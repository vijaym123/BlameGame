Dear Friend, 

This morning, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's budget came up for a
vote in the House of Representatives. When I had the chance to speak
out against Ryan's budget
  on the House
floor, I made my stance clear: this budget sets the wrong goals for our
country.

I voted against this budget because I do not believe it was grounded in
a rigorous economic analysis. If we want to make the right choices for
our country, we have an obligation not just to reduce the national
debt, but also to strengthen smart investments that help American
workers and make our businesses more competitive. We can't thrive in a
technologically advanced global economy without adequately supporting
education, science and research, and infrastructure.

Please listen to my speech on the Ryan budget
 , and let me
know what you think. I value your input as I continue my work to
support a budget that strengthens opportunities for American workers
and invests in a more competitive economy.

Sincerely,

John
