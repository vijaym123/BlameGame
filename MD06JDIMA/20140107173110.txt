January 7, 2014

Dear Friend,

I write to you today to update you on some important services we are
providing to constituents in Maryland's 6th Congressional District. I
am proud to represent our district here in Congress, and, as 2014
begins, I am working with my offices to help our constituents in any
way possible. From D.C. to Montgomery County to Garrett County, my
staff stands ready to assist constituents with cases at a federal
agency, planning a visit to our nation's capital, applying to a
national service academy and much more.

Help with a Federal Agency 
If you are having trouble communicating with a federal agency
  or you feel that you are
being treated unfairly, my team in Maryland may be able to help resolve
your problem or get you the information you need. My offices have
experience working with constituents who have cases with the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Social Security Administration and the
Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services among other federal
agencies. I understand how important it is that federal agencies
respond in a timely manner to your concerns, and what a difference help
from a congressional office can make, which is why my staff is
committed to helping constituents find a fair resolution to their
cases. 

Applying to a U.S. Service Academy 
My offices also assist young men and women interested in applying to
the U.S. Service Academies, including the Military Academy, the Naval
Academy, the Air Force Academy and the Merchant Marine Academy. These
schools, which provide undergraduate education and training with full
four-year scholarships, prepare some of the brightest students in the
nation for service in our Armed Forces.

As a member of the House of Representatives, I have the honor of
nominating a limited number of young men and women to the academies for
enrollment. Last month, I recommended students from across the district
for admission to all four academies as members of the Class of 2018. My
offices are now accepting applications for service academy nominations
for the Class of 2019.

Requesting a Tour 
Families and individuals from our district can also request help
planning a visit to our nation's capital
 . Our staff in Washington, D.C.,
not only provides tours of the Capitol Building for constituents, but
also requests tours of other federal buildings and agencies. Through
our office, interested parties can work to plan a visit to the White
House, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the Kennedy Center and other
historic sites.

Office Hours 
If you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss issues or work
together on a case with my staff, we maintain offices or office-hours
in every county in our district. In Montgomery County, my office is
located at 9801 Washingtonian Boulevard, Suite 330, Gaithersburg, MD
20878. In Washington County, my office can be found at 6 West
Washington Street, Suite 210, Hagerstown, MD 21740. Both locations are
open during regular business hours to help resolve any issues you may
have.

In Frederick, Allegany, and Garrett Counties, my staff keeps office
hours at local libraries and schools to help constituents with whatever
challenges they're facing. Frederick office hours take place on the 2nd
and 4th Thursday of each month, from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM at the C. Burr
Artz Public Library (110 East Patrick Street, Frederick, MD 21701). In
Allegany County, my staff holds office hours from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM
on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Wednesday of each month at the Allegany County
Library (31 Washington Street, Cumberland, MD 21502). In Garrett
County, our office hours are held on the 3rd Friday of each month from
10:00 AM to 4:30 PM at the CARC Aquatics Building at Garrett College
(687 Mosser Road, McHenry, MD 21541).

As the New Year begins, I will continue my work in the District to
ensure that families and individuals in Maryland receive the help they
need, when they need it. Please take a moment to let me know what
constituent services you would be interested in hearing about in the
future
 .

If you would like help with a federal claim or have insights into how
we can best support our constituents, please contact my office
 . We have caseworkers ready to assist you.

Sincerely,

John
