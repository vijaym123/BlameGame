Dear Friend, 

Tonight's State of the Union address marked a critical milestone in our
work to pass bipartisan legislation supporting economic growth and
opportunity in the United States. The President tonight spoke out for
infrastructure development and increasing the minimum wage. With
bipartisan legislation already before Congress, the President's speech
adds one more voice to our call for collaborative action on our nation's
top priorities.

As President Obama recognized tonight, the United States' aging
infrastructure has acted as a barrier to our economic growth in an
increasingly competitive global economy. Today, forty-two percent of
America's major highways remain congested, fourteen percent of our
nation's public bridges are functionally obsolete, and our energy grid
needs nearly 17,000 miles of electric lines. As a former CEO, I
understand the pressure companies face to build and hire in areas with
up-to-date railways, reliable power grids and high-speed Internet,
which is why I've prioritized addressing our nation's infrastructure
needs.

President Obama's State of the Union endorsement of infrastructure
development builds on the momentum I've worked to create with the
introduction of The Partnership to Build America Act
  (H.R.
2084), a bill that would invest $750 billion in infrastructure upgrades
nationwide at no cost to the taxpayer. Currently, the bill has 25
Democratic and 26 Republican cosponsors in the House. Last month, a
companion bill was introduced in the upper chamber by a bipartisan team
of eleven Senators. President Obama's words tonight add greater weight
to our own call for infrastructure renewal and put the focus back on an
area where we can come together, supporting job creation and economic
competitiveness through commonsense investments.

I was excited to see the President use his State of the Union address
to advocate for another issue important to me, increasing the federal
minimum wage for our low-income workers. Our nation's wage laws have
historically made the United States a land of opportunity, a country
with a strong middle class, and a place where parents had a chance to
leave a better life for their children. For many Americans, especially
after the last recession, a middle class life has become harder to
attain. Many minimum wage employees who work 40 hours a week continue
to earn an income below the federal poverty line. I applaud the
President for using the State of the Union to shine a spotlight on this
issue.

Tonight, I was most excited to hear the President endorse our
bipartisan priorities. From infrastructure development to increasing
the minimum wage, I have worked with Republicans and Democrats to
highlight these issues in Congress, and the President's speech moved
our work forward. As the 113th Congress continues, I will be sure to
keep you up-to-date with our progress.

Sincerely,

John
