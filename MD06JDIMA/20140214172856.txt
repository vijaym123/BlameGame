Dear Friend,

This Valentine's Day, as we spend time with our friends and loved ones,
it's important to remember those service members and veterans who
cannot make it home for the holiday. Our men and women serving overseas
have made enormous sacrifices, not the least of which is spending time
away from their family. This year, I remembered our service members by
coordinating the second annual Hearts for Heroes to thank our veterans.

This year's Hearts for Heroes was hosted at Summit Hall Elementary
School in Gaithersburg, where I made Valentine's Day cards with Ms.
Carol Moretz's 4th grade class, to be delivered to veterans at Walter
Reed Hospital. As a Member of Congress, I strongly believe that our
veterans deserve recognition for their service, and my visit to Summit
Hall was a great chance for me to talk with our youngest generation
about the sacrifices veterans have made for our nation. I was moved by
some of the heartfelt messages students chose to send our veterans, and
was happy to have the opportunity to thank those at Walter Reed for
their service. 

Please take a moment to let me know how you would thank our service
members and veterans for their work
 . 

During my first term in Congress, I've worked hard to ensure that our
veterans receive the care they need and the benefits they've earned.
Last week, the House passed the G.I. Bill Tuition Fairness Act
  to allow our veterans to
receive in-state tuition rates at the public school of their choice. I
supported the bill when it came up for a vote, and was excited to see
the House take action to strengthen educational programs for our
nation's veterans. 

In the past year, I've also introduced legislation to give our service
members a stronger voice
  at the Department of Veterans
Affairs and to increase funding for Fisher Houses
 , which provide free lodging near
hospitals for military and veteran families. 

Today, Maryland is home to more than 400,000 veterans and service
members. Their work to make our nation safe must never be forgotten. As
I continue to speak out for our veterans in the 113th Congress, I
welcome your feedback
 .

Sincerely, 

John
