Your analogy of homophobia to   racism   is well chosen and fills in some points I left out above.  But still unexplained to me is the depth of the hatred and hostility or resentment that some hold against minority groups.   I've never truly understood the 'out of proportion' emotion which is felt by some racists or homophobes.   In other words, it appears to be something more than simply considering something or someone 'weird'  and letting them be.  The response in some appears to be more one of intense hatred or fear, sometimes resulting in violence against the 'weird'.   But I still think you make a good point in stressing the importance of   environment  .    Not because environments of any size where there are no homosexuals (they are everywhere) but because our environment is a powerful factor in learning racism or homophobia.   You imply that thought and behavior is learned, with which I agree and find hopeful because this means racism and homophobia can also be unlearned, usually by positive interactions with known members of a minority group.   >>A homosexual does not find heterosexuals as weird because the homosexual has grown up in an environment wherein heterosexuality is "normal", the opposite is not true.<<As above, this depends on definition of 'normal' (open social acceptability in the current culture in which a person lives or grew up vs. biologically normal variant existing world wide as long as there have been humans).
