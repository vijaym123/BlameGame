It's sad when comments like this come to light. These types of comments show ignorance about how western   society   came to be and who Jesus is. Western society was built upon the Judeo-Christian tradition. A simple look at the 10 Commandments should be a clear indication the basis of our own laws. There are some Greek and Roman philosophies thrown in, but the foundation of our system of justice is the 10 commandments. Our founding documents mention God and Creator, and many of the state constitutions mention God directly. A   theocracy   is a government run by   religious   leaders, usually of one denomination -- that's what the 1st Amendment prohibited. However, our country was founded by religious men who trusted in God and the Bible to guide their daily lives. And regarding the   tolerance   of Jesus, you obviously have no clue. Yes, Jesus Christ represents love in its purest form, in that He sacrificed Himself for mankind to pay for   sin  . But regarding marriage, God created Adam and Eve, therefore defining the institution of marriage as between a man and a woman. Same-sex "marriage" pokes God in the eye and warps His definition of marriage. Do you really think Jesus Christ will tolerate people thumbing their noses at God's institution?
