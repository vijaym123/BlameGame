Definition of bigot from Merriam-Webster:  "a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices ; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance" One who wants to exclude individuals of a certain "group" from marriage is intolerant, and bigoted. So if the shoe fits...And if it is hateful to disagree with bigots, then I am a hateful person and am reveling in it.I guess attacking a bigot's moral integrity is equal to the hurt that a homosexual person's feels when they are denied the opportunity to marry the partner of their choice because someone who has nothing to do with them doesn't like the idea.We should all be more careful in assuring that bigot's feelings aren't hurt. Sorry.
