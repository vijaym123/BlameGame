 Civil Unions would provide all the "rights" that could be somewhat justified by valid argument. Of course it would be "separate and unequal" to marriage, because IT IS ... by natural law. Of course the cultural importance of marriage would cause it to be insufficient to homosexual activists, but IF there were gay marriage, then marriage would LOOSE all its cultural importance. A union between homosexuals can NEVER BE more than a Civil Union.
