However, those who choose to go with their desires and follow the gay path with all it's goods also have to accept it's bads. Simple question: Did you ever choose to follow the heterosexual path? Furthermore, what are the "goods" associated with the gay path, compared to the heterosexual one? From what I can see it's a much harder path to go down. I can't really fathom why someone might CHOOSE to go that way, unless of course they were BORN gay, in which case you're discriminating against a condition people have no control over.
