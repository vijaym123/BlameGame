People are BORN gay,cause if we had a choice to be "gay" or not,I'm pretty sure i'd remember.So yes,people cannot decide,cause I know a great deal of people who are gay that don't wish to be.If that's the case,how did they pick?And it has nothing to do with race,religion,income,ANYTHING!You just don't hear about the "upper crust" as much.
