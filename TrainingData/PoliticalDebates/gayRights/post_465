It is not proven by any means that sexual orientation is mutable.  Just because some people are bisexual does not prove that any and every person could change his/her innate sexual orientation.  Clearly, the physical capability exists for most people to interact sexually with a person of either gender, but that does not equate to a basic orientation of bisexuality.  Most people are FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to the opposite gender than to their own gender.  They cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of their own gender.  In the same way, a smaller segment of the population is FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to people of the same gender, and  cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of the opposite gender.
