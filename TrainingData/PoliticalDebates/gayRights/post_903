I live in a place I'd rather not acknowledge exists.  Many children here only have one parent to care for them.  It would be a GIFT for these children to have a second adult in their life guiding and supporting them.  Gay marriage is not going to tear apart the family structure (and if it does it wasn't a good structure to begin with).  I agree that marriage has its purpose to bring children into this world but there are plenty of heterosexual marriages that result in two people who have no desire to reproduce.  Is that a marriage in the eyes of organized religion?In closing I don't agree that the best family structure is two parents of opposite genders.  I believe the best family structure is two parents who care for their children.
