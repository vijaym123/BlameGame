Ha!  You have figured out my cheesy 70's movie nickname.  What a great post and I agree with you 110% but I am going to add a couple of things.  Hypothetically speaking, what if homosexuality IS evil? So what? I don't believe that myself but if you do, how does it really affect you? (not you Sid)My personal opinion is that so many things like this, both religious in nature and not, is really fueled by fear of the unknown and a lack of confidence.For example, if you are strong in your Christian faith, what do you have to lose by gaining a better understating of Islam or Buddhism?  I have traveled extensively all over the world and with each journey, I gain a greater understanding of the world and it's people but traveling abroad only enhances my love for my country.  It doesn't make me want to move there.I believe there is fear behind homophobia for most people. If you are secure in who you are, what does it matter? Fear may be the most crippling disease in the world: fear of homosexuals, fear of other cultures, fear of other races, fear of other religions and most of all, fear of change.  Fear robs people of the most wonderful parts of the human experience.
