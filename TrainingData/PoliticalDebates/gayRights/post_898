It is my honor and delight to officiate for same sex marriages in Connecticut I even advised all my 100 or so civil union couples that I would upgrade them to marriage for NO charge (if they came to Norwalk or Darien). CT is proud to lead the way to provide this basic right to ALL couples. CT is the ONLY state where a same sex couple can get married in one day- no residency requirement, no blood test, no witnesses. Just the $30 license fee and $10 for a certified copy plus the fee for the officiant (which varies by officiant and by location).  I take care of everything for as little as $200.I have couples who have flown in from CA, FL, TX, IN, OH, IL, Mexico and who have driven in or taken the train from NYC, NJ, PA, RI, VA Most couples have been together for YEARS...including one couple from Florida who have been together for 45 years! Let people love each other and take care of each other. Isn't that what marriage is about? Mary Pugh, CT Justice of the Peace, Norwalk, CT  www.ct-jp.com
