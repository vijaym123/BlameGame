The definition of marriage is a union and committment between a MAN and a WOMAN.  PERIOD. You don't change definitions because a small vocal minority wants it. I certainly understand same sex people being in love and wanting to spend their remaining days together.  So for insurance and other reasons I would be inclined to agree with some type of civil unions.  But marriage.....NO
