How can you say that   kids   who grow up in a home with 2 parents that are in a loving and committed relationship are at a disadvantage?  The argument about kids needing to have a male parent to discuss some things with and a female parent to discuss other things with is off the wall.  What about parents of single parents, either by divorce or death?  Does   society   just write those kids off like the kids of same-sex parents?  That’s not a very fair shake at life.  The issue in any child-rearing   environment   is love, educational, support and consistency.  If you offer that to your kids, they will end up just fine.
