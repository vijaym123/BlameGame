I'm an atheist, so the discussion of whether homosexuality is a sin does not even have a point as far as I'm concerned.  However, completely aside from opinion, the "logic" used in this argument is totally absurd.  According to the argument, god first created Adam.  Then he went through all the animals on earth, and none of them were a good mate.  So god created Eve, therefore homosexuality is wrong. QED.  There's only one problem with that.  There were no other men on earth throughout all this.  Therefore god never, ever said "oh, well, you don't fit with this other dude, either."  There was only one man on the planet, gay was not even an option for god to dismiss. If you want to believe in god, fine with me.  If you want to use religion to hate others, that's not fine with me, but I respect your right to think whatever you please.  But if you're going to have opinions and make arguments, please think about whether they make sense now that you're not 17.  Hopefully this does not sound rude, but it upsets me when people just parrot things they're taught without thinking critically, and religion is a big source of that.  It hurts society, like "just following orders."
