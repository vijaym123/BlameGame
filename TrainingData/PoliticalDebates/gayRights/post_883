First: the right to choose one's own partner is a fundamental right. You'd never give up your right to choose your partner, why should anyone else?Second: Same-sex relationships are 100% legal as long as there is consent. A minor is not an adult and therefor cannot give consent. Equating grown men and women to children is just insulting.Third: Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black. Please explain how exactly two grown men or women cannot give consent legally like a 13 year old? Also, please explain how refusing the right to marry based on physical gender is any different than refusing the right to marry based on skin color.
