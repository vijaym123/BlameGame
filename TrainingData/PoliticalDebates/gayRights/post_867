Are you suggesting that we should freeze things the way they are now?  No more rights for anyone?  We've finally got it right, and if we go any farther we'll open 'Pandora's Box'?  Are you sure we haven't gone just a little too far?  Maybe we should take away a women's right to vote...  Or maybe we should take away the right for persons of different races to marry... Or maybe we should segregate the schools again...  We should have a negro league for all sports...  We should outlaw liquor again...  We shouldn't allow women to work...  We should decide on just one religion and throw all the non-christians out of our perfect country.God only knows the dangers of allowing two consenting adults to pledge themselves to one another.  It would be just like a man raping a child.  Or maybe it would be more like a man raping a cat.  And also, 12 and 13 year olds would be considered adults if we allow same sex couples to marry.Now, quite frankly, I think your opinion and your logic is gross and unacceptable.  But that's your business.  And I can choose to think you're wrong without wanting to force you to think just like me.  And you can think same sex marriage is wrong.  But how will it affect you on a daily basis if same sex couples marry?
