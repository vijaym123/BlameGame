The United States takes pride in being considered the "melting pot" where all are accepted for who they are and what they believe in, yet there is such a heated debate over whether same sex couples should be allowed to get married.  What happened to the melting pot idea, the idea that we are all equal?  Can society really call itself tolerant if it can deny such a right to citizens whose sexual preference may be different from the majority?  It is a fallacy to assume that same sex marriage will somehow delude the general population into thinking that marriage is pointless and having children without getting married.  The fact is that nothing would change between a married man and woman were same sex couples allowed to marry.  Their bond would remain exactly the same.  It is sheerly biased to believe that one's own sexual preference is "right".  For society to progress, everyone regardless of skin color, religious views, or sexual preferences must be accepted.  Such things do not, in any way, change the essence of a person.
