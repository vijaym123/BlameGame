While the teachings of the Church are clear that homosexuality is unnatural, to make blanket statements that “the followers of the Catholic Church believe that homosexuality is wrong” is not only false, but, as a Catholic, one that I take personal offense to.  The Church is one of the largest religious denominations in the world, among Christians and among all faiths, encompassing over one billion people.  There are many faucets of Catholicism unique to the faith, but, even though public deviation is not well tolerated, dissent does occur, even in the church hierarchy.  As for the faith of the laypeople, it is often a personal matter and faith does not necessary lay contingent on complete adherence to dogma, but rather the belief of at least the core principles of Catholicism.I believe that is the will of God that we should respect other peoples’ religious beliefs, and that to join Church and State at any level would be to force, in this case, the Catholic faith upon all people of the United States.  I think it is un-Christian and un-Catholic to do such a thing, and so I invite you to give a logical, not theological, argument against gay marriage.
