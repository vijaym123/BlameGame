Oh, you're right!  Here, let me parse up the articles for you.Kyle Pruett, Fatherneed (Broadway Books, 2001) 204.Elizabeth Marquardt, The Moral and Spiritual Lives of Children of Divorce. Forthcoming.Ellis, Bruce J., et al., "Does Father Absence Place Daughters at Special Risk for Early Sexual Activity and Teenage Pregnancy?" Child Development, 74:801-821.David Popenoe, Life Without Father (Boston: Harvard University Press, 1999).Eleanor MacCoby, The Two Sexes: Growing Up Apart, Coming Together (Boston: Harvard, 1998).Steven Rhoads, Taking Sex Differences Seriously (Encounter Books, 2004).Hey, would you look at that?!  Most of the articles are talking about the -absence- of a parent!  Maybe it's -divorces- that cause psychological problems, not lacking a parent of one gender or the other.
