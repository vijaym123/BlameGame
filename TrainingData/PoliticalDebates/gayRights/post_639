Gay gene? No one's ever said there's a "gay gene".  What is that anyway? A gene that sleeps with guys name terry?   Just kidding.  There's EVIDENCE... and a lot of it... that points to gayness being an in-born trait.  So how exactly do these people "learn" to be gay?  You and I aren't gay.  How did we escape the evil clutches of the gay agenda that's hell-bent (pun entirely intended) on "teaching" kids to be gay? Before the "gay agneda" occurred there have been gay people... how did they "learn" to be gay? I know people who've parents have said they knew their kid was gay from childhood... their parents didn't treat them any different than they did the "straight" siblings.  How did that child "learn" to be gay?And since you ingore the fact that homosexuality exists in animals (non-human animals) would you care to explain how you think that gayness is a learned behavior? And since you've read several of my posts, you would know that I don't base my opinions on idiotic religious views, but on those of reason and observation. But thanks for that.  All that statement says is that you can read.
