Hmmmm, I did go read the article you put in your posting and still left going "huh?" Really I could see no real link that you were attempting to establish regarding gay people. Actually, this would give some credence to the fact that DESPITE the "norms" influence gay people remain gay. We may hide a little more, due to the uncertainty of those that are different from us. Not shame mind you, but uncertainty as many have been on the receiving end of violence, predjudice and judgements. Safety and survival a human instinct we all have.I was born to straight parents, Christians, 7 kids and in SOUTH DAKOTA, definetly not my surroundings that influenced my sexuality. Although I guess on some level it was correct. I did try to hide, fake it and be "normal" and as a result suffered and made myself a victim. No more.
