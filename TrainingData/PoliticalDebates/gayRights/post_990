God created marraige?There are many people that do not believe in God but still get married.  There are many others who believe in other gods that you do not believe in.  Do they not have equal rights?The bottom line for me is this:  You have equal rights under the constitution or you don't.Keep marriage sacred in your own church and let the government treat everyone equal. Won't that work?Michelle
