3000+ years of human wisdom extends to every major civilization on Earth.  Western Civilization was mentioned obviously because of its Christian roots for the last 2000 years, but that does not mean marriage between same-sex couples was the norm in any civilization on Earth through history.Suddenly, in the 21st century, we have a generation of people who believe that they are smarter than every one of those generations before.  None of those generations were right, and this new generation is FAR smarter and knows better than   same-sex marriage   is good for   society  .  That arrogance is appalling, as great as we would feel about seeing same-sex couples feel validated.
