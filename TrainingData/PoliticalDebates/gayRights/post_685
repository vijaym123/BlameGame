The entire concept of sin is ludicrous.  The funniest thing about people that think this way is that they are the pure definition of hypocrite. They take the Bible verbatim, yet they choose what to take verbatim (another discussion if this is a verbatim sin all together) when it benefits but ignore when it doesn't.  For example, the concept of casting the first stone, or the concept that only God can decide right and wrong, or the belief that Jesus supposedly hung out with the dregs of   society   because they had the first chance at heaven.  Those who persecute are the most likely candidates for Hell.  While I don't believe in any of this malarkey, the concept that something which is not one's choice is a sin is hilarious.  Leave homosexuals alone, they are generally nicer and more generous people and closer to the false image we portray of Jesus than any of the finger pointing focus on the family, Southern Baptist morons in this country.
