“I do not mean to be unkind, but   homosexuality   is not a survival characteristic, it's an evolutionary dead end.”Actually there is evidence to the contrary.  Male penguins raising a chick together are a good example of how homosexual parings can promote the survival of the species.   This lends credence to the idea that homosexuals help with population survival buy providing additional caretakers for the young while not contributing young of their own.“You can argue that other alternatives to the traditional family unit are equally contra survival, perhaps even with some small merit, but that doesn't   change   the fact that the traditional family unit provides the best possible   benefits   to   children  .”That argument has been made before… and as before I have to ask what evidence you base that assumption on?Furthermore children adopted by homosexuals are already without a ‘traditional family unit’, and so all that really needs to be shown is that being raised by a homosexual couple is better then being left in foster care.“The big difference between a pet kitten and a human child is with the kitten, you are not responsible for teaching it everything it will need to know to survive for the 50 plus years it will live after leaving your care.”So couples need to be careful when considering having children?  No part of this entire rant applies exclusively to homosexuals (which is to say it is a statement that could be made to any couple regardless of the couples gender).“The moment you say you should be allowed to impose your will on another, you will fnd me in adament opposition to your position.”How is this imposing anyone’s will on you?“Do what you like as long as you do me no harm in the process, and leave children alone.”So children should not be placed in potentially loving homes?
