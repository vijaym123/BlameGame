yeah and the reagae.. it's in your blood meaning it's in the root social foundations of your upbringing. primarily in the realm of scoial brain patterns developed from your upbringing and no   science   has indicated otherwise. everyone one understand that my attraction to women in buisness skirts is primarily related to things i saw, felt, and became. The anti-  church   brigade can't seem to notice facts or deal with reality or truth. They have an agenda, based on hate and prejudice. They hate truth. It shows. It's not remarkable that these unscientific people are also experts on   theocratic   and ecllesiatic matters. There is no end to the   obscenity   of these people.  They only hate jesus. They can not condemn barnabus but wish jesus to die full of pain and humiliation. That's the nature of these people. Those who hate truth.
