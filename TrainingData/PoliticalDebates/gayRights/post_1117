you suggest that opposing gay marriage on the basis of its "unnatural-ness" is a completely logical stance.  i find that...strange.the word itself, "unnatural" is one of those bogeyman words that in itself means nothing, while saying much of the speaker.  by some standards, it is "unnatural" to conduct discussions with people one has never met, nor indeed am ever likely to meet.  while it certainly recalls to mind epistolary debates such as the lively exchange within the screwtape letters, the immediacy we are offered now is certainly unnatural.pointing out that you consider a thing to be "unnatural" is not a valid basis for public policy and indeed simply isn't logical.but perhaps more importantly, advancing the "unnaturalness" argument reveals the true heart of your objection: that you simply dislike homosexuals.  it has little to do with the subject of marriage per se, and advancing the unnaturalness argument spells that out in blazing, 40' tall letters for all to see.
