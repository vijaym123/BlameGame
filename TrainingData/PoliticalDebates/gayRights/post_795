then Christians believe it is sin unless it is inconvenient for them to do so. Why focus on homosexuality as a sin when there are scores of laws laid down in Leviticus and elsewhere in the Bible that hardly anyone pays attention to anymore? You're right to make this distinction between cultic and committed relationships, but I think there's a bigger point about defining sin. Why would an openly homosexual person be denied the Eucharist whereas there would be no problem with, for example, someone wearing two different kinds of fabric at once? It's a silly and arbitrary distinction as far as the Bible is concerned.
