History is important and I will agree to that.  However history cannot determine what the Word of God means.  You are correct,  without context, the Word od God is meaningless, which is why we need to keep it in its context and allow the Bible to be its own interpriter.  History cannot be the interpriter of God's word any more than God's word can be the intrepriter of history.   They are separate and distinct and both, while valuable, have nothing to do with one another, at least secular history.  God's word is inspired; history is not.    If we use history as a leverage, then the evil things that happened in human history become important and relevant when we try to interprite the word of God.  If we allow the Word of God to be its own interpreter, then we are on solid ground.
