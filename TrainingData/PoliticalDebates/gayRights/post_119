Marriage is not an "institution" that gay marriage can violate. Marriage should not be in the institution in the first place, nor should religion. They shouldn't be in politics either. Religion bases their rules on faith, not on morality. Politics should create laws based on common sense, morality, and trends, not on religious views and traditions that become "institutionalized" by the state over time.
