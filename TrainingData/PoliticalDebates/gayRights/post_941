...I just don't want them in my face.  I am capable of doing for myself, thank you very much.  One of the things that   spanking   father taught me was independence.  When I finished college, I was NOT invited home to lounge around while I looked for suitable employment.  I was expected to take whatever was available and make do while I found a better paying, more suitable job in my career field.  But that was then; and children didn't run families - parents did.Meanwhile, back at the issue: I agree with you about the abuse of children - it's rampant.  Having worked with CASA, I am appalled at the flagrant abuse and neglect this generation of drug-using, irresponsible, sleep-around, me-me-me, gimme-another-tattoo-instead-of-paying-my-child-support jerks is perpetrating on their children.  Teenagers having babies without a partner to help raise the child, then discovering that babies are LOTS of trouble.  LOTS of work.  LOTS of responsibility.I don't blame CPS in the least - I blame the media, for spreading the idea that anyone can have a baby - who needs to be married?  If "Murphy Brown" can do it, so can I.  And Follywood wondered why Middle America objected so much back when ole Murphy got pregnant.  The little black box which came into our homes took over our lives and our families back when I was a child, and has created a nation of brainwashed people. When the sound of that crying, sick baby needing to be fed and bathed and changed rises above the roar of Jerry Springer, that teenage mother is tempted - very strongly - to hold a pillow over its mouth just so she can hear about the abusive parents on TV.
