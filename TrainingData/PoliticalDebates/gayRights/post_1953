I am a Christian and I can't stand those 'Christians' who make laws reflecting our Bible and then try to say they aren't forcing their beliefs on others.Let's see how they react if a Muslim or Hindu becomes president. Our pledge of allegiance changes from 'Under God' to 'Under Gods' or 'Under the Sky'. Our ten commandments (which most Christians including myself don't really adhere to that well) are dashed against rocks and in their place are statues of Vishnu and Krishna. Instead of praying before congressional meetings we all get together and meditate on the higher sense of self.Take your religion out of my government. Also, if gays can't marry then they shouldn't pay as much in taxes. Our taxes go to pay for TONS of services homosexuals can't benefit from. Marriage bureaus and Adoption Services are two obvious examples.And don't even get me started on gays in the military when they have to register for the draft.
