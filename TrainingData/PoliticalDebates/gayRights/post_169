Disclaimer: I'm not anti gay. I voted "NO" on prop 8 and protested side by side with the gay community outside the Mormon temple in Westwood.I am a parent. I have two daughters and two sons. Being in a heterosexual marriage I can see the advantages of having parents from different sexes. There are times that I can not connect to one of my children because I see things from a man's point of view. At those times my wife is the one who has a totally different perspective and manages to understand something that I never could. This works the other way around too. The simple fact is that men and women are different and a child growing up needs both points of views to be able to make good balanced decisions.I'm sure children with same sex parents will grow up well enough to become very good citizens but my beliefe is that they are at a disadvantage and have to learn things the hard way.
