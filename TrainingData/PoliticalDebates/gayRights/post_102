 Reproduction is a key function of marriage, not only reproducing children, but reproducing parents and families. Throughout history, regardless of religion, ALL societies from primitive to developed have established some form of marriage to reproduce new generations of people. The fabric of society is woven by marriages producing new families with new children, which are nurtured, educated, and developed by a mother and a father into productive members of that society, who then reproduce, in kind, the next generation, each gender becoming a respective mother or father. To the degree that a society or civilization can REPRODUCE good healthy families, it will prosper. This depends on reproducing, not only children, but reproducing good fathers and good mothers by developing role model fathers and role model mothers. 
 Homosexual marriages could only reproduce dysfunction.
