I'll tell you what, the best thing that my parents ever did for me was get divorced, yes it was rough on my single mom and hard for me to comprehend, but they would have eventually killed each (literally) had they stayed together. Something that cracks me up is a comment about   kids   with divorced parents never wishing that their parents had same sex partners...watching my dad be emotionally abusive to all his girlfriends and my mom be emotionally abused by all her boyfriends, in hindsight I bet had my parents had same sex relationships things would have gone a lot smoother. I think that might even be true of them today, watching them in their current relationships. I don't care where   babies   come from; what's most important is that they are loved when they get here. Whether you're gay, straight, bi-curious or a unicorn, if you are comfortable with who you are and you can pass that on to your kid, the lesson is not "be like me" the lesson is "be yourself". If two people who love each other are willing to invest positive time and   energy   into their   children  , it doesn't matter whether one is a man and the other a woman, a child just needs to be loved, respected and allowed to have a chance at a happy childhood. There are so many reasons why this argument is ridiculous...I could go on and on but I don't want to hog all the space.My Questions for You: *Do gay people really wish gay-dom on their children, knowing the adversity they may face in their future?*Isn't being molested as a young person more likely to effect your sexuality (in any regard) in your future more so than having two loving parents who happen to be of the same sex?* Do you think that adopted children are thinking "my parents are pushing their gay agenda down my throat and that is too heavy a burden for [me] to carry and it is in my opinion criminal" (according to Hope7) or do you think they are thinking "hey i have two parents who love me, awesome".....?*Does the phrase "it takes a village to raise a child" actually mean a bunch of same sex couples or does it really just mean a positive support system, made up of people who have the child's best interest in mind?
