Well not bringing religion into the argument lets think logically shall we. Consider this, imagine every couple in the world at any generation in time decided to be homosexual, what would happen? There would be no next generation because homosexuals cant reproduce and if they can it would be unnatural granted i am Christian but i also believe in common logic but we cant very well be fruitful and multiply if we were all in a same sex marriage.
