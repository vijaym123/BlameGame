Pat, I agree with everything you say here, except the point that all gay parents have step-families by default.  Unless we consider that a heterosexual couple who creates their family by use of donor sperm is creating "step-children," then we cannot say this about lesbian couples who do the same, or gay men who conceive their children by way of a surrogate.  We don't consider straight couples who use a surrogate mom to be step-parents.  In fact, we don't even consider straight couples who adopt to be step-parents.  So, no, gay couples are not step-families by default.  There are all kinds of gay-parented families, just as there are all kinds of straight-parented families.  Really, there are just all kinds of families. :)Not, again, that I disagree with anything in the remainder of your post.  You are absolutely right that FOF tries to turn this into a comparison of families parenting biological children vs. families parenting children as a result of divorce or abandonment, and that is a ridiculous comparison to make as "proof" that gays are "inadequate" or "substandard" parents.
