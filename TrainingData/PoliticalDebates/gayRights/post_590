I agree with SidAirfoil, that the bible is filled with immoral acts that are no longer considered immoral. They were made by man and they have been changed by man. But the passages of the Bible that deserve the most question include Genesis itself, within the chapter on Sodom and Gomorrah. When two male angels come to Lot's house the night before God is to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot protects them from the (homosexual male) crowd by what moral act? By offering up his two virgin daughters so that the crowd will leave his honored guests alone. And if that were not enough morality with which we would ALL DISAGREE, and see as reprehensible child abandonment or worse...the chapter ends with both of Lot's daughters getting him drunk so they can have incestuous sex with him.So our source of morality has homosexuality as sinful, but child endangerment as virtuous, and incest as perfectly okay.The Bible is a very weak source of morality. What else do you have to show that homosexuality is "immoral?" What harm is it to "moral"people, if otherwise moral homosexuals do their own thing in private?
