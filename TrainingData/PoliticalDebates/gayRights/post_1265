Ah, the slavery strawman ... what a waste of an argument. First of all, slavery has nothing to do with this issue. Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not innate and not a civil right. There is an overwhelming amount of research and studies that prove   homosexuality   is not inborn. There are few studies that may indicate otherwise, but one has to look hard and with a strong bias to find such indications. People cannot change the color of their skin; homosexuals can change their behavior. My father is the perfect example. He said he was never truly happy in that lifestyle, not because of the negative attitudes toward homosexuality, but because homosexuality was his attempt to satisfy himself sexually. He came to realize the lifestyle is self-destructive and left it. His only regret was that he didn't leave that lifestyle sooner.
