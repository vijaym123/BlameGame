There is nothing in the Constitution that protects or establishes "Gay Marriage.  For further proof of this, was it   legal   at the time for two men or two women to marry?  No!I believe that Marriage should remain defined between a man and a woman, like it has for thousands of years.  For those to enjoy the fruits of their Constitutional right, then legalize Civil Unions with the benefits of being a couple, excluding any rights to have   children   unless they were obtained by natural methods.Marriage defines the role two people take, Civil Unions also define the role two same genders make.
