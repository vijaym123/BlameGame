Allowing   same-sex marriage   does not respect the   freedom of religion  . In European countries that have legalized same-sex marriages, pastors are being arrested and jailed for refusing to marry same-sex marriages. Already in this country, a Christian photographer was fined for not accepting a job photographing a same-sex "marriage" ceremony. I would be long before I, as a pastor, must face a tribunal for my refusal to officiate a same-sex cerermony.
