Only people who believe in the Christian "God" are moral, is what you're saying....The Catholic church recognizes that homosexuality is not a sin... it is only a sin to act out the homosexuality...ness.  If you say you believe in "God", and then call what "God" made imperfect, don't you think that's defeating the purpose?  Who the crap are you to know better than "God" how a person is supposed to be made?  If that person was made by "God" then it was "God" who created that sinful cocktail mix of chemicals that dictates to that person whom he or she will be sexually attracted to.  That would make the act of "God" a sinful act...  which, if you believe in "God"... you know can't happen.So, by you saying that homosexuality is a sin, you're completely destroying the very "God" you claim to believe in.  Which doesn't sound very reasonable to me.  Especially since you're the one who believes in him.Last, but not least,  that wasn't a case of "begging the question".
