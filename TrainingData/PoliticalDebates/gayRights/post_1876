Yes, I understand what you're saying and I agree that ideally that would be the best thing to do. But I'm saying it's not practical to do that because people would go apeshit if we replaced the word "marriage" with "civil union" everywhere. They'd say we were "undermining the Christian foundations of our nation." They'd say we were "demeaning a fundamental pillar of society." They'd say it was "political correctness run amok." It would never get done. Legalizing gay marriage is the easier way to achieve equality.
