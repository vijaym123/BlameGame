"Homosexuality" is necessarily political in that it is behavior between oneself and at least one other human being and "politics" is the science of - at least - human-to-human relationships. Sex with at least one other partner is ALWAYS political. "Politics" need not necessarily mean the politics of large groups of humans. It only requires the relationship between two and not necessarily two "humans". Indeed, one's relationship with one's pet is political as far as the basic definition of "politics" is concerned, as is the relationship between any two lifeforms - same species or not. That is to say, there is human-to-dog politics, human-to-horse politics, ant-to-anteater politics, butterfly-to-flower politics and on and on. "Politics" equals "relationships" - it does not imply with whom or how many.Sex involving only oneself, because it does not involve relationship with at least one other human being - or being - is not political.
