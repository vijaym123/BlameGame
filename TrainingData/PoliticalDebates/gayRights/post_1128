"From a scientific view, it is extreemly improbable that life is here by any other means except a designer. "There is tons of evidence to show that we evolved. We are not definitely not designed. Read up a little on Biology and the Theory of Evolution before you go spouting what (presumably) someone told you as fact when you don't know what you're talking about."The last time I looked, I'm a human. I'm not a giraffe, I'm not an insect, etc... I'm a human. "Well guess what! Whether you want to admit it or not, some humans are homosexual just like some   animals   are. So it would seem it is a natural occurrence in all LIFE. "there is no basis to belive that the designer behind life intends for this to be normative"First of all from reading your comment it is apparently you have very little schooling as you can't spell. Secondly you use the word "normative". Homosexuality is not a majority in nature at all... that doesn't mean it's occurrence isn't normal. Just like a previous commenter said... just because red haired people aren't the majority doesn't mean they aren't normal.AND we come to the root of your false reasoning:"you will need to show that the designer has intended this as normal behavior in the animal kingdom as a whole."No wonder you don't know anything about   science  . You look to your invisible friend as a starting point for a line of reasoning. I'm sorry, but to demonstrate whether something is a fact we do not need to pick up a   bible   and try to fathom what some mythical being thinks about it! We do just fine without first presuming a   god   exists and working from what we can demonstrate in the real world.
