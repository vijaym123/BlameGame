The amendments to the Constitution and, indeed, the record of the debate which took place before and during its writing attest to the trend of using the spirit and wording to remove prejudicial limits on liberties rather than to institute them. Certainly, that history is a bit of a mixed bag in that regard, however, in the end, U.S. culture has seen fit to reverse past mistakes and restore the greatest degree of liberty to the greatest number.If past generations have seen fit to do what was ultimately the right thing, we earn our inheritance of their good thinking by continuing to do that same. We must use the Constitution and every constitution to enhance liberty rather than destroy it. Our children will either have to suffer our mistakes ... or correct our stupidity.
