put simply, yes. in this world, but especially in America we have become more accepting of race and views. but there needs to be a point that we as a human race evolve. this needs to occur and will in the next five to ten years.   gay rights   are facing the same problems as segregation did in the thirties and forties. if gay marriage is enacted, will there be fighting? yes. will there be riots? probably, but the goal is to let every man and woman express they're views without accusation, but acceptance. the goal on this planet is to achieve true freedom in thought, view, and actions. Sivan, you said " I believe that homosexual people will find that they are the recipients of a great deal of enmity and hostility from other people". well, first of all that's a blanket statement, not every gay man wears rainbow shirts and hits on straight men. and you also said that the source of this hostility are the gay activist organizations. granted, they may have pushed the envelope, but the anti gay organizations are just as guilty.
