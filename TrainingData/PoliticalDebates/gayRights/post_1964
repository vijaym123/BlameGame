I agree with essentially all of that, but I feel that some nitpicking is in order."The First Constitutional Amendment did not retract religion from the Declaration of Independence."No, it does not, but as we have been discussing, the DoI does not contain the kindling of any specific religion. The First Amendment does clearly forbid the endorsement of a particular religion by the State. As long as the State is not forming legislation with preference to the Bible, the Qu'ran, the Bhagavad Gita, or any other holy text, everyone can play nice. If the State endorses scripture-dependent legislation, it clearly violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.I think all of our disagreements are pretty much hammered out now, wouldn't you say?
