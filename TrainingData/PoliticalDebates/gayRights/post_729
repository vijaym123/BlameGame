I notice that you like to draw from a lot of reference pertaining to psychologists, philosophers or, scholars and if taken from the Bible not in its true context.1 Corinthians 1 vs. 20, 25Where is the wise man?  Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age?  Has not  God made foolish the wisdom of the world?For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.1 Corinthians 3 vs 18-20Do not deceive yourselves.  If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight.  As it is written:  "He catches the wise in their craftiness" and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.Psalms 18 vs. 30As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is flawless.  He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.2 Corinthians Chapter 11 vs. 13-15For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.And marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.Goodbye on this topic.
