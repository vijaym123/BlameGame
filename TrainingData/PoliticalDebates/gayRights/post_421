WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A new report published by the Family ResearchCouncil (FRC) reveals that there is a body of evidence indicating adefinite link between   homosexuality   and pedophilia. Statistics showthat homosexual men, who represent less than 3 percent of the adultmale population, commit a disproportionate number (one-third or more cases of child sexual molestation. The report, "Homosexualityand Child Sexual Abuse," authored by Dr. Timothy J. Dailey (availableat   www.frc.org  .), is being sent to parents, youth groups, schooladministrators, Catholic bishops, and religious organizations.FRC's report comes at a time when the nation has been rocked byscandals of child sexual abuse and when homosexuals argue that youthorganizations such as the Boy Scouts should be forced to includehomosexuals as leaders. Similarly, gay activist organizations areencouraging homosexual teachers to share their sexuality with theirstudents. Many parents have become concerned that   children   may bemolested, encouraged to become sexually active, or even "recruited"into adopting a homosexual identity and lifestyle."Homosexuality and Child Sexual Abuse" examines the following evidencelinking homosexuality to pedophilia:Pedophiles are invariably males: Almost all sex crimes againstchildren are committed by men.Significant numbers of victims are males: Up to one-third of all sexcrimes against children are committed against boys (as opposed togirls).The 10 percent fallacy: Studies indicate that, contrary to theinaccurate but widely accepted claims of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey,homosexuals comprise between 1 to 3 percent of the population.Homosexuals are overrepresented in child sex offenses: Those among the1 to 3 percent of the population that is sexually attracted to thesame sex are committing up to one-third of the sex crimes againstchildren.Some homosexual activists defend the historic connection betweenhomosexuality and pedophilia: Such activists consider the defense of"boy-lovers" to be a legitimate gay rights issue.Pedophile themes abound in homosexual literary culture: Gay fiction aswell as serious academic treatises promote "intergenerationalintimacy.""Children have become the last sexual frontier," FRC President KenConnor said. "Those given the task of protecting our nation's childrenshould give a serious look at these statistics and think twice beforecomplying with the demands of homosexual activists."
