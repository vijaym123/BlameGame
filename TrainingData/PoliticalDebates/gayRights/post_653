the Christian gay that believes he's doing the right thing and is going to go to heaven is being deceived, and without  fully seeing their sin and repenting of it...they are heading toward sorrow and suffering, whether they love God or not, He loves them, too, and doesn't want that to be their future, but He can't allow them into His presence unless there has been repentance and forgiveness. it's hard on both sides...trying to convince a gay Christian that they're heading for trouble (as they should know they are if they know their bible and what the scriptures clearly state), or the non-Christian gay, as they may not necessarily see the need for Christ in their life, if they haven't been explained to the reasons why we need Jesus as our personal Savior.that's why i feel its crucial that the right witness is sent into the lives of both Christian and non, as there is so much anger towards Jesus and the "Christian" community, due largely to the wrong type of witnessing and preaching by those that attend glbt parades, festivals and events to "spread the Gospel".i know, having attended the pride parades before, that the "Christians" that show up to these events are(more often than not) red-faced, veins bulging in their foreheads, screaming at these people messages of damnation, which i definitely feel is the wrong approach.the world is so used to Christians who use these methods, and when they see them doing that, they think "why would i want to live like that" or "that's what Jesus is all about?", and they probably do more harm than good for God's kingdom. their intentions might be good, but their delivery is taken offensively, and if that's their method, i can see why. what did Jesus do? and what would Jesus do? i think if we're to reach this community, it needs to be done with love and in such a way that it comes across as that they are truly loved by ourselves and more importantly by Him, but its the lifestyle that is unhealthy and will ultimately lead to death.like i said before, i know i was deceived for a long time, but i think its because i kept hanging onto other sins in my life, and once i gave everything over to Him i was finally able to start to be healed in every area.so, yeah...it's the prayer of realizing our sin, and the resulting deliverance from it. it's hard, too, because i know i had alot of people around me that coddled my sin lifestyle, and filled me with "feel-good" vibes, saying "well, my "god" wouldn't send someone to hell for being gay"...and that's the first mistake right there. of course, their "god" wouldn't send someone to hell for being gay, because they have just created a "god" that fits their liking and approves of such things, whereas it states in scripture a number of times how wrong sexual sin is in the eyes of the Lord. i dont know how many times i'd be engaged in that type of discussion/debate with someone, but if they say their "god" wouldn't do that, then that in itself is idolatry, as they've just created their own "god". if that were the case, then there would also be a large portion of liars, and thieves, and murderers(all unrepentant) in heaven, and as i said before...God loves us, but He can't allow these things in His kingdom.i have so many friends still in the lifestyle, and i pray daily for their salvation.it breaks my heart that many won't turn to Him in time before its too late, but yet i pray that they may...
