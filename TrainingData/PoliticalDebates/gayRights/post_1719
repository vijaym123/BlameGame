You should not deride another's love as unworthy without a damn good reason. Semantic bullshit is not a good reason.Your argument in nothing but thinly veiled gay bashing.That said, allowing gays to marry does not radically redefine marriage. You just flip the gender of one of the participants. Everything else stays the same.
