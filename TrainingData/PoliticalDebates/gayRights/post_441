>. But we still come out because the pain of living a lie is in many ways worse than the pain of abandonment.>Why would so many of us make this "choice" if we didn't have to?Because it is fun?The sex drive is extremely compelling. A view by some psychologists suggested that the powerful force behind it was the motivation for all productivity. It was also suggested that the benefits of this energy often drove ore productivity when sublimated.I had a gay brother in law (now deceased). When he "came out" it had very little effect on my opinions of him or interactions with him. He had been married. We cared for his two children through their high school years. Neither of them is gay.When he passed away the obituary emphasized that it was lung cancer he died from and not aids.Since I respect the overwhelming power of the sex drive and what it can make one do I tend to analyze the idea that all species have gays a bit differently. It is not so much a matter of being born with a"different orientation" but rather a matter of opportunism. For instance there are males of all species that will screw anything that holds still for them! It is only a small step from this to men being with men because the opportunity exists or is considered a "better" or "easier" way to get "satisfaction", and you don't need to adjust to the differences (foibles) of "the other sex".Other than that I do believe one can control their own destiny to a very, very considerable extent- so even with any underlying "orientation" toward being gay one could resist it,Hal 84
