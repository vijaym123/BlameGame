....I also think gross hairy men who walk around without their shirts on when they have bigger boobs than I should be illegal.  Oh... but wait.  I can't have opinions because those things are legal.  Right.  So I'll be forced to smile at the disgustingness or I'll be arrested for not agreeing with something that's legal - and by all right should be legal.Just because I - and probably a lot of other people - think that mullets are offensive and Keanu Reeves is a really bad actor doesn't mean that laws should be made to regulate such things.  Well, I might make an exception to this if it meant no more Reeves, but...  ehh.  Nothing prevents you having an opinion.
