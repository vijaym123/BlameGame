I'm confused.  Jesus died for our sins, so now adultery and theft aren't sins anymore?  Or if they are still sins, they require less severe punishment today than in the past because Jesus paid-it-forward for us?  Either I'm missing an important theological point, or this is just a rationalization to reject the literal word of god (the bible) in favor of modern, humanistic moral standards.
