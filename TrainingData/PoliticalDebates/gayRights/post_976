I appreciate your points, Aegiltheugly, and I could accept the union, civil union, or household designation -- except for one thing.  To yield the point would be to allow the religious right to claim a word out of the English language as belonging solely to them.  According the Websters Dictionary, 1996, marriage is defined as the taking of another person as husband or wife.  It says nothing about a husband taking a wife.  Two women can just as easily take each other as wife, or two men take each other as husband.  I feel it would be wrong to make that sort of concession to any group.  Witness the foolishness of Spike Jones suing Spike TV because they were encroaching on his trademark of his name.
