I don't believe the Bible ever relates to "Adam and Steve" It does however relate to "Adam and Eve." Because someone claims to be a minister it does not qualify that individual to give his personal definition of what "sin" is. It's a personal belief. During my lifetime I heard so many different explainations and definitions on this one word until I finally took my mother's advice and found my own answers in the way I believe.
