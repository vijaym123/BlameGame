What if it is not a gay gene.  What if a flood of hormones from mom cascade over the fetus?  What if the fetus' just developing glands squirt our the wrong hormone at just the right moment and that causes the homosexuality.Perhaps there is no gene, but limiting yourself to that straw-man is silly.The question was not "Is there a gay gene", it was "Are people born gay?"
