Nowhere in my comment did I state that mammals didn't exhibit homosexual behavior. I have exhibited such. What I did state is that they DO NOT FORNICATE. Connecting innocent "behaviors" with a lifestyle is at best ludicrous, at worst moronic. I've read LeVay and numerous others. When concise scientific proof, not conjecture, is presented, I may be enticed to   change   my opinion.
