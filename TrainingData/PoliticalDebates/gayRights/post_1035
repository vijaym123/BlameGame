Though I feel a completely neutral standing when it comes to questions of sexual orientation (meaning that I view homosexuality as neither right nor wrong), I feel that it should not be allowed to have marriage for same sex couples. Marriage is defined as a religious institution. Now, should the individuals be wishing to marry under a religion that feels that their union is acceptable, then their marriage is acceptable. However, should the individuals be trying to be married under a religion such as Islam, Christianity, or any other religion that does not approve of their act, it is violating the rights of that religion to have the government force such a thing to occur. They (the individuals) had willingly agreed to joining the religion, with its preset beliefs and ethics. The government is not in a place to violate their rights. Do I think that same sex marriage is wrong? No. Do I think that it is wrong to ignore the already given rights of a religion, violating them in order for a person's choice (what religion they belong to) to be kept unchanged? Yes.
