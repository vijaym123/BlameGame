To reduce your argument to a level of 'well, dogs do it too!'  seems so base as to hardly be worthy of response. Dogs eat their own feces at times too, but that doesn't seem to be a good rationale for suggesting that Humans should, or a good defense if one would.Homosexuality is a 'deviant' behavior. Now, I use that strong word precisely because I know it will generate a strong reaction to many. None the less, that is what   homosexuality   is. It is 'deviant'. Not so much in the sense that it is 'wicked', 'evil' or 'vile', but in the sense that it 'deviates' from the norm.Approximately 3% of the population are homosexual. That means 97% aren't. Therefore, homosexuality 'Deviates' greatly from the norm. Society (The People) at large also have Rights and the Constitutional ability to voice their Rights . And, in State after State where the question has been put to The People, homosexual marriage has failed dismally. Personally, I hope the question becomes one of a Constitutional Amendment whereby The People are given the chance to voice their desires on what type of Society we shall live in. Take the matter out of the Courts and let The People decide. Naturally, homosexuals don't wish for that, because they know they could never win.
