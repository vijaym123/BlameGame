HG...LOL! I'll forgive you this one but there was a day, in my time, where the term Lesbian was frowned upon. Today, because everything and everyone MUST be categorized we've been split into Males (Gays) and Females (Lesbians). I still take exception to it because I remember the stigma attached to it. Faggots and Lesbos, Fags & Lesbians! We called each other Gay...no one else did. Geeze, what monikers! So now the guys have the Happy term and women have the Politically Correct one!
