"The only thing that determines your entrance into Heaven is your religious affiliation. Is that an accurate summary?"You ask some really intelligent questions quantummechanik but No, that is a common but entirely mistaken belief. Religious affiliation is NOT what determines going to heaven or hell.Whether or not you have a personal, saving relationship with Jesus Christ, the Jewish Messiah, is what determines whether  one goes to heaven or hell."Jesus said: I am the way, the truth and the life. No man comes unto the Father except by me." -John 14:6  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Saved.html  Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com
