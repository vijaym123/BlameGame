but we must be careful when we use the word love because as you and I know they mean very different things in different contexts.  The Bible is full of examples where people love eachother and are not married.  However, this love is not sexual.  Do not then presume (please) that I mean that no intimate human partnerships or relationsihps should occur outside of marriage- that is simply not Biblical or true.  In this case, according to definintion of complementarianisim you offered, I am not a complementarian.  Beyond the possibility of marriage great emotional and social needs and longings are met through parents, siblings, family, best friends, friends, partners, groups, classmates, co-workers, the church, small groups and so forth.  All kinds of human relationships can develop the capacity for intimaciy and in more extreme circumstances partnership.  This is all good and decent granted the realtionships have a realtive level of health; i.e. not subject to co-dependency, violent, or otherwise harmful to the people invovled in those relationships.  What is reserved for marriage though is the fullness of sexual union as embodied in sexual union.  That is, although intimate partnerships and/or relationships happen between people they are not open to sexual union because that specific gift to humanity is reserved for the covenent and relationship of marriage.  There is a difference between what I am advocating, from the Bible, than what you are claiming I am saying.  Unfortunatly I must make a leave now so I will not be able to give a more adequate response to your comment at this time although I did read the two articles you linked and will respond at a later time.  God's peace be upon you,Spencer
