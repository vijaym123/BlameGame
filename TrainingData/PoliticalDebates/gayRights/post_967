Let me dissect a few points that opponents of gay marriage often bring up:-Gay marriage will lead to more homosexuals by legitimizing the gay lifestyle. A Swedish study published last month showed that gay men and women consistently displayed a brain structure that resembled that of the opposite sex. You see, one of the hemispheres of a woman's brain is slightly bigger than the other, while in men the hemispheres are the same size, which has long been known to be a reliable way to tell apart the sexes physically (besides the really obvious ways) Gay men had brains that resembled a woman's brain and vice versa for lesbian women. This basically proves irrefutably that homosexuality is not a so-called "lifestyle choice", but a born-in trait, determined in the womb. -Gay parenting will create screwed up kids by denying them a father or mother figure.  Yes! This is why we, as a society, do not allow single mothers to raise kids. It's just not healthy. I'd do more, but I'm out of room.
