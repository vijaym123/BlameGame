I hadn't noticed the gay christian link on your comments till this post. And as I am not religious I was already impressed with your previous posts. There are so many paths to take in life and half the fun is seeing what others have chosen. You certainly chose an interesting one. I also second the very well written response, I wish I had written it (if would permit me one second of envy)  : )
