I disagree with all points you present.  Kids are hit from all sides, and at the top of the list, is the parents (mom and dad) or guardians (lesbians and gay/couples).  Kids cannot escape either.Kids are hit when they see other parents that consist of male and a female.  Kids at school, once they know the child has same sex parents, will tease and belittle them.Kids in most situations do not have someone they can go for comfort and understanding.  Most humans do not have the capacity to express themselves well enough to help themselves, let alone help others, and this has been with us since the beginning of man kind.Kids have enough problems growing without increasing their burden by forcing them into a situation that isn't normal.  The kids end up suffering, and like most family settings, when done wrong,   society   also pays.Have we had a chance to actually see these   children   in homsexual settings?  No!  The few that we have seen, the kids think their guardians are weird, or just have no respect for them.  This are the kids that were not affected by this strange desire to be together.
