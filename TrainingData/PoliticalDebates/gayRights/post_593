It's not saying they aren't since anymore, but sin is not dealt in the same way as in the old testament. This doesn't mean that the condition of sin is lightened, it is the same, but Jesus sacrifice plays a huge role when it comes to forgiveness. Now because of Jesus we can be saved, we are able to be forgiven and called righteous as long as we repent from our sins (meaning turning away from our sinful nature) and chose to live for Jesus. Isaiah 53 talks about Jesus death on the cross. These are just parts of it.5 But he was pierced for our rebellion,      crushed for our sins.   He was beaten so we could be whole.      He was whipped so we could be healed. 6 All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.      We have left God’s paths to follow our own.   Yet the Lord laid on him      the sins of us all. This part talks about How He became an offering for sin on the cross. 10 But it was the Lord’s good plan to crush him      and cause him grief.   Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,      he will have many descendants.   He will enjoy a long life,      and the Lord’s good plan will prosper in his hands. 11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,      he will be satisfied.   And because of his experience,      my righteous servant will make it possible   for many to be counted righteous,      for he will bear all their sins.Notice how it talks about many because not everyone will turn to Jesus for salvation.So just to make sure I answer your questions1) Adultery, theft as well as homosexuality and other sins are still sins. And I believe they aren't any less of sins. 2) Basically the there is judgement, however Jesus did pay for our sins so repentance plays a huge role. He can take away judgement from us if we turn away from our ways and surrender to Him.
