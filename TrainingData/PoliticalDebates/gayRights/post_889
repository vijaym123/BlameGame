We cannot just let go of the Same-Sex issue because it involves too many fundamental freedoms Californians have not enjoyed for 6 months due to the California Supreme Court's decision. I agree with many of the arguments posed by the Agreement Vs. Respect comment below. Respect of opinions should be given to all and I believe the right to maintain individual opinions on this matter is important. However, the Supreme Court's Decision has taken away Californian's legal right to disagree with Same-Sex Marriage and is in fact forcing that opinion upon us. While I have not qualms with giving a license to Same-Sex Couples, the Supreme Court did more then that in their ruling. Please find and read it. They placed Same-Sex and Traditional Marriages as equals that cannot be separated, and that has brought up a slew of civil-right and religious issues, as well as taking away our right to have an opinion on the issue. If you wish to have an opinion on this issue, vote Yes on Proposition 8.
