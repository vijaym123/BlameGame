Crash makes an interesting point.What did Jesus say about all of this?Many non-gay and gay people insist Jesus never addressed the issue of homosexuality. I believe Jesus did address the gay issue when He pointed out in Matthew 19:3-12 that all men cannot receive His teaching about Adam and Eve style marriage.Jesus taught that "born eunuchs" were a separate group, distinct from eunuchs who had been castrated and distinct from eunuchs who voluntarily abstained from Adam and Eve style marriage in order to serve God without distraction.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html   Because Jesus intentionally differentiated between born eunuchs and metaphysical eunuchs who voluntarily decide not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage, it makes sense to conclude that born eunuchs are:a. not required to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage (since Jesus intentionally opts them out)b. not required to abstain from marrying an orientation compatible partner (since Jesus intentionally differentiates them from metaphysical eunuchs who make a personal decision not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage).   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Eunuchs-Are-Gay.html
