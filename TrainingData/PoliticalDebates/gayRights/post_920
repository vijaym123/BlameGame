By the very statements used to argue against same gender marriages, any heterosexual pair known to be infertile should not be allowed to wed.  Single parents having children of the opposite gender should not be allowed to raise them because they are inherently incapable of teaching the child how to act like a person of that gender.  People who are suspected of being likely to divorce should not be allowed to wed because of the psychological damage it might do to the children.  Very foolish argument.Also, the fact that I am homosexual does not mean I know nothing about having a relationship with a woman.  I fought for decades to live "in the closet" and had a very successful relationship until my lady died.  I was not happy, but I concealed it very well.  Then I had my first love relationship natural to me -- one with another man.  I stayed with him, too, until I lost him to a heart attack. I've also raised four children, 2 boys and 1 girl, who have very stable heterosexual relationships and who have all come to me with their mates to discuss problems because they knew I could look at both sides and advise without attacking or being biased.Your reasoning is specious and based upon a total lack of understanding of the capabilities of fully cognizant human beings.
