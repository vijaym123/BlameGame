While I don't know if people are born to be Gay or it happens from other cause I whole hardily believe that people do not choose to be Gay any more than I chose to be bald. They are who they are and it can't be changed. I totally support Gay Rights and Government recognized Gay "marriage" or "Civil Unions" or what ever the name as long as it establishes equal rights with Heterosexual Married couples.
