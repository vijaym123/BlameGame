Copy and paste from an earlier debate like this.People are born gay.Not just people, pandas, swans, monkeys, and every other mamal in the world has a percentage of its population that is gay. linkIf one were to argue that being gay is a choice, they would also have to argue that two male swans who are gay, are choosing to be gay.So please, find me a swan that is making a conscious decision anywhere. Animals work on instinct, they don't make "lifestyle choices." Now, people for the most part aren't slaves to instinct. But we have it, just like animals. If one, like the gay swan, has gay instincts, there are 0 logical reasons they should not pursue it. Infact, not being gay if you're gay leads to mental and physical health problems.To answer Pyg's new twist on this arguement.One could argue that there are too many people, and homosexuality is a good thing in this case.Regardless, there's really no end game here. People who are gay have no choice in the matter, and a gay person can and often is born from two not gay parents. Plus there's every level of gay. Human sexuality looks like a bell curve, it's not really even an either or situation. Though most fall pretty heavily on one side or the other, or at least claim to.If not a single gay person were to pass on their genes to the next generation of humans, still the next generation of humans would have a similar percentage of gay members.
