That two or more people can marry one another emotionally is both unquestionable and unpreventable by others. Those in "same-sex" relationships have emotionally married one another likely since our species was identifiable as a distinct species and will likely continue to do so until the species is no more. Those who wish to keep the administrative marriage of same-sex individuals illegal cannot prevent the emotional marriage, nor can they prevent same-sex relationships from both inventively creating offspring and raising them to maturity. One wonders what is actually being accomplished except the irrational and prejudicial exclusion of some individuals from the benefits of administrative recognition of what already exists. What is likely to happen in the continued illegality of same-sex administrative marriage is that these individuals will acquire the same benefits of heterosexual marriages by other means. Life adapts and improvises - or it perishes.
