The key point that gets missed in the this discussion is that parents aren't the only ones who raise children. I grew up with a single mother, and while she certainly did her best, she couldn't answer all my questions as a boy. That's why I had a grandfather, uncles, family friends, teachers, coaches and others who I could rely on. Every situation is unique (in my case I was likely better off without my father in my home), but I absolutely feel that their collective help but me at no disadvantage. There's no reason to think that the children of same-sex parents couldn't use similar resources. I would challenge you to re-consider if two opposite sex parents really are so necessary.
