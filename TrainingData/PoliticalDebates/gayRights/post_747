I don't really believe it's just my friends. I would say around 90% of the gay men I have known (and I've lived down the street from San Fransisco, so it's not just a few) have had pretty open relationships. I'm trying very hard not to stereotype here, but it's hard not to when, adversely, all my lesbian friends have been pretty freaking monogamous. You're lucky, in a way, to be an atheist. I've had some good friends who've been steadfastly religious try to deal with their sexuality and it can get quite ugly and distressing for them. It's hard to deal with parents or family who aren't accepting of your choices, but harder still when you yourself have issues with who you are.
