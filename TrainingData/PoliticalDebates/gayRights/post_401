I think gays give up too much when they use the genetic argument to deflect moral judgments of their lifestyle. Obviously, being gay isn't like deciding to eat ice cream. It arises out of a complex array of choices made as one grows up. It would be silly to claim that everything we like in life is the result of our DNA, and this applies to sexual preference as well. It's equally silly to claim that homosexuality is immoral because it's not 'natural', especially if what's natural is based on animal behavior. We're humans. How much of what we do is natural by that standard? Is kissing natural?  My verdict would be that homosexuality is neither genetic nor immoral. It's one way for humans to live. There is a great deal of self destructive behavior that both homosexuals and heterosexuals indulge in with regard to their sex lives. That kind of behavior is wrong, but the preference itself is not.
