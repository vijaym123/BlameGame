...in this "debate" is the state that   children   typically are in when they come to same-sex parents for foster care or   adoption  . My   kids   had been in and out of foster care eight times before they were permanently placed with us. My husband and I had to address years of abusive behavior, domestic violence that had been witnessed in previous homes, etc., with our kids. All of those things happened during their critical formative years, and the damage of all of them is difficult, if not impossible, to undo completely. And this is just one of many realities that Focus dismisses, ignores or rationalizes to support its political interests. If Focus were truly concerned about the welfare of kids, it would devote resources to placing more of them in loving homes rather than trying to undermine the ability of GLBT parents to be good parents to their foster and adoptive kids.Let's be clear: I didn't make my kids. A heterosexual couple did. And that same couple abused, neglected and ultimately abandoned them. They are my children and my husband's children now. And we are "serving their best interests" in ways that have literally meant salvation for them both. Focus and other far-right, anti-gay groups continually distort data regarding gay and lesbian parents to the degree that to call them "experts" in this area is like calling the Klan experts in race relations.
