OddGrouch,You have an excellent point and I now agree with you without reservation.  It must be up to the churches to make their own distinction within their own congregations and doctrine and practice that belief within the confines of their faith. Marriage under the law should be afforded to everyone.  It is a right that we must all have.Michelle
