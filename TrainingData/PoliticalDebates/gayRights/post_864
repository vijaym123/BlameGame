I believe that was ruined long ago.    Furthermore, marriage sucks.  I'm not kidding.  Unless you think it acceptable and sanctimonious to sell you daughter?  Or unless you believe that women are merely property of men?  That's the original intent of marriage and for thousands of years, that's how it went.  Calling a hideous tradition a sanctimonious act is like calling slavery sanctimonious.    Simply because this has changed to marriage being an actual choice between two consenting adults who love each other doesn't change the history of the act, does it?  Nor  was the "sanctity" of marriage any less sanctimonious when it was illegal for inter-racial couples to tie the knot.And just how has the sanctity of marriage been preserved and protected from heterosexual couples? Britney Spears? Drew Barrymore? A 17 hour marriage? Drive-thru chapels?  Sanctimonious enough for you?What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to say that homosexuality is not okay.  What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to use democracy to discriminate against another group simply because it "suits your own desires or your own agenda."You do not have to like homosexuality anymore than I like the fact that some people will continue to  wear crosses around their necks and carry guns in their hands and march off into war because it's their duty for country.  As if the laws they say they live their by are superseded by their love country.  (Which, you don't have to say anything about that, I'm using it as an example of what I have to accept.)    What you cannot and should not do is to support laws that intentionally leave out a group of people simply because they are in the minority.  Unless, of course, you thought it was perfectly acceptable for laws to be made that discriminated against black people simply because black people were in the minority.Stop lying to yourself.
