Most, if not all, of Focus on the Family's "research" which they use to "prove" that gay-parented families are inferior to straight-parented families are studies of children being raised either in single-parent homes because their parents were divorced or they were abandoned by one of their parents, or of children being raised in "blended" step-families.  Such familial situations may very well NOT be ideal for raising children, but poor outcomes from such blended or single-parent families does not by any means equate to poor outcomes for children raised in stable, two-parent, loving, nurturing homes where the parents are of the same gender.The studies of children raised in stable, loving, two-same-gendered parent homes show that such children are equally as happy, healthy and thriving as children raised in equivalent opposite-gendered-parent homes.
