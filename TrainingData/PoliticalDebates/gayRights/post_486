 If you were born homosexual and   science   and   medicine   could prove it, they cant so we will take there word for it, then psycologists and socialogist would be screaming to put homosexual   children   into homosexual homes and visa versa and they are not because they know as well as the rest of us that your sexual preference is C-H-O-I-C-E. Good articles at narth.com and at exodus international web site. This one is another reason I say let adult homosexuals live how they want to but children do not need to be put in these environments through   adoption  .  http://www.drtraycehansen.com/Pages/writings_samesex.html  Titled appropriatelyLove Isn’t Enough: 5 Reasons Why Same-Sex Marriage Will Harm ChildrenBy Trayce Hansen, Ph.D.
