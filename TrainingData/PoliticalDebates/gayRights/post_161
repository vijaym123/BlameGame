This was the very excuse given me by my mother when she explained to me why two people of different races should not marry.  She carefully explained to me that, "while there was nothing wrong with black people," still, there were "cultural differences" which would make such a marriage more "difficult" and the children would be "negatively impacted" by the teasing they would face from other children.Therefore, ipso facto, interracial marriage should be illegal (or immoral, or both).  Please.  :roll-eyes-and-sigh:
