There are 3 types of sexuality which we must define when talking about   homosexuality  .  (1) Sexuality as it pertains to reproduction(2) Sexuality as it pertains to gender(3) Sexuality as it pertains to attractionThis argument relies on equivocating through the various meanings.  Fact: 100% of all humans are heterosexual(1).  This is undeniable. Therefore this definition is irrelevant to our debate.“Homosexual” in the arena we are debating does not make any sense in the context of #(2). Homosexual(3) is all that is relevant to our debate.  I will now show how we cannot speak about   animals   in the third sense.  Fact: You have no idea whether I am attracted to men or   women   irrespective of what I tell you or how I act.  You cannot know to whom I am attracted, since this is undeniable, how could you know that animals are homosexual(3)?  The key word in your argument is: "Seem" in your third sentence.  This word deracinates any possibility that your argument means anything at all.  In order for us to take any meaning from the fact that animals perform some act and apply it to this discussion, we would need to know why they do this action.  Since we cannot know this, the point is moot.  Animals may perform some actions that, prima facie, are similar to actions which we deem as homosexual(3), these actions are irrelevant in this debate.
