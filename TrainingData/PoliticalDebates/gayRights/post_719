This is another example of misinterpreting the scriptures.  The "speck in the eye" is an allegorical reference to the fact that no human being is without fault, therefore not qualified to pass judgements.  All human beings have specks in their eyes. And since when is a saint considered to be a normal human being?    This forum is about homosexuality being a sin.  If a homosexual cannot accept his or  her feelings and wishes to suppress and ignore them, that is their choice. But that does not make it a sin.  JUDGING homosexuality is a sin.  Also, comparing homosexuality to drugs or alcohol is ignorant.  It's like comparing a fish to a bicycle.  Again, I point out that using the Bible as the basis for a viewpoint like this is unsound reasoning. It is an allegorical piece of literature, a text translated many times, colored by personal opinion, open to countless interpretations of the same passages depending on a person's viewpoint, and not shared by all humankind.  Those who view homosexuality as a sin simply have no concrete basis for their viewpoint.  In fact, the most enlightened spiritual teachings refute the concept of "sin" as presented by the christians.
