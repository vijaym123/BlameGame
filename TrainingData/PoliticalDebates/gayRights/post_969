I was raised by my biological mother and her partner. I am no different than anyone else. Nor was I any different than any of my school friends. Which  by the way was ALOT! None of their parents had any problems with it, it did not stop me from doing the same things that the straight parented   kids   did. When my mother died, many of my school friends and their parents attended her funeral, along with BOTH of my ex husbands and their families, including the new wives. My mother being gay did not hurt my   children   either. My mother's partner is still a daily part of our lives and we are the better for it! Get your facts straight. The kids that have issues are the ones raised by parents that dont give a crap about no one but themselves. Out there screwing around,drinking and doing drugs. That is straight and gay parents. Your sexual orientation doesnt make you a bad or good parent, your heart makes that choice.
