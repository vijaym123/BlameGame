I will assume you're an American, otherwise you wouldn't reply with a comment so unnecessary. You wouldn't know this, but for anyone else in the world, being informed about issues simmering along in the US is hardly compulsive.I won't ever be travelling to the US, because I don't need to - your country makes its way over here, as so much of your   media   is exported to countries like mine. Unfortunately, so are some of the happy-clappy-type churches and their foreign moralities along with it. You're right: at the moment, my country is ideally suited to me. Dnd due to people like you, it seems, it is in danger of not being so. I call that interference ... hence my interest in this forum and others like it.
