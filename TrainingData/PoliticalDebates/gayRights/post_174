Alex, you are completely bypassing the fact that children have been raised by same-gender couples for far longer than there have been adoption policies to place adoptive children with such couples.  Thousands and thousands of children have been raised by couples who brought up children from a previous marriage or relationship by a member of the couple, or by couples who intentionally got pregnant as a couple, or who brought up the unwanted child of a friend or family member without benefit of being able to adopt him or her, just as "declared guardians" of the child by permission of the biological parent.There have been formal studies in place on gay-parented families since the 70's, and further data is available on people raised by same-gender parents since long before that time (I know a few of these people, myself, none of whom happen to be gay, by the way).  They are happily married to people of the opposite gender, and raising children of their own, who are normal and well-adjusted as far as I can tell (some are teenagers, so "normal" and "well-adjusted" are relative terms! :) But really, they are good kids by any measure).So, while I'm happy to hear that you don't oppose same-gender couples adopting children, it's odd that you feel the need to come here and add fuel to the fire against gay couples raising children without being aware of the body of evidence which consistently supports the fact that children raised by same-gender parents ARE equally healthy and well-adjusted as compared with children of opposite-gender parents.
