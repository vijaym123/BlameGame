Firstly, I think eating meat on Fridays should be illegal.Answer me this: Why should my freedoms be limited because of your beliefs? Should I also be required to go to church every Sunday? Does me eating meat hurt anyone? What gives you the right to tell me what I can and can't do, if my actions have no effect on you?Let me repeat: Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion. That is literally how the bill of rights starts.In addition, you clearly aren't a very good Christian if you think your not allowed to eat meat on Fridays. The Catholic Church lifted that ban years ago. It's only on lent that you aren't allowed to eat meat on Fridays. You might want to get your facts straight (otherwise you may end being torchered for all of eternity, because God loves you).Finally, our constitution was founded on enlightenment principles of rationality and reason. Merely saying something is wrong "because the bible says so" puts us back in the dark ages. Something can be wrong because it hurts people, or has a negative effect on society. Both eating meat, and homosexuality do not fall into either category, and therefore cannot be immoral.Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
