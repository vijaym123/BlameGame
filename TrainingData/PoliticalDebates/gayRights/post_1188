First of all, people see what they want to see.  Personally I have seen many polls on the gay marriage issue and the majority of those I've seen indicate that most Americans are in favor of some kind of gay marriage whether it be called a marriage or a civil union.  This article is clearly biased toward only those poll results that are favorable to the FRC's side of the argument.  The accuracy of polls is always unsure and I highly question the results of some of the polls listed in this argument.  Second, whether or not most people agree with banning same sex marriage or not is essentially irrelevant.  Majority does not necessarily rule in this country.  The majority at one point thought that slavery was acceptable but that does not make it any more justifiable.  Prejudice is prejudice regardless of how many people you get to back it up.
