I'm typing on my phone so I'll only adress one issue: Massachusetts and the   catholic     adoption   issue.The ability of the court to overturn the so called "will of the people" is necessary for the protection of the minority from the "tyranny of the majority." To even demean the courts for overruling laws "against the will of the people" is truly representative of a   conservative  's desire to have pure democacy... Which is how communism AND fascism come into   power  (all you need to do is convince the majority that you are right and it won't matter what the minority says). Please don't insult our legal system just because you disagree with the outcome of a particular case. As for why the catholic adoption agencies being forced to accept   gay   couples is because of the 14th ammendment(equal protection) to our   constitution  . The   children   in orphanages can't choose to transfer to "pro-gay" adoption agency and are therefore denied rights that are granted to other orphans. It's really very simple: it's about protecting children from illegal   discrimination   and giving the children equal access to adoptive   parents  !
