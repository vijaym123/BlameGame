Instead, what we see is that none of them identified the sin of Sodom as homosexuality until around the first century. Here is what ancient Jews believed about the sin of Sodom.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sodom.html   Biblical authors identify the sin of Sodom as idolatry [shrine prostitution, for example]  or adultery or pride or prosperity and greed or refusal to help the poor and needy [lack of hospitality] - Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel. Writers outside the inspired scriptures identified the sin of Sodom as pride and refusal to be kind to strangers traveling through their land.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html   six11 wrote:>>>>>"jude 1:7 connects sodom with 'sexual immorality' - which includes homosexual relationships"<<<<<That statement is inaccurate. Jude used the Greek word, heteros, to identify the kind of sin that was being committed in Sodom. Had Jude intended us to believe the sin of Sodom was related to same sex activity, he would have used the Greek word, homoios, which is the root of our English word, homosexual.six11 wrote:>>>>>"knowing that several other towns/cities were rude and had horrible towards GOD'S messengers, why didn't GOD also destroy those places as well?"<<<<<History testifies that God is full of grace toward humanity, even in the midst of sin.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/what-is-grace.html   six11 wrote:>>>>>"joe dallas notes in his book a strong delusion, "the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus appear alongside other sexual sins ... which are forbidden in both [testaments] ... [these references] show GOD'S displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved" (193). he also makes another point stating that if these other practices only pertained to idol worship, then child sacrifice, adultery, incest, and the like would all be permissible as long as it was done apart form idol worship. rick, that's exactly what you're suggesting as well. outside of 'idol worship' is incest a sin? what about adultery? child sacrifice?"<<<<<The problem with this question is that it ASSUMES Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 is talking about homosexuality and is not talking about shrine prostitution. Philo, the Jewish philosopher, stated 2000 years ago, that he believed Moses was talking about shrine prostitution in Leviticus.
