If FRC could prove that an overwhelming amount of people think homosexuality is unnatural, what would that mean?  Just many people think homosexuality is unnatural does not mean that it actually is.  Still, if FRC could demonstrate that homosexuality was unnatural, why would it matter?  Why is something that is “unnatural” immoral?  Why do we place so much trust in the dictates of nature?  FRC would say that the law of the Lord is against homosexuality, in that, if homosexuality is against nature, homosexuality is against God and His nature.  That might work for a theological argument, but in this context, we’re wondering what policy our government should take.  The government rules over a people free to practice any creed, or lack thereof, and to guide the government by religious dogma, or ideas derived from that dogma, is to impose articles of faith on the People.  We cannot allow our government to veer from secularism; else, our government threatens our civil liberties and our freedom of religion.  When our officials make decisions, they must use secular reason, else they stand to threaten the establishment of religion.
