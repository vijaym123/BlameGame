I'm not sure why this weak argument was even included.  The heterosexual couple feels that their rights are being infringed upon?  Becuase of the wording on a legal document?  They are still allowed to get married.  What about the rights of the gay couple who wish to marry and won't be able to if this proposition passes?  Who's rights have really been trampled?  Words on a document vs. actual legal rights as a citizen of the U.S.
