The idea is that Jesus in His life, death and resurrection, fulfilled all the demands of the Law, therefore we are not required to keep the Law ourselves to be right with God.That is not a license to sin. It simply acknowledges that "all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." To get saved and to go to heaven, we need the righteousness of Christ."Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation THROUGH FAITH IN HIS BLOOD, to declare HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;To declare, I say, at this time, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS..." - Romans 3:25"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and RIGHTEOUSNESS, and sanctification, and redemption." - I Corinthians 1:30    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Christians-Under-Law.html
