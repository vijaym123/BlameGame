Pacific Justice Institute, are you not familiar with the California Legislative Guide to Marriage Law?  Does the 14th Amendment ring a bell?  Marriage is indeed considered a Fundamental Right under the Constitution of the U.S.  If this is a new concept to you, then perhaps you're overstating your expert status on this matter.  The 'Yes On 8' side has yet to make a valid logical argument as to what harm will come to anyone when two gay people get 'Married'.  Some people have actually stated that they have been harmed because they can't have an opinion on this matter anymore.  Huh?  Some people say that it harms the institution of Marriage.  What?  Marriage is only special because certain people aren't allowed to be married?  Some people say that it infringes on their religious freedom.  They believe the gay lifestyle is immoral, and they might be forced to perform a wedding ceremony for a gay couple.  This is an empty argument.  Immoral people get married in churches every weekend.  Does the church do a complete background check on every couple before it performs a wedding ceremony?  Does it know that the husband to be is a child molester?  Does it know that the wife has slept with the entire high school football team?  Does it know that the money used to pay the church for the wedding was earned by selling meth?  Does it always perform it’s due diligence in these matters?  No, it doesn’t.  The standard is, as long as you appear moral, then you’re ok.  I say, don’t preach a double standard to me.  And don’t use empty, illogical arguments to strip people of their FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
