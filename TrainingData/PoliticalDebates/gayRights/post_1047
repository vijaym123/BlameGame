"Second I cant figure out why Gay people want to be married as this is a religous ceremony and the real issue is having the same rights as the heterosexual people. A   legal   union will be as binding if recognized by the state or federal level."Marriage is not a strictly religious institution... it never has been.  There are also religious homosexuals, who want to be able to get exercise their right to   religious freedom   by getting married (and all that entails).It also strikes me as a little odd to create civil   unions   and have them be identical in every way to marriages... except that the names are different.
