Correct - I do not believe that homosexuality is a natural thing. I think I stated that. I also, however, don't believe that most homosexuals "choose" to be gay. I think that there are many factors that create a state in which one's mind opens to certain desires, and for whatever reason becomes infatuated with it. It then becomes very "natural" to that person. I can respect that in lieu of a more substantiated theory. The fact that there are occurances of this in life only supports the notion that this anomoly exists in more than the human race. We should study the similarities to understand what this better. All that being said, I do not believe that it is very American to disallow marriage based on homosexual tendancies or persuasions, regardless of what I think is "right".
