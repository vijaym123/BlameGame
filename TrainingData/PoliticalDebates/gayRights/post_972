The "parents" need their freedom too. We're all human beings, animals. We have feelings. It's just a minority of us have feelings for the same sex, but those people should not be deprived of their place in the society. It is not weird for a child to have two parents of the same sex. The parents need to be accepted in this society too. As for the children, if they really do get out of hand with a single parent, we should help them more, shouldn't we? We should teach them if their parents don't. The children feel left out because the society looks at same sex parents as unacceptable people. Just like the parents feel the pain. The best solution to this is to accept same sex lovers as part of our society, not looking down on them or anything, letting them feel accepted, so the children will not have any problems at all.
