I'm a bit lost.  Where is your evidence that gay marriage would hurt heterosexual marriage?  The point is stated but not backed up or explained.  The link provided doesn't actually include any justification for this argument either.  All I can see offered is the "yardstick" metaphor, which doesn't really make sense.  Yes, changing the definition of a meter (not "yardstick" which is not a defined measurement) would be a problem.  It would be tough to know how long a yard is.  I don't see how that extrapolates to marriage... are you suggesting that if gays marry, heterosexual couples who've been married for years will not know if they're married or not anymore? If anything, I think traditional marriage is harmed by the high divorce rate, green card marriages, Britney Spears getting married for a weekend, etc.  Even then, how is any traditional "sacred" marriage harmed?  If your marriage is sound, it will not be affected by the actions of other people.
