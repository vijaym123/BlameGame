Freedom of religion does not include the freedom to infringe on the liberties of another. What those who support Proposition 8 wish to keep in place is the right of what amounts to a religious viewpoint to hinder the liberties of those whose views on marriage are different. If, as you say, there are those who would next demand religious institutions perform marriages against their will, I would certainly and just as adamantly oppose their efforts. One cannot rightly demand liberty while at the same time stepping all over the liberties of others to obtain it.Nevertheless, historically, the major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are far more often the perpetrators of damage to liberties than are other points of view. It has long been their sense of self-righteousness that has led to an assumption they own the cultures in which they find themselves and can therefore dictate the lifestyles of all. They are mistaken and have always been mistaken. Human history is a long story of removing the prejudices of these religions to restore authentic liberty.It is long overdue those philosophies lose their arrogance. Perhaps a little humility would do them good.
