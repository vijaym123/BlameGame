Homosexuality has been proven to be a result of nature. It is not a choice to be attracted to members of the same sex.For you theists, explain it to yourself how you want, but if there really is a God, he's clearly testing you to see if you've learned the Bible, and he wants you to understand how important it is to accept all his creations in all the shapes, sizes, and forms he sends them.
