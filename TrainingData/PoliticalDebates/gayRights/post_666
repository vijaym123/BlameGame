A person who has a sexual desire for someone of their same sex, does not commit a sin by having a desire. However, if he indulges the desire in his imagination and then acts upon it (masturbation and/or sexual contact with another) then it becomes a sin. Why is a homosexual act sinful? For the same reason that heterosexual sex outside of marriage is a sin - it injures the people who indulge in it, destroys the presence of grace in the soul, and leads to a warping of the intellect and will, especially one's view of human dignity.
