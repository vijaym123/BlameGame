Gay marriage is unacceptable because it is not private. If two people choose to engage in this behavior behind closed doors, society should remain agnostic.  However, when this behavior (like other aberrant behaviors), is championed as normal, natural, and a matter of "freedom" (as opposed to license), society has an obligation to protect children during their formative years and denounce these acts.
