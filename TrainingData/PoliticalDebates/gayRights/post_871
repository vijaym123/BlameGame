Restoring the liberty of homosexual individuals to marry whomever they choose has nothing at all to do with agreeing with their preferences in sexual partners or their lifestyle. Agreement with them is not required. What is required in any civilized culture which claims to value individual rights and liberties is respect for their individual humanity and their personal pursuit of happiness. Assuming an individual is not infringing the liberty of another to exercise their individual rights, that individual is owed to them the liberty to do the same.I must remind those who object to granting liberty to same-sex couples to marry one another that, regardless of how right you believe your viewpoint and values, there are always thousands of individuals in the United States who disagree with your points of view, your beliefs, your values, your chosen lifestyle. Perhaps some of those who disagree with and object to you would see that you lose some liberties to enforce their point of view upon your choices. If you would not have the practice of suppressing liberties because the lifestyle of another makes you uncomfortable become a standard approach to relationships in cultures, perhaps you ought not encourage such thinking by thinking in such ways yourself. You will, no doubt, be forging the chains you will someday wear.If you wish to live with optimum liberty, although you do not owe another your agreement, you DO owe any and all your respect of their liberties. If you do not believe this true, then you explicitly disagree with a culture that holds as its highest value individual rights and liberties. What you truly value is an elitist culture - liberty for some, slavery for others. Perhaps your viewpoint is better suited for a feudal society or one similar to Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea or perhaps Cuba.Those dictatorships are always looking for your sort of affirming opinions.
