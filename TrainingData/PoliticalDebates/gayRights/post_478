Jeremy,I am not an expert, but I wonder if perhaps your comment was too limited in what it addressed.  You only addressed behavior outcomes within the context of our current strongly pro heterosexual society.  I seem to remember studies from many years ago that concluded that the natural human tendency was for people to be born with congenital preference across the full spectrum between pure hetero and pure homo with the vast majority in various shades of bi.  This preference is then shaped by the rubric of current social values that lead to the outcomes you describe.That would imply that far fewer people are “born gay” than you might expect.  It also mean that far fewer people are “born straight” than you might expect as well.  The conflict comes from all of those people in the middle forced to conform to the imposed unnatural social values.  Normally you would expect that the closer you are to one end of the spectrum the easier it is to move your outcome to conform, but human nature is more complex than that.  Then you have to deal with people that have what I describe as angry reformed behavior complex.  I’m sure you know the type.  I made the sacrifice and quit (fill in what you want; smoking, drinking, being over weight, enjoying myself, whatever), “how dare you offend me and do that in front of me you weak willed sinner.”  Or the less angry who feel “I want to be good, please don’t tempt me to take my life down that road of social scorn.”
