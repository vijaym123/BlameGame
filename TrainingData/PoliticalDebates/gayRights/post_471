 The passages in the Bible you listed don't condone slavery, in my opinion. But they do acknowledge it exists and is very common, and basically talks about slaveowners and slaves treating each other properly. For example, saying that slaveowners should not beat their slaves is nothing controversial to me, or saying that good deeds a slave does for their master are counted equally by God.
