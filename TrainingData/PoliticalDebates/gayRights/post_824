I agree with you that Saul's vulgar sexual characterization of the Jonathan and David relationship does not prove that J & D had a sexual relationship. I make that statement in my book, Gay Christian 101.On the other hand, Saul's statement provides contemporary eye witness testimony about the sexual intimacy of their partnership, from a man who knew both men.And the fact that the Holy Spirit chose to include Saul's testimony in the text of scripture raises an interesting question.If God is as anti-gay as He is alleged to be, why does He include in scripture, this LONG story, chapter after chapter, detailing the loving, intimate, committed partnership of Jonathan and David?  http://www.gaychristian101.com/David-and-Jonathan.html  There is more in the Bible about the Jonathan and David partnership than about the creation of the universe.Scripture vividly contrasts the loving, committed partnership of Jonathan and David with the failed marriage of David and Princess Michal and with the violent, murderous relationship between King Saul, David and Jonathan. Saul tried to kill both David and Jonathan.Certainly you are correct that two men can have an intimate friendship without being sexual. Yet that assertion does not in any way support the contention that Jonathan and David were no more than close friends.Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/David-Loved-Jonathan.html
