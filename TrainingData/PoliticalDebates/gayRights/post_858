It is unclear to me your intentions for citing the love between Jonathan and David.  I've read these interactions many times in many translations and I've yet to see anything that displays a committed homosexual relationship.  I can see how it is easily misunderstood.  Differentiating between philia and eros is critical.  I see philia quite readily throughout the   bible   betwee two men or two   women  , I have yet to see eros between two men celebrated in the bible.
