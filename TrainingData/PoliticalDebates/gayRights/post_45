#originalTopic=Debate:_Homosexuals_in_the_US_military
US troops are professional enough to tolerate gay peers. The argument that the presence of gay troops will undermine morale and unit cohesion is premised on the idea that US troops are unable to handle their emotions and maintain their professional focus in the presence of gay peers. This is an insult to the professionalism of US soldiers. They can easily maintain their mission focus and strong morale in the presence of homosexuals. And, any troop that cannot do so is simply not living up to the standards of the US military. Their poor performance as such should not be a factor in driving military policy against gays.
