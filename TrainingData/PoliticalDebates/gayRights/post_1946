Roman Catholics still don't eat meat on Fridays, with the exception of fish1) Actually, my entire family is Roman Catholic, a decent portion of my friends are Roman Catholic, and I have heard the priest at my Church explain multiple times the rules regarding eating meat on fridays (I guess I forgot to mention that I go to a Roman Catholic Church every Sunday). The rules are: it's okay to eat meat on fridays (except lent) however, if you do choose to eat meat you should give something else up.So in short: you're wrong.2) First: It doesn't go against nature because it can be found prevalently in nature. Allow me to give you some examples of animals that have observed homosexual tendencies in their population:African BuffaloAfrican ElephantAgile WallabyAmazon River Dolphin(Boto)American BisonAntelopeAsian ElephantAsiatic LionAsiatic MouflonAtlantic Spotted DolphinAustralian Sea LionBarasinghaBarbary SheepBelugaBharalBighorn SheepBlack BearBlackbuckBlack-footed Rock WallabyBlack-tailed DeerBonnet MacaqueBonoboBottlenose DolphinBowhead WhaleBrazilian Guinea PigBridled DolphinBrown BearBrown CapuchinBrown Long-eared BatBrown RatBuffaloCaribouCat (domestic)Cattle (domestic)CheetahCollared PeccaryCommerson's DolphinCommon Brushtail PossumCommon ChimpanzeeCommon DolphinCommon MarmosetCommon PipistrelleCommon RaccoonCommon Tree ShrewCotton-top TamarinCrab-eating MacaqueCrested Black MacaqueCuiDall's SheepDaubenton's BatDog (domestic)Doria's Tree KangarooDugongDwarf CavyDwarf MongooseEastern Cottontail RabbitEastern Grey KangarooElkEuro (a subspecies of wallaroo)European BisonFallow DeerFalse Killer WhaleFat-tailed DunnartFin WhaleFoxGazelleGelada BaboonGiraffeGoat (Domestic)Golden MonkeyGorillaGrant's GazelleGrey-headed Flying FoxGrey SealGrey squirrelGrey WhaleGrey WolfGrizzly BearGuinea Pig (Domestic)Hamadryas BaboonHamster (Domestic)Hanuman LangurHarbor PorpoiseHarbor SealHimalayan TahrHoary MarmotHorse (domestic)HumanIndian Fruit BatIndian MuntjacIndian RhinocerosJapanese MacaqueJavelinaKangaroo RatKiller WhaleKoalaKobLarga SealLeast ChipmunkLechweLesser BushbabyLionLion-tailed MacaqueLion TamarinLittle Brown BatLivingstone's Fruit BatLong-eared HedgehogLong-footed Tree ShrewMacaqueMarkhorMartenMatschie's Tree KangarooMocoMohol GalagoMoor MacaqueMooseMountain GoatMountain Tree ShrewMountain ZebraMouse (domestic)Moustached TamarinMule DeerMusk-oxNatterer's BatNew Zealand Sea LionNilgiri LangurNoctuleNorth American PorcupineNorthern Elephant SealNorthern Fur SealNorthern QuollOlympic MarmotOrangutanOrcaPacific Striped DolphinPatas MonkeyPere David's DeerPig (Domestic)Pig-tailed MacaquePlains ZebraPolar BearPretty-faced WallabyProboscis MonkeyPronghornPrzewalski's HorsePukuQuokkaRabbitRaccoon DogRed DeerRed FoxRed KangarooRed-necked WallabyRed SquirrelReeves's MuntjacReindeerRhesus MacaqueRight WhaleRock CavyRodrigues Fruit BatRoe DeerRufous BettongRufous-naped TamarinRufous Rat KangarooSaddle-back TamarinSavanna BaboonSea OtterSerotine BatSheep (Domestic)SiamangSika DeerSlender Tree ShrewSooty MangabeySperm WhaleSpinifex Hopping MouseSpinner DolphinSpotted HyenaSpotted SealSquirrel MonkeyStriped DolphinStuart's Marsupial MouseStumptail MacaqueSwamp DeerSwamp WallabyTakhiTalapoinTammar WallabyTasmanian DevilTasmanian Rat KangarooThinhorn SheepThomson's GazelleTigerTonkean MacaqueTucuxiUrialVampire BatVerreaux's SifakaVervetVicunaWalrusWapitiWarthogWaterbuckWater BuffaloWeeper CapuchinWestern Grey KangarooWest Indian ManateeWhiptail WallabyWhite-faced CapuchinWhite-fronted CapuchinWhite-handed GibbonWhite-lipped PeccaryWhite-tailed DeerWild CavyWild GoatWisentYellow-footed Rock WallabyYellow-toothed CavyAnd that is just the mammals! I could go on about birds, fish, reptiles and all sorts of different other kinds of animals, but I think you get my point. If God did create the world, then clearly he is a fan of homosexuality.Next: Just because a large group of people think something, doesn't make it right. Are you a puppet? Can you not think for yourself? If everyone thought that snowflakes were god's dandruff would that make it right? In fact a large majority of the earth's population thought that the earth was flat, and the majority of the U.S. thought slavery was alright and used Bible verses to support their position.If all your going to argue is: well most of these religions think this so it must be right, then I don't see the point in continuing. Your argument isn't valid. You also never tell me how, specifically it hurts society. They're not forcing those people who think it's immoral to be homosexual, or even to condone homosexuality. Homosexuals are merely looking for their own rights.3) Thanks for providing proof that you are using multiple accounts.
