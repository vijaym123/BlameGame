it is simpleWhy do people have to complicate gender?I sincerely think it is a mental illness- some form of defect in the brain which makes people truly believe they are the opposite of what they are...maybe they can be given hormones or mental   medication   one day to make them feel their true gender- what they were born with.Gay is a lifestyle choice for most who are twisted or immoral -then their may be others who have some mental- chromosome issues not yet discovered.If their is a gay gene- that doesn't mean it's good--- for instance there is a   cancer   gene.....that is not good either
