I do agree with you regarding the Founding Fathers   treatment   of slavery and American Indians in the Constitution. Many of our Founding Fathers were opposed and relunctantly accepted its inclusion to keep the framework going. As abhorrent as slavery is, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutional duty in the Dred Scot decision -- the court interpreted the law at that time. It did not make new law, an unconstitutional action that the Burger Court assumed. When American   society   finally realized the evils of slavery, the Constitution was amended, as outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution.Homosexualty being a choice is not irrelevant to this discussion. It actually goes to the heart of the matter. Civil rights were denied to African-Americans simply because of their skin color, something they could not change. Homosexuals are commandeering the African-American struggle for   civil rights   as their cause. Homosexuals are claiming that they're born   homosexual  , and thus cannot change. That's the red herring in this debate.My experience is no more valuable than anyone else's, but I use it to back up my side of the debate. Personal appeals enact more laws that you're giving credit for. That's why we have such laws as "Meghan's Law" and the current mortgage   bailout  . Our government didn't want to see people losing their homes, even though those people weren't responsible enough with their own   money   to buy homes they could afford. Whenever someone testifies before Congress in support of or in opposition to proposed legislation, they are making personal appeals in relating their positions.And when the government steps in and requires me to become a   vegetarian   like you, will you stand with me in opposition to that intrusion?
