I feel a lot of sarcasm coming on but I'll hold it in check... Look up those three types of people on the Internet (i.e. Serial Killers, Pedophiles and Rapists). You'll see that there are claims of DNA, Psychological Studies, Historical Evidence, etc. for all of them. So if the argument is "I was born that way" works for the Gay Community then it works for Serial Killers, Pedophiles and Rapists.Just as I believe Serial Killers, Pedophiles and Rapists are not born that way, I also believe people are not born Gay. The two driving factors are   environment   and choice.
