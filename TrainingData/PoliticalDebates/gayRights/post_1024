Oftentimes when discussing the issue of homosexuality, a religious argument is brought up.  Basically saying that homosexuality is a sin and is condemned by the bible.  Certainly, if you hold these beliefs you are fully within your right to express them and to practice them.  I am not here to argue whether or not the bible does indeed condemn homosexuality.  However, even if the bible does condemn sexuality I don't see the connection between that and laws allowing same-sex marriage.  Since when has our country been governed by religion.  Our government MUST be seperate from religion.  Whatever you think about homosexuality is your belief and can not be forced upon others.  Laws that outlaw same-sex marriage are doing just that and in turn violating the very freedom that this country loves so dearly.P.S Also, I believe families and marriage can function without procreation.  There are many mna-woman couples who don't have children for any number of reasons.  Whether they are sterile or just can't afford children or simply are happy without children, I don't think they are doing anything wrong and wonder if you would be for outlawing these marriages with your argument that, "people who are married should have a family and reproduce."
