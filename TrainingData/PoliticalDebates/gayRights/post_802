The Bible is clear and God did destroy Sodom and Gomahara over the "unnatural" sin of that city. Winning this argument on a website changes nothing. The final word is with the creator - (blah, blah) aetheist, no   god  , yeah right. Let's see whose right when you die. Not the time to discover you were wrong. Again, another warning that you are and will be judged. The clock is ticking... tick, tock, tick, tock... I hear the closet calling.Now that's funny..... :)
