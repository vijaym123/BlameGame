If you believe in God, and what the Bible says, then you have to recognize that God clearly states that   homosexuality   is a sin. He says in Leviticus 18:22: "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination." And in Leviticus 20:13: "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act[.]" And the Apostle Paul wrote in Corinthians 6:9-10: "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."Though Jesus does not directly address the issue of homosexuality in the New Testament, He does speak about sexual immorality in Mark chapter 7 when He says, "What comes out of you is what defiles you. For from within, out of your hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft,   murder  , adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile you."it is clearly spelled out that in the eyes of God, it is a sin. It's in both the New and Old Testaments. I don't see how you can be a Baptist minister and deny this?
