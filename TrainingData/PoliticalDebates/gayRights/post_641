Your comment about not being born gay is interesting. But I don't think we can extrapolate from your experience and the experience of a few gay men you've talked to  that no one is born gay.Jesus, contrary to what many people allege, did address homosexuality. The text is Matthew 19:3-12. Jesus says there are three groups of men who CANNOT receive His teaching about Adam and Eve stle marriage.The first group Jesus mentions is born eunuchs. The term eunuch was sometimes used to describe what today we would refer to as gay or homosexual.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html    I think it is a mistake to assume that gay men are generally the same in their views, beliefs or actions - envious of other men who possess attributes they feel they lack or that gay men are generally effeminate and somehow not real men.Some gay men do exhibit feminine characteristics but then, so do some heterosexual men. And some gay men are as macho as any heterosexual male.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Gay-Centurion.html
