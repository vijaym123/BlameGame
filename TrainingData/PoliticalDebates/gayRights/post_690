I don't see anywhere in my comment where I said I haven't sinned, if that's what you mean.  But an interesting side point is  that I "don't" eat shellfish, but for other reasons.  If you're trying to say that the old testiment is mute, that fails, as I believe the 10 commandments are in there? Something about not murdering and the like...I think that would still be in effect.
