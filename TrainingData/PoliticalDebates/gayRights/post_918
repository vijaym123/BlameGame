I work as a volunteer at Catholic Adoption Services.  They have not been fined, their operations have not been challenged, and the courts specific ally stated in their decision that no religious organization could be required to act against the mandates of their faith.  Of course, if they refuse to allow otherwise qualified same sex couples to be represented, they may lose their tax exzempt status, but that would require another court ruling.  Please make sure the blogs you go to are reporting factually before you quote them.
