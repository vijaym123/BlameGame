Good points, Christine.   I think people usually narrow their focus on only what affects them the most.  It's a fact of human psychology that people most often condemn the things in themselves that they find most hard to accept.  Most homophobic people are either fearful of some of the feelings of affection for the same gender, which upsets or confuses them, or they're closeted and can't face it.  So they find whatever they can, wherever they can, to somehow counter the confusion.  Literature like the Bible gives people ample material to quote in order to deal with their own problems.  They are attacking what they dislike the most in themselves, and looking for the best ammunition they can find.Of course, every time I say this to a homophobe, they get outraged and defensive...which is also explained in basic psychology texts.  That's why you'll never win an argument with a religious fundamentalist about a subject like this...not until they accept themselves and their feelings.  I have to admit that although I find their views offensive, I do feel sorry for the conflict that goes on inside them.
