The context is important, I am not denying that, but we must ask ourselves what is actually condemned.  The Leviticul condemnation is not of prostitution, although the Scripture also condemns that activity both in the context of idolatrous worship and street prostitution, but of any sexual actions between two people of the same sex.  It is an abomination because it flies in the face of God's intention for sexuality.  As previously stated this command is given in a list of commandments that condemn other sexual perversities, that distort the original intended in the sexual gift.
