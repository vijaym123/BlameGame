I don't disagree with your argument that All things being equal the children are better off with a loving mom and dad.  But all things are never equal.  Many children do not grow up with a LOVING mom and dad, even when the family starts with a mom and dad.  Often children are born out of wed-lock and only have a mom, or the dad leaves, dies, is jailed, etc., etc.  What about these situations?So if two people of the same sex are in love and want to start a family who are you to say that they will not make good, loving parents?  Would the child have been better off with both a mom and dad.  Maybe?  Does it matter?  No.
