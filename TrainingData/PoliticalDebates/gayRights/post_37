"Don't ask don't tell" is exploited by troops to avoid combat. Lou Chibbaro. "Out gay soldiers sent to Iraq. Regulation keeps straights from ‘playing gay’ to avoid war." Washington Blade. Sep 23, 2005 - "[regulations have had to be created that are aimed] at preventing Reservists and National Guard members from using their sexual orientation — or from pretending to be gay — to escape combat. 'The bottom line is some people are using sexual orientation to avoid deployment,' [civilian spokeswomen for the U.S. Army Forces Command Kim] Waldron said. 'So in this case, with the Reserve and Guard forces, if a soldier ‘tells,’ they still have to go to war and the homosexual issue is postponed until they return to the U.S. and the unit is demobilized.'" While regulations have been created to combat this use of "don't ask don't tell" to avoid combat, getting rid of "don't ask don't tell" would eliminate this perverse use of the policy and the need for any such regulations.
