RE: "the Wainright one -does- have forty-four participants"These so called "studies", as described, amount to polls. Split into two groups, your margin of error is on the order of plus or minus 25% for each group. In other words, comparing the two groups would involve potential errors of close to 50%. It's not a study that can be taken seriously, or cited with any credibility.A serious study would involve several thousand participants, which would give you a margin of error in the 3% range, with a level of confidence around 95%. I'd also argue that you'd want your participants to be more in the 25 to 40 age range, rather than teenagers. At that age, they'd have more perspective, be less succeptable to slanted surveys, and have more life experience to draw from.Of course, propagandists don't do serious studies.
