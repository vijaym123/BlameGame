You are equivocating.  You are talking about the potential of performing an act and then switching usage of the word "homosexual" to mean being attracted to people of the same sex.  This is not your only flaw though it is an obvious and fatal flaw...Just to help you out a bit these are the three definitions of sexuality. (1) Sexuality as it pertains to reproduction(2) Sexuality as it pertains to gender(3) Sexuality as it pertains to attractionBut none of this matters, in order to have an argument you must have evidence, I guess you just admitted you did not pose an argument.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.
