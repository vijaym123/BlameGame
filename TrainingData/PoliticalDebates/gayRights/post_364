For sure I would say that no one is born homosexual or heterosexual.  We are all born as human beings and our lives are the keys to understanding what makes a person enjoy the features of the same sex.Maybe a boy was molested by a woman and grows up fearing them and only accepting the comfort of other men.  Maybe a girl has a bad experience with dating boys and likes the comfort of women.  Maybe the   media   we grow up with is a greater factor in whether a child grows to like their own sex as opposed to the "natural" liking of the opposite sex.  It could be that   homosexuality   first arose from the will to go against social rule or perhaps it had to do more with convenience.In any case, there is no evidence that when a baby is born it will prefer one sex over another.  Just because a child learns "mom" first doesn't mean it will prefer the features of a woman (physical and emotional).Is being gay wrong or immoral?  Hell no, it's a perfectly acceptable choice because there is no force in the universe that can prove that is is wrong.  Have i issued any facts in this comment?  No, but I feel that common sense should be a prevailing factor in an issue that can not and has not been scientifically supported (sorry religious people).This all being said, I am a straight man with gay friends.
