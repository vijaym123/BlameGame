Absolutely. Of course, being both logical and very religious, nearly every single thing any human has done since the “fall into sin” is a sin. That being said along with the common faith that ultimately there is only one punishment for all unrepentant sin, it should not be regarded as such a touchstone issue. Or at least anymore so than murder or swearing. They are all sins against God, they were already forgiven before they even happened; all you have to do is accept that faith. Why do we treat it differently? Because it involves a sexual act?As human beings we have a tendency to try to categorize things and assign value to actions that don't require it. That is not the way sin works. Homosexuality is essentially the same sin as lusting after someone you pass on the street.I do have to say it's a sin, but only because as humans every thing we do could be considered a sin.
