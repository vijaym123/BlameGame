so what about sodom and gomorrah? Did God burn down that homosexual city because he had a sudden urge to be an arsonist? Really, now. In the plainest terms, sin is defined by God, God burned down a city full of homosexuals (in other words, he doesn't like it), THEREFORE homosexuality is a sin. As defined by God. As defined by the Bible.
