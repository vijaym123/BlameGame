Reproduction is not what defines marriage. If it were, not only would infertility disqualify a person from marrying (as discussed above), but so would the intent to use birth control of any kind.  Furthermore, taken to its logical conclusion, the position that reproduction defines marriage implies that the only legitimate reason for marrying is reproduction.  Wanna have sex?  Just do it.  There's no need to marry so long as you protect against pregnancy.  But proponents of reproduction-is-marriage are most likely unwilling to accept this logical consequence of their argument since they are probably also proponents of sexual abstinence outside of marriage.
