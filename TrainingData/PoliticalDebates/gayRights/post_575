To put this into a little more perspective: we study fruit flies for insights into human   autism  , and we have made breakthroughs through them. If the study had shown that some genes make some fruit flies kind of sort of showing a slight change in orientation at certain times in the day, no, this would not have any meaning. It doesn't. It shows a hardwired single gene. Of course it doesn't work exactly the same way; we don't lay eggs, for one, and we likely have a few recessive genes that activate or not depending on the environment instead of one specific gene. (Research points to there being a couple different ones, anyway, since genetic causes of male homosexuality already seem different from female.)If you're asking if this is the gene that controls detecting masculinity or femininity, and which one the fly is attracted to, that's the same thing in different words. And, again, it shows a lead.
