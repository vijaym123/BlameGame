I've been in these discussion before, and a common refrain from the anti-same sex parents contingent is to say tha children with same-sex parents are subject to teasing and discrimination that leaves them emotionally damaged. If this is true, and it seems reasonable, the solution is not to condemn same-sex households, but to stop discriminating. If same-sex parents were given equal societal and legal status as heterosexual parents, many of the challeneges children of same-sex parents face would disappear.
