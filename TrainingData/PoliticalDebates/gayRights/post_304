Wow, those are some bold "statistics" you've presented.  Any chance you can link us to the documentation that shows the percentage of homosexuals amongst circumcised males, sexually abused children and lower class income people?  My first reaction is that is totally bogus information, so if you can back that up with some actually scientific research, that would be helpful.If I made some assumptions from what you've said, then most (over 50%?) of men in America must be homosexuals, because most males born in the US are circumsized.  One could also assume that blacks make up a large percentage of lower income families, so most blacks are homosexual.  So the odds of a black man being heterosexual in America, must be pretty slim!!  But then, as we recently saw in California, most blacks voted for prop 8, so I'm guessing most blacks aren't homosexual, and it's just my guess, but I'd think most American men are also heterosexual.There have been some scientific studies that are finding some evidence of genetic predisposition, but they are not conclusive either.  It wont surprise me a bit if in 10-20 years they've found more evidence.BUT I whole heartedly agree with your last paragraph, that you can't change a person's orientation once established.
