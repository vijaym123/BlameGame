1.) Tamara only included a small quote from the Bible. The majority of her input was comprised of interpretation [albeit from her, you, or any minister] of this--and likely other--pieces of scripture. She stated her accordance with a common intrepretation of God's word. There are a great deal of interpretations of scripture, and unfortunately there is not much one can do to clear up misinterpretations considering that all the interpretations are based off of the same text.2.) You cannot use people or the Earth as evidence in support of God if the question at hand is whether or not God created us and the Earth. It may be true [or equally likely false] that God created us and our surroundings, but said evidence is not valid support. Who knows if God created the universe or not... we can never prove such metaphysical conjectures.3.) God may or may not be around [a question I often ask myself], but the Bible was still written by people. Wonderful lessons and words of wisdom, but it's still just a book. God is above and beyond such earthly, material things.
