Call it bisexual or call it moving on from   homosexuality  .  That is why I said sex is plastic.  I will check up on Bonobo social bonding etc... but if the core data is from other primate studies....I really doubt it then, but I should not be bias until I see it.    Of course, not all physiological/morphological expressions can be attributed to one gene (1:1)--there are secondary, tertiary etc... levels of gene interactions and not to forget the myriad levels of hormones/steroids (endocrine/exocrine).My concern is to come across, with   science  , that there is no more room for argument and discussion, because science has not provided the proof in the pudding either way on this issue.  Not that you have done this yest, just my general concern.  Science can and is shedding light but there is a large difference between normative and descriptive.  Humans cannot live on science alone (normative) but must hold on to all the arts (which also reveal/has truth).
