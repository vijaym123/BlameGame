>>17 yo boy being thrown from a train because he refused to be rapedFirst of all, being gay is neither a mental disorder (since DSM-III) nor correlated with rape  (or pedophilia for that matter - the majority of pedophiles are straight).>>It’s become a hammer to force the acceptance and normalization of   homosexuality   on everyone.This comment pinpoints the crucial importance of the entire discussion of 'nature/nurture/choice'.   If being queer is perceived to be a mental disorder OR something the gay person 'chooses' to be, or could go to therapy to change, then it would be socially acceptable to stigmatize, punish, and generally discriminate against gay people.    If being queer is innate (just like being left handed), then it doesn't make sense to punish or discriminate against gay people any more than it does to discriminate against left handed people, or ANY minority group (and everyone is a member of some minority group or the other).Why is it so hard for Hope7 to accept as normal anyone who is different from themselves?   I have always been mystified by the extreme emotion, even violence, engendered in certain people against homosexuals.   It is what we call 'out of proportion'.   I am not offended by heterosexual people, even when I see them kiss on screen, or in R-rated movies make out.   I don't even get squeamish when I see them hold hands.   Do heterosexuals have more fragile sexual identities that cannot tolerate differences?Live and let live is the only way to get along in a world with too much hatred and bigotry.
