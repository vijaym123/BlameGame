 Biblical passages that are claimed by anti-gay believers to condemn homosexuality are being misinterpreted by these groups The Bible does not actually give any mention to homosexuality as a whole, but only homosexual acts. It does condemn certain specific homosexual acts, but in a context that does not clearly indicate a condemnation of homosexuality. For example, the Sodomites were condemned to death by God before sodomy was performed. The act of sodomy in that specific, inappropriate context was condemned, but should not be misinterpreted as the cause of the ultimate condemnation of the Sodomites.
