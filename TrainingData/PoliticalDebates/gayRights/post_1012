No matter how one looks at this question, the responses all come down to a clash of moral and religious viewpoints, or lack thereof. True, separation of church and state is said to be in effect, but has religion ever been truly separate from government? I don't think it has, or is even possible honestly, because people will always bring their religious and non-religious and ethical ideas to the table on highly controversial issues such as this one. And if they did not, we would truly live in a country that is even more closed minded and one-dimensional than many may claim it to be. If people truly kept their religious beliefs out of it, then we would be living under a much more stifling government, not a more open and tolerant one.
