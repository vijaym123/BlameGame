I see "verified" expert listed for the Exodus commentator.  In what way, shape or form is this person "verified?"  As a religious commentator, maybe, but as a sexuality expert?  Please.  It's more drivel from the repugnant religious right.Perhaps you should consider that God put gay people on this earth to teach you people a lesson in acceptance.  You're failing miserably on that.And, tell us EXACTLY what Jesus said about homosexuality?  Oh, that's right, not one word.Quit citing verses from Leviticus unless you're prepared to admonish all the other topics that qualifies as sin from the Old Testament.  You shouldn't talk the talk, as you can't walk the walk.Finally, sexual orientation is set at birth or in utero.  No, the gay gene hasn't been discovered, but they have discovered the transexual gene.    http://www.365gay.com/news/scientists-claim-to-find-transsexuality-gene  /Too bad it didn't make into the main-stream right-wing media.  It's only time before the gay gene is discovered.  Sadly, you and your ilk will never believe it, much like you try to discredit   evolution   as "only a theory."
