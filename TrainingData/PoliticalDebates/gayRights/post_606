The Bible is fine with slavery. It only says how much you are allowed to beat your slaves; not that slavery is wrong, or that maybe your shouldn't beat them at all.  It even says it is OK to sell your daughter into slavery.  I'm not aware of any sect of Christians who don't deny that particular teaching.  It also demands that a virgin marry her rapist in order to be made pure.  Yes, I will continue to deny the Bible and its "teachings".  I don't get my sense of morality from bronze-age shepherds who thought genocide, slavery, and treating women as property was peachy.    http://www.godisimaginary.com  /
