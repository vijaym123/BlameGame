I apologize for being blissfully unaware of who you are referring to in the first section of your reply, it certainly doesn't apply to Tamara, I hope, unless you know something I don't.  I KNOW it doesn't apply to me........and if you are trying to apply it to God, well, I don't see how any of it applies to Him...or, were you even replying to what I said?  I'm just a little confused.....I mean I guess when you got out your dictionary/thesaurus to look up those words, I suppose that you may have gotten a few definitions and meanings distorted but........I don't know....please explain?If you want me to discuss the validity of the Bible, all you need do is ask; if you need proof of a deity (God) the proof is all around you, all you need do is open your mind and consider the proof and the facts.  But if that doesn't work, you can still ask about that too.I had a chemistry teacher who had a brain tumor, miraculously, she lived.  However she did indeed lose part of her brain from that process, because of that I don't really appreciate that comment......and yes it does...to think otherwise would be.....well.....kind of stupid....
