Let's do some simple math. 5 million divided by 300 million = 1.6%.Obviously 1.6% is not even close to the percentage of homosexuals that exist in animal populations, and more than likely human populations (I don't know what percentage of people are gay). So, to answer your question, no, that's not supposed to happen.
