In short, yes, it's just your friends.  I know several monogamous homosexuals, and I am an extremely monogamous bisexual (supposedly they don't exist, yet here I am!).  While it may be true that as a population, homosexuals are more promiscuous (and I will not concede that point without current data), that was not the question.  The question is: "Is Homosexuality a Sin?"  If I answer no, does that automatically mean that doing meth is not a sin, because some gay people do meth?  Of course not.  It's a different question entirely.  For what it's worth, I don't believe any of these things are sin, because I'm an atheist.  Some things are just wrong.  Being who you are is not one of them, unless who you are is a serial killer, etc.
