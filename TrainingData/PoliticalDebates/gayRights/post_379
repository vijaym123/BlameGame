If   homosexuality   is not a moral issue, it's not an issue at all.  (except for the disgusting factor, but lots of things are disgusting).  Science doesn't show any of the things you claim, and "really, really, likely or pretty strong", aren't exactly good examples of scientific data.  History does not show us homosexuality was "fairly normal", it shows it was around, but it wasn't considered "normal".  Back up your "  science  " with something other than "really, really, likely" studies, and maybe you could come up with a competant point, but until then, No.
