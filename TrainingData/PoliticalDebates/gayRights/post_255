You think things have changed significantly since 2004?  Studies take time to compile.  Do you actually believe that an entire body of data spreading over the course of the last 30-40 years could show that   children   of same-gender parents are healthy, well-adjusted, and not at a disadvantage as compared with their opposite-gender-parented peers, but then somehow something would happen in the last 5 years which would turn all that on its ear?  Sure, whatever.  If you can produce a study in the last five years which demonstrates that the last 30-40 years' worth of studies are wrong, please link it right up and I'll be happy to have a look.
