Seems to me that the bible has a few verses that support homosexual relationships:In Samuel 20:41, Jonathan and David kiss each other. When Jonathan dies in battle, David conveys his love for Jonathan when he says, in 2 Samuel 1:26: ÒI grieve for you, Jonathan my brother! Most dear have you been to me; your love more wonderful to me surpassing the love of women.Ó (copied/pasted from an article by Irene Morgan)Does it boil down to how one interprets the book?It seems to me God deliberately made homosexuality; perhaps as a way to teach people love and acceptance for all.  It's too bad the vast majority of "christians" are failing badly, and most seem to want to "judge not lest thee be judged."  Shame on the bigots.
