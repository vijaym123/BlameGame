While this was true in the 80's it is no longer true. Homosexual groups disavowed NAMBLA over a decade ago and The Last Undercover, while true is equally dated. The problem with your logic is that just as allowing gays to be foster parents but not adopt doesn't really protect   children  , there is no practical difference between civil union and   gay marriage  . Just as there is are a few bad apples in any group, gays have there share. Allowing gay marriage would further marginalize those few bad examples.
