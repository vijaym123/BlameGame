I think you misunderstood the list. It is a list of animals in which portions of the population exhibit homosexual behavior. The percentages vary widely, and usually there are sections of the population that are also bisexual, in addition to those sections who appear to be exclusively homosexual.In all of these populations, there are obviously significant sections (usually the majority) of the population which are heterosexual, because, as you said, they couldn't survive as a species otherwise.
