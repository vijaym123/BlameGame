under the new covenant.......... 1thess 5:21 test everything, keep the good. how can we test the law if we are still under it and have a canonical relation to it as in deut 28as believers our test is as specified in 1john1 "that which have heard, which we have looked at, which we have seen with our eyes, and our hands have touched."it is a test of witness thru fellowship of the holy spirit, thru the one who lives in each believer(the triune god)of walking in the light.it is a witness to test where the spirit of christ(god) rests. because wherever the spirit of god rests that is what is approved by god.the witness of believers is that believing homosexual lives and  marriages are filled by the fruit of the spirit in the same way as believing heterosexual marriages.jesus said "you will recognize them by their fruit" fruit being the fruit of the spirit because it is of the  fruit of the spirit that we lay up treasures in heaven..............these are the things that last.about all this energy about moral law . in romans paul said we are no longer under the law but grace. paul in romans says that under the new covenant we are now led and serve of the spirit. that we are callled  to a higher standard of fulfilling the law(love) rather than following it. because now our conviction about sin is from our heart with the one who lives in us, rather than thru a set of laws about controling are outward physical lives. the law is now for making us conscious of sin..........conscious of loving our neighbor as ourselves.................. the summation of all the law. but it is the spirit that convicts our hearts about our sin.the conviction is thru godly sorrow in our hearts, and it  is without regret.(2cor7:7-10)if king david had loved his neighbor as himself( under the new covenant the 2nd commandment is the summation of all the law(romans)) he would never have stepped into what he did with bathsheba.
