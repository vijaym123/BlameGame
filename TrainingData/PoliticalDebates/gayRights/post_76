#originalTopic=Debate:_Homosexuals_in_the_US_military
"Don't ask don't tell" is a necessary compromise in a divided country. "Don't ask don't tell" was crafted in the early 90s, when the country and the military were deeply divided as to whether gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military. The country remains deeply divided on this question. "Don't ask don't tell" strikes an appropriate compromise in this divided environment, avoiding overt approval of homosexuality in the military, while accommodating it.
