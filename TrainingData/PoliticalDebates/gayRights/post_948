Your right-  gay marriage   is a goal for us and everyone that believes in the American ideal of equal rights and celebrating our great diversity!But, obviously, we deserve and expect more until one day we will be equal to our straight friends and truly be free!  You obviously, share the views of the extreme right who has over the years, targeted groups they vehemently opposed!  They took the lead in the 50's and 60's to oppose civil rights for African   Americans  , and when they lost that fight, they moved on and took on those who believed a woman has a right to choose an   abortion   or not. They did everything they could including murdering   doctors   who performed that service as well as demonstrating unlawfully at Planned Parenthood offices and showing unbelievable hatred!  They lost that battle, since every   poll   shows majority of the people support abortion rights including those in Congress.  Now they are taking on gays and lesbians and our supporters!  Of course, they are using the same nasty tactics to gain support and   media   attention to get their message across! You people used to assert years ago that we had "a hidden gay agenda" that included corrupting the   children   in our   schools  !  Well that has been so thoroughly discredited by the vast majority of the American people now that it is brought now-except you!One last thing about gay equality my bigoted friend-we are making headway in all parts of the country now although it has not been as fast as I'd wish.  Hopefully, the Congress will finally   vote   in support of ENDA-Employment Non-Discrimination Act which will be a major milestone in the long journey towards equality.  We have the votes now in Congress to pass major areas of concern for our positions!  Thank God we have Obama and a liberal leaning Democratic Congress!
