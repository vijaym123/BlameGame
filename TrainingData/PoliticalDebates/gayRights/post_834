In attempting to buttress your argument I believe you vastly overreach when you state:>>>>"I submit, because at *least at that time*, the writers of scripture quite probably saw any same-sex sexual union *only in that context*, and couldn't conceive of it outside of an idolatrous, cultic context."<<<<Yet as  noted above, NO human author of scripture links the sinful activities of Genesis 19 - Sodom and the sinful activities of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 with committed faithful non-cultic same sex partnerships.Your assertion that the writers of scripture saw ANY same sex union in the context of idolatry is an opinion, not necessarily an historical fact. The fact is, Jewish rabbis before, during and after the time of Christ, did discuss lesbianism and determined that lesbians are not included in the Levitical prohibitions.Your next assertion is more opinion, masquerading as fact.>>>>"Hence, Paul argues in this very passage that idolatry, in his mind, *leads* to this kind of "vile affection"."<<<<That is your opinion of Paul's argument. In point of fact, Paul's argument is focused on the consequences of idolatry, not an alleged condemnation of gay men and lesbians in Romans 1:26-27.Paul's argument posits idolatrous same sex activity - worship of the fertility goddess - as the result of idolatry.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html  To read Paul's words as a condemnation of faithful committed non-cultic same sex partnerships is an egregious mis-reading of the scriptures. It assumes "facts" not in evidence and reads into scripture what scripture manifestly does not say.Aristides, preaching and writing within 70 years of 58 A.D., (when Paul wrote Romans), understood Paul's words to refer to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, writing within 100 years of Paul, understood Paul to be speaking of shrine prostitution.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html  You seem to be asserting that: >>>>"Paul (not God, mind you, but Paul)"<<<< is the ultimate writer of Romans, a popular but unsubstantiated opinion in our post-Christian age.I disagree with what I understand you to be saying, since I strongly believe in the God-breathed purity, verbal inspiration, absolute authority, infallibility and inerrancy of scripture.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Scripture.html  >>>>"I really think the reason why your argument is not convincing to many is because it overreaches and flies in the face of a simple reading of the text"<<<<A text without a context is a pretext for teaching something that is not true.The overreaching is almost entirely on the side of those who refuse to factor in the context God and Moses addressed in Genesis 19, Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and Romans 1:26-27. In some cases they acknowledge the context and then insist (as you seem to be doing), that the Bible still condemns committed faithful non-cultic same sex partnerships in these passages DESPITE the context.Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/eDisciples.html
