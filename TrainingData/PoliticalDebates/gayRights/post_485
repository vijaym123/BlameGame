if a man has what ever it takes to make them more attracted to men, they are simply going to find more persons that they look at being men, strike up more amorous conversations with men.  perhaps the "less gay" they are they increase the number of women they might date.  but we do know that many persons who are self declared as gay have dated women.  the lessons we learn from them was that they chose to be with women due to standards and expectations but that they only addmit they are gay, to themselves and perhaps others.  they readily report how the shape of a man, his scent and more were always tugging at them without permission.  I am gay and have never sought the company of a woman sexually, I have had opportunity and a flexible mind.  I have fallen in love with a girl as young adult and experiment you might say with kissing.  while i reveled in the intimacy of our kisses as an expression of loving her, I never got aroused by her scent, form or the mere thought of pleasure.  It is like how I will each a brussel sprout to force myself to a better diet but have never taken pleasure in it,  and don't get me started on beets.  I have such an adversion to everything I have experienced from them that I litterally cannot comprehend the words being used to describe them when people who like them as delicious.  I was never scared by a beet, I just taste metal when I eat them, not the sweet I hear so much about.  I choose to not eat beets but it is because I dislike the taste.  since alot of people eat beets is something wrong with me?  only a moral judgement would say yes as it hurts no one that I don't.  infact there are more beets for you.  if we all wanted or needed beets there could be a problem of scarcity when beet crops failed.
