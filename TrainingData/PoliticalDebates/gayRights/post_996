...our kids that earth is 6,000 years old in school? Hey, you can't separate religion from politics, right? Of course, I feel sorry for anyone who believes that nonsense. By the way, I'm very deeply rooted in the Christian faith. I have a very strong faith in Christianity, but I do not force that faith on others and I let people live the way they see fit and love the people they want to love. Adultery is perfectly legal in this nation, as is lying, coveteousness, and not attending church, so your theory of the 10 Commandments being the basis for law is out the window. A majority of the founding fathers of this nation were actually non-Christians anyway (most of them were Deists). "God's standard" might be the best way, but we can't hold everyone to that standard, as such we would be oppressing minorities. To make everyone commit to Christian values against their will is truly disgusting, people just want to be free to live their lives.
