#originalTopic=Debate:_Homosexuals_in_the_US_military
Most members of the US military support ban on gays. Americans in the military are inclined to oppose gays serving openly in the military and support "don't ask don't tell". A 2006 opinion poll by the independent Military Times newspapers showed that only 30% of those surveyed think openly gay people should serve. 59% are opposed.[15]
