 Gays in the military undermine unit cohesion and morale The "Don't ask, don't tell" law (Federal law Pub.L. 103-160 [10 U.S.C. ¤ 654].) prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts' from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because it 'would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.'"[3]
