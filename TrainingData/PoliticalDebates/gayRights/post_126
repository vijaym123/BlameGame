 The quality of parenting should not be a factor in legalizing gay marriage, as it is not a legal factor in ordinary marriages  Many characteristics of individuals would lead one to believe that there is a high probability that they will be bad parents, but this cannot cause the state to ban these individuals from becoming married parents. Neither should it for gay couples.
