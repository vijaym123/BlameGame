You seem to forget that gays are not raised by other gays.  Most gay people grow up in a surrounding family and social structure made up primarily of straight individuals.  They are, like other children, rewarded for exhibiting "gender-appropriate" behaviors and conforming to expected norms for the majority-straight population with which they are surrounding.  Societal conformity would tend to make gay people straight, not the other way around.And yet, the majority of gay people report having been "different" from their earliest memories.  While some certainly conformed to gender norms, many, many did not.  Why do you think so many of us faced tremendous teasing and harassment from our peers?  Certainly not because we were "conforming" to the social group with which we were surrounded.
