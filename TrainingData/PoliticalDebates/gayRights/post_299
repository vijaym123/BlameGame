Just because my genitalia might be different from my child's does not mean I'm incapable of giving him or her guidance about sexual issues, feelings, experiences, fears or misunderstandings.  And if an issue comes up in which input from a person of the opposite gender seems necessary or important, there are other family members and trusted friends to turn to for additional help and guidance.  To declare this as a reason why same-gender parents are inadequate to parent children is simply ridiculous.  It's equivalent to claiming that a black child cannot be adequately parented by white parents because they will not be able to give the child guidance with regard to his/her race.  Good, loving parents meet challenges as they come up and use the resources available to them to care for their children.  Prejudice is what puts children at a disadvantage, not loving parents.
