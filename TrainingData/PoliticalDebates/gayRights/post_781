Dear quiet4no1:Reading into the text what Paul did not say (a universal prohibition of homosexuality) is called eisogesis - wrongly interpreting the text. That kind of faulty interpretation is unworthy of Christians who love the word of God.This Link will assist our mutual understanding of Romans 1.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Against-Nature.html   Paul's words to the Christian community in ancient Rome come from his knowledge of the first century world in which he lived. His carefully tailored argument against idolatry (not lesbianism and not homosexuality) in Romans 1 is set in the specific context of Gentile and Jewish history, complete with first century illustrations familiar to his first century readers.Paul’s readers were intimately acquainted, as we are not, with Greek, Jewish and Roman culture and the shrine prostitution which permeated those ancient cultures.Is it honest to deny the influence of fertility goddess cults which flourished in first century Rome?   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1-And-Homosexuality.html   Paul Talks About Gentile Idolatry In Romans 1, Not Homosexuals And Not Lesbians."For this cause [idolatry] God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet." - Romans 1:26-27Idolatry (not lesbianism and not homosexuality) is the hook that catches Gentiles and Jews and allows Paul to declare everyone guilty before a holy God, Romans 3:23.Idolatry, not homosexuality and not lesbianism, is the specific context of Paul's argument in Romans 1.Shrine prostitution is certainly how Paul's first century readers understood his words in Romans 1 and that is how we ought to understand Romans.Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Saved.html
