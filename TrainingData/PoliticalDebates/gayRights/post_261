In the previous argument the title states " Research Indicates Children Do Best When Raised By Married Mom & Dad." Yet this argument says that no reliable research indicates   children   in same sex homes do as well. Now clear something up for me. If there is "reliable" research to indicate an outcome in any comparison, there has to be reliable research based on the other end of that comparison. That means you can't say that   kids   do best with mom and dad and then say that there is no reliable research to the contrary. Either the first statement is made up, or the second is a lie. Lastly, how is this research performed? Who conducted it and what are the standards? None of this info is given. I, for one, was raised in a mom and dad household. And one that lived by Focus on the Family, none the less. However, I want to pull my hair out thinking about my upbringing. Going by textbook FOTF living, resulted in a pregnant teenage sister who got kicked out of high school, a gay brother, and me. I left the home at 16 and slept in my car at the park. My friend? Grew up with two dads. She excelled in school, is happily married to her   military   husband, and is well on her way to her Masters. Now tell me again. What are the standards?
