Yes I agree. I am an atheist, but according to the bible homosexuality is wrong in "God's" eyes. I mean if you want to be gay then go for it, it's your life and your decision, but if you are a homosexual and still believe in "God" the you are not living up to your religions standards. I have a Bi girlfriend and I love her with all that I have to offer but I care she is Bi and it saddens me because of her decision. But it is her life and her decision to be with other girls if she chooses, there is NO stopping it. You cannot control someone's life, no matter how hard you try.
