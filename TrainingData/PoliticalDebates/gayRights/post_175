I note that you make a dinstinction between "equivalency" and "disadvantage."  I am hard-pressed to see where "equivalent" parenting equals "disadvantaged."  The only disadvantage I see for children of same-gender parents has to do with outside prejudice, such as their parents not being able to protect them with full and equal civil rights because some folks very selfishly want to claim the word "marriage" as their own exclusive belonging.  This kind of prejudice is what disadvantages children of same-gender parents, not the genders of their parents.
