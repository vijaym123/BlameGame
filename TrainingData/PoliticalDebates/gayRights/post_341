Parents need to know that science does not validate the notion that homosexuality is inborn.  This is important as parents may be tasked with advising and managing a child who expresses homosexual tendencies.  The American College of Pediatricians encourages parents to be involved in their child's life and to know that "Same-sex attraction is determined by a complex interaction between familial and peer influences, unique events, social and biological factors. . . No one is 'born gay.' "  Paste this link into your browser:  http://www.acpeds.org/index.cgi?CONTEXT=art&cat=10005&art=167
