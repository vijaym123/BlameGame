Ummm.Don't really know what you're talking about  because:1.  I am on the side of people being born gay.  (See- it says, 'YES'.)  One of my best friends is gay and he knew when he was about eight, so I don't even question the idea.2.  I wasn't saying anything about being molested making one gay.  I wasn't even talking about homosexuality at all.3.  I was responding to what you wrote when you said, "last I heard, somwhere around 1 in 4 girls are molested (conservatively) prior to the age of 18 -- if someone has a more accurate estimate, please correct me."4. Is that a kitten wearing a lime as a hat?
