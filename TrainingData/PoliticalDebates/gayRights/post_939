I agree with you.  I don't want it both ways.  Like I said...the license is the same for everyone...what you do with it is up to you.  Go to a church and get married under the eyes of God.  You have a license for a civil union from the government - not a marriage license.  Your church lets you get married.  The government lets you file taxes as a union...not as a married couple.  Your company lets you buy insurance as a union, not as a couple.  You file a will as a union...not as a couple.  Whatever ceremony you choose to celebrate is up to you.So where do I want cake and to eat, too??????? DUH?  I want the government OUT of my life.  But YOU can't have them in my life about other things...like how I raise MY children.  If I want to spank MY child, it is none of your business.  I was spanked by a wonderful father who NEVER raised a hand to me in anger.  When I had misbehaved, he sent me to my room until he was no longer angry.  Then he came in and talked to me about what I had done wrong.  Then he told me that he had to spank me to make me remember not to do it again.  Then he gave me a    spanking   ...not a beating.  I never had a mark.  Not a red bottom.So I believe he did a good job, and the idea that some knee-jerk reaction from a do-gooder could have me arrested for disciplining my child makes me FURIOUS.  It's not the government's business.  I want the government out of my business.  It doesn't take a village to raise a child.  It takes a family...a whole family, a loving whole family with proper values and a Mom at home to pay attention and a Dad who comes home and pays attention.  It takes FAMILY...not Government...and I want them OUT of my life.
