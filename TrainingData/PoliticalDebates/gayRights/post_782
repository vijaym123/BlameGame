Above you have stated that because of idolatry, God gave them unto their vile affections. What were the vile affections? It explains that next: women and men exchanging in unnatural relations with the same gender. The word "vile" is defined as:1.  Loathsome; disgusting: vile language.2. Unpleasant or objectionable: vile weather. See Synonyms at offensive.3.a. Contemptibly low in worth or account; second-rate.b. Of mean or low condition.4. Miserably poor and degrading; wretched: a vile existence.5. Morally depraved; ignoble or wicked: a vile conspiracy.Obviously, something that is "vile" is not GOOD. In this passage, God gives them over to their own selfish and bad desires (such as homosexuality) because they have committed idolatry. Because God gave them over to homosexuality because of idolatry does not make it "right." They were choosing to worship themselves and creatures instead of God, so he gave them over to their other bad desires. The context is about what God did because of men and women idolizing things other than him. He gave them over to their "foolish," "unnatural," and "vile" desires. Homosexuality was one of those desires.
