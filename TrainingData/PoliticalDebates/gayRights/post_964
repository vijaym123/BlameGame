I agree the definiton of marriage is between a man and woman but, the word marry means- To join as spouses by exchanging vows, to take as a spouse, to obtain by marriage. My opinion is marriage is to take a spouse, doesnt matter if its same sex or different sex. I can tell you from personal expierence that   same sex marriage   is important for same sex partners but more importantly its important to their   children  . Maybe more so to   kids  .
