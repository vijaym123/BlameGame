The entire premise of this argument rests on the premise that the current debate is analogous to a decision made 40 years ago, referred to as the Divorce Experiment.  I am extremely skeptical of this assertion since divorce has existed for thousands of years and there has been no mention of who participated in or initiated this experiment.The remaining point made in this argument seems to be that divorce is hard on children, and I wholeheartedly agree, but without any proof of the assertion of a similarity between the two "Experiments", the rest of the argument is a non sequitur.If you read this comment, could you please explain what you mean?
