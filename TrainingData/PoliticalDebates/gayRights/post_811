"The idea that we have a somehow higher knowledge of homosexuality--a grasp of what it means to be "gay" that hasn't existed in all of human history, is arrogant and self-deceiving."Okay, so the fact that we progress as human beings and that we know more now about things that were misunderstood in the past is arrogant and self-deceiving?  Case in point...  My grandparents were Deaf.  When they were growing up, being Deaf was considered the same as being mentally retarded.  They were abused and treated as though they were stupid and not worth a whole lot to society.  Now, we've learned a lot about deafness and have come to understand that it isn't something that has anything to do with mental dificiency.  There are some great minds that are located in people who cannot hear.  That's just one example.  To say that progress shouldn't happen because of your own personal views on an issue is what is arrogant.  Changes happen all the time.  If we don't keep up with it as a society, we will always live in the past.  I prefer to go forward, not back.  Jesus did too, by the way.
