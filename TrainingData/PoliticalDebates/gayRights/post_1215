I'm not sure if you're aware, Benjamin Tuttle, but the last 3000+ years of human history have been anything but wise. They were marked by extreme anti-intellectualism, oppression, slavery, lack of women's rights, persecution of   science  , and worse. Should we just do whatever's been done in history and assume that because it's been done the last 3000+ years, it's correct? Perhaps you'd be the first to slice your arm open and bleed it out, as that was one of the "wise" cures of our forefathers.Sorry, I've never seen such a ridiculous argument.
