The idea 'homosexuality is sin' is a religious belief, but it is not the only one.  Many people of faith believe, based on the Bible, that homosexuality is not sin.  Further, they believe that labeling the loving intimacy between two people of the same gender as 'an abomination' is not only a false translation of "toe'vah", but because it falls in a passage that requires the death penalty, the claim is a overt repudiation of Christ's teachings and a covert death threat.In other words, to many progressive and liberal Christians, 'homosexuality is sin' is incompatible with Christian faith and life.Since there is no such thing as a gay lifestyle, such claims are 'bearing false witness' which is repeatedly forbidden in the Bible.Before posting one's religious views as fact, one should consider that they are, at best, speculation, and often lead one into sin, such as bearing false witness.
