The traits exhibited by the 3 Gay men as   children  , even at less than 10 years old, went beyond mere   feminism   and preferring to play with girls. You just knew it and I believe they were born with it. They came from 3 completely different families and social backgrounds yet all 3 exhibited traits that I find difficult to describe. In all my life I have never known straight men that exhibited these traits to such a degree. I know it's not scientific but it's enough to convince me. It's like describing Jazz. It's hard to define but I know it when I hear it. It was these 3 along with other things that leads me to believe most Gays are probably born that way.
