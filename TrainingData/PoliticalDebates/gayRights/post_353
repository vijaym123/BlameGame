I am a college male who was born with a high voice. Over the course of my life people have mistaken me for a girl and sadly that took a toll on me and when I entered high school I was unsure as to what my sexuality was. Since I had straight Christian family, I should not have ended up being bisexual. However in the end that is what I am. I NEVER wanted to be this. I am a firm upstanding example of how there was no genetics involved or a choice. I have an attraction that I am not proud of but it isn't something I am able to be cured from. I can choose to resist the temptations of that lifestyle but I will always be bisexual. Rarely do you have an obvious example set in front of you like this but keep it in mind when you say that it is a genetic trait or it is a choice.
