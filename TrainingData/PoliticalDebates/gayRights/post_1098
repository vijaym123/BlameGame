Alliance Defense Fund, when you twist and omit the facts of your examples to suit your own purpose (as in the case of the lesbian brides at the New Jersey beach park pavilion, designated for use by the public; the photographer who refused service to lesbians; and the lesbian woman who was denied insemination after undergoing a full cycle of preparation for that insemination) you do your cause a disservice. How is anyone supposed to believe or trust anything you say when so much of what you say can be easily determined to be misleading or outright false?
