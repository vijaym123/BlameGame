No one is redefining the definition of marriage.  Marriage means quite literally the joining of entities - be it buisnesses, ideas, people, elements...etc.  But for the sake of things changing... here are some words that have changed: Commit:  to come together - but now it also means a number of other things.Luxury: originally meant ‘lasciviousness’ or ‘lustCookie: both means   food   and now has tech meaning as wellMouse: animal and techScroll: ancient piece of paper... and how one moves down the screenUndertaker: old meaning entrepreneur, now entrepreneur means small business ownerInspire: to breath life into - now also means to elicit, to move to action etc.Nice: use to mean 'not to know', but now it means something well... nice. :)  good.Bundle of sticks - in the old english - now is a derogatory wordGay: meant happy or merry - so quite litterally when when everyone was happy - it meant everyone was gay. Obviously the meaning has changed.  But in the case of marriage - it is not changing, at least not in the true sense of change as noted above. It still means to come together, to bind, to join, to create a union... etc.  All citizens should have the right to choose their life partner, marry them, and enjoy the benefits of doing so.
