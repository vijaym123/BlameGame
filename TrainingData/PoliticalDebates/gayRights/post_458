Think about your sisters and brothers for a moment. Better yet, everyone's. They're probably very alike in at least some ways, physically, in personality, or in the traits they pass on to their kids, because they have the same genetic source: the parents. Now imagine that a gay or lesbian person was in a primitive family many thousand years ago. They wouldn't have their own kids, but that would free the person up to help watch out for their sibling's kids. They'd also be useful on hunting or gathering trips, because they could do just as much work as anyone else, but they wouldn't take as big a share for their family. We can actually see this in the black-backed jackal. Often, an adult pup will come back and help raise the next litter. Does that jackal spread its genes that year? No. Does it help spread its family's? Yep. Did black-backed jackals who did have the gene outspread those who didn't, making this a common trait among all jackals? Yep. The first jackals with that mutation found evolutionary success. You don't have to win the evolutionary game by propagating your own genes. You can succeed just as well by making sure your family genes survive.
