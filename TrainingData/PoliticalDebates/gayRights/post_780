Let me show you what Romans 1 says:So homosexuality is viewed as "alright" in this passage? That definitely is not the case. Here it says: "For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error."So it states that "homosexuality" is not "NATURAL" and that the men also received the "Due Penalty" for their error (men and women committing "unatural" relations with same gender).It then goes onto say: " 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."Here it tells us that those who practiced "unnatural relations" with same gender, were filled with unrighteousness, evil, malice, etc. It says they also not only commit all these acts, but give approval to others to do the same. It says the "God's decree" to those who practice such things is to "die."So again, explain to me.... why is homosexuality not a sin? Do you know what the term sin means. Sin is essentially "rebellion against God." If God says that practicing same gender sex is against his decree, which means those who practice are "rebelling against God's decree," therefore that means they are "sinning." It is simple logic.
