I don't understand why anyone is against gay marriage! They are people just like us and by denying them the right to marry whomever they want, we are discriminating! It is just like saying that Jewish people are bad or black people are bad! I think if you love someone, no matter what their gender, you should be allowed to love and marry them without it being looked down upon or illeagle! I really and truly don't understand why anyone would be against gay marriage.
