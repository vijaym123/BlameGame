1.) 1 Cor. 6:9 " 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,  10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."Sorry if I find this straight-forward, but it seems to me that if you don't interpret this as homosexuals will NOT enter the kingdom of Heaven...then, you're wrong.  Plain and simple, not my opinion, nor interpretation, rather it is what it says.2.) So how do you believe the earth (and the universe) was created?  Evolution?  Well if that's the case, look up the second   law   of thermodynamics, it states that everything is moving to disorder, when   evolution   says: bang = life and order. Ummmmm, no, even our own   science   laws disagree with that.  And survival of the fittest?  How come apes are still around if we evolved, wouldn't they be weaker and have died off by now?And matter cannot be created or destroyed according to   the law   of conservation of matter (or mass), so how did all the matter appear on the earth, even the gases that allegedly were there to cause the 'big bang' had to have come from somewhere....right?3.) Yes, people wrote the Bible; however, the author was God. That's a distinction that is crucial to understanding the Bible. And any argument associated with it. Forty people wrote the Bible. How could they be in complete agreement with one another? The writing of the Bible spanned thousands of years. There are no contradictions whatsoever in the Bible. But books written by even one person can contradict themselves. How can it be that forty people, most of which didn't even live near the same time, be in complete agreement?
