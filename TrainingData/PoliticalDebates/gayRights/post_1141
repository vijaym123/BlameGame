Have you checked out the web site called AMERICANS FOR TRUTH lately? They had an article on the Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco and men where parading around naked in front of   children  , no less, when are these men going to grow up? You bet NAMBLA was there for that even if they dont hold up signs or where I LOVE BOYS T-shirts how could they pass up and opportunity to run around nude in front of children. When did everything that homosexuals do turn out to be about sex, do they ever do anything else with their lives? I think its all unnatural and shameful.
