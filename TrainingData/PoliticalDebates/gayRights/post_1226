The relevant text of the 14th amendment is:No State shall make or enforce any   law   which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.I of course am not insulting our   legal   system, other than the fact you are completely ignoring the complex legal question surrounding the clash of the 1st amendment with your interpretation of the 14th.  The 1st Amendment:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of   religion  , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.I, as many other individuals far more intelligent than I, are arguing that   same-sex marriage   is NOT a 14th amendment issue.  They are NOT being denied any rights regarding marriage... they have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex as everyone else.  The issue is whether they WANT to marry someone of the opposite sex.  The issue is ultimately about homosexuals' completely legitimate desire to feel accepted by   society  .  Tolerance and love should be shown to all individuals, but that does not mean we make rash decisions that affect generations of society because of our supposed compassion for their situation (and arrogance that we know far better than every generation before us).Given the Catholic Adoption agency, they have a Constitutional RIGHT to practice their religion.  The government cannot ask them to prohibit the free expression of their beliefs, in this case their beliefs against same-sex marriage, EVEN IF it gives them   money  .  If the government gives you a welfare check, can they prohibit your   free speech  ?
