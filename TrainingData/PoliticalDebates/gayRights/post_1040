The question should have been worded, "Should CIVIL marriage for same-gender couples be legal?"  I agree that no religious organization should ever be forced to dispense ANY sacrament or blessing to ANYONE, including the sacramental or religious blessing of a union between ANY two people.  The question under discussion is and should be one of CIVIL rights accorded to citizens and their partners as members of a society.
