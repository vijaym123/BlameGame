The question's legitimate, I suppose, but the answer is obviously no. A sin must be an action, and   homosexuality   is NOT an action. It's not something you DO, it's something you ARE. It also must be chosen, and sexual orientation is NOT chosen.However, my major objection comes from your supposed "expert." That as an expert on this topic you chose the insidious hate group "Exodus" to give their proven lies is horrifying. Not ONLY do they promote the hateful lie that it's a "sin" to be gay, blasphemously misusing twisted and out of context scripture as their weapon, but they also promote a far more insidious and dangerous lie...that they can "cure" homosexuality, turn gay people into straight people.This is not only a PROVEN lie...there is no such thing as a former homosexual...but this lie destroys countless lives. EVERY credible mental   health   authority confirms that not only can a gay person not EVER turn into a heterosexual, but that it causes tremendous damage to try. You should be aware that of the two founders of this hate group, one is still promoting the lie of being a "former homosexual" even though he's admitted in interviews that he still "struggles with temptation" In other words, he's still attracted romantically and physically to men.In other words, he's still homosexual. Being celebate, or even forcing yourself to have sex with women, doesn't change this fact.On the other hand, the OTHER of the two founders  of Exodus now admits the entire thing was a fraud, and is now living as what he ALWAYS really was...a gay man.Intentionally causing harm to people is a moral outrage. To pretend to be a "Christian" group while doing so is blasphemy of the worst kind, like the KKK pretending to be a "Christian" group. Exodus should be removed from your site, they're no "expert" in anything except promoting bigotry and lies.
