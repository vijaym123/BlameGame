Do you have any research to back up the statement that the main reason for marriage was to provide a stable environment to raise children? I'm no expert, but I always thought the main reasons for marriage has been to pass on bloodlines and property rights. I don't think ancient man was as concerned with the proper "environment" to raise children so much as they were concerned about being able to lay claim to a son/daughter. Sperm/Egg banks and adoption agencies are all private entities. They aren't forced into anything and they already cater to gay/lesbian couples. Some of these couples even manage to have heterosexual relationships long enough to produce children of their own. Allowing gay/lesbians to marry won't change the fact that they are already capable of having children one way or another. I am a fan of a two-parent household. I especially like for the parents to be married. I, like you, think it's ideal. I understand your concern for children needing a father and a mother, because I completely agree. But I also think that children deserve, more than anything, a loving environment where they can prosper and be safe. If that comes in a gay/lesbian household so be it.What exactly do you mean by "elevating same sex marriages denies the differences between men and women"? How so? It's a fact that men and women are different. I have no problem with that thought. In a same sex relationship, there isn't one partner "playing" the opposite sex. They embrace the fact that they are either two women or two men together. What do you envision will happen if homosexual couples are allowed to marry? What is the outcome for children, in your estimation? Are straight couples going to be denied the ability to adopt or have fertility treatments?
