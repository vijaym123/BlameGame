 a parent cannot marry their child (even if he or she is of age), two or more spouses, or the husband or wife of another person. such restrictions are based upon the accumulated wisdom not only of societies and cultures around the world for millennia. i'm sorry, are you seriously comparing homosexual relationships to *rape* (incest) or adultery? is that really what you mean to suggest here?ed
