While history is important and plays an important role in our understanding of what happened in the past and why people of other cultures act as they do, it is not the final authority, and you agree with me on that. The Bible is the final authority and it remains the final authority in all matters of faithand practice.   I was not saying that history is not important or relevant.  I was saying that in intrepreting the Bible, history should not be used where it contradicts the Word of God. If we use history alone to intreprite the Bible, then we are in trouble!  Our histories are packed with immorality, fornication,   murder  , sexual abuse, and so forth.   If we use these actions as standards for verifying the truth of the Bible, then we depend on man's inhumanity to man to explain God's love for man.  It cannot be done. We need to use the histories to understand what God means by what He says.  However we cannot allow history to dictate to us what God meant by what He said in His Holy Word.  His word is final and not even history can make God's word mean what it was never meant to.That is all I was saying.  Let history interprite history and let the Bible intreprite the Bible.  RichWh1
