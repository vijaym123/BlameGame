Ok, that may be... I do not know... but the "NO" side is definitely and unarguably (as already evidenced) very myopic and self centered, and unintelligent in basis and rhetorical construct, or the lacking thereof. It is unarguable that their positions ABSOLUTELY only uses the basis for their claim for SSM narrow mindedly and one sided, without considering the other and EQUAL side of those same arguments about "equality" and "discrimination."  Basically, its the whole use only the parts or position of an argument or example as it suits your agenda; but not as it does not. That is not really being "EQUAL" nd "FAIR" now is it? -Please open your minds and quit having your cake and eating it too. If you can not see this, then you are "still doing it!"
