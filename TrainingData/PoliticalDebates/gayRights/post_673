I don't study the Bible, so I'm not exactly if this is true, but from what I've heard, the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin. If this is true, what if someone who is homosexual doesn't believe in the Bible? What if they're affiliated with another religion? Or no religion? Then, would their personal choice be considered a sin?Many would consider murder wrong. Killing impacts another directly. Choosing someone of the same sex to be a life parter is a personal choice that only directly impacts the two that are involved, and perhaps to some extent, their family and friends. That isn't harming anyone. They make their choices. You make your own.
