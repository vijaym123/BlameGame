I love your statement: "You (among all atheists) might be moral -- for now, but if you don't believe in God and the Bible, we cannot hold you to it."What you're admitting is that a religious person, like yourself, who believes in heaven and hell behaves morally for mostly selfish reasons -- to buy admission to heaven and to avoid hell. You can't understand that anyone would choose to live a life of kindness, compassion, and love of fellow human beings for unselfish reasons, so you don't trust atheists who appear to live a moral life.I'm not saying that religious folks can't be unselfishly moral sometimes, but they ought to question their motives constantly, because their morality is so inextricably intertwined with a selfish desire to please the big guy up there and thereby buy admission to the big prize. Only the atheist can be moral in simple, uncomplicated way.
