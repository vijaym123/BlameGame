People are not born   gay  . Most if not all the cases of   homosexuality   I have heard of were influenced by a happening in the persons life while growing up Including my own... For me gay   porn   on the   internet  , when I was a child I ran into this and after seeing this I remember being attracted to men. Also as a child a kid my age asked me to touch him sexually and I did being a kid who had no idea how wrong and disgusting this was. Another thing that is believed, I never had a good relationship with my father. And most guy homosexuals if not all that I have heard of have not had fathers or did not have a good relationship with them. Another thing, BIG influence. Being raped as a child I would say probably would not help. I myself was never raped. But a lot of people I know who are homosexuals have been or molested one.
