My argument is clear.  You're arguing the messenger.  My point has been made.   On the contrary, my knowledge suffices.Yeah "influences in   pregnancy  " include birth defects and deformities".  Mutating your biologically intrinsic drive to reproduce your own genes is NOT a "pregnancy influence"!!!!!!!!!  That's like saying "when a care is made in a factory, occasionally when it comes out on the conveyor belt, sometimes some "influence" happens that causes it to only go in reverse".As homo sapiens, we're designed to reproduce.  Tendencies to not do that (  homosexuality  ) are not just counter-productive, but they're anatomically-biologically-productive (i.e. nonexistent) .  Behavior traits are NOT so much determined by genes.  It's anatomical traits such as pigment that are gene-based. Your "comeback" if you can even call your pathetic whimper a "rebuttal" (which for the sake of wanting to do the world "rebuttal" justice, let's not say your comments were even an attempt at that) merely says that I lack knowledge and that my analysis fails.Whoopteedoo!!!  Aren't you good at finger-pointing and saying your wrong.I think you're first sentence would be most useful to you, now meekly squandering in your sense of loss. For the sake of edifying your naivety: "You analysis fails" (why? how? counter-evidence?) and "You're low on knowledge" (where? elaborate? educate with more knowlegde?) is a peurile "rebuttal".I don't even know why I took the time to this pathetic response!!  If you're going to be active about an issue, might as well have a well-structured set of arguments and facts laid out as I took the liberty to do, instead of cowering in the corner with your trivial 4 sentence "response".Cheerio then.
