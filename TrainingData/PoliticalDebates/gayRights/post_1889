Actually the word you are looking for is called analogy. I know it's kind of a difficulty concept so I will explain it. Making an analogy is comparing similarities between to ideas. So if I make an analogy between gay marriage and interracial marriage, I am talking about things that are similar between them. No one in their right mind would take this to mean I am asserting they are the same thing.And I know segregation was awhile ago, so you may have forgotten, but the supreme court ruled that separate is not equal. You can't have one one type of thing for one group and one for another. WARNING: Incoming analogy. White water fountains and black water fountains. Straight marriages and gay civil unions.
