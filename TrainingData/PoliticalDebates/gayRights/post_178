Thank you for your note but the word "Disadvantage" is exactly what you were. Instead of having someone at home you had to go to alternatives. That is called "being at a disadvantage."Based on that same experience you had, the children that live with same sex parents will have to go o alternatives hence being disadvantaged.Please notice that disadvantage doesn't mean "not as good," it simply means not having the same opportunities.Thank you
