The commons sense answer is of course it is a sin. Those that beleive in scriptures and our heritage know that it is a sin.  Those that are practicing this behavior know in their hearts it is wrong.  The bible speaks of a time when that which is good is said to be bad and that which is bad will be said to be good.  We will then know that the end is coming soon.  The radical approach to this situation is proof enough of the legitimate points that I make.  Look at how the homosexual audience responded to the recent vote in California. They were ok with voting for BO even though he said marriage is for men and women yet they didn't picket the Black race who voted overwhelmingly against gay marriage. They didn't picket the Muslims who are on record as being against gay marriage.  They violently went after the LDS church.  A church that is very very small and have always been against gay marriage and who are only exercising their God given right to disagree.  So why the violent approach?  Simple really.  You lose it when you know in your heart you are wrong.
