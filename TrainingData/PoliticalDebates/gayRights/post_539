I have a musing from my 86 yr old mother. Since the Christian argument is that Gay is a choice, it can be overcome and whatnot...it's NOT proven to be by birth(whatever)...ok, so IT IS proven we all have a male side AND a female side of the brain (everybody agree?)so the real difference is our physical bodies. Made differently so we are able to carry out different tasks in the world. Not to say those are THE ONLY tasks we can do or are allowed to do. Kinda like the ONLY use of water is not as a liquid to drink but as ice cubes, steam, ect ect. "out of one so great come many" . My mothers querry was/is this; If a man and woman are having sex and the woman is more in the male side of her brain, are they having homosexual relations? Is the male gay? And the vice versa. When a "straight" male wants to have anal sex w/his wife is there an underlying gayness?
