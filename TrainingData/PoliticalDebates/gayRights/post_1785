Brilliant clip.I did not know that relatives of homosexuals tend to have more kids (the male ones at least.)But is that based on observation only?I'm confused why that would be true. Did you find anything that offered a genetic or social reason?It's seems the number of kids one has would have more to do with how many times they have sex without a condom, more than anything.What about having a gay relative would make one more likely to participate in unprotected sex more often? If it's a simple fertility issue... again I'm flabergasted. That would suggest that the ability of one to have kids is reversely proportional to their genetic propensity to only have gay sex...I just had a thought.Following that the relatives of gays have more kids,it would stand to reason that that is the reason why, while gays themselves tend not to pass on their genes, the percent of gays stays static.So then, things like viagra, and fertility clinics would essentially lower the percentage of people who are gay.This assuming1. relatives of gays have historically and presently been less likely to need outside help reproducing.2. those who historically had more trouble having kids did not have any gay relatives, thus perhaps slightly less likely to have gay children, and now are able to have more kids, where in the past they could not.Not sure what my point is, but it interests me for some reason. I wonder if in 10 years we'll see a decline in the percentage of gay people, and we'll stand around scratching our heads why, while the religious take it as proof of god's disaproval.
