I'm so sorry for all the people who give up who they are for a FEW versus in a 2,000 year old, often translated book. There are some basic tennents that are good in the Bible. I live by those every day. I refuse to believe that love is wrong. I wonder how many times love is mentioned in the Bible? In my opinion, the only thing Exodus does is push those seeking their "help" into celibacy. What a waste of a perfectly natural life.
