When people say that "gays" will be "living among us" it sounds like you're referring to aliens or some unknown life form.  But the fact of the matter is, they are people. Living, breathing, human beings just like you and me.  They will be “living among us” whether or not gay marriage is legalized. Gay couples are no more playing house than kids who marry young. A man can fall in love with a man just like a man can fall in love with a woman. And who says marriages between a gay couple won’t last? Now days, opposite-sex married couples are getting divorces left and right, what about their children? Should getting divorced be illegal because of that reason too? Other people are free to live their lives happily without the whole world scrutinizing who they fall in love with. Why should they get to dictate how those who are gay get to live?  Gay people will always “be among us”. They’re not going anywhere. It’s not like they are a separate species that can be extinct. I say stop fighting and let them live.
