"Children should be in homes where they have some chance to grow up normal."Yes they should, and evidence suggests that   children   raised by homosexuals are no worse off the those raised by heterosexuals.  Further, as I stated above, a child adopted by a homosexual couple is already one that will not have a 'traditional' upbringing."Your lame rap about how it should be okay because other people who aren't gay screw up children's lives is disgusting"I'm not sure where you are getting this.  All evidence shows that homosexual couples are as caring and supportive as heterosexual couples."Two wrongs don't make a right."Quite true... a child denied the family that that were born into is further wronged by being denied a loving home just because the couple is homosexual.
