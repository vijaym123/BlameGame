"It wouldn't be as special."  Why should he have the same color ball as I do?  I had one first.  Why should he get "x", I didn't get one?  The other   kids   aren't going to think i'm cool if everybody has the same thing I have.Ok, that was midly snippy.  I have seen this "special" argument before and I am rather saddened by it.  My 'x' thing (like marriage) is special to me because it is special to me.  It's not more special because you say it is.  It's not less special because you say it isn't.  It is the greatest character flaw in man that we are not always capable of appreciating what we have without the consent, or indeed the jealousy, of those around us.  It is from this that greed stems.  To say that marriage would not be as special because a different group of people now have access to it is both petty and selfish.
