Twin studies DO demonstrate a genetic link.  Every notable twin study has shown that a greater percentage of monozygotic twins shared the same sexual orientation than the percentage of dizygotic twins. The fact that not all monozygotic twins share the same sexual orientation does not disprove a genetic link.  It simply suggests that other factors, most likely intrauterine, are involved -- most likely a complex process involving the mutation of certain fragile genes during early cell replications, along with hormonal changes which alter brain chemistry, received more by one twin than the other.  Monozygotic twins nearly always have some perceptible physiological differences, including mirror-image,where one twin is left-handed and has left-handed hair whorls, while the other is the opposite; size differences, due to unequal uterine blood supply; and even being of opposite genders, due to genetic mutations which take place after the the cell division in which the twins divide from one another. One would not expect that 100% of monozygotic twins would share the same sexual orientation.  But the fact that a higher percentage of monozygotics do than dizygotics is a highly-reliable indication that sexual orientation is a genetically-linked trait.
