In both of these passages, Paul uses the Greek term arsenokoite in reference to male homosexuality.  The conventional understanding has been that Paul is specifically addressing homosexuality within this passage.The pro-gay theological stance is that Paul is extremely concerned about prostitution within I Corinthians 6 and is mainly referring to male prostitutes.  This word is only used within I Corinthians and I Timothy but nowhere else in the literature of the period.(1)  John Boswell states that there were other words for “homosexual” in the Greek language so there was little need to use this term.(2)   Also the word arsenokoite is a term that Paul has created from the words arsenos (man) and koite (couch or bed) and is specific to him.  Therefore, Paul is condemning sexual immorality in general and not referring to committed homosexual relationships.  While it is true that the term arsenokoite appears to be of Paul’s invention, the context in which it appears is not nullified because of Paul’s originality.  In fact, Paul coined 179 words throughout the New Testament.  The words arsenos and koiten are taken directly from the Holiness Code of the Septuagint.(3)   Because arsen is Greek for “man” and koites means “bed”, the connotation of sexual activity is predominant.  The Septuagint’s translation of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 places the words arsenos and koite in close proximity to each other and is suggested by Martii Nissinen that Paul is creating a neologism based upon the Septuagint.(4)   These are the previously referred passages in which homosexual behavior is expressly forbidden.  This further complicates the position that another meaning other than homosexuality is implied.  In I Corinthians 5:1, Paul begins by addressing sexual matters with the general term porneia, ‘sexual immorality’.  This is applied to a case of heterosexual immorality in verse 1 regarding a man’s stepmother.  In the following verses there are initial references to porneia referencing heterosexual immorality followed by arsenokoitai which references the homosexual contrast.(5)    In this context, one must consider the intent of arsenokoite in its perceived application to prostitution.  Arsenos signifying ‘male’ is a clear emphasis on gender.   Koite meaning ‘couch’ is listed only twice in the New Testament in a sexual connotation.  There is nothing within these words that would implicate a trade or bartering.  __________________________________1 Rev.
