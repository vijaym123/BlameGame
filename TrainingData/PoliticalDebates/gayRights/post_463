No, we do NOT know that "people can...change from one to the other."  What we know is that there is some percentage of the population which is innately bisexual, and may fall in love with or be attracted to members of his or her own gender as well as the opposite.  Such people could correctly be described as having a "choice."  However, they do not make up the sum total of the population.  There are significant percentages on either end who are either exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of the opposite gender, or exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of their own gender.As to a gene, or more likely a SET of genes, which give evolutionary advantage to those who carry some or all of them, the hypothesis, however difficult it might be to prove, is a good one, as we have any number of examples of such genetic characteristics in the data already, including the sickle cell example I gave earlier.  Can I prove the hypothesis?  Of course not.  Not yet, anyway.  Geneticists are finding new information about the human genome every day.  The probability that a genetic link will be found is strong.  And considering the abilities, behaviors and talents which can be readily identified in a significant percentage of the gay population, it is highly likely that there is a significant evolutionary advantage conferred by that set of genes, whether it be in creative abilities, or in more prosaic areas such as enhanced abilities to form the family and group bonds which were the basis of individual safety and strong social networks in the early history of human civilization.  For an example of this type of genetic advantage resulting from genetic ability to interact sexually with members of either gender, study Bonobo social bonding and conflict resolution strategies.
