"I think the issue being addressed here is a question of whether or not marriage for anyone can be considered a right guaranteed by the United States government"Please remember that this is an international website, with people from all around the world. The question is "should gays have the right to marry?" not "under current US legislation do gays have the right to marry?"Sorry to make a point of it, but this default position of all debates being centred around the US both alienates non-Americans, and absolutely bugs the crap out of me.
