Just a reminder: if Prop 8 passes, gay people will still be able to form relationships with their partners.  Nothing with Prop 8 has anything to do with condemning homosexuality.  Supporters of gay-marriage may say all that this is about is 'two loving people getting married.'  But it's not that simple, and to think it is is very naive.  The possible repercussions of legalizing gay-marriage are innumerable and unknown.  We cannot risk to leave these unknown consequences to chance.When you throw a rock in a pond, the ripples extend very far.  Prop 8 is not focused as much on the initial impact of the rock hitting the pond as we are on the ripples that will result.Yes on 8.God bless.
