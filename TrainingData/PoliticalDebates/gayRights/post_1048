and I still can't completely decide how I personally feel. I never felt less than married in the two serious relationships I have been in, one for 6 years and one for 13 years. I suppose because they weren't permanent I don't have much faith in an oath, whether you take it before God or a group of people to witness your commitment to another. I do respect the wishes of others and I worked to promote vote against   prop 8   in California because I do think there should be an opportunity for all to marry if they want. So it is more of a struggle for me than a criticism of the whole issue, thanks for your thoughts.'
