Arguing that   same-sex marriage   is a slippery slope completely ignores the fact that   society   and courts are able to distinguish between different situations.  Courts, state, and the federal government will easily be able to recognize   gay marriage   while still banning marriage between blood relatives.Assuming that once gay marriage is allowed that all types of marriage must follow also ignores that standards can be developed and lines can be drawn.When marriage between interracial couples was finally recognized, did that former slippery slope lead to polygamy?  When women were finally granted the right to   vote  , did that lead to infants being allowed the right to vote?It is important to not factor in "slippery slopes" with regard to fundamental rights.  Fundamental rights should be protected among all citizens, including the fundamental right to marry.  Recognizing a slippery slope when protecting a human right is illogical and ridiculous.
