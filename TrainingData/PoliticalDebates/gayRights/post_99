Reproduction provides a stable foundation for the rearing of children. In American society we see more women having children without a male in the household.  Is this by choice of the woman or by design of the man?  We know (statistically), that children in single-mother households have some of the greatest deficits to overcome.  By ignoring the traditional prescription for men "do the right thing" and marry a woman that they make pregnant, we see the licentious self-indulgence that punishes children. Homosexuals do not experience this circumstance and cannot claim marriage as a reason to aid children. Social Learning Theory tells us that adoptive homosexual parents will likely increase the number of children entering a lifestyle that produces significant medical pathologies because of the behavior of the participants.  This would simply be child abuse.
