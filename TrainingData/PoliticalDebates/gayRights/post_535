There's not really a specific   gay     gene  , but there are links. First of all, the gene for fay men is usually passed down through the mother. Mothers who have gay uncles or cousins are more likely to have a gay child. The more sons a mother has, the more likely another son is to be gay. This has to do with an immune system response. Prenatal hormones also have a huge effect. If a girl   baby   has abnormal levels of testosterone in her blood, she will be more likely to be gay. So... There's not necessarily a gay gene, it's more of an environmental thing. People are still born gay, however, and they don't have a choice in the matter. It makes no sense to discriminate against people who have no choice in the way they are. It's like being black. You can't help being black, it just is.
