We teach our children the same things any parent teaches his or her children.  That seems rather obvious to me.  First they learn about their own bodies.  They ask questions and a parent answers those questions honestly, but at the level of detail appropriate to the age of the child.  Then they notice differences about the other gender (in our case, our daughters observed that the family dogs were built a little differently).  The parent again explains what the child has observed, at a level appropriate to the child's age and questions.There is nothing particularly difficult, here.
