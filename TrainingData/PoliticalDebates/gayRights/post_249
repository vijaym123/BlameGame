All of the studies cited compared married biological heterosexual families versus other splintered heterosexual families.  None of the studies considered same-sex couples as variables, so none of those studies can be said to reveal anything about   children   of same-sex couples.If you want to discuss children of same-sex couples, then you must read a study that discusses same-sex couples, not one that discusses splintered heterosexual couples.  Go ahead over to   http://www.apa.org/pi/parent.html   to see literally HUNDREDS of studies that actually looked at children of same-sex couples.The big lie is that Focus thinks that a splintered heterosexual couple is equivalent to a committed   homosexual   couple.  Nothing could be further from the truth!!!There are several selection factors that actually make same-sex couples more fit   parents  , statistically speaking, than the average heterosexual couple.  Mainly, same-sex couples can't have accidental children, meaning they only will   adopt   children if they plan to, you can't accidently get knocked up when you are   gay  .  Focus, will you stop lying and actually read scientific literature???
