 The bible opposes homosexuality, and thus gay marriage. The importance of the Bible in guiding Western moral codes is very high. If the Bible opposes homosexuality and gay marriage, then it should be trusted and followed. While the separation of Church and state exists, the importance of the bible to the development of national principles cannot be denied and should leave room for the moral guidance of the bible in influencing policy against gay marriage.
