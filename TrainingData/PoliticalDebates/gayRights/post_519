Colin, anyone who tells you that they "worked on it" and "became straight" is either bisexual or lying.  Gender-attractions don't just "go away when you pray about them a lot."  Someone who can be in a satisfying relationship with a person of the opposite gender is either straight from the get-go or is bisexual.  Someone who is NOT bisexual and is NOT attracted to people of the opposite gender CANNOT make him or herself "become straight" by praying about it or "working on it," anymore than you could make yourself "become gay" by praying about it or working on it.
