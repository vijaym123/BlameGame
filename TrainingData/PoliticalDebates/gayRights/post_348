The American College of Pediatricians is a group funded by in part, and partly controlled by Focus on the Family. A Christian Fundamentalist Anti any thing Group based in Colorado Springs Colo. USA. I suggest you read what the true group has to say about   homosexuality  . That true group is the American Academy of Pediatrics.  That and the American Psychiatric Assoc. and the American Medical Assoc. All of those groups are the final authority on this subject...Each one say that Homosexuality is NORMAL human behavior.
