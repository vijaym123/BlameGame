If you don't want people to bash your beliefs and opinion, you probably shouldn't bash theirs. I am all for   gay marriage  , but I don't see us making any progress by bagging on the Christian   church  . Mud slinging will get us no where. I will get off my high horse now, but it is possible to be   religious   and still support gay marriage.
