 The definition of marriage is fluid and should evolve to include gay marriage - Marriage was, at one point, an institution only for the elite. It was also something that, at one point, was denied to slaves. It evolved from both of these exclusive positions to be more inclusive. There is no reason to believe that the "institution" cannnot or should not evolve to also include homosexuals.
