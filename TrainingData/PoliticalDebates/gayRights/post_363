"Most if not all the cases of   homosexuality   I have heard of were influenced by a happening in the persons life while growing up"The way I've understood my   gay   friends is that they were not 'influenced' by a happening, but that sometimes an experience in childhood makes them realize that they are gay. When one is socialized into a heterosexual   society  , the experience of understanding that there is also a gay society is often not even realized until one sees that there are others like oneself. I wouldn't necessarily call that being influenced, but having one's eye's open to something that already exists.
