you can't really be arguing that because someone is born possibly with a certain body type or voice pitch that he has the "gay gene" no, how about the much more logical explanation that because people are born with certain things, they are exiled in   society  , and thus are more likely to turn to a gay lifestyle, becaue it is within such a life that they gain wider acceptance and have a better niche.
