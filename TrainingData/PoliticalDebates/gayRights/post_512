Matthew 19 is Jesus answering a direct question from the pharisees which they framed specifically regarding a man divorcing his wife:Matthew 19:3 (NIV)Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"Of COURSE he addressed this question regarding heterosexual people marrying and divorcing in terms of husbands and wives.  You think he would talk about two men in response to this question?  Or two women?  Ridiculous.He went on, though, later in that same chapter, to discuss "Eunuchs who were born that way," which many scholars believe was a common manner of referring to men who did not prefer to have sexual relations with women.  He discusses such men in Matthew 19:12, and does not condemn them.
