How do you debate a topic that has a different meaning from what is implied?What we're technically supposed to talk about here is "should gays have the right to marry?" but I know no one wants to talk about that, since that isn't the hot button issue.Joe would have made a comment that made no sense or would have joked around. While I joke around, this post was not a joke and made perfect sense.It's sad that people criticize it.
