Marriage is indeed considered a Fundamental Right under the Constitution of the U.S.  Please do your research on this.  It seems that the Yes side is very, very lazy.  Lookup Loving v. Virginia.  It wasn't very long ago that mixed-race marriage was illegal.  This is what a judge in Virginia had to say about mixed-race marriage just 50 years ago... "Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay and red, and He placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with His arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that He separated the races shows that He did not intend for the races to mix."    This sounds so much like the Yes on 8 agrument.  It should make you all sick to your stomach.
