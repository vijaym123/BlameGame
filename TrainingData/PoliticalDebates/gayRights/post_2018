I'm gonna have to say that it's untrue that gays are "more serious about it than the common straight couple is."Every couples is different, and straight, gay, bisexual, open, polygamous, whatever.... it's the individuals involved that make the relationship work. Not the "mold" it comes out of.I'd also like to defend Vegas Weddings. They're Cheap, and fun. I actually plan on having one, someday.You're so attached to stereotypes.
