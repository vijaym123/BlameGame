You knew exactly what the debate meant by "Should gays have the right to get marry?" Instead you took the pedantic route and contributed nothing to the debate.And my reference to interracial marriage was saying that if you think it is okay to have same-sex marriage be illegal because gays still have a right to get married than you should be okay with interracial marriage being illegal.
