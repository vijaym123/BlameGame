If Mr. Chambers were solely engaged in living in a way which makes himself happy, I wouldn't have a problem with him.  I know a handful of gay people who choose a celibate lifestyle because of their (usually religiously-based) discomfort with their sexual orientation.  That's fine, if it makes them feel more happy and satisfied.  When someone who is gay decides that they must marry a person of the opposite gender, this gets a bit more worrisome, since now another person is involved, and, most particularly, there is a risk that children will be born into a familial situation which has proven for many to be quite unstable.  But still, it is a personal decision between spouses, and children have survived the divorce of their parents for millennia.But when that person begins attempting to convince others, especially those who are already psychologically vulnerable from a childhood of indoctrination in self-hatred, to do something as psychologically damaging as denying their own natural sexual orientation and trying to force themselves to be the opposite, or using emotional coercion to try to compel them into a lifetime of celibacy for which they are not emotionally suited, I have a problem with it.  And when that person forms an organization which demonstrates a devotion to disseminating false information (pseudo-science) about others with a view towards interfering with their basic civil and human rights, and towards trying to sway public opinion to further persecute that group of people, yeah, that really gets my blood boiling.So, if Mr. Chambers wants to marry and have kids, that's his business.  Chances are pretty good that he is actually bisexual.  But he need not go about insisting that everyone is like himself and that if they do not conform to his personal choices, they deserve fewer rights than he does.
