"...it can no longer say that a child should have a mother and father if possible instead of a same-sex set of parents."Everyone believes that a child should have a mother and father, if possible, but we certainly don't take the children away from single mothers and give them to two-parent families. An ideal for an imaginary child has nothing to do with people's daily lives. A child with involved grandparents may do what any single mom's child does and turn to the grandparent for a role model of that gender, or bond closely with an uncle or aunt. And since many lesbian couples have children from one partner's previous relationship, and they will be a couple regardless if they're married or not, you seem to be hinting that it would be best to take the child from the lesbian regardless of how custody was arranged--or the reasons for her having custody--and giving it to the ex-husband if he only gets a girlfriend.
