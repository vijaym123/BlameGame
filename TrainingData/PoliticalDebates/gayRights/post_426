sniffing their arm pits? They have tried harder to find a homosexual gene that cure   cancer   becasue if they can prove its genetic they can get lots of   money   from the government and justify their lifestyle, since they failed to find a gene, one does not exist so its futile but hey go for it, they are recruiting our   children   via the public schools, otherwise their numbers would diminish drastically over the next few years. Personally I think they will anyway as more and more baby boomers wake up to the fact that the lifestyle is a dead end, literally, and figuratively.
