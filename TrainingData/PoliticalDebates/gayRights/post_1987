ABSOULUTELY NOT!!!!! Why do men even want to marry each other? there's no good reason about WHY they want to marry each other. Here are my points:1. Neither of them can have children.2. What would they do together at home?3. Why do they like each other?4. Wouldn't other people think it's disgusting and gross?THIS IS WHY GAY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
