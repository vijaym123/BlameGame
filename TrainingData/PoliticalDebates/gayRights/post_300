First of all, I have to say that I am highly insulted by your comment. To say that a mother cannot give her male child guidance (or father to daughter) is ludicrous and inflammatory. I have been a single parent to a son for most of his 16 years and he is very well-adjusted, well-informed and open-minded (if I do say so myself ; ) ).Secondly, while I have no studies to support my claim, I have lots of personal experience. I am raising my son with my same-sex partner, and as I've already stated, he is doing exceptionally well. I know several same-sex couples who have adopted and I can't think of one instance where these children are "disadvantaged". Can there be challenges in these circumstances? Of course. But what child doesn't provide a challenge to their parent(s) at some point.If anything, I would say that these adopted children are better off than many children. They were given to families who wanted them with all of their hearts, and who had to fight every step of the way to bring them home. Once there, they are showered with love and affection. The only thing that might make their lives easier would be if they were not stared at with contempt by the bigots of this country.
