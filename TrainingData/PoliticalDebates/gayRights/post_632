when asked recently what i thought of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people...this was my response...they're awesome people, most of my best frenz from my past are gay or lesbian..and just like the rest of us, they're sinners as well..i am a sinner, saved only by His grace. i am so far from being able to walk on water without sinking to the bottom..but He loves me enough to save me by His grace.God loves them as much as He does you or i..Jesus came and died and rose again for them as much as He did for you and i..God doesn't like what they do, as far the kind of life that they live(nor does He like what thieves, liars, and murderers do)..but they are just as able to be delivered from that life, and saved and be heaven-bound as any of the rest of us..unfortunately, there are many, many gays and lesbians that believe they can continue living that life and that God will welcome them into heaven along with those that have confessed their sins, and repented of that life..and God is the only one that can judge, but God will not and cannot allow anyone who is unrepentant into heaven..no matter what the sin is.many and most leaders in the gay church tell their congregations that God is love, and He is..but God is also just..He is holy, and i don't think most people realize exactly what that means..asking forgiveness of Him for what we've done is one thing..being repentant is another. to repent is to confess that sin and turn from it, in some cases(like mine) run from it;) alot of Christians approach the glbt community the wrong way..with hate, and contempt, and self-righteousness, and threats of hellfire and brimstone..which always reminds me of the woman that the pharisees brought to Jesus because she was caught in adultery..when asked what He thought should happen to her for what she had done, He drew a line in the sand and told the crowd of men collected there that "whoever is without sin, let him be the one to cast the first stone"..after thinking about what the Lord had said, and examining themselves (realizing that none of us is without sin), they set their stones down and left..the Lord then turned back to the woman, asking her where her accusers were..He simply told her "to go and sin no more"...alot of Christians need to remember that when it comes to the hateful, accusing way(s) that they approach those that are still struggling and lost...
