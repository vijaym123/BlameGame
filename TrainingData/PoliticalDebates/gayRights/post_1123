You've seen those pictures of giraffes with their necks entwined so that their necks form a heart, right? It's on "LOVE" cards and greeting cards everywhere. It's perfectly natural, and it's a mating behavior that causes the animals involved to sexually react to each other. But no female giraffe engages in this behavior. Every time you see it, it's two male giraffes."Cnemidophorus uniparens," the whiptail lizard, reproduces after a ritual involving two females. There are no males. The females partogenically lay eggs afterward that produce female babies. This is also clearly "natural," since it's in nature and it's how the species survive.Take out the claim of "divinely created natural order" and all you're left with is "divine creation" as your argument, which is a matter for individuals, their gods, and their churches, not the judgement of the Family Research Council.
