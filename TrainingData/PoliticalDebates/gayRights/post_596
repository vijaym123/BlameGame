Sid-You make a very good point about forgiveness being multi-faceted.Just to be clear, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be homosexual or lesbian. Further, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be in a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership. As human beings, we need forgiveness from God - that forgiveness is available because Jesus' blood paid our sin debt (past, present and future sins) and because Jesus' physical resurrection demonstrated that God the Father has accepted Jesus' payment for our sins.But your point is absolutely valid, that we should also seek forgiveness for wronging someone and they should seek forgiveness for wronging us. That is the human side of forgiveness.I agree with you that homosexuality in general hurts no PERSON.Rick    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Moses-Law.html
