In advocating same-sex marriage, we acknowledge that any two people who love each other should be able to marry each other, and children, in a safe and loving environment, will be raised well by any parents.  We do, of course, have to lay certain restrictions on love and marriage, for the sake of the exploited and the offspring (in the case of incest).  Children cannot marry each other, for they are not mature enough to consent to a commitment and to sexual relations.  An adult cannot marry a child, for the child still cannot consent.  Nor can bestiality be tolerated—it is abusive to the animal—or (generally speaking) incest, since the offspring of that relationship would be unfairly subjected to the genetic disturbances consequent of inbreeding.  The great irony of the Alliance Defense Fund’s argument is that they expose the bias of those who might advocate same sex marriage with one hand, and decry other sound marriages with the other.Those marriages between consenting adults must be tolerated, unless it is an incestuous relationship that may produce children.  We do not have to be comfortable with it—if we cannot deny it based on logic, then government and society must be tolerant of others beliefs.  I am a practicing Catholic, and I wholeheartedly side with my church on issues of incest and polygamy, but I cannot ask my government to make laws against them, for my beliefs in their immorality are founded in religious dogma, not secular reason, and as such, it would be unjust, and un-Christian, of me to force my religious dogma upon other people.
