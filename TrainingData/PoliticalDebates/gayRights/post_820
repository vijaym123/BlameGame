hey rick,my bad for the long wait.  i've had some pressing 'youth ministry' issues that i needed to attend to.  anyways, let's carry on this conversation.in regards to your question about sodom ... just because the word "homosexual" doesn't always accompany the passages about sodom's sin, doesn't mean that it wasn't apart of sodom's downfall.  notice that i say 'apart'.  i agree with you that homosexuality wasn't the only sin that brought destruction upon the city, but it definately played its role.  i read your comments about how JESUS never said anything about homosexuality and sodom, so therefore the sin of sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.  i totally disagree with you.  i think that the homosexual sin was well known to people, so HE didn't have to explain it.  when people spoke of sodom, they connected the sin of homosexuality to it.  i can see JESUS talking about the other sins within the town more so because these sins were often overlooked, as 'petty issues' so to say, just as they still are in most american churches today.jude 1:7 connects sodom with 'sexual immorality' - which includes homosexual relationships: In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.  (   http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=Sodom&version1=31&searchtype=all&limit=none&wholewordsonly=no   )here's a question i have with your argument.  knowing that several other towns/cities were rude and had horrible towards GOD'S messengers, why didn't GOD also destroy those places as well?  you state in your article that, "The sin of Sodom, according to Jesus, was inhospitality to God’s messengers."  but if this is true, then why didn't GOD destroy Jerusalem because the Jews rejected the messages of the disciples.  why didn't GOD destroy every other place that rejected HIS messengers?in speaking about the passages of scripture used to call homosexuality as sin - especially Leviticus - all i can say is that GOD'S word is GOD'S word.  the natural order GOD set up in the beginning was male and female, and the charge for them was to produce offspring.  i do believe that those verses of homosexuality do condemn it mostly because it went totally against the created order GOD established over us.  regardless if it's pagan worship or committed same-sex relationships, is still against what GOD set into place.in addition to this, there are several other times when GOD talks about things being an abomination (toevah) that are not connected to idol worship, such as Proverbs 6:16-19.  as joe dallas notes in his book a strong delusion, "the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus appear alongside other sexual sins ... which are forbidden in both [testaments] ... [these references] show GOD'S displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved" (193).  he also makes another point stating that if these other practices only pertained to idol worship, then child sacrifice, adultery, incest, and the like would all be permissible as long as it was done apart form idol worship.  rick, that's exactly what you're suggesting as well.  outside of 'idol worship' is incest a sin?  what about adultery?  child sacrifice?again, you mention about david and jonathan and their 'same-sex' relationship.  i think we beat that issue over the head enough times.  if both men were gay, explain the wives they had - was their 'gayness' like a light switch?  it doesn't make sense.you stated:  For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times.well if this is correct, my question is why wasn't it the norm back then?  if there was nothing wrong with homosexuality, even back in the day, why wasn't it a norm just like every other couple in a committed relationship?  i think it wasn't the norm because everyone knew it was a sin!  yeah, JESUS never spoke about it, so the 'silence argument' can be used, but then again i can use the same argument - JESUS never accepted the lifestyle either.  never!**************************************************************************you asked me why i have a deep conviction of this topic and where i stand on.  my conviction simply comes from years of studying this subject by pouring over scripture, reading books (from both sides), praying, and other things.this past august marked an 8 year journey out of homosexuality.  up until that point, i was very active in 'the life', even at one time being engaged to a man (i am 30 now).  my convictions are born out of what GOD has done within my life and the revelation HE has given me through HIS word by HIS Spirit.  like i said before, this is my conviction.
