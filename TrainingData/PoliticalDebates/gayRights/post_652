I read your post and thank you for writing. Not too many people take the time to listen and care for others, but I believe your conclusion is incomplete. Although indeed homosexuals may be from birth and it is not their fault, (that is my personal belief), it does not answer the fundamental question of is it correct behavior or "good behavior" for themselves or anyone else. If you determine what is good as doing as you feel compelled, well what if someone felt compelled to murder, or have sex with children since birth? What if they act on that compulsion, and truly many of these sociopaths are that way from birth. Are we to judge them? Yes, their actions are wrong. Do we condemn them? If they commit crimes, yes. But are the actions of homosexuals wrong in some sense? Absolutely. I can say that because I believe in an absolute moral law, someone who does not belive in a moral law beyond themselves cannot use the word absolute. Do we condemn them? No. Why? Have they taken the rights of another in their actions? No. So they are not doing illegal activity. So what do we as a society do? We love them, we treat them as equals, and we decide for ourselves what is morally correct. I believe it is immoral behavior, do I have that right to believe that, who is to tell me my philosophical beliefs , who is to tell them theirs? To ask a question is it a sin, unfortunately sets up both sides for a fight, it may be better to ask, should we live in the context of our own conciences having a view to the liberties of those in our society. I wonder if anyone would even ponder that one.
