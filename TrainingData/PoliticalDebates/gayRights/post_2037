anyone should have the right to marry no matter what. there is nothing in the constitution stating it is wrong it is more of a religious belief. If you believe that they shouldnt you should keep it to yourself. everyone is equal and should be treated the same. how would you like it if it was the other way around and straight people couldnt marry other straight people
