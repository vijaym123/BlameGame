"Communism, Fascism, Racism (which is far newer than we are taught)"Communism, in a sense, has always existed... it just was never formally codified.  As an economic / political system it can work on a small scale (single tribes or family group), though it falls apart when projected over a larger group.Fascism is just authoritarianism repackaged.  There were many brutal tyrants before Fascism existed (and I'm sure that there will be many more).Racism has always been part of the human condition...  It is the idea that ones own social group (such as a tribe or nation) is superior to all others."Yes we make material progress, but that does not mean we always make moral progress."We have been making great strides.  Slavery, as a global institution, has been all but eliminated... and it no longer exists as a   legal   entity in much of the world.  The rights of women have been expanding... to the point where in nearly every country they have the right to own property and vote.
