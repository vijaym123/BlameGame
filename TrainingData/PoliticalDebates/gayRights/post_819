It is alleged to be a story condemning homosexuality in the strongest fashion possible. If homosexuality is wrong, we would expect the Bible to say so in some of the 48 places where Sodom is mentioned in the Bible. Instead, we discover that wherever Sodom is mentioned in the Bible, homosexuality is not mentioned or condemned.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html   If I cited Genesis 34 (a passage about heterosexual rape) as a proof text against heterosexuality, you would contend that its wrong to take a passage about rape and based on that passage, condemn heterosexuality.Yet Exodus and most anti-gay Christians feel no remorse in using a passage about attempted violent rape as a proof text that homosexuality is wrong.In the Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 portion of the Holiness Code, God carefully places His proscription of male male sex in the context of pagan worship, Lev 18:3, taking care to mention Molech in Lev 18:21, just before prohibiting male male sex in Lev 18:22.In the Leviticus 20:13 passage, we find the same context. God carefully mentions and forbids Molech worship in Lev 20:2, 3, 4, 5 and then prohibits male male sex in Lev 20:13 and then reiterates the pagan worship context in Lev 20:23.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Leviticus.html   *******************************I wonder then, what informs your "belief and conviction" that the Bible speaks against homosexuality, even "committed and faithful" relationships? How did you get convicted to believe something the Bible does not say?*******************************You asked, Where does God approve of homosexuality in the Bible?I believe God approves of committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships in the true story of the 15 year committed relationship Jonathan and David enjoyed, I Samuel 18 - II Samuel 9.Of course most scriptures about marriage partnerships deal with the 95% norm. For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times. Therefore, there was no reason to address the issue of gay marriage in the Bible, just as there was no reason to address the issue of nuclear energy back then. six11 wrote:"if GOD 'made people gay' and allowed them to be gay... HE would have spoken about such relationships in the Bible - positively"Okay. Please carefully read Matthew 19:11-12. "For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”Jesus does speak positively about "born eunuchs." A "born eunuch" is someone who was born without the desire for opposite sex marriage in the Adam and Eve model and Jesus specifically exempts "born eunuchs" from the Adam and Eve marriage paradigm.The leading anti-gay evangelical, Dr. Robert Gagnon, admits that:"Probably "born eunuchs" in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined..."   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Eunuchs-Are-Gay.html   I'm enjoying our conversation.
