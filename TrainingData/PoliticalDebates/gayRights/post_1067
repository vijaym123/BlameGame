 You are treated as fairly as anyone else or else their would be   law   suits. Trust me thats the one aspect of   nursing   I can tell you with full certainty that hospitals and   doctors   give all considerations to the patients and their partners, no matter who that partner is, so the story you gave will very emotional is still incorrect. If I have an affair with a man, and we are deeply in love, share everything in life, go on trips together, buy a home and car together and are together for years and years,  so does that make our relationship right in the eyes of   society  , in the eyes of God and does that give me some kind of say in his life, just because we sleep together and love one another?I would have given my life for this man doesnt that count for anything in a court of law or in a society. Why is our love second rate? If homosexual couples have rights shouldnt adultresses have rights too? After all we put up with soooo much more than wives do and we also get sooooo much more than wives do? Why not give us   legal   rights too? But we love each other? If I have an affair with a married person do I have rights? I will answer that question myself:  Just because you sleep with someone does not automatically make you the number one person in that persons legal and moral life! You cant force a Holy God to accept what isnt right and you cant force people to accept it either.And I should know because I am that person.
