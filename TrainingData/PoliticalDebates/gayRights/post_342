FRC shapes public debate and formulates public policy that values human life and upholds the institutions of marriage and the family. Believing that God is the author of life, liberty, and the family, FRC promotes the Judeo-Christian worldview as the basis for a just, free, and stable society."The REAL medical authority on Pediatric issues is the American Academy of Pediatrics, who have a decidedly different opinion on issues surrounding homosexuality, which is based in actual peer-reviewed scientific research, not in religious axe-grinding.Here are some links:Sexual Orientation and Adolescents:  http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics  ;113/6/1827Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by Same-Sex Parents:  http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/pediatrics  ;109/2/341Sexuality Education for Children and Adolescents:  http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/pediatrics  ;108/2/498A great many more policy statements and clinical and technical reports relating to this issue may be accessed at:   http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/search  Pseudo-science aimed at upholding religious persecution has no place in this discussion.
