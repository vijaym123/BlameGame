This article claims that children raised by two moms or two dads are more likely to engage in early sex, do drugs, drop out, etc. Can this be blamed on the fact that the child was raised without a mom AND a dad or on the fact that society is so intolerant that constant ostracizing has led the child down the wrong path?  I don't think these types of statistics can be exclusively attributed to being raised by a gay couple.  There are far too many other factors to be considered, therefore the basis of this argument is a fallacy.  It is true that children raised by gay couples are more likely to be picked on but it is through society's own bigotry that this happens.  The most important factor in raising children is giving love and care, regardless of whether there is a mom AND a dad.
