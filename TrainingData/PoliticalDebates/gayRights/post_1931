NO!!! Quit putting words in my mouth,stop infering things! And I don't think i need to worry about having to turn gay because like YOU said ''it would only take less than 10% of mankind , it wouldn't be a big deal '' Good job backing up your argument!! That will never happen,at least in my lifetime or yours! Nobody is forcing people to be straight, that is an opinion that is strongly enforced!!! LOOK IT UP!!! GOSH,I HATE gay fags,all gay fags can go to hell where they belong!!!
