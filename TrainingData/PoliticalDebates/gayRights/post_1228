Yes, reality is much tougher than idealism.  That is the precise reason I take my position on many issues.I obviously would prefer a same-sex couple taking care of a child to a single parent or no parent.  I want what is best for each child.  The issue I have, though, is that elevating same-sex marriage to be the same as traditional marriage further denies the inherent differences between the sexes (the denial of which has already damaged society) and denies the ability of society to say that, wherever possible, a traditional married couple is preferred over all other options because of its proven superiority as a method of raising children.  Denying that denies 4000 years+ of human experience and basic science.  Acknowledging it accepts reality and places an ideal for a flawed society to strive towards.
