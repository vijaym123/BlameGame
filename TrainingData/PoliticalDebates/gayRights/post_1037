Now, though the pure, clean cut definition of marriage may say that the state or government recognizes their union (which I see no faults with), actual marriage ceremonies are performed for enjoyment and religious sake, in order for their religion to recognize their union. So, is marriage a secular thing? Yes, if the individuals wish to have it be solely the state that recognizes them. I feel that we are arguing for roughly the same thing. I am not saying that the state should not recognize them, and I am not saying that the Hindu faith shouldn't as well. I am saying that if a group does not wish to recognize them, already firmly holds the belief that their act is "wrong", it is violating their [the religion's] rights to force recognition. "To clarify, same-sex couples do not and should not request religious institutions to sanction their marriages. They are and should be appealing to the government to sanction their marriages."Not fully true. If a same sex couple wishes to have a religious ceremony, then they have every right to do so, if the religion is not being forced to change due to their [individual's] beliefs."Nobody is arguing about whether or not churches should sanction same-sex marriages."The topic header chose to generalize marriage and not to restrict this argument. I felt that it was fair for me to argue it.I hope that might better clarify my point and argument and nullify some "Wrong. Wrong, you're already wrong" comments.
