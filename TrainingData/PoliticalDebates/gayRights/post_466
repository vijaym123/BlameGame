I agree with the idea that our animal nature, in most cases, does not dictate that we be either "gay" or straight."  And there are many reasons (e.g., overpopulation) why "gayness" might be favored in nature.  Studies of primates and other animals show this.  But our Judeo-Christian morality does offer solid guidance.  When a young person begins to mature sexually, they are as malleable as clay.  It is at this point that, without the constraints of culture or morality, they can grow into whatever (often bizarre) adult they choose (usually unconsciously) to shape themselves into.  Just like an animal.
