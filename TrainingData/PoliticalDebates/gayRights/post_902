            I'm amazed the hatred of gays, other by so called Christains!!            You are going to have a problem with this because who is to say what someone is, man or woman?            Everyone is really both man and woman, just different %.  Very few supermales/superfemales are born, most a combo of the 2.             Where the problem comes is those whom are both sex appearing having various combo's of sex organs or none at all. Since they are both, does that mean they can't marry? There are many more of these than talked about.            But really sex is in the brain. If you see a nice female and want to kiss her, you are a male sex wise no matter what sexual organs you have.            So this law is illegal if passed as it restricts some to no marriage at all, violating their basic human rights. Let's stop the hate and let whomever wants to be a family be between consenting adults. A family is those who care for you, not whom is biological your parent if they don't care.. God will punish those whom hate, hurt.jerryd
