Don't be fooled that because of a few misguided indivduals that gay marriage is okay.  For thousands of years, marriage has only been with man and woman.  It is absurd that a very small group of people thinks that because the misinterpreted what the Constitution provides, that they can change history over night.  By the way, this is not one of them.  Marriage has always been and should never be changed from between man and woman.  This is natural.  During hard times in our history, with the lack of a partner of the opposite sex, genders have come together for the comfort and contact experienced from birth.  It helps keep us sane: humans need contact.  But to make this as ligitimate as mariage between a man and a woman is naive, arrogant, selfish.
