Ok, ANOTHER "accredited   college  " with a pretty evident anti gay stance. They just say it really nice. Gay families raise   children   to be more likely to have sex earlier and declare their "gayness". WHERE? And WHOM?They site no studies that are non-Christian but just scientific research. At least they don't give a free pass to hetro's by saying ALL children are best served in a family with a MARRIED mommy and daddy. Ugh, there's no end to this debate. I just don't get WHY I have to debate ANYTHING about my persoanl, and VERY private life. Who has the right to debate ME about ME? How can you tell ME I am wrong about me? I know me...even I tried to not be how I am...but after the 2nd wonderful time of being raped by God loving males who knew it was their duty to "bring me around", I let it be, I accepted me as God child, no more, no less.
