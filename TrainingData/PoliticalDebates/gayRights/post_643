"I do believe Jesus discussed homosexuality, (Romans 1:24-27) but not in the way the "Expert" is saying. He is strongly against homosexuality, as he says in many verses. It is a sin."The Romans 1:24-27 passage is frequently misused and abused today, especially by Christians who want to condemn gays and lesbians.It is impossible to understand Romans 1 until you factor in Cybele, the fertility goddess whose pagan temple loomed over first century Rome from atop the Palatine Hill.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html  What Paul describes is fertility goddess worship, not committed, faithful, same sex partnerships. To interpret Romans 1:24-27 as a condemnation of gays and lesbians rips the passage from its context of idolatry and idols and false worship.To interpret Romans 1:24-27 as condemning homosexuals is to ignore the cultural, historical and religious context Paul addressed when he wrote Romans.First century Christians in Rome were familiar with Cybele's temple because it loomed above the Circus Maximus. The temple was clearly visible and the religious parade every spring, led by the castrated galli priests was well-known to every citizen of Rome.To insist that Paul was addressing the issue of two women or two men who loved each other and wanted to spend their lives together but was not addressing shrine prostitution is a sad misunderstanding of history.Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html
