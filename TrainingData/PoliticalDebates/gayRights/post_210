I grew up the oldest boy out of three, in a Midwest model American home with a   mother   and a father until the age of twelve.  Up until then I believed everything was just as perfect and I would have to say that I was probably at an advantage over most of the other families I knew, simply because of the fact that we were all still a family.  One day my father caught my mother cheating on him with another female.  Now, kudos to both of them because I will have to say they did one heck of a job keeping us three   kids   out of the mess that had been created.  Of course, divorce followed and soon I watched our family crumble into pieces from that day forward.  I knew what was going on, but I never brought it up.  It was a little embarrassing, so as far as everyone else, I was just a good kid going through tough time at home. Eventually, my mother came out to us and it was not different than it was before.  For two-thirds of the time under my parents roof, everything was great.  The last third was a mess!!  Not because, she was gay, or even the fact that I was gay, it was the ugly, messy divorce.  The odd thing was that my father never really met anyone until many years later, but my mother had a   girlfriend   who lived with her.  I am here to tell you now that homes with two parents, any parents whether they are gay, straight, blue or brown, are the ones at an advantage.  For the most part I was better off living with my mother and her girlfriend than with my father, not because   money  , or lifestyle, or anything else.  It was simply because of the single parent home versus the two parent home factor.  It was hell going through all of that, and the only thing that put me at a disadvantage was the divorce.
