I dont know how one could think that not giving   children   the benefit of a   mother   and a father is beneficial in any way. I dont know how one could think that woman and children will benefit from this in our   society   since woman make less and have less insurance it would only obvious that woman and children will have poorer   health  , poorer lifestyles, poorer everyting, and the male dominated world would not benefit from this either.  I dont know how you could even rationalize the fact that opening   marriage   up for a free for all would lead to a stronger society but a much weaker and distorted and psychologically imbalaced one and I hope that they would see that and that realizing that the road to hell is paved in roads such as the one that homosexual marriage will create in America.  It will weaken our family structure and thereby weaken our towns and eventually our country, if you dont think so remember what ERA for woman promised us, better futures more security etc blah blah and what did we actually get? Harder lives, more on our plates, expectations over the limit, family structure that fell apart without the mother role in the house, more   money   but that lead to more bills, more divorce rates because we allievated some of the mens responsiblities and that opened them up to the wondering eye, woman cheating on their husbands. Woman if we allow a redefinition of marriage we might as well just ask for the short end of the stick cuz thats what well get.
