The definition of the term "marriage" is such because we have arbitrarily defined it that way as an expression of views we have inherited. There doesn't seem to be a justification for this definition in your comment. On your line of reasoning, inter-racial marrying, which was of course legally barred for decades, would automatically be justified. We must challenge these assumptions to see if they hold water today. Considered more systematically however, if you were to go to church and marry without seeking the approval and consent of the state, your marriage wouldn't be legally valid. The inverse, however, isn't true: If you are given a contract by the state to marry without seeking the consent of a religious affiliation your marriage is still valid. My point is that marriage, at its foundation, is granted importance by the state. Therefore, religion aside, why shouldn't consenting adults be allowed to marry whom they choose?
