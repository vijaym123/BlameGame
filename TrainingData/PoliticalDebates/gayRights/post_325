I'd like to know where you got that bogus information as well.  Have you interviewed ANY "ex-gay"?  Do you know anyone identifying themselves as gay or ex-gay?  I know both and the testimonies of those who are ex-gay are pretty encouraging that they can and have changed.  Here's some example (on these sites - can't seem to link the exact page):  http://www.pureheartministries.com  /  www.narth.com  Regarding the ones I know who identify themselves as "gay" are not what I would term the original definition of the word "happy".  Its like they picked that word so people would think they were happy, but they are bitter, unforgiving, and vindictive.  Here's a famous example:  http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/39264/perez-hilton-why-miss-california-did-not-win-miss-usa-pageant
