Tamara,This scripture has been so misused over the centuries that it's not even funny.If you read the context of what is being discussed here, it is about temple sexual rituals that were performed by mostly otherwise straight people who would have sex with anyone to please their foreign god.  It doesn't even come close to speaking of a loving, committed, covenanted relationship between two people of the same sex.Sharone
