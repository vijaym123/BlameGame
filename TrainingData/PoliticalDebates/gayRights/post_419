Wonderfully stated, posed and thought provoking. I so agree with 99% of what you wrote in your view of the great debate. And I wonder why it is that it's just sooooooo important that the religious side NEED to somehow "prove" that sexuality is an open choice for all. And really, WHO or just WHY would ANYONE choose conciously to live in a manner that exposes them to the cruelness of   society   and fear based groups, a lifestyle in which they have to fight for their rights as gauranteed by our   constitution  , or be told they are "less than" in EVERTY way, as parents, Christians, community members, called pedeophiles, perverts, sinners and many other ugly names. Crazy...I was born the youngest of 7, to a Hetrosexual couple, Catholics(staunch), and in S.Dak. I was the only person who felt "different" that I knew of then...so the piece about hanging out and being influenced to follow suite by other LGBT persons that the Christians use, is laughable. Perhaps  The Creator had to throw in enough diversity to challenge the mind set of His chosen few...and to date, they are being very challenged and not getting a very good grade.
