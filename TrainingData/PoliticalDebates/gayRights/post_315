Every one born is prone to something or the other.  People are born prone to same sex attractions and they choose to give into it. There are people born prone to sex addiction, alcoholism, obesity and ETC. We all have certain desires and tendencies toward specific problems.I have to control my desires for sex with other women or I will not be married very long.  If I give in to my desires than I am hooked and become enslaved to it. We can control it.....same sex attractions or opposite sex attractions.You say religion is a scam.  I say religion is dangerous, but true Christianity is not religion, although there are some that make religion out of it.  That is where the problem comes in.
