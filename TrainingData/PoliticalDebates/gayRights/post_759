 I was very active in the gay comminity for 14 years. There was 4 years I didn't care who I took home from the gay bars.I marched in the gay pride parade, I attended Metropolitian Community Church In time their sunday school department asked me to teach some of their kids. During thids time I met a woman who was willing to help me in the gay sunday school class. Our relationship lasted nine years. We even had the gay marriage. I thought I had the best of everything I could worship God in a gay church, teach kids about Jesus, and love a woman. While I taught SUnday School at the gay church, I asked God to remove my alcohol problem that I had. He took the desire to drink away from me. Later  my lover and I moved from Ca. to Ill. We told the  church we attended we were just sisters. After attending a Louis Palau Cursade in the early '90's, my partner told me she thought our relationship was wrong in God' eyes. I was really taken by surprise,and didn't know what to do. She made plans to move out. I had a choice, but going back to the bars would have been like dying. In my belief that God is bigger than me I began reading the Bible, and asking Him for help.  I met Jesus at the well, in John 4-The Samaritian Woman. I continued to read and seek God's will, I came to the conclusion that homosexuality was a sin in God's eyes, and I asked him to remove it from me, and I repented of my sinful ways. There was peace and healing when I let God be in control. All of us have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, only when we repent of the sin and ask God for forgiveness can we have peace. In 1 Corinthians 6 there are a list of things that God calls sin. There is also hope, because that is what some of us were.
