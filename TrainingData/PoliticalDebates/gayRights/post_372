What difference does it make whether people are "born gay" or not?  If that's the question you want to ask, why don't we also ask whether people are "born believing in Christianity" and whether "belief in Christianity can be overcome or even cured"?  We could eliminate all this hand-wringing about   homosexuality   if the right wing Christians would simply abandon their wicked ways and convert to a more reasonable   religion  .  But they don't want to, do they?The simple fact is that most gay men and women are happy the way they are and don't want to change.  Whether it's a choice or whether they can change really doesn't matter.  The primary reason gay men and women were ever unhappy is because right wing groups and extreme Christians made their lives miserable.So, who needs to change is not gays and lesbians, it is Christians.  And they definitely can change.
