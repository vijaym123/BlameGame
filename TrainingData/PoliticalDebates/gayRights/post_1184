Well, the probable reason why male homosexual sex gives more STDs is that you have two factors involved: (1) penetration and (2) pregnancy.As a male, you can't get pregnant, so there's no reason for most contraceptives.  Similarly, STDs have more commonly passed from penetrator to penetratee (though I'll probably have to find a citation for that one).As you said, it is "just a disgusting joke" -to you-.  To some people, it's a perfectly acceptable lifestyle.  How can we have your judgment be more valid than another person's judgment?
