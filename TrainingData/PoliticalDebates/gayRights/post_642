I do believe Jesus discussed homosexuality,(Romans 1:24-27) but not in the way the "Expert" is saying.  He is strongly against homosexuality, as he says in many verses. It is a sin.  Also, "eunuch" means a guy with out testicles or testicles that do not function properly. In no way was he reffering to someone 'Born' gay. He simply ment just that. Someone who was born without testicles that do not function properly. They would feel less superior and be less likely to take in what he was saying.
