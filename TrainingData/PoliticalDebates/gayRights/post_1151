Anyone who feels that gay marriage harms traditional marriage is surely an insecure person. We live in a fluid ever-changing world. Surely we must come to appreciate and accept the differences within each and every individual. Bigotry has its roots in the fear of the unfamiliar. As the unfamiliar becomes familiar, fear and hatred will dissipate. It took an extremely long time for this country to finally eliminate the miscegenation laws. Why can’t we just move forward in peace and harmony? If each one of us would simply concentrate on making sure that our own lives were decent and productive without trying to disrupt others’ lives, this world would be so much more peaceful and harmonious!
