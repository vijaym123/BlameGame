While the Yes side certainly presented some unscientific arguments, the No side presented nothing but unscientific arguments, though they trotted out a bit of pseudo-science, and inapplicable science mutilated in an attempt to make it serve their purpose.  If you wish to drop the argument, please feel free.  But accusing one side of presenting a non-scientific argument in the face of nothing BUT non-science and religious pseudo-science from the other side strikes as a bit disingenuous.
