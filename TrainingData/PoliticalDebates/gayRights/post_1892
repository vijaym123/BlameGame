OK, so we agree on the following:And if I had my druthers I would prefer states only issue civil unions to all couples and no marriage licenses because marriage has religious connotations.Now the question is, does the state have the power to force the church to marry gays? I say no. But that's OK because the state also does not have the power to prevent gays from starting a religion that will marry them.
