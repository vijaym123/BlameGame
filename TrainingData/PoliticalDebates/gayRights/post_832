For me, the most consistent, honest understanding of all the clobber passages is that the Bible is addressing shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.That being so, there are NO Biblical passages which condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Only by taking the clobber passages out of their cultural, doctrinal, historical, linguistic and religious context can they be made to condemn two gay men who love each other or two lesbian women who love each other and want to spend their lives together.Talking to anti-gay Christians can be frustrating because they ping pong back and forth between equally inconsistent arguments.They will admit that, in context, none of the clobber passages is NOT talking about committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Then they ping pong back to their Complementarian argument, that since God originally created Adam and Eve, that "proves" God could never affirm Adam and Steve.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/adam-and-eve.html  When it is pointed out that Adam and Eve (one man with one woman for life) did NOT indicate God's prohibition of polygamy (notice Genesis 4:19 where the first polygamous marriage occurs and Deuteronomy 21:15 where God makes provision for inheritance in polygamous marriage situations) anti-gay Christians then ping pong back to the clobber passages and opine that it is "clear" that God is talking about homosexuality, even though they previously admitted that the context is shrine prostitution, NOT a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership.Ah, the joys of debating the Bible with the brethren...Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Mission.html
