The institution of marriage is centered around reproduction, disqualifying homosexuals - Marriage laws are designed in recognition of a unique biological phenomenon. They do not create marriages so much as apply appropriate legal sanctions and privileges to the inherent responsibilities and needs where a man and a woman have or will likely reproduce sexually. Marriage was a means to solidifying and stabilizing families so that reproduction and child-rearing would be more succesful. This is why adoption laws are kept separate - the biological realities are different. So also it is bad jurisprudence to lump pairs of people that are not going to conceive a child together (via a mixing of their DNA) in with those who will. For those morbid people that lay awake at night wondering how they will get into an emergency room with their lovers I suggest a chat with hospital administrators to find out what you can do to ensure access, or maybe switch hospitals. But don't muddy the legal waters by confusing lovers or best friends with those who conceive together. You do realize that best friends are denied access on the same terms as gay lovers and it can be just as disappointing.
