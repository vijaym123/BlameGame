I really like the reasoning in this thread (leading up to and including your post), but a lot of thoughts/sentiments/ideals need to be "test-driven" on this middle path. I want to see that happen because I support it.Personally, I hate debates and yes/no positions...I like it when you watch a person think ideas through and dance around until resting on a position they feel more secure with after the conversation.Here are some opinions I am attempting to paraphrase from various discussion threads on this section of the opposing opinions web site: a)   same-sex marriage   values more than just protections; they want the "intangeables" of marriage toob) having civil unions classifying only the same-sex marriage is a fundamental inequality to marriage [which says that separate itself is unequal, and separate but equal will not be agreeable]c) most of the division on this issue is the use of the word marriage in affiliation with same-sex couples, but much fewer will have an issue with ensuring same-sex couples the same [federal/state defined] legal rights as married couples d) any argument about   religious   institutions not recognizing same-sex marriage is reversely encroaching upon the rights of the historical churches by state/federal involvement. [Thus, this violates the separation of   church and state  , which protects our   society   in both directions.]Here are my thoughts as extension of those shared in the post above me:1. why not have a new word that means marriage and is defined by religious institutions that support same-sex relationships?2. why not support that state and federal policies and protections refer to all relationships formed through weddings/ceremonies/courts as civil unions to encompass marriage and any other   religion  -defined relationships in addition to state recognized/defined relationships.Looking forward - the next questions1. If state and federal authorities, back out of the picture after calling everything remotely resembling marriage as a   civil union  , how will the argument approach resolution at the steps of the churches in the US?2. Is this an issue beyond the Christian churches? What about the Jewish faith or Islam? any alternatives for same-sex couples from those religions?
