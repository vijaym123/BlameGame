I have re-read the passages in Leviticus with Rick's interpretation in mind that this was solely about types of sex that happened at the shrine - with the notion that perhaps God is not addressing sexual relations that happen within a monogamus loving relationship. What's interesting to me is that Lev 18 lists all kinds of prohibitions: no sex with your relatives; no sex with your neighbor, no sex with someone of the same gender; but it doesn't prohibit sex with your heterosexual spouse. It seems to me that if we were to discount what Lev 18 says on the basis that it was God prohibiting any kind of idolatrous sex ritual, we would see the inclusion of sex with your heterosexual spouse.It seems to me that God is giving instruction for a broader context.
