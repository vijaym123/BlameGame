Ad hominum is no effective way to argue. Who is to what the "homosexual lifestyle" is? All credibility is lost in that statement. And how can one say that homosexuality isn't "normal"? Attacking homosexuals and bisexuals because of your differing political beliefs has absolutely nothing to do with the core issue. Not every gay couple has an agenda to over run the government. Believe it or not, some homosexuals want to get married because they love each other, just like "normal" heterosexual couples.
