There are many ways for paedofiles to get access to their victims...How many   children   are adopted by heterosexuals only to be abused?  Is this comparable, statistically, to the number of children who are adopted and abused by homosexuals?You are applying the actions of a small number of paedophiles to the entire population of homosexuals.  From such a small number of instances this is not a valid comparison, a statistical relationship must be shown, and so far it has not.
