    "...it has been proven, time and again, that isn't the case."I don't know of a single time it's been "proven" that the Bible does not condemn homosexual behavior, let alone "time and time again." Only if you consider it proof for people to promote different ideas based on their own personal preferences.   "The Bible, in it's original language and context, doesn't even address homosexuality as we know it today..."This is exactly what I was talking about when I said, "He was never able to get past [the Biblical authors'] homophobia throughout thousands of years--until this enlightened generation came along and discovered what God really said." The idea that we have a somehow higher knowledge of homosexuality--a grasp of what it means to be "gay" that hasn't existed in all of human history, is arrogant and self-deceiving.
