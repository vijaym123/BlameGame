Okay, yes, I'd agree with you.  I have a problem with people who believe that if a gay gene were identified, it should be modified so that gays would cease to exist.  It's not that I necessarily want there to be a continual population of gay people.  I'm fairly neutral on that score because, in today's society, being gay is, while less difficult than it was 30 years ago when I came out, still very painful and difficult for most of us.  But I believe that being gay is morally neutral, and do not wish to see a slice of genetic diversity eliminated from the "whole pie."  If the presumptive sequence of "gay genes" does provide some other adaptive qualities to humanity, then eliminating them could have untold disastrous consequences.Consider "stereotypically gay" behaviors -- an interest in (and often, impressive talent for) the arts, painting, design, music, philosophy, literature.  If it is true that these genes are linked to those characteristics, as might seem plausible, how many great works of music would never be composed, great works of art never painted, great treatises never written if the genetic make-up which could play a part in enabling these abilities were destroyed in the name of "curing gay"? Perhaps the creativity in each of us is linked to our personal complement of one or more of these theoretical "gay genes."  Maybe the combination of all of them produces a gay individual, but the individual expression of one or two simply produces a person with talent or creativity in some area.  Should we muck around and destroy it?  I don't think so.
