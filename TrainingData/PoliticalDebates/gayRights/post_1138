That's a long list... but in going over it I've got to say that I doubt that they are all homosexuals.  Looking at Charles Manson the only evidence of   homosexuality   I can see is one instance early in life.  Indeed he seemed to prefer the company of women almost exclusively.You seem to be rather stuck on this notion that all homosexuals are brutal, child molesting, killers... and that hardly matches the statistical evidence.  The majority of women are raped by straight men... so do you consider all straight men rapists?  African Americans commit crimes... does that make all of them criminals?
