There's no dispute that a civil union could have the same benefits.  The question, however, lies in the wording."Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treated marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful inequality. We’ve been down this road before in this country and should not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is the fairest and simplest thing to do." (from the same source cited earlier)Is it such a long stretch to see "civil union" become a derogatory term?Starting out with "civil union" may bring the illusion of satisfaction.  In this hypothetical situation, once lawmakers confer the same provisions that come with marriages, they could argue that civil unions are "good enough", failing to fully realize how a mere word can invite discrimination.Same-sex marriages were already allowed in parts of the world before the 21st century*.  Why do we have to fight for the exact same rights again?*See: Virginia Law Review vol. 79 no. 7, 1993, A History of Same-Sex Marriage by William N. Eskridge, Jr.
