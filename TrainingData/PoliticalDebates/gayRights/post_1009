Marriage between gays and not-gays should not be an issue of the State - then marriage becomes a private matter...and people can do what they want.  That is the mistake society has made....rather than ask if gays should be married - we should ask should the State regulate marriages?  If we were to end state regulation on marriage - then gays and the not so gays can marry however they way.  Heck even a gay guy and a straight girl could marry- think of all the possibilities!
