The fact that there may or may not be negative consequences for a certain action or belief is not a good guideline to determine whether a person is choosing to do them.  "Why would so many of us make this "choice" if we didn't have to?"Extemporaneously I can answer this quite easily.  The lack of knowledge of a choice does not preclude the possibility of a choice.  Furthermore, it does not follow logically that if someone makes a choice that he or she understands the potential consequences sufficiently so as to dissuade his or her mind from making that choice.  Finally, just because a choice may carry with it negative consequences does not mean he or she will choose against it.  Quite obviously, many people make choices which harm themselves (if you consider   homosexuality   and its consequences as “harmful”, which apparently you do) all of the time.  Take the monk whose self-immolation is quite famous.  He made a choice to set himself on fire… Under your line of reasoning, no one would ever smoke, do   drugs  , wear high-heels… etc.  Facts and common observation disagree with your method of reasoning.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th  %C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c
