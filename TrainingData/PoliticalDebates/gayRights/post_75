January 2, 2007 - "In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve.

The compromise that came to be known as 'don’t ask, don’t tell' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve. [...] The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has."
