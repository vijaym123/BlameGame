Those who turn to Leviticus and other passages to confirm preconcieved beliefs about homosexuality are only cherry picking--these same books say many other normal things are sins, from the sorts of clothes one wears to what you eat. Do those who find homosexuality sinful find the other things in these passages sinful as well? Or are they cherry picking?
