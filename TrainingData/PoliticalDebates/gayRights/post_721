The Bible says in Corinthians Chapter 6 vs 9-10."Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived (misled) neither the impure and immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who participate in homosexuality.Nor cheats ( swindlers and thieves,) nor greedy graspers, nor drunkards, nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers, nor extortioners, and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God."Corinthians Chapter 6 vs. 18"Shun immorality and all sexual looseness (flee from impurity in thought, word, or deed).  Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."The Bible is not out dated and it always confirms itself it is the greatest predicter of human behavior.Everything that a scientist or philosopher may be a fact or an opinion may last for a moment but the truth stands forever.  God is the same yesterday, today and forever.If any who reads these words wants to continue to delude themselves or seer their conscience go ahead because you have been warned.John 3 vs 16-17 says"For God  so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He (even) gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in ( trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish ( come to destruction be lost) but have eternal ( everlasting) life.For God did not send the Son into the world in order to pass sentence on) the world, but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him."John 3 vs. 20For every wrongdoer hates (loathes, detests) the Light, and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it, lest his works ( his deeds, his activities, his conduct) be exposed and reproved.Jesus is the way the truth and the life.  He is also Light of the world.Therefore, there is no such thing as a gay Christian that's an oxymoron.
