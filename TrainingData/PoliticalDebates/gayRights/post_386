of a guy who chooses MuffMonster as a screen name is somewhat questionable, but I'll table that for now.You're saying that heterosexuality needs to be taught? You were taught to be heterosexual?Actually,   homosexuality   has been around for pretty much ever. Plato taught it as the superior form of love. It's been a human norm for most of human history, and only became taboo in the last few centuries. Homosexuality appears in   animals  . It's a naturally occuring, biologically-caused event, just like heterosexuality.
