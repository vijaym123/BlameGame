Tomcat2200,The 10 commandments you reference are actually a part of the Hebrew Torah, meaning Law that was give to Moses from God.  The 10 commandments are as significant part of the Mosaic Law.  Two clear prohibitions against homosexuality are made by God through Moses in the Law.  " 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable." (Leviticus 18:22, NIV)" 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." (Leviticus 20:13)You compare the act of animals to the acts of humans.  Animals indulges in all kinds of beastly behavior but to compare this to human homosexuality is actually out of place.  For one humans are created above animals and we know right from wrong in a general sense which animals cannot.  Furthermore animals have know self identity and are entirely incapable of rational thought, a bull cannot think itself homosexual anymore then it can think itself a bull, it just is a bull.  Animals have instincts that they act on and when taken out of nature, eg. a farm, they are more inclined to all kinds of more unnatural behaviors including apparently homosexual acts.Peace,Spencer
