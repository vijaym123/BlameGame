Getting married in a   church   is determined by the church so churchy people calm down on it's not gods will.State why can't to people recieve the same rights for being together as any other Person? It's about who will care for them when they are sick or getting older. PDA isn't welcome around me if you're straight or gay I just don't think it's respectful.
