Because of their blindness to God, He gave them over to shameful lusts.  He gave them over to sin and sin they did, and in every way possible.  Yes your right, it is a sin, but should we try and stop them doing it or should we be leading them out of sin by sharing our faith?My pastor has a saying "They know what were against, but not what were for!"  Brian Greenaway was an Hell's Angel.  He murdered, beat people up for fun, slept around and many other things, without caring about the sins he was doing.  One day he turned to Christ with the help of caring christians.  Is he more deserving then gays?You can say "It says in the   bible  " that they are wrong, or you can support them and lead them to Christ and let them discover for themselves that they need turn their hearts around.I'd like to   add  .  I know a pair of male christians who love each other and live together, but they claim that they have been celibate since believing.  I cannot know if they ever backslide, but who can say that they never slip back to their old ways once in a while.  Would you condemn them for still living together?  All I know is that their faith is shown in their lives and that is all I care about as I know that I could have a long list of faults that I should look at in my life.
