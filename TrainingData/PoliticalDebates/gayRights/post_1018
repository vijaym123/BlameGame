Well, that is how it is translated in the   bible   today...and the word is really unnecessary...Homosexuals have been around for a long time....go back to Genesis 19:4-7...and the rest of the story is good as well, it shows how God thinks of gays regardless of whether they call themselves married or not doesn't matter to himHere, i'll quote the two verses here for you from my New American Standard version bible 4-Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; 5- and they called to Lot and said to him "where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring then out to us that we may have relations with them.: 6-But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, 7-and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly."Also, if you want   homosexuality   clearly spoken of in the New Testament go to Romans 1:18-32 most specifically verses 26 and 27, but the rest helps you to understand the context....Go ahead and read those and then tell me what you think, and if you have more questions I am willing to help you understand...
