I agree totally with everything you've said.  Of course, I'm an old gay man who's buried the three loves of his life with no legal standing to protect my interests and families who turned up after the bills were paid to sue in court to throw out my loved ones' wills.  I lost, sad to say.One thing I would like to add is this.  My home dictionary is a 1996 edition of Websters.  "Marriage" is defined in it as "10 the state of being married; wedlock. 2) the act of marrying or the state of being married. 3) close union  ."  The word "Marry" is defined as: 1)to take as a husband or wife. 2) to unite in matrimony.  3) to become closely united."  Since "husband" is not gender specific, nor, in English, is "wife", the claim that the definition is being changed is poppycock -- just like almost every pro-Prop 8 claim we've heard.
