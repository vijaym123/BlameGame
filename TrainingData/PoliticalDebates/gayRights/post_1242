If   children   look down on others who are different from them who do you think is to blame? The parents and other adults in our   society  , that's who. I read recently a gospel tract put out by a very well known right wing Christian. It showed a girl in elementary school who was opposed to her teacher allowing two gay dentista to come to the school and speak to their class. She was telling her classmates that her grandfather told her that being gay was a sickness and sin and she was   simply assuming that it was the correct thing to say. I once overheard a mother telling her little girl whose name was Suzy some very important things. She said, "Suzy, you will probably encounter people in this world who look down on other people because they are different than them. Suzy, even if they talk like that, you must not look down on people just because they are different than you. Everybody has a place in this world and you must show respect for them. If you want to get respect, you must show respect." I think it's time for all of us adults to start acting like Suzy's mother instead of that other girl's grandfather. If we do, we will go a long way to changing things for the better.
