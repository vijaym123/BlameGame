Well, here's how the typical argument goes:"Homosexuality is unnatural, and therefore immoral"Clearly, homosexuality exists prevalently in nature and therefore is, by definition, natural. I apologize for losing my temper, but to be fair you did call me a sick freak when all I did was copy and paste from a wikipedia article about homosexual behavior in animals. The long list was mostly for effect...to show how wrong the other guy was.
