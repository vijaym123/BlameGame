Oh baloney, prevents employers from acquiring good talent?  How many times has this been thrown in the public face with absolutly to substance to the claim.I will agree "Civil Unions" should be allowed and this would provide the protections under the Constitution, but not marriage, marriage that has been the way it has been for thousands of years.  To change it would be reckless and careless.  Avery bad example to provide our younger population and the world that because you feel you are entitled, that you can dismantle what has been put in place for a reason and purpose.  A reason and purpose that gets loss from generaton to generation.
