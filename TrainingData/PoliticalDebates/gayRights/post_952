 Higot-according to mothers book of definitions means a person who practices, by choice, the act of   homosexuality   and then blames everything under the sun for their sexuality to the point of abnormal psychology. The higot feels they are deserving of special treatment by the whole of society because they just do,period. A person who does not see tolerance as something they must exhibit but that all others must abide by these cosmic rules;a sense of distorted reality  aka homosexual bigot=higot. A person who will when they are questioned about their sexual choice will deny the ability to choose or willingness to admit they can change. Despite horrendous mounting evidence to the contrary. They will say they are born this way and have no choice but deny the fact that people like Rock Hodson would be alive today since his first choice was a woman. They will question the authenticity of someones homosexuality if they do anything illegal or immoral ie serial rapist/murderers that are homosexual are not true homosexuals according to them. That is quite interesting given the fact they feel that homosexuality cannot be taught or learned but is a birth condition, without any genetic proof ofcourse. While on the other hand teaching homosexuality to   children   in school. Was removing this from a mental disorder the wisest decision. NO. We should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous sexual movement.
