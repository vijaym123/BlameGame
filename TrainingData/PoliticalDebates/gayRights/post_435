 With a very high number 43% of all nationalities, countries, etc have this in common: HOMOSEXUALITY.  http://www.adherents.com/misc/hsk.html  So even more alarming when you consider that if you took the TOP TEN serial rapist/murderers you would find that 8 out of the 10 are homosexuals.Quote:Dr. Brian Clowes cited some alarming statistics showing that eight of the top ten serial killers in the United States were homosexuals and that homosexuals were responsible for 68 percent of all mass murders (Clowes:97). The following is a list of nine leading homosexual serial killers, eight of which were among the top ten most prolific killers as of 1992. Clowes’ sources are listed in the text and are reprinted from Debating the “Gay Rights” Issue: Donald Garvey: 37 Murders...[a] nurse’s aide [who] was convicted of 37 murders in Kentucky and Ohio.

Steven Spielberg, GLAAD, NAMBLA, and the ACLU need to explain why they are insistent at being at the heart of pushing NAMBLA homosexuals onto the Boy Scouts. This is not about diversity. This is not about politically correctness. End quote Found at   www.topix.com   under pink swastika gay serial killers
