I agree that kids are hit the hardest.  Some may not be impacted, others may not understand what they see and end up with mental instability themselves, and even others will get the idea that this was meant for them.  Like playing God with the thoughts of people, for we have seen people can be swayed, manipulated, brain-washed to think something wrong is right.Recently on the Dr. Phil show, a husband decides he wants to be a woman.  The daughters are devistated.  now they will have to spend countless years trying to understand something that they may never learn to understand, and now, they will fear the males they meet if they will do the same thing to them that their father did to them.  We can be reckless and totally destroy the fabric of humans, create people who do not think before they act, and the next thing you know, these group will have high levels of suicide,   drug use  , and diseases only because we think we have a right to mate with our own gender.  Will it stop here, or will humans decide they can marry objects and   animals  ?Kids should not be in the picture.
