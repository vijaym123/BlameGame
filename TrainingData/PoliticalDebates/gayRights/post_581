I'm sorry that Rick Brentlinger has chosen to reject an important aspect of his own humanity (his sexual orientation) because of what it says in a dusty old book.  There is no way to argue this point rationally, because "sin" is a completely non-objective term based on no evidence whatsoever except what it says in the bible.  If you believe that the bible is god's literal word (also in the absence of objective evidence, and in contradiction to much objective evidence) then nothing anyone says will convince you otherwise.  That's the nature of faith; that's its immune from reason, exists in its own isolated world, and cannot be touched by rational debate or discussion.  But if the bible is the literal work of god, I wonder what believers think about the two examples below. There are many others. Should we take them literally?  Leviticus 20:10"If a man commits adultery with another man's wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death."Exodus 22:3"A thief must certainly make restitution, but if he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for his theft.
