You object to arguments being made without solid scientific proof, and yet the "gay-is-a-choice" side of this discussion has pretty much zero in the way of valid, peer-reviewed scientific backup for their claims.  When they DO cite a scientific study, careful review of their cite nearly always results in discovery that the study they cite did not prove anything approaching the claims they make, and generally was not even designed to test the hypothesis they are claiming it tested.If you want to go after people for making non-scientifically-based claims, go after the people who continually spout religious pseudo-science to justify their continued harassment of gays.
