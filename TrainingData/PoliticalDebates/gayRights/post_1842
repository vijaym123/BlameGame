Well if we were living in Israel under the Old Covenant I guess you might have a point. But since we aren't your point is mute. We are however living in America, at least I am, and it turns out our Founding Fathers grounded our from of government and it's laws on a Judeo-Christian ethic. Now you are correct that some have have fought very hard to "overcome" that by removing that foundation. Perhaps that's why our nation is on the verge of collapse. Because we have changed it's foundation to the shifting sands of the opinions of men and not on the immutable character of our creator.And yes, evil is a reality. It's something you seem to be very aware of and something the Bible never fears exposing, even in it's greatest heroes, like Moses and King David just to name a few. You also seem to be very concerned about evil's presence in the world. But what I want to know is what are you doing about the evil in your own heart? have you made peace with it or war? And finally, what hope do you offer that evil someday will be eradicated from our world? I'd love to hear what hope you offer.
