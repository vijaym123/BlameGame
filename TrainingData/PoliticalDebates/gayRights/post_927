What a relief to hear that you had at least a twinge of conscience.The fact that Jews have faced discrimination and oppression does not excuse supporting prop 8. How incredibly sad that you've chosen to ally yourselves with forces working to take rights away from others based only on their personal prejudice and their religious beliefs.
