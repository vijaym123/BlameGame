Science shows that it's incredibly unlikely that people choose their orientation, and that it's really, really likely that there is a pretty strong biological component to sexual orientation. HISTORY shows us that same-sex relationships were fairly normal for most of the time humans have been on this earth. Biology shows that   homosexuality   shows up in most species studied. But regardless of that.Making a sexual orientation a moral issue, if sexual orientation is biological, is a bit like making anything else biological a moral issue--Race (that's something that's been done for a long, long time), or height, or what have you.
