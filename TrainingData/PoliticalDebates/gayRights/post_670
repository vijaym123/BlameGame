It says in the bible about not lying with a man as you would a woman (directed at men). So yes, the bible classifies it as a sin. However, it says all sins are equal... so... that small lie you told last week is exactly the same as murdering 1000 people which is the same as stealing a pack of chewing gum which is the same as being gay. Any sin separates us from God so it doesn't matter how 'good' or how 'bad' you are. Romans 3v23 says that 'For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'. Or in another version and a bit longer:Romans 3 vs 21-24'But in our time something new has been added. What Moses and the prophets witnessed to all those years has happened. The God-setting-things-right that we read about has become Jesus-setting-things-right for us. And not only for us, but for everyone who believes in him. For there is no difference between us and them in this. Since we've compiled this long and sorry record as sinners (both us and them) and proved that we are utterly incapable of living the glorious lives God wills for us, God did it for us. Out of sheer generosity he put us in right standing with himself. A pure gift. He got us out of the mess we're in and restored us to where he always wanted us to be. And he did it by means of Jesus Christ.'Basically God knew that man would never be perfect again so he needed someone to take away the sin that separated us from him so he sent Jesus who took all our sin and set us free from the punishment that we deserve. Because he loves us he gave us a simple way out of hell. Jesus. He 'restored us to where he always wanted us to be'.
