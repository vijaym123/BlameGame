My response didn't get thru so I'll try again. I really don't care if your insulted by the truth or not, that's your problem. How can you really think a female can give a male perspective? Thre are experiences in life that are sex oriented and no matter hom much you want it not to be, some things are impossible.Please explain how a male can possibly explain the mother instinct to a male adolescent? Please comment on the relationship a mother has with a son, if your a male?We are our experiences and nothing can change that.Please explaine "well adjusted" and "open minded". Is one inclusive of the other? Who says so, you? The neighbor?. The only thing same sex parenets cannot give a child is the same as an only parent.The emotional and experience of the opposite sexual parent. A family experienced of a father and mother.Your perspective that all's a child need is love and affection is rather limited in itself. Love an affection have nothing to do with the focus of discussion so why mention it?Most adopted kids want to know who their biological parents are. There is a bond that is undeniable and has nothing to do with the love and kindness of another.You talk about bigots like straights have a corner on the market. Waht about the gay's threatening the lives of christians? I suppsoe that's OK since they promote you agenda. Or pedophiles wanting to become parents haveing close access same sex children, schools, and friends.Or do you say that this doesn't exist?The only thing that is relevant is what the child and or cannot get from same sex parents.
