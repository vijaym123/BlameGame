The Supreme Court of California did exactly what they're appointed to do.  They determined that the prior voter supported action was unconstitutional.  It violated the wording of the California State Constitution, and it violates the wording and spirit of the American Constitution .  A yes vote on Prop 8 is a vote against equality for all Americans and a vote for law based upon one particular religious belief -- that with a Judeo-Christian base.  That, in effect, establishes a state religion, which is forbidden by the United States Constitution.
