First, advocates of   gay marriage   are not anti-marriage or anti-family.  Opposite sex couples who love each other and wish to get married and have   children   may continue to do this, just as they've always done.  The change?  Same sex couples who love each other want similar legal rights.  Second, the law should not be based off of   religion  .  It is important for a   society   to have morals; individual rights and freedom should be protected, whether it's their   right to life  , property, or opinions.  But the majority should not be able to take rights from the minority.  Besides, not everyone is Christian, or believes that nature was divinely created.  As a   secular   state, why should the Bible supersede the Constitution?Christian beliefs and dictates apply only to those people who choose to believe in them.  There is no way to justify forcing others to follow them.And then- innate realizations?  Please.  For something to be innate, it would have to be agreed upon widely, consistently, and from birth.  No exceptions.  Even if I were the only one who feels that homosexuality is nor unnatural, it would be enough to prove that the concept is not innate.
