Your comment above states: "Homosexual's were given protection from discrimination and same rights as married couples (which is discrimination, by the way)"First, how is this discrimination?  How is giving someone equal rights discrimination?  Who is being discriminated against?Second, if Homosexuals have been given protection from discrimination and the same rights as married couples, then why can't they be married?Have you really given much thought to your opinion?  Give me a legitimate argument for banning same sex marriage.  I think we both agree that marriage is a good thing.  It helps to stabilize society and is an enriching experience for the couple and their family.  So, if we agree that marriage is good, how can marriage also be bad?  How can including more people in a good thing be bad?I know, it is morally wrong to allow same sex couples to marry... Right?  Well, as I said before, that was the same argument used against inter-racial marriage just a few years ago. It's an empty argument and it won't hold up to the Constitution.  So you'd better come up with something else.
