For background's sake. I was raised a Christian and my credentials are excellent. I am very well versed on the 10 commandments, old and new testament, as well as most things Christian. My family has many members who have devoted their lives to serve their   religion   and are placed very highly in the Church. Now that this is established, please be careful when you attack people for their ignorance. What comes out when you attack like this is that it reveals your ignorance and anger. Clarity of mind only comes when calm. I wanted to comment that although our Western   society   has based its legal system on the Judeo-Christian faiths, it does not mean that it was right or that it should be so or be imposed on citizens. We live in a world of many belief systems and we cannot choose one   faith   over another. The best choice for civil society is to choose laws based on   tolerance   and respect. Individuals can choose their gods and live by their belief systems at home. No one will impede on those rights. At least it gives an equal chance for everyone to live free from fear.As for God being written into our constitutions and courts of law. I believe it is a grave error. It is a North American and not a European tradition. The French revolution got rid of God in its civil society to create a clear separation of church and state. The state doe snot have any allegiances other than to its citizens. So to put the debate back to same sex marriages, if one desires to be married to a partner of same sex than by all means please do. You don't have too. That is true freedom. God will one judge you. You are not God so please do not judge others. You are not responsible for the   soul   of others.
