I've made a personal life choice and I think I have a genetic disposition to taking other peoples things; I'm a thief. Sometimes I do get violent when I do it and hurt people but that's OK cause I was born this way and nobody should tell me what I can or can't do; I'm entitled to live my live as I see fit.Oh yeah, could you send me your address, I'd like to see were you live. I bet you've got some cool stuff.Final thought, I'll bet money you don't instinctively believe your argument. You only believe it when your trying to justify your behavior that you instinctively know is wrong. But If somebody is violating you I'd bet a million dollars you get morally objective real quick and say something like; you shouldn't do that. To which I would reply; why not? And you might say; because it's wrong. And I would say; how do you know it's wrong? And you might say; I just know it is.So I don't have to prove your argument is false because you know instinctively that it is.
