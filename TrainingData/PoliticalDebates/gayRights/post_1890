WARNING: Incoming analogy. White water fountains and black water fountains. Straight marriages and gay civil unions.You're right. The analogy doesn't work because you could have dirty run down water fountains reserved strictly for one group and the nice clean ones for another group. However, if the states drop the use of the word "marriage" and replace it with he words "civil union" then there wouldn't be a "separate but equal" situation and only churches and religious organizations will be left using the word marriage and (I know this is difficult for you to grasp but) since we have separation of church and state, the supreme court doesn't have a say in what word churches use. Have a nice day, lead head ;)
