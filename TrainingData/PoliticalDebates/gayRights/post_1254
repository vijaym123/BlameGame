I inadvertently submitted this as though I were "uncommitted". This is not true: so that you may know my biases, I am firmly on the "yes" side.Also, the odd structure of the post is because I was not sure if HTML is accepted here—apparently not. If it were, the quotes would be indented, and my rebuttals to the numbered suppositions would be presented as a numbered list. Also, a couple of words would have been emphasised.My apologies for any confusion caused. To present my excuses: this is my first time on the site, and as a web developer I am naturally inclined to use HTML if I think I possibly can!
