Marriage, in and of itself, was created for multiple reasons, but one of the main ones is because it provides the most stable environment to raise children in.  Denying this goes against 4000 years or more of human wisdom and history, although it is vogue to deny it.Allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry will inherently force society to accept that relationship as the same as a traditional marriage, and therefore force upon adoption agencies and sperm banks, etc, giving such relationships equal weight to traditional couples.  It is this "sameness" that is unacceptable and irresponsible, because it forces on society the unscientific and wrong idea (though politically correct) that two moms or two dads is just as good as a mom and a dad.Yes, in the real world, situations are different.  I'd much rather a same sex couple care for a child than a single parent, or a single parent instead of no parent.  Obviously, this is not an either/or.  In the end, though, same-sex marriage being elevated to being the same as traditional marriage denies the differences between men and women and furthermore removes the ability for society to prefer a traditional couple as the best way to raise a child which it is. I realize you probably will never agree, but I encourage you to at least acknowledge and attempt to understand the premises which I am laying out.
