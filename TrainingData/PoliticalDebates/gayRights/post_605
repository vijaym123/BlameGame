I was at a "revival" where the guest speaker was what they called a "completed Jew"; he was a Jew who had become a "born-again Christian".  The part that stuck with me was this man sobbing from the pulpit because of his parents.  He said that they had loved each other dearly in life, but since they had died without being "saved", they were now both burning in Hell and hated one another (there being no love in Hell).  I was almost made sick by this. Still am.
