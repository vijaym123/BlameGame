You know that is all conjecture.  I don't even think it is a reasonable hypothesis to compare it to a protective gene that causes sickle cell anemia.  All subjective opinion. We only know that   homosexuality   exist in humans, we know that sexual drive is plastic, we know that people can abstain from sex (hetero or homo) or even change from one to the other.  We do not have any conclusive genetic studies.  We do have a lot of environmental/psychological studies, which shows some correlation.  I am open to any rigorous data.God bless
