Why is it silly?  I would like to know more about this!! How much do you actually know about the History of the Bible?  I can tell you, though I am not a student of the Bible, that there are 66 books in the Bible.  More than that if you include the Apocrypha from the 1611 version of the Bible.  It is no more silly for people to follow the principles of the Bible than it is for you or I to follow the teachings of any modern day writer.  What does that mean?  It means that you pick any given writer of today (not fictional).  They have a following.  That following is known for their stance on the teachings of that individual.  From what I do know of the Bible, there are allot of Customs dealt with in the Bible that were specific to the Jews.  Those were Old Testament laws.  A person using the Bible to prove their point is no more ignorant, pointless, stupid, and socially damaging than someone picking up the latest Psychology book by the Latest writer and Whole heartedly following what that person teaches.
