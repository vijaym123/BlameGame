I am convinced many anti-gay Christians intentionally misrepresent what the Bible says. Its not difficult to discover what Jewish believers wrote and taught about shrine prostitutes thousands of years ago.But since ancient Jewish teaching does not fit with current  anti-gay teaching in so many churches, they prefer to ignore the truth or misrepresent it, hoping no one will notice.NEWSFLASH!!! We've noticed!!!Ancient Jewish writers frequently linked same sex shrine prostitution with the prohibitions in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.For example, every passage in the Bible which is alleged to prohibit same sex partnerships, when read in doctrinal or historical context, is always referring to shrine prostitution. The human authors of the Bible did this intentionally because they were not referring to homosexuality in general and they most assuredly were not referring to female-female partnerships since those partnerships are never prohibited in the Old Testament.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Pagan-practices.html    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Molech.html  Philo, the Alexandrian Jewish writer was a contemporary of Jesus and the Apostle Paul. Philo believed that Moses' use of arsenos koiten in Leviticus 20:13 referred to shrine prostitution.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Beastiality.html  God bless you in your search for truth.Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Saved.html
