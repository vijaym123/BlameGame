1.) If a few scholars/linguists agree that "homosexuals" is a fair translation of the original text, then you are absolutely right. I don't have enough background in Greek nor in the Bible itself to figure it out. If the translation is accurate [which neither you or I can really know...] then you're absolutely right and this passage does speak against   homosexuality  .2.) What does it matter how I believe the universe was created? I only said that if God created the universe [which He might have] we cannot use our existence as proof of it. I never discredited Creationism. Even if I had, that does not necessarily mean I believe in "Evolution." You're quick to assume my beliefs and even quicker to disprove them. Also, the Big Bang and Evolution are two entirely different theories and should be addressed as such.3.) It is not crucial to accept God as an author to understand an argument put forth. That's like saying non-believers are incapable of understanding your ways. An argument should be evaluted for its reasoning, not who said it. There are also more than a few contradictions in the Bible. You'd have a much stronger argument by saying that there aren't many. And I'm sure some groups have 40+ members in complete agreement with each other sometimes. It's not impossible.
