You're choosing to ignore mountains of evidence that sexuality is indeed a genetic.  The weight of evidence is heavily leaning that way...  So, in a way, gay people are aberrations of what is normal.  But so are left handed people, albino people, etcetera.   Are left-handed people sinful? Do we tell the double-jointed that they're going to hell for choosing to be double jointed?   Are Downs babies not born the way "God" meant them to be born? It's a genetic aberration of the what's normal... but you can't say they're imperfect or you'd be saying "God" was imperfect.People change their behaviors... not their genetic "flaws". Anyone can tell you what you want to hear.  And people can behave in convincing manners.   That doesn't mean they have "changed". A left handed person, until recently, was taught that it was "wrong" way to write... and was forced to write with the right.  The person undoubtedly "changed".  He wrote with his right hand.  Wow. That obviously means that left-handedness is a choice!!  Yielding to societal pressures means that genetic differences are choices!    And since you believe that one, I've got a bridge I'd like to sell you.
