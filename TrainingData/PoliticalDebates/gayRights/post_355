Logical minds think in a specific way. If something can be proven by facts then it exists. In this case there are NO facts to show that homosexuality is a genetic or chemical. Therefore it isn't a possibility for me to be making an "entire arguement based off of ignorance" since there are no facts to back up that assumption. I will happily buy into that logic or even give it a chance if there was ANY indication that it could exist. However there has been nothing but "possibilities" and theories in that line of thought.So how is information based on theories and possibilities any more IGNORANT than my claim? Really you have to do better than that! You need more than just a strong opinion to debate a topic like this!!
