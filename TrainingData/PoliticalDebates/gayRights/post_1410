Not quite true. Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings.

In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on.
