PSYOP says >> "Many have told me that they wished God had not created them this way. That tells me that, indeed, GOD CREATED GAY PEOPLE! If God is perfect, then this wasn't a mistake!"<<There are several major problems with a statement that sounds so right. First of all, our feelings don't determine truth. If we really believed that our world would be in much worse shape than it is. Secondly, no valid scientific evidence exists to support this oft repeated claim. Thirdly, people do change. Since this is demonstrably true, it casts serious doubt on the genetic claims.Fourthly, valid studies do exist to demonstrate that change is possible.We may quibble over the number who do, etc., but not over the fact that they do change.Finally, the Bible is quite clear that because of the fall we are all born sinners. We sin because we are sinners, not vice versa. Thus we all have predisposition to sin, to various challenges both physically and spiritually. Consequently we all need a Savior. A new study says some are predisposed to adultery. Do we accept that and make allowances for it? Or do we use the tools God has given to live the lives He intended.
