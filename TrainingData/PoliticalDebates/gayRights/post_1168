"when gay activists and their supporters cry “discrimination” they conveniently avoid the question of whether homosexual relationships merit being granted equality with marriage."yet with this statement you create a circular argument: they cannot be married, therefore there is no way in which to evaluate fairly the question of whether homosexual relationships merit being granted equality.  which of course would be necessary in order for them to be married.  ad nauseum, ad infinitum, yes?
