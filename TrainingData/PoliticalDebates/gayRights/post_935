Brian, you wrote:"Are you kidding me? Prop 8 imposes YOUR religious views onto homosexuals, and rejection of Prop 8 is simply the rejection of that inequality."I would like to add to your criticism.... I would write it this way:"Are you kidding me? Prop 8 imposes YOUR religious views not only on to homosexuals but on to everyone else who does not share your faith. Rejection of Prop 8 is simply the rejection of that inequality".I am very weary of the self proclaimed righteous in this country telling me how to live my life (and I am straight) just because they have an old book. I am willing to stand up with the gays and lesbians here.  Because if I don't, some day, the self righteous will come after me because I don't have "faith and compassion" like they do.People, it is equal rights for all.  Not for some..... for all.  It's simple.  Let God sort it out later.  I betchya he can do that.Michelle
