This argument is quite simple. Either homosexuality is a choice, or it is something you are born with. Having never made the choice to be heterosexual, I believe it is a natural phenomenon that people are born with. Perhaps it is God's way of limiting population growth. To those that believe it is a choice, did YOU ever choose to be heterosexual? If it is not a choice, then there is no point arguing the morality of it. Morality involves choices you make. It would be like saying being black is immoral. It's simply idiotic.
