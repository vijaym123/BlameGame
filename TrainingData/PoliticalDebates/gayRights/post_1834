I'm having a hard time not resorting to petty argument tactics such as "you are stupid". But let me be clear. You _ARE_ stupid. Having gotten that out of the way, let's discuss why. First, you think a boy who sees a picture of a "normal" family will be confused that his "mom" has muscles. A 2 year old is well aware of gender differences and perfectly capable of understanding that he has two dads, rather than a mom and a dad. Secondly, you believe that child will feel hurt and pain at the "cruel truth". What cruel truth is that exactly? That he was adopted by two loving people to be given a better life than he otherwise would have had? Finally, STD's are contractable by heterosexuals too. I ask that you stop and think prior to engaging in discussion. I have one further question for you. If homosexuality goes against nature as you say, then is it a choice people make? And if so, when did you choose to be heterosexual?
