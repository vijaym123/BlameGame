"This is why we, as a society, do not allow single mothers to raise kids. It's just not healthy" how can you say that society doesnt allow single mothers to parent so gays shouldnt either? around 50% of marriages dont last, gay or straight regardless creating single parents. single mothers and fathers raise children all the time with complete sucess and in that situation there is only 1 parent. in a gay marriage there are 2 parenting so it would only create more stability and a better concept of family. im sorry to say that most who are so insecure about any aspects of homosexuality are probably insecure with themselves.
