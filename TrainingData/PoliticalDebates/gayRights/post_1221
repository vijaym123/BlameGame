Marriage, in and of itself, has nothing to do with children. Marriage is just the act of two consenting adults pledging to become their own family together. Whether or not they have children is strictly up to each individual marriage. Therefore, it can't be said that giving marriage rights to gay/lesbian couples deprives a child of the inherent right to a mother and father.There are things that do help in that arena though: egg donors, sperm banks, deadly accidents, divorce.
