Can some gays change? Yes. Can most gays change? No. Are there genetic factors? Probably. Sexuality is a continuum, from straight to bi-sexual to gay. It isn't hard to understand that some bi-sexuals are going to be able to leave a gay lifestyle.  Genetics is complicated. Nobody has done the genetic study needed to find a gay gene or more likely genes. For political reasons I doubt any one will.
