The problems with your view are manifold.1. Committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships are not prohibited in the Old Testament, in Sodom or anywhere else.     http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html    What the OT prohibits is shrine prostitution. Therefore there is no prior scriptural basis for Paul to prohibit same sex relationships, except for prohibiting shrine prostitution.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Pagan-practices.html    2. Since lesbianism is never condemned in the OT, it is entirely out of context with Paul's argument about idolatry to suddenly inject a one verse condemnation of lesbianism (Romans 1:26) into his idolatry argument.3. Early Christians understood Romans 1:26 as a reference to non-procreative sex as being unnatural. It was hundreds of years later (around AD 330), when John Chrysostom decided Paul might have been referring to lesbians.4. If you'll take the time to read the information at the Links in my previous comment to you, you will discover that early Christians DID understand Romans 1:26-27 as referring to shrine prostitution instead of homosexuality.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexuality-Wrong.html    5. Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN. If Romans 1:26-27 was a reference to shrine prostitution then, its a reference to shrine prostitution now. That doesn't change simply because someone in the twenty first century decides to take the verses out of their historical context.
