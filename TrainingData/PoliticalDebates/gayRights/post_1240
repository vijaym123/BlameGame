The idea that kids will be hit hardest if gays and lesbians are allowed to marry is a myth. The biggest threat to children today is the high divorce rate among hetrosexuals, many of whom are professing Christians. Instead of worrying about whether gays and lesbians will stay together, the hetrosexual critics should clean up their own act first. The fact is there are many gays and lesbians who have lived in faithful monogamous relationships for many years, raised children and done a commendable job. I live in Canada where gay marriage is legal and you know what, the country hasn't fallen apart. In fact, things have never been better.
