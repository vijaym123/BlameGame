You're making the assumption that homosexuality is not natural - that only sex between man and woman is natural and therefore what binds them together.  Homosexuality is quite natural. It exists in nature between animals and also in humans. You're also making the assumption that marriage has typically been between one man and one woman.  As if the entire world has always shared this decidedly Christian view.  Furthermore, in most societies - including those ancestral societies you speak of in which the child was better off with the biological mother and father - the raising of the child has typically been a group effort. It's only been in our society, within the past 200 years that this has changed.  What benefits children is having as many people as possible in their lives who love and support them.  It makes little difference if these people are biologically related, or married.  Gay marriage isn't about raising children, it's the right that exists to bind yourself to a person for rest of your life if you so choose.  Placing another factor in the mix doesn't say anything about the original argument - that gay marriage is wrong.And further to that - marriage is a religious act.  Government should makes no laws establishing rules of any religious ceremony (barring sacrifices of humans or anything that infringes upon the rights of another).
