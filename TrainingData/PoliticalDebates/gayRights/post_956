"Marriage is, at its heart, a religious concept."This is factually inaccurate.  Marriage is a cultural construct that transcends religions, whose requirements and structure vary from religion to religion, culture to culture, period to period.Marriage as understood in western society arose from property issues, particularly inheritance for legitimate male offspring.  For a signficant part of Christian history, the Christian church did not participate in marriages.  Marriage in the U.S. is not contingent on having any religious allegiance, nor does it require adherence to the rules and beliefs of one's chosen religion.  The marriage contract in the U.S. is a civil contract, and the clergy's religious role in weddings is ancillary to the civil authority they are granted by the state to recognize the civil contract of marriage.
