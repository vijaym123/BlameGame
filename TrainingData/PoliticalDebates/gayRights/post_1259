I have been reading through the comments about   same-sex marriage  . I am in favour. Have always  been and view it as positive. God has nothing to do with civil   society   o else it would be a   theocracy  . I believe that a true civil society (i.e. France) would only recognize marriages performed by the state rather than by churches. Slippery slopes: well look at Las Vegas marriages. It's a silly argument b/c ultimately it has nothing to do with   gay marriage   - the issue is bigotry. If Jesus was one of us, I am sure he would fool most people. His message is of peace and   tolerance  . And sadly no one is listening. I aplaud any laws that speak out for tolerance. BTW i have no issue with polygamy between consenting adults. Who cares. Abraham did it right!!! Goodness people just let your neighbours be happy, life is short.
