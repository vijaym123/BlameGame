Certainly not (this would make for an excellent debate in itself). If morality is not subjective, which I believe it is not, then the question becomes, does God set moral laws because they are what is moral and right, OR are things that are moral right because God says so. I'm personally of the first opinion, but don't see it necessary to bring God into it at all. Morality does not need God to exist, but with the inclusion, I believe he sets moral laws out because they are right, not the other way around.
