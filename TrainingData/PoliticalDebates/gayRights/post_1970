Your argument has no foundation. It is like asking whether women in Afghanistan should be stoned if they cheat on their husbands and then quote the Quran. Do you believe in separation of church and state? Policy issues that affect a population that is allowed to freely choose their own religion (unless you state that there is no freedom of religion in the U.S.) should not be addressed through religion. Gays should be allowed to form unions that are legitimate under the law. Whether it be called "marriage" from a Christian point of view is irrelevant. The legality of a union does not depend on the church but on state laws.
