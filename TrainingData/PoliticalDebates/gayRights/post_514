I think you are wrong to say people are not born gay or have a choice to be Gay or not. You are Gay, like it or not, but you choose not to act on it sexually because you believe it to be immoral or destructive or whatever. That's fine. It's similar to heterosexual men choosing a monogamous life style even though that may not be the natural way to be. It's a choice that you have decided works best for you.
