Dear Barbaroni, If you are so convinced that science proves homosexual attraction is inborn and unchangeable, why not simply refute our evidence to the contrary?  Our position statements are based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence in the medical literature.  Anyone truly devoted to science would engage in a reasoned debate over the evidence. Instead, you and many others, immediately resort to religious bigotry (which implicitly concedes that there really is no substance to the innate immutable myth afterall).  We are not a Christian organization.  Our members span the religious spectrum.  The only axe our members have to grind is against the political correctness that currently reigns over science and what is best for children.
