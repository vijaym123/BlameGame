I tend to doubt that there is a gene that "causes" Gayness but from my own observations I've seen Gay traits in pre pubescent children that grew up to be Gay. Whatever the cause it is not a conscious decision to "become" Gay I'm sure of that. If not at birth then the trait occurs at an early age. I have no problem with allowing government sanctioned Gay marriage and I'm a pretty conservative person.
