If you want to drag   religion   into this, fine. Here's a challenge, make a case against gay marriage that does not include religion, reproduction issues, ethics or anything stated here. My point is that as soon as this debate comes up, the first thing to be said is "well the   bible   says..." or "gay men or women cant reproduce". Oh, and you said "You have your opinion and I have my truth" well, that's an opinion. Your opinion is that you're right when it comes to religion. my opinion is that you're bring arrogant, close minded, and flat out rude.
