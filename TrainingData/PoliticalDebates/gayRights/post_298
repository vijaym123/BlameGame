You right, there is nothing difficult because you and the good doctor avoid the real issue. Describing the physical differences between a male and a female is not the issue. Its about two same sex adults not being capable of giving emotional and experience laden guidence to maturing children of the opposite sex. This being the case it's obvious that the children are at a disadvantage from the situation.A female cannot possiblely give guidence a male parent can to a boy about a boy growing up and visa-versa. It would be exactly the same as having no male influence in the family.
