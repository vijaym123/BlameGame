Homosexuality is a natural phenomenon: people are born and some are gay. Nothing has been "tinkered with". As proof that it's not a "social invention", we can observe other members of the animal kingdom who also have the incidence of homosexuality within their populations. See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_displaying_homosexual_behavior and the links therein.It can't conceivably be condemned as "unnatural" when it's natural. Add to that the fact that even if it was a social construction, that alone wouldn't make it bad.
