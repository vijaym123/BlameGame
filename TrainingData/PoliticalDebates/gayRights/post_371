I am not aware of any persuasive or convincing Scientific research or studies that conclude that   homosexuality   is inherited through our genetic lineage. We can not say with any significant degree of certainty that homosexuality is inherited from our parents like hair color, eye color or facial features.  Having our sexual and/or romantic needs met by a person of the same sex or different sex is a choice that we make. All of us either choose homosexualtiy or heterosexuality as our sexaul preference.
