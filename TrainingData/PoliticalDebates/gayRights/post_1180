I care what sources the article cites.  Any old article can make any old claim, but unless the sources they cite are relevant and compelling, the article is as good as Joe Schmoe's rantings about why the world will end in ten days.Once again, I implore you to look at the titles of the references.  You'll see that most of what's written in the article itself is just clever wordplay and misusing research to further one's own ends.  The article might -tell- you that the research is against same-sex marriages, but in reality, the references are against divorce and single parents.You can't build your argument off of research that is making a very different point.  You can't pull research out of context and use it for your own ends.  That's academic dishonesty.
