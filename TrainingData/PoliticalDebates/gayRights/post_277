I am sorry to say but since the beginning of time the fruit of love between a man and a woman comes out as a child. It is not a question of being for procreation or trying to save the environment through homosexuality. That is way to intellectual of an explanationThe child is from both parents, looks like both parents. The child is in the father and the father is in the child. Same as for the mother. Anyone who go through that experience feels that it is a miracle.For me the issue of homosexuality is wrong. It is no about being different. I do not think that there is a person on the face of the earth who has not stuggled with her or his sexuality. It is not an exclusivity of people dealing with same sex attactions.In my personal beliefs, I do have a reason for this situation. That is not the subject of this post.I do beliefs that men (masculin) and women (feminin) express their love different for their children in a complementary way. We all experience that. Women can see from early age that boys and girls are different.Gender roles are affected by the culture people live in but they are real. People who ignore them suffer a lot in their marriages and learn it the hard way. You can recreate the world to fit you personal views.I think that you are fighting the universe itself, not me.I do not have ill feelings towards homosexuals. It does not mean that I have to agree with you just to please you.On the issue of adoption, it is not on top of the list of the causes celebre like breast cancer or aids and others. The study on the increase in homosexual behaviors if someone was raised in a ss home was made available by focus on the family. I do not have a copy with me. It is available on the web. It does make a lot of common sense since children do imitate what they parents do.
