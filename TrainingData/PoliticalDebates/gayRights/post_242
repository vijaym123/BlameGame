I've read all the arguments and Focus on the Family had 1 excellent point.  "the more precise question is Òdisadvantaged compared to what?Ó.  After they say that they go on and on about how great it is when   kids   are raised by their married biological mom and dad.  You know what, they may be right about that.  On average (certainly not in every case but on average) kids are probably better off being raised by their married biological parents (BTW, those married biological parents could be gay).  Thing is, that's not an option for these kids.  Their biological parents can't, or won't, raise them anymore.  Kids that are up for   adoption   aren't being pulled out of the homes of perfectly good married heterosexual parents.  Kids that are up for adoption are in orphanages, or bouncing around from one foster home to another.  I think we can all agree that's not an ideal way for a kid to grow up.  So the real question isn't whether having straight parents is better than having gay parents.  The question is, is it better to bounce from foster home to foster home, never living with the same parents for more than a few years, never setting down roots and making long term family or friend connections, or, is it better for a child to be raised by a loving gay couple who want to love them, and take care of them throughout their childhood.  Personally I think it's obviously better to be raised by loving gay parents but you can all make your own decision.  The important thing is that you make that decision based on the facts, not some scare tactics FOTF is throwing out.  The choice isn't married straight parents or gays.  The choice is orphanage/foster care or gays.  Which do you think is better?
