stereotyping helps produce statistics. A statistic of approx 45% of all married couples divorcing someday, is a statistic based on a stereotype. In 2005, 57% of illegal immigrants in the US, are from Mexico, is therefore a statistic and a stereotype that at least half of illegal immigrants are Mexicans.
