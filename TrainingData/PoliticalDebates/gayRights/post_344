That's what I'd expect you to say, and I do not claim that your organization necessarily receives any direct financial support from FRC.  However, your relationship to them is quite plain to anyone who does even the most cursory research.  And your organization was founded specifically to counter the findings of the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding the normalcy and acceptability of same-gender orientation and of gay parenting.You plainly, even from the materials published on your own website, have an axe to grind.Incidentally, for anyone interested, the "American College of Pediatricians" also espouses many other "fundamentalist Christian" ideas such as the idea that   spanking   is good for kids.This is a group that was founded by "Fundamentalist Christian" groups specifically to put forward their specific religiously-motivated ideas into the public forum and give them a "scientific" facade.  Their name is so close to that of the American Academy of Pediatrics that people are often confused and will believe that brief quotations with non-specific cites such as the one a few posts above this, are coming from a reliable, peer-reviewed academic source.
