I realize that and a lot of times there is a reason for people marring young and that is only because there is an unexpected pregnancy involved no that doesn’t make it right, but there are also laws on getting married to young.  If we legalized gay marriage in the U.S. then people would think its ok and safe but there are so many negative effects such as STD’S I realize that there are STD’S in other places too but the risk of getting them is a lot higher when being in a gay sexual relationship. And do you really think its possible for someone to be bi-sexual. To me its just a disgusting joke that people are wanting to experiment with. And that’s wrong.
