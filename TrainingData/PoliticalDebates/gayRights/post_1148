None of those things have been proven definitively. Do you really think homosexuals have it out to ruin   society  ? Do you really think that's the point of a person who is homosexual? Again, I reiterate as I said in another response. You need to get to know homosexuals on a personal level so that you can understand that your hatred/fear is absolutely unfounded.
