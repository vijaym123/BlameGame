Since when has pedophilia been consensual? Answer: NEVER. The cut here has to do with consent. A young person does not have the mental capacity to consent to anything. Same-sex marriage hurts nobody because it's done by two consenting adults.. BTW, I also support euthanasia, as you mentioned previously, for whatever reason...depression, terminal illness, just tired of life, etc. Again, we boil down to the religious argument. It ALL has to do with religion, and since religion is BS anyway, oh well.
