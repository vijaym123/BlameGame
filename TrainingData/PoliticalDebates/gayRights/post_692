I am old testament as anything. So that I still go with. I just wonder how it still applies that   Christians   can debate what constitutes sin, what the ramifications of that are, etc. when sin, to you guys, is like oxygen. Everyone has it, everyone has it in equal amounts, and no one is any better than anyone else because everyone breathes. A thief is the equivalent of a murderer, a homosexual is the equivalent of a married guy who thinks some other lady is quite attractive. Sin is sin, consummated or unconsummated, as the case may be.
