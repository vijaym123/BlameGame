What is the difference between a gay married couple and a family where one parent got hit by a bus?The nuclear family is a myth these days. A mom, father and 1-3 kids just does not happen anymore. As the saying goes it takes a village to raise a child and even if the child has 2 mommies or two daddies it should not matter because they will still have their opposing gender's roles displayed to them by teachers, other relatives, and even friends parents.The thing is same-sex couples want LEGAL marriage and the rights, protections and obligations associated with it such as immigration rights which married couples have but the current established 'civil unions' for homosexuals do not. Is there something magical about having pieces that dont fit together that should deny them the same rights that heterosexual couples enjoy?I'll take this time to quote the 1st Amendment.Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.CONGRESS shall make no LAW respecting the ESTABLISHMENT of RELIGION. If you want to pawn Marriage off as a religious thing then you had best be prepared to deal with alternative religions that permit same sex couples. If it is not then it becomes a civil rights issue as congress has made laws (tax laws) that respect the establishment of religion (Judeo-Christian ideal of marriage). In either case the result would be the same if one followed the logic of arguing from the Original Position (look it up on Wikipedia)
