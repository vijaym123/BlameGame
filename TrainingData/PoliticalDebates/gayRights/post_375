I have personally tackled this issue most of my life and I can say unconditionally and without reservation, that you are born gay and that there is no choice as to being one or not no matter how old you might be.  Why would anybody want to chose to be gay! We are openly discriminated, are treated as 2nd class citizens in this country and can't legally be married in most states.  I would have loved to be straight and had a loving wife and family and be treated with respect and enjoy all the rights and priviledges in this country.  I had to finally accept in my early 30's, that I am gay and that in I had to accept that reality!  The American Psychiatric Associationa and the American Medical Association have come out strongly for   gay rights   and believe there is nothing inherently wrong in being gay. I am also blessed that my family have always been accepting of my sexual orienta-tion as well as my   church  -the Episcopal Church.
