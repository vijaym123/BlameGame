The dictionary defines marriage as: "the social institution under which a MAN and WOMAN establish their decision to live as HUSBAND and WIFE by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.Some dictionaries, maybe.Merriam-Webster gives us a similar definition, but also "(2) : the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage."Regardless, words change, and dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive: a given dictionary serves only to reflect the usage of words at the time of its printing.so what if someone wanted to marry their pet? Should we allow that too?No, at the very least on the grounds that an animal is incapable of consenting to marriage.People are really starting to lose the understanding of what marriage really means.On this, at least, we agree. Marriage is, in origin, a religious practice, and it should remain so without any legal connotations.My personal preference remains that the state should remove itself completely from the issue of marriage and all legal unions should be "civil unions". Then, every church may decide the capacity of its marriages, but the state would be free to place secular restrictions on civil unions. Thus, polygamist-religions can have their multiple-marriages, conservative christian groups can forbid gay-marriage, liberal-christian groups can allow gay marriage, and the legal benefits in all cases remain the same: none. Then, any two people who want the current legal benefits associated with marriage can file for a civil union in much the same way that they are currently required to file for a "marriage license".
