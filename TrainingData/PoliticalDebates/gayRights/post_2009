A gay guy wanting to marry in a christian church is like a black guy wanting to join the Ku Klux KlanBut Id rather want gay christians to marry then heterosexual christians for gay christians cant have children so they cant spread their stupid beliefs as much as heterosexualsIn terms of going to a city council and get married (for legal reasons) I think any couple regardless of sex should be able to get a certificate of that under law
