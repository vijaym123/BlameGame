This argument has been used many times before and with equal disingenuousness.  This was the same argument used against interracial marriage -- "What about the CHILDREN???? :gasp:"  Research DOES show that the children of same-gender parents do equally as well as the children of opposite-gender parents.  The only "research" which disputes this is the mocked-up garbage disseminated by Focus on the Family, which draws upon studies of children raised by a single parent, generally as the result of traumatic divorce or abandonment.  Stop with the gasping and eyelash fluttering and start speaking the truth for a change.
