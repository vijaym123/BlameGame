How about we list a couple other things the Bible bans:-Leviticus 19:27 - Shaving-Ephesians 5:4 - Cursing-Leviticus 19:16 - Gossip-Leviticus 11:10 - Eating Lobster-Leviticus 11:17 - Eating Pork-Leviticus 19:19 - Cotton/Polyester Blends-Leviticus 15:19-20 - Associating with women who on their periods So now tell me why these shouldn't also be illegal?By making laws based on Bible quotes you are forcing your religion on others.By picking and choosing which Bible quotes to enforce you are being hypociritical.
