Children that grow up with single parents is no different then children that grow up with two fathers, or two mothers. Sexuality doesn't change the person you are. I'm bi, and I'm still the same person that everybody knew me as before they knew i was bi. So if I were to get a girlfriend, and we got married, and we wanted a child, we couldn't get one because we're both females? becuase people don't think the child would grow up like any other child? because people think that we are a disadvantage for that child? ..... your exact words are "children who grow up in any other family form single parent family, divorced, step family, or co-habiting parents- dont' do as well by up to half in these measures compared to children living with their own married mother and father"I don't think that having same sex parents are any different then having opposite sex parents, ok, yeah their the same sex, they have the same parts, but it doesn't matter. They can still provide the money, and the home and everything else needed just as much as an opposite sex couple can.
