You're not precise when you say sin is isolated from a rational world. Authors like CS Lewis in "Mere Christianity" have argued how there is a moral law that trascends religions. If you're interested you can check out that book. Also your quotes are out of the context (bible has to be analised literally, symbolically and historically). If you analize New Testament the circumstance may continue as a sin, but Jesus payed for those sins.
