Well, a problem, which there may be more with this idea of making marriage not a legal issue is that of divorce.  The way it is presently setup the government also deals with divorce, but a divorce case could not be settled in court if the marriage was never considered to be legal or at least something that can be considered legal, however I don't mean to convey that it would make it illegal, just that it wouldn't be covered in our laws anymore.  Oh! and another thing is for those who are atheists or simply don't choose to go to church how would that work?  What I mean to say is simply that the idea is going to take a  lot more than just an idea, it'll have to be covered on all bases to even work....however the intent behind the idea, I don't necessarily disagree with it.
