I hate it when people have to bring politics into everything. Such as talk about the "Right Wing Media "etc. Such stereotyping is no better than Gay bashing as you are painting everything with one stroke. If some people believe that a Gay lifestyle is immoral for example that is their right and you are not going to change them by attacking them. It becomes a problem when they try to take measures that restrict the civil rights of gays. I don't believe that AlanMChambers is doing that. It's well within the rights of the commentator you chastised so much to lead a celibate lifestyle if he chooses without you jumping all over him and criticizing him. Attitudes such as yours do more harm than good to the Gay Rights issue since it alienates people. It's time we talk civilly too each other and try to understand not demonize and preach hate against hate. 2 wrongs don't make a right. Another thing, I read that link and until more research is done and others have replicated the results it cannot be considered a "discovery". Regardless genetic or not nobody chooses to be Gay.
