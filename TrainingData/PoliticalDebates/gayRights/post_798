Contrary to many beliefs that homosexuality is not a sin, I would have to disagree. Homosexuality is much like any sin: lying, stealing, coveting, idolatry, etc. I realize it is a controversial topic in today's society, but it doesn't mean we can ignore the word of God. One thing I do disagree with is: the way homosexuals are treated by Christians and the church. We are all sinners, like Romans 3:23 says: "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." We must understand that homosexuality is a sin, like 1 Corinthians 6:9 says: "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality."The one thing Christians do tend to do is to judge harshly, the homosexuals. I do not believe this should happen. Homosexuality is just one of many sins, and we all sin daily, no matter who we are. Those of us who recognize this and have asked Jesus for forgiveness will be forgiven, but those who dwell and live in sin will not inherit the kingdom of God. I do know many Christians that struggle with homosexuality, but we should encourage them to listen to God's voice. I do believe many homosexuals will and have gone to heaven, those who truly have a relationship with God and try to obey his commandments. On a tighter note, I do stand at the point: homosexuality is still a sin.
