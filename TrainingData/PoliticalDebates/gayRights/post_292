That's an interesting way of looking at things, but if I may be so rude as to question you, I am simply going to ask "WHY do you think you wouldn't be happy?"I grew up with two dads and I would definitely consider myself happier than most. Yet a single case a study does not make. I will, however, say that kids with only one parent or worse yet, NO parents are significantly more UNhappy than MOST kids with two parents...Just a question and a thought, pay me no heed if you wish.
