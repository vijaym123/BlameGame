wow, infanticide necessary.  Ancient Greek reasons were varied but it is no different than the reasons the Chinese and US has for aborting and abandoning their   children  .  Oedepus Rex (play by Sophcles) is poetic justice.  The reasons vary but   society   (me and others with a conscience) know it was wrong and evil.  Just the same as some Germans knew it was wrong but part of their ruling society allowed the Jews to be gassed.
