"You Said "Why do you assume that the expert's experience is illegitimate and just something like a choice to be monogamous?""I neither said nor implied that. Why put words in my mouth. The "experts" experience certainly is legitimate and I have said so in numerous other posts. I do believe that he is Gay but has chosen not to act on it. There's nothing he can do about being Gay just like I could not make myself become attracted to men. He can, and has chosen to live a non gay lifestyle."But you did say that and I copy and pasted it directly from your post. Here is the complete paragraph again copied and pasted. You said that in reference to me not your self."If someone such as the expert can choose to be straight in the sense that they chose to work on it and they changed why are they wrong to consider that people are not born gay or have a choice? Why do you assume that the expert's experience is illegitimate and just something like a choice to be monogamous?"For the record I do not feel the expert's experiences are illegitimate at all, just an exception.From the friendships I've had with Gay men and women since my high school days in the 60's, I firmly believe that a truly Gay person cannot change who they are but can choose not to have sexual contact with members of the same sex, just like I can choose not to cheat on my wife if I'm physically attracted to another women, an attraction over which I have no control. As far as Alan being one of the minority who can "change", he could be bisexual so maybe he can go either way.
