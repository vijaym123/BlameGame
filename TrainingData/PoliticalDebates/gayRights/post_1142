Americans for Truth sounds a bit biased.  Unless there is third party documentation of the incident then I wouldn't trust it.You may think that members of NAMBLA were there... but unless you can show that they were it is just speculation, and without a history of the groups presence as baseless as suggesting that people protesting against   gay marriage   are all members of racist organizations.You think it is un-natural and shameful?  Do you have a non-Biblical reason for that belief?
