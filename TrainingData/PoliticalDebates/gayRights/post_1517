What do you mean by statistically? Are you saying there's statistical evidence? Did you misconstrue my argument? I said if you're able to get pregnant by accident, you're more likely to raise a child you do not want. If you adopt, you're more likely to actually want the child. How many adopted children do you know who resented being adopted? For me, zero. I think your whole argument is on very shaky ground.
