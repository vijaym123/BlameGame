Separation of church and state precludes ban on gay marriage. It is not congress's job to decide who anyone can marry.  Marriage could be considered a form of expression, and the First Amendment gives us the right to freely express ourselves.  The First Amendment also states, "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or abridging the free exercise thereof".
