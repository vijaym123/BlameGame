I find it interesting, but not at all surprising, that the biased and anti-gay rights group thinks it knows more about children than the obvious expert in this argument.Worse, there wasn't even an attempt at making an argument, but that's even less surprising: it's simply not possible to logically argue anti-gay opinions like this. It's because they're nothing more than hate and prejudice founded on absolutely nothing.
