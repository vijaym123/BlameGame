I choose not to be attracted to married people, to my friends girl friends, ect and so on. THIS WHOLE CONCEPT IS FOREIGN to the irresponsible. The idea is foreign to liberals. perhaps some are born with   gay   tendencies or dispositions, it makes no difference. It's not really an issue. They're allowed to have sex, and live in soceity. They don't want that. They want the right not to be looked at as different than straight people. That's irrational. All who wish that should be shot. we do know that people are raised to be gay. That's a fact. We can raise   children   to be gay. Society can do it, we can do it ina lab. We know this, yet we want to redefine the moral trends of   society  . THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO IT.
