If Christian conservatives were sincere in their condemnation of homosexuals on BIBLICAL biblical grounds, as I show on my http://LiberalsLikeChrist.Org/about/God&gays.html they would be just as conscientious about applying the   bible  's teaching that those who don't obey the sabbath demands that are repeated forcefully and frequently in "God's Word".  How many rich Republicans would support such "Christian conservatives" for public offices, if they were demanding that people not work, or shop, or go to   entertainment   events one out of seven days every week?!?In contrast to a few rare and obscure references to   homosexuality   in the O.Testament, the sabbath command is one of the TEN GREAT COMMANDMENTS, and the penalty required by the bible is DEATH.How many show the sincerity of their view of "God's Word" by their insistance that people either obey the 4th commandment or DIE?!? (I would have asked, "should homosexuals be treated as parriahs?" (even if you view it as one of the MANY behaviors condemned by the bible)
