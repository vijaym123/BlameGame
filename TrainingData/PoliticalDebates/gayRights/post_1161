The exessive divorce rate degrades the principal of marriage much more than two same-sex persons making (and keeping!) a commitment to each other. Every day it seems I am bombarded by a co-worker who is now going through a divorce. Not to mention, that it is none of our buisness, and doesn't bother or hurt my marriage at all. My psyche is much more damaged by the heterosexual couples murdering each other plastered all over the news, than the pictures of other couples getting married. We all deserve the same happiness, and joy where we can find it.
