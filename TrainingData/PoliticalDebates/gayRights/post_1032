I believe that same sex couples should be able to get married.  When people are in love, they should be able to get married, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Same sex couples should be treated the same as straight couples, and should have the same rights as straight people.  Just because they like someone of the same sex doesn't mean they're any different from people who are straight.
