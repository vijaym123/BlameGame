"Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not innate and not a civil right."If anything, this is the red herring. The point I bring up when I invoke Dred Scott v. Sandford is that Justice Traney and the Justices that followed him used flat-out originalist thinking when forming their opinion. They -didn't care about justice- at all. They cared about what the founding fathers (allegedly) thought about, and nothing else. All I said was that originalist viewpoints cannot stand on their own.Homosexuality being a choice is irrelevant to discussion.Personal appeals are irrelevant to law.Are you about to tell me not only (1) that your experience is more valuable than someone else's, and (2) that we should all follow your opinion? Perhaps I think being a   vegetarian   is more healthy than eating   meat  , yet I'm not about to pose the same standards upon you.
