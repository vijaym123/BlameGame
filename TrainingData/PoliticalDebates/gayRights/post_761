"Thirdly, consider yourself dead to your old nature and your carnal nature. Don't obey the lust of your flesh, rather subject yourself to the Spirit of God and live for God."Torturing yourself is not healthy. What your are saying is that you must torture yourself to obey god's supposed "word." What kind of god would want a person to do that? The only logical conclusion I can think of is a cruel one.It's like you've made it some sort of "righteous test" in your mind; something you think you need to overcome - but what you can't see is that a god that would do that to a person isn't worth worshiping in the first place.
