If only civil unions would afford the same benefits as marriages, I might stand to agree with you.However, many people can think of over 1,000 reasons why they're unequal."According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least 1,049 legal protections andresponsibilities from the federal government, including the right to take leave from work to care for afamily member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes, and Social Security survivorbenefits that can make a difference between old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of these critical legal protections."  http://www.massequality.org/ourwork/marriage/marriagevscivilunions.pdf
