Two people of the same sex getting married is just two people playing house.  It has nothing to do with hate or discrimination.  It has to do with what is right or wrong.  Allowing gay marriage is just showing that the society is going deeper into moral decay. God is the one that created marriage & it is between one man and one woman anything else apart from that is not of God therefore, cannot be called a marriage.Some people might say God does not judge them well let's clarify that.  While you are alive on this earth in your mortal body God has not yet pass judgment on anyone because he wants everyone to be saved and that means accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life, because after death is the judgment.  Everyone will give have to an account on the type of life they lived here on earth.Does God allow each of us to make our own choices? Yes, but know this every decision you make has consequences.  The Bible said in Revelation 2l verse 8, "But the cowardly, the unbelieving the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars-their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  This is the second death."  I am not making this up it is already written.
