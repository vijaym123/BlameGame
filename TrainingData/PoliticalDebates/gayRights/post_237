To tell the truth approx. 40% of   children   raised in same-sex families grow up to practice   homosexuality  . That comes from a conference in Rome several years ago where many psychologists spoke on this subject and infact this was a proven fact mentioned at this conference. Making   adoption   the number one recruitment tool for homosexual activists.To tell the truth the above statement regarding how brutal most homosexal activists are is more indicative of the whole population than you have implied. One would only have to recall the protests after Prop. 8 passed in Calif. to get a real picture of how brutal this organization really is at the core.To say anything otherwise is paint a false picture of this community.To tell the truth to place children into homosexual families is to put them at significant risk for abuse. Quote: Pedophiles are invariably males: Almost all sex crimes againstchildren are committed by men.Significant numbers of victims are males: Up to one-third of all sexcrimes against children are committed against boys (as opposed togirls).Rest of article can be read here:  http://www.hope7.highpowersites.com/page/page/4563078.htm   I could go on and on but if you google " statistics on homosexuality" it will shock the boots off your feet.The best scenerio for children is a home with a mother and father, the next best is with at least one of their biological parents. Just what I have researched and find quite grounded in truth.
