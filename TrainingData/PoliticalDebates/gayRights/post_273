We can only speak from experience and conjecture.  Anecdotes, unfortunately, are all we have right now when talking about this topic.  If there was some way to objectively gauge whether a child being raised in a   safe  , secure and calm heterosexual home was any better-off (or perhaps worse-off) than a child being raised in a safe, secure and calm homosexual home then we could talk about this topic intelligently.  All we can do right now is make analogies and comparisons while talking about our own conjecture and limited experiences.  I am personally witnessing a boy being raised in a lesbian home and have been watching him grow for the last 15 years (he is 15 years old).  The couple raising him are very intelligent and caring individuals, but there just seems something odd about the young man, the way he acts and talks, the things he says, are all odd, I will not go into detail, however, there definitely is something off about him.  Beyond that, I am not even sure it is causal, perhaps he would have been odd if raised by a heterosexual couple, I cannot know this, however, in the current lack of knowledge that we have as a culture, I am opposed to homosexual   parenting  .
