"Those who would reject this law find themselves in opposition to the Divine intent for mankind, a reality that every culture from the dawn of civilization has either recognized Ð or failed to acknowledge at its peril."Oh, that's convenient.  All civilizations have condemned homosexuality.  And those that didn't... well, they died -because- they didn't condemn homosexuality.  The other civilizations fell for other reasons.As for past civilizations who did not condemn homosexuality... I'm currently doing research, and my list looks something like this:Zuni community (late 19th c.)Roman community (4th c.)Egypt (2600 B.C.)Mesopotamian codes (2375 B.C., 2100 B.C., 1750 B. C., 1726 B.C., circa 800 B.C.)Plato and other contemporary philosophers (4th c. B.C.)Classical Greek philosophers (Cicero and Curio, no date)Native Americans (1500s - 1800s at least)Not comprehensive in the least, and clearly not all civilizations condemned homosexuality.
