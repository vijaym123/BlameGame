What is perhaps just as logically flawed claims of "unnatural" homosexuality is the rhetoric of victimization that this organization claims for the conservative agenda. By twisting the truth into a depiction of the "seemingly invincible juggernaut of the gay agenda," this conservative group attempts to appear as a political underdog-- trying to evoke pity as a proxy for support. I wish that the gay agenda had the type of corporate dollars, supporters in the White House and other forms of financial and personal resource the conservative Christian agenda funnels to our nation's political system-- as this expert seems to claim. Then we would have an equal footing for debate. Until then, do not mistake the persistent inequality of political power based on this organization's skewed vision. Let's continue fighting for the true equality of all families!
