I say yes just because homosexuality falls under the same category as lust, doesn't it? I haven't gotten far in the bible (it's so boring) but I'm not aware of anything, yet, about it saying anything bad about man with man. Otherwise, in the world of religion, it's probably a sin, but in reality, not in my opinion, because I don't believe in sins. :-)
