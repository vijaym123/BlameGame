And maybe discuss the difference between "Judeo-Christian", "Judaic", and "Christian."Firstly, Judeo-Christian was a word that was invented by Christians and confuses and worries most Jews. Jews and Christians have very different ideas around morality, the nature of willpower and mankind, what role the laws play in every day life, etc. So let's create that disconnect, please.Judaic morality says that, at best, men lying with men is a sort of odd, inexplicable thing and at worst is an abominable act. On the subject of lesbianism, there's no rule against it, but since it was practiced by the Egyptians, we're supposed to not do it.Very few of the mitzvhot are moral in nature. Few can debate the MORALITY of keeping kosher. We can discuss the USEFULNESS of it, but the morality is somewhat seperate.Also, Quincey, in response to your statement: "Judeo-Christian morality excludes all other religious and non-religious morality." should really read "Christian morality". Jewish morality has very specific people to whom it applies, namely Jews. If you're not one of us, we do not and should not care what you do. Jews will probably not like same-sex marriages being performed in their temples, but throughout the US at least, most Jews support it, filing it under "things that don't really affect us but make some people happy".Anyways. JudeoChristian=not a thing. Thanks.
