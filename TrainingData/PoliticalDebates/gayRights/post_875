Smurph your arguments are not as good as you think.  There is no such thing as consentual pedophilia because minors can't legally consent.  Your argument makes absolutely no sense.  Try looking at this issue from a purely logical point of view.  I'm not gay, so I don't have any reason to feel strongly about this, except that the logic is clear.  There is no good argument against same sex marriage.  All arguments against are purely emotional.  Take a few minutes and really ponder this.
