While individuals may chose to agree with or not agree with Same-Sex marriages, including religions, the California Supreme Court has ruled that Same-Sex Marriage and Traditional Marriage are the same (please read the California Supreme Court consolidated "In Re Marriage Cases"), and as such, cannot be legally distinguished or separated. What now happens to individuals or religious institutions who continue to separate them, or to disagree with Same-Sex Marriage. Their right to hold an opinion is now legally weakened. In fact, Catholic Adoption Services in Massachusetts, where Same-Sex Marriage is also legal, has been legally told to include Same-Sex couples in their adoption services or to shut down their operations. Thus, while the Catholic Adoption Services do not "agree" with Same-Sex Marriage, they have been forced to either accept it or close down. The right to disagree has been taken away, and this is only one of several cases I have heard of where even non-profit organizations, religious organizations, and business have been fined for not "agreeing" with Same-Sex Marriage. Those who believe Same-Sex Marriage is a matter of opinion and should not be forced on all should vote Yes on Proposition 8.
