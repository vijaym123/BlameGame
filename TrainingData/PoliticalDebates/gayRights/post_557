To Setfree,The only issue I would have with your well reasoned arguments is that all of the evidence listed comes from the same book, a book which has a definate bias from the outset. Fair enough, if the stats prove correct it doesn't matter what the authors bias is, the quoted statistics are somewhat unambiguous. I would be very surprised if they held up to the scrutiny of a statician. I have looked around the internet briefly for the studies he quotes in his bibliography and found that one survey (Linn et al 1989) was entitled "Recent sexual behaviors among homosexual men seeking primary medical care" and was a study of knowledge of AIDS, HIV and safe sex practises in people who are suspected of infection. (ie why they were vulnerable to it).Another; (seage et al 1992) was a study of patients at AIDS-related clinics and their sexual partners. If the entire sample field is questioned in an STD clinic or doctors surgery, is it maybe conceivable that a large proportion would have STD's? Why else would they be there in the first place? Does he compare this sample to heterosexuals at STD clinics? I imagine he would find promiscuity artificially high, STD rate equally high and probably recreational drug and alcohol use also high.You did however say that there is more sure data so if you'd let us know what it is I'd love to have a look.
