 Children always benefit from having two parents opposed to just one, regardless of whether they are straight or not "Single-parent mom" is an all too frequent term. It is costly to children, primarily from the standpoint of having half the support that a child deserves. Married gay couples can provide twice the support that a single parent can provide, and this is always a good thing.
