I believe that we are making a mistake to dismiss the relationship between   homosexuality   in humans and sexual orientation among   animals  .  Man is classified as a member of the animal kingdom, and despite the fact the we are Spiritual creatures as well, we share common characteristics with the animal kingdom.  As I had mentioned elsewhere, I consider myself to be a Spiritual believer in the Heavenly Father and His Son.  Before the creation of Adam and Eve, Satan brought into the mortal Universe sin, which corrupted much of what God had intended for this world.  Adam and Eve agreed to commit themselves to sin, after being tempted and led into by Satan.  As a result, their offspring and all generations of human beings after them would be stained by the results of their actions.  From a Christian standpoint, this would include the genetic alteration of sexual orientation itself, which affected both people and animals.  To say that it is wrong for us to align the sexual orientations of people and animals is to ignore the reality of evil and its ability to originate from the soul.  Scripture tells us that humans are basically "born of sin," which means that once our innocence in infancy has passed, our natural desires gain hold, and sin takes control.  As a result, animals and humans have been altered by the decisions that Adam and Eve had chosen in the Garden.  And that includes our gene pool, which determines our sexuality before birth.  More often than not, this is not a choice.  This is indeed something determined before birth because of sin, which came into the world before Adam was formed.  My apologies to the many decent   law  -abiding gay and lesbian people reading this: It is not a sin to be homosexual, and I have the highest respect for all people.  Thanks for sharing.
