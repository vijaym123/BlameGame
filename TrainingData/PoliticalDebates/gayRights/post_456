Infanticide has never been acceptable in the US... although it was practiced in the days before birth control and   abortion  , and widely. I don't believe there is a society that has never practiced it. Yeah, we're in agreement. I think it's important to remember there are those two sides of the coin, and jumped in only to add a little weight to that point. It's true that homosexuality being a perfectly natural thing doesn't mean that it's inherently good. It also doesn't make it inherently evil. Just like, well, heterosexuality.
