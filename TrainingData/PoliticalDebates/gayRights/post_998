Tamara,I think you would do well to to read about the actual writing of the US constitution and the bill of rights as well as the debates over religion and state laws that took place in Virginia prior to our founding documents. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were very clear about what they thought should be the founding principles of this country.Besides, not kill and not steal are pretty universal laws, they even existed before Moses received the stones they were written on.
