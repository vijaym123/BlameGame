Societies frequently practiced infanticide, because they had no birth control and no measures to help single mothers or too many babies at once. "Natural" was "necessary." The Greeks looked down on heterosexuality because it seemed "natural" to them; it was an animal thing, and thus homosexuality was "higher." Heterosexuality isn't "right" because it's "natural," either. We deem it right when healthy adults identify as it and build good relationships with it, and deem it wrong when it's misused, as when it's done without consent or with a minor.
