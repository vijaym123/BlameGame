Can you juts give examples of what kind of things that   kids   raised by homosexual parents would struggle to understand but which kids raised by heterosexuals would find a given!?At the centre of your argument is this disturbing assumption that kids raised by heterosexuals are just better, more balanced in their general deminure, that the homosexual run household is comparable to a ghetto while the heterosexual run household is automatically more of a suburb and hence kids raised there can more easily become the president of the USA as compared to kids raised by homosexual couples simply because the one parent has a penis and the other a vulva. I also find quite naive and absurdthis this assertion that because we are all male we are locked in a certain mode of uniform thinking, that we have the same way of seeing, analyzing and doing things. I differ with a lot of men in seeing and doing things and incidentally a lot of my thinking and behaviour is inline with that of numeous women, which is just a coincidence because I differ with a lot of women in my thinking and doing in just about the same measure. Individuals and their values make good parents not their genitals and genitals do not predispose people to any set rule in thinking or doing things, popular culture and the roles it assignes to the sexes in rearing   children   maybe but not the genitals of the parents.Thre is nothing that you can say about how heterosexual couples see and do things that you cannot say about homosexual couples when it comes to raising children. The disavantages that kids raised in homosexual homes face are all a result of the very unfounded sense of false superiority and entitlement that kids raised in heterosexual homes have which they inturn get from their parents such as yourself.
