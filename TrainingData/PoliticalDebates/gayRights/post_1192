I couldn't keep a straight face reading this. It would also have helped you realize your last sentence isn't even a sentence.To put more care into rebutting your argument than was put into framing it:A parent can't marry their child because it would be psychologically abusive; the parent is in a position of authority over their child. This is not comparable to relationships between consenting adults.Two- to three-partner marriages have died out not because of wisdom, but because of social equality between the sexes and the rise of industrialization, which means money is no longer represented in land, families are more mobile socially and geographically, and marriages have lost diplomatic value. It means that a rich man no longer needs to collect wives as representatives of the land he's acquired and tokens gathered to assure good relations with his neighbors. Polygamy and polyandry are also usually inequal-power relationships. None of this has anything to do with two unrelated adults who are in love, want to marry, and cannot based purely on the laws of the society they live in.
