To merely say "We do not know, therefore yes, people can be born gay" is not an argument for this position.  As others have pointed out, it is more closely a refusal of the position than a support thereof.  I portend that the only conclusion that can come from this debate is both sides (and people in the middle) to just throw up their hands and say some form of "So what?".  Are people born gay? Yes, so what?Are people born gay? No, so what? I completely agree that human sexuality is not binary by any means; but this does not attempt to answer the question, "Are people born gay?"
