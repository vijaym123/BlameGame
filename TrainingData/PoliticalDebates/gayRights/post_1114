According to this logic, then, marriage as a civil issue should be separate from the church.The issues for those in support of gay marriage are civil.  It seems that those in opposition are against the state telling the church what to do.I agree with both stances.  So is it therefore logical to no longer commingle church and state activities with legal church-marriages?  That seems like a fine solution to me.Gays just want the rights of marriage, that being state-sanctioning of their marriage which has everything to do with power of attorney, healthcare benefits, and financial death benefits.  Do those who oppose gay marriage really have an issue with those things?  It is not likely (I'm sure there are some yeses) that the majority don't want other people to do as they will.  They simply don't want their religious institution to be dictated by the state as I now understand it.Brady, thanks for clearing this up for me!  So, can we agree to simply separate marriage as separate civil and religious institutions?  Would that appease both sides?
