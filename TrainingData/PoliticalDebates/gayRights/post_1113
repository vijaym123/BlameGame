Ever heard of separation of church and state? It was originally made to keep the state out of the church... No religious institution should be forced to do anything. Religious institutions are supposed to be houses of freedom from cynical, politically correct, immoral, and oppressive natures of society (and i'm not saying this because i'm a regular church-goer. I haven't been to church in months). If a religious institution chooses not to recognize a same-sex marriage, or anything else for that matter, more power to them!
