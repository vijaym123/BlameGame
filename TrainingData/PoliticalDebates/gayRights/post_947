Yes, because we love each other.  And because we want to be able to protect our children with ALL the same rights of marriage with which straight people are able to to protect their children.  These are CIVIL rights, attached to CIVIL marriage, and were created by society as a safety-net available to citizens of this nation in exchange for making commitments to care for one's spouse and children, thereby relieving society of some of the risk it faces.  Many of the rights and benefits of marriage are specifically for the benefit and protection of children, and many gay families DO have children.  Denial of basic civil rights to such families is a punishment to the children of gay parents simply because of who their parents are.  This is not the kind of society we subscribe to in this country.
