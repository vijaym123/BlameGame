I understand what you are saying however, if marriage keeps 'evolving' soon it could be considered marriage between a chair and a desk.  That is a little to the extreme but where do we draw the line between marriage and just unionized?  Marriage is not going to mean much to those who take it as what it began as. It wouldn't be as special.
