While females are paid 75 cents to every dollar a man earns, I can't agree with your idea that the sexes are similar enough.I'm also not sure which inherent differences you're referring to, or which damage. Please understand, however, that I just a few days ago read a Victorian-era screed that decried young women of good families going to work as governesses. The author's reasoning was because their taking jobs unseated social order, caused breakdown in the class system, and caused woes to women that in turn drove them to feminism and caused men to disrespect the gentler sex. And while science does agree there are some innate differences between men and women, this is a description, not a prescription.
