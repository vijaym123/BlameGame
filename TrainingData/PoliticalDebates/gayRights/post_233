How does growing up in a family with two parents of the same sex put a child at greater risk for domestic violence and sexual abuse as this argument proposes? That would be a great example of ad hominem: you can't use your opinions of the care-takers sexual preference as a vice for whether or not they will be good parents, or sexual abuse their kids. That's really just sick.
