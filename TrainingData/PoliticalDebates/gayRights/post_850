But what do we do in relationship?  How do we treat our loved ones?  People mess up in biblical interpretation when they either try to remove New Testament requirements of obedience or they once again put back on the "yoke of slavery" (the law) that they have been freed from.  The fact is that true relationship demands love.  Loving someone is wanting what's best for the person you love.  What father or mother in their right minds, would want their child to do anything that would harm them?   I often here people quote out of context Matthew 7 about not judging others.  People respond indignantly when anyone challenges their beliefs or their choice of lifestyles and simply say, "didn't Jesus say not to judge."  Well actually, in Matthew 7:5, Jesus tells us to judge our brothers and sisters in Christ.  What he is condemning is hypocrisy, not judging.  In other words, he is condemning being "judgmental," not judging your brother or sister in Christ.  Read the passage.  It says, "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."   In other words, if you have taken the time to examine yourself and to deal with your own sin, you can then, and only then, more on to judging a brother or sister in Christ for their sin issues.  But this must be done in love?  Speak the truth in love and so on and so forth . . .
