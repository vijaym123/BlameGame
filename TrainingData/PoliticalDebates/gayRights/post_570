"Furthermore, all research shows that sexuality is fairly well solidified by the time a child is born". That's a pretty strong and absolute statement about something that is impossible to determine. Sorry but saying that has no credibility at all and will reduce the credibility of anything else you say (even if I agree with it). The fact is it seems that being Gay is determined before puberty but when and how has never been established.
