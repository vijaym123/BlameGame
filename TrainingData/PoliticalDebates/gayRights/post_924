Its about legal rights...hospital visitation, getting into an ambulance, tax incentives.  These are not the same for domestic partners.  Its exactly like having separate "but equal" drinking fountains or restrooms--or sitting in the back of the bus.  Religions don't have to bless these unions, however its up to the government of the people to treat people fairly and bestow the same rights.
