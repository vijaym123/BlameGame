How is it that this is out of context? Just because those of us who are less educated say something is out of context does not mean it is so. They are referring to loving, caring relationships between two adults as "an untested social experiment" and you say that it is out of context? Sorry, I beg to differ.Also, I would like to   add   that it is unethical to deny gay men and lesbians the right to adopt. Hell, the   children   will come out better people with stronger character because of the fact that they have successfully confronted homophobia in their lives. Much like children from interracial couples have overcome issues of   race   and identity, as well as prejudice from many groups of people.Love has everything to do with a proper, healthy family. That is what these gay men and lesbians seek to form, a proper, healthy family. I am afraid that you cannot debate my comment on it's merits so you choose to cry "out of context! out of context!". I have distorted nothing and deep down, you know this. It is unfortunate that you choose to attack my argument rather than debate. Shame.
