I like that idea - wow, I think it was actually Christianity that brought that concept, or should I say, Biblical teaching, to   society  .  Look back over history who did and didn't treat people as equals.  Jesus, whether you believe he was the Son of God or just another historical figure, he was shown in several texts (other than the Bible) to treat people equally (men AND women - which was unheard of in the day.Both Hitler and Stalin, self described Atheists, certainly didn't treat or believe people were equal - there were superior people, and inferior people.Mother Theresa Ð treated people as equals.Billy Graham Ð treated people as equals.President Obama Ð he believes those with same gender attraction issues should be given special consideration when it comes to crimes against them Ð i.e. the Hate Crime bill.How about the potential Justice Sonia Sodemeyor Ð she believes giving preferential treatment to minorities is justified.  However, who is in that minority is really up to her.
