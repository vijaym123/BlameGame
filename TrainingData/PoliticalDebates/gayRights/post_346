You distort the work of legitimate scientists and claim that it proves things it does not prove.  I have already presented some of the scientific evidence which supports my claims elsewhere in this discussion.  I see no need to restate it over and over simply because you will not read the rest of the discussion.And, yes, I'm sure you have recruited a handful of members from other religions who share your anti-gay bias to help push your agenda of depriving gay people of civil rights and reasonable treatment and acceptance by the society to which they contribute equally with other citizens.  I'd be very interested, however, to see a percentage breakdown of the religious affiliations of your membership and leadership.  I think my point would be immediately crystal clear to the most casual reviewer.As to "religious bigotry," I'm surprised you'd even dare to twist those words to apply them to your critics.  Talk about not being able to see past the beam in your own eye.
