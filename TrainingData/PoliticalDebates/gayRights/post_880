Then why cant a 42 year old man marry a consenting 13 year old??!! Especially, "they aren't hurting anyone!"  SSM advocates have made the treacherous and unintelligent comparative analogy to racial discrimination; and it will be one of the many of your own arguments, by which their agenda will be exposed. Apples to Oranges! An attorney representing pedophiles, and many other such groups, will have a MUCH MORE ACCURATELY CLOSER comparative analogy to legalizing SSM and homosexuality, than SSM advocates have to "racial" discrimination. Ok, so then using your argument, a cultural or tribal or religious sect should also be allowed to practice human sacrifice; as was percieved as appropriate and acceptable in many cultures.  Who are any of us to say that perspective is wrong and should not be tolerated? See, you (plural) are doing it again.
