Marriage by its very definition cannot be performed on same sex partners.Webster: the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by lawCalling it marriage is changing the very definition of the word. That is like calling someone a homosexual and deciding that the definition means they like the opposite sex.Now, if you want to call it something different. That is fine. I have no issues with two males or two females being joined to receive the tax and family benefits of married couples. As long as they also have to go through the long, drawn out process of divorce when they decide they don't want to be together anymore.
