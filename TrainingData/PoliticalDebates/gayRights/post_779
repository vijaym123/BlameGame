How much more specific could the scriptures be?"The problem with your viewpoint is that you begin with two false presuppositions.a. That Paul is talking about committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships in Romans 1:26-27b. That Paul agrees with your twenty first century viewpoint on homosexuality.Paul is not dealing with homosexuality as such in Romans 1. That is not at all his point. His argument is about IDOLATRY and he mentions shrine prostitution as evidence of idolatry.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html
