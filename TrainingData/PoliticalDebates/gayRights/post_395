Yes, of course. They choose to go against any ridiculous moral attitude by risking their lives (or only their friends, or their   jobs  ). For hundreds, if not thousands of years, they were discriminated against in many societies, they were punished, tortured, burned, killed just for loving somebody of the same sex. And why did they love someone of the same sex? Because they love the risk. They are real risk hunters, and they dream about to die, or at least to be beaten up or punished. Admit it, come on: YOU ALSO LOVE THE RISK - GO GAY AND TRY HOW MUCH FUN IT IS!!!!
