Nope! What's wrong about homosexuality? I think that it is a personal choice.Marriage is about union of two souls, not two genders. As long as the couples love each other, no matter they are a gay or a lesbian, they do have their rights to get married, no one should have stop them. Although homosexuals can't reproduce, they could adopt those homeless children as their child.The reason why some people who think that homosexuality is morally wrong is because it is against their religion but do they ever think about others? Must others gonna be same as them. No one has the rights to force others to do things because in this 21st century, everyone do have their freedom!
