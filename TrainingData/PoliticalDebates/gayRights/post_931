Discrimination is discrimination and it’s always wrong.  How would the civil rights movement progressed if we had asked the people of Alabama to decide for themselves if they wanted to integrate or not.  The only difference here is the discrimination is not as closely tied to location.  When will we ever learn, civil rights and social transparency benefits everyone.  Discrimination hurts everyone, not just the discriminated, but also the discriminators and society in general.  Gays disproportionately contribute to society.  The sooner they are allowed to fully express themselves, the sooner we will all be better off.
