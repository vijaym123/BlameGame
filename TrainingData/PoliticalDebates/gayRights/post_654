If what you say is true, and a murderer, rapist, or someone who is an awful person all of their lives, repents before death and goes to heaven, and yet a gay man/woman who hurts no one, but seems to "offend" people just by being themselves, can not go to heaven because they won't repent.......then that God is a not a God to me anymore, but the devil.  I'm not religious as you can tell.  This country was founded on religious freedom, and yet it seems we have no freedom not to believe what others choose for us to believe.  I am not "saved" and I have not "found jesus" yet.  Most likely I never will.  Maybe that means I will go to hell, however, isn't that my choice to make and God's responsibility, not everyone else's, to judge me?  Because it seems to me, that all the religious followers seem to think God can't handle his job, and want to do all the judging for him.  Well, if you truly believe he is all powerful and is the one to judge him, why can't we leave homosexuals alone?  Go after the really bad people, who hurt other people all the time, and then when that situation is taken care of, then take care of the lesser evils as you see them.
