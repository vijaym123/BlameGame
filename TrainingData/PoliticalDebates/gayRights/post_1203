#originalTopic=should-marriage-for-same-sex-couples-be-legal
Popular culture has labeled the issue, as has this website, a question of "should marriage for same-sex couples be legal?"The question can be asked another way, which those for same-sex marriage like to avoid: "Should we change the definition of marriage?"Marriage as it stands is one of the central cultural institutions in Western Civilization and 3000 years of wisdom as well as countless scientific studies show that a good mother and father are the best situation to raise a child in.  Does this mean other situations can't be good?  No.  It just means other situations are better.Same-sex marriage expands the definition of marriage, and in doing so, states that having two mommies is just as good as a mommy and a daddy.  This denies the inherent differences between men and women and their value to child rearing.If we can redefine marriage, saying we know better than 3000 years of human wisdom because our hearts tell us so, doesn't that mean we can have compassion for any change?
