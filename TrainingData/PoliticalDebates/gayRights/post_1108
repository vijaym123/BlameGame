Marraige is the union between a MAN and a WOMAN.  If it is not between two DIFFERENT sexes, then it is not Marraige.  Civilly Unionized is the word they must use... unless they decide to take the initive to create a new word.  Either way, Marraige is not between a man and a man or a woman and a woman.
