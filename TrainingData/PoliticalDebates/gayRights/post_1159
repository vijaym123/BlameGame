It seems to me that most of the confusion here has to do with the usage of the term "marriage" in both a legal and a religious sense. When you write "the real thing" here, I think you fall into that same trap. What defines the real thing? You mean marriage as a sacrament, or at least marriage as sanctioned by your religious framework.My question to you: how do you feel about people outside of your religious community getting married? Their rules for marriage are different from yours (some slightly, some vastly). Do you think that anyone with a set of expectations for marriage that differ from yours is cheapening marriage for you and those like you? If so, what you are advocating is a ban on all marriages of people with other faiths. If not, you disagree with your own argument. Christian marriage is no more harmed by homosexuals being married than it is by Jews or Muslims getting married. (I could just as easily have written Catholic marriage vs. Methodist or Presbyterian, for that matter.)
