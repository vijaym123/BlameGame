Being brought up by two lesbian parents and being a boy with no male role model in my life (other than gay friends of my mom's) i would have to say that it does not put you at a disadvantage.Kids will pick on you for a huge list of reasons. If that means i was saved from names such as 'big head' or 'four eyes' because   children   would choose to focus on the sexual orrientation of my parents, so be it.Both my moms gave me love and attention and supported me through   education  , relationships and anything they could.I must say that i am a very camp man but i harbor no homosexual desires, im completely straight. This is without any heterosexual influence.Now im in my late   teens  , i didnt go to   college  , unfortunatly but instead i work in a large investment bank, earning as much as any  graduate in my job.In conclusion having gay parents hasnt affected me, i have a nice job, a beautifull   girlfriend   and im debt free. This is all the product of the so called 'broken home'
