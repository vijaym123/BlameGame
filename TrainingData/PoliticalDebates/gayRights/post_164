It's ironic you advise me to relax. I take it for granted some will find what I have to say interesting and even agreeable while others will not. I thank you for making your position with regard to that particular fence clear. As it happens, I have no real need of others to read what I write or to agree with its content. Neither of these are reasons for the thinking and writing involved. Take that to mean your discomfort and/or disagreement is irrelevant to me. Perhaps you are shocked because you are ill-acquainted with this level of discussion. It is an unfamiliarity easily remedied by further experience beyond your usual comfort zones.Perhaps, in the future, you'll find it within you to intelligently address what is being said, not for the sake of the writer/thinker, but for your own.
