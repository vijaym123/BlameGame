I have issues with people claiming either "yes" or "no." Let's say you believe "no." Does that mean you get to have sex with whomever you want? Most of my male gay friends couldn't lead a monogamous relationship if God himself came down, slapped them in the face with a turkey, and said "dude, seriously? Knock it off." Maybe that's just the crowd I run around with. But if you sleep with everything that casts a shadow, whether you're gay or straight, you're still a slut. And I'm pretty sure the bible outlines God's feelings towards sluts. Also, if you believe having sex before marriage constitutes as a sin and you're still living in one of those states that doesn't allow same sex marriage...you can see how this could be a problem...If you say "yes" to the whole "homosexuality is a sin" that's fine. You're entitled to your beliefs. But I have never seen Christians fail so wholly on the concept "love the sinner hate the sin" more than on the subject of homosexuality.
