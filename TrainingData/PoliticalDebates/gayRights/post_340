I agree with the cold distant reasoning you have.  However, we have to realize that sex acts are not separate from some of societies ills.  You can argue that is where laws and   religion   come in, which you are right.  However, if one claims that sex has no consequences/results that is being unrealistic. One (I believe) reason for the concern of   homosexuality   is the results or the symptoms of society and what does that tell us of that societies path.  You did mention that earth will happily turn around and around the sun without humans.  It is the same as a person thinking about suicide and realizing that life still goes on without that person.  On a personal human level-that is very unsatisfactory.  Which leads us to another thought "Value of human life or life in general", which can lead to the concepts of human rights and equal rights.  In the big scheme of things (big picture) if there is no real value transcendent beyond the chemical make up of humans then what you say is true and fine.  However, societies believe different....wars...inventions...prolonging life...civil rights...Striving to live and beyond that the value of human life.    I appreciate your calmness.
