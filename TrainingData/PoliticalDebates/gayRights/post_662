You are misquoting scripture, bagpiper.  The passage to which you refer says for a man not to "lie with another man in beds of woman."  While the meaning of this seems a bit obscure, it clearly is not a blanket condemnation of all same-gender sexuality.  First, it doesn't even apply to women.  Second, there is that troubling reference to "in beds of woman."  It would seem to indicate to me that a man who engages in sexual activity with another man in his wife's bed is being condemned here; not surprising, considering that this would be both a situation where someone who is ostensibly heterosexual is engaging in homosexual acts for some reason, and, perhaps more importantly, is commiting adultery in his own wife's bed.
