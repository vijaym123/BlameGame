It is the adherance to the belief system that you display in your comment that has gotten this country where it is today..And, I belief, the same process that brought about the destruction of multiple civilizations.  The minimization of Scripture; the pompous belief that man has Truth, or at least has the capability of finding Truth; that we as people are born "good"; that there is no "right" or "wrong" in this world; that there is no afterlife, or consequences for our current behaviors or liefstyles--these are all consequences of modern thoughts/beliefs.  Let me boil this down to one question: Would it be wrong for an adult male to sexually abuse a female infant?  The child will have no recollection of the event(s), so no "harm" was technically done, and it fulfilled the deranged desires of the abuser.  What would you do if this happened to YOUR daughter?This absurd example is an extreme, used to highlight the fallacy and illogical nature of modern "logic."God's reality and commands never lead to anything "disgusting."  The Old Testament commands about 'putting to death' is hyperbole.  For example, to my knowledge, there are no records showing that disrespectful children were put to death.  I believe social commands such as this one were given to highlight the importance of and to decree the exact social hierarchy/structure (e.g. the role and respect given to parents; their influence and control over their children).
