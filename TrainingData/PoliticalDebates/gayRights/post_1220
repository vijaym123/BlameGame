The ADF is not objecting to the fact that children so far in our limited research have done well with two parents.  In a situation where there is a loving same-sex couple willing to adopt a child that otherwise would have no family, that choice is obvious.The issue lies with Lambda Legal's refusal to acknowledge the ADF's point.  Allowing same-sex marriage makes a statement to society, whether you agree or not, that a male parent and a female parent is no longer ideal.  It deprives a child of the inherent right to have a mother and a father as an ideal family.  Once a society removes that distinction, it can no longer say that a child should have a mother and father if possible instead of a same-sex set of parents.At heart is the fact that this denies the scientifically documented (as if we needed it) differences between men and women.  Removing that ideal of both sexes from a child's upbringing deprives them of exposure to both sexes and denies that that makes any difference.
