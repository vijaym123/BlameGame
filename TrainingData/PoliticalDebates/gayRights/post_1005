I think you are mistaken about gay marriage, Jesus never said anything about it. What we read in the bible are what they think Jesus said and even they don't agree about many things in relation to Jesus, so not a good arguing point.However, the bible is clear that it is anti homosexual, so your right among "believers" and the "faithful", most likely your mind won't be changed to accept gay marriage. This means that you, your fellow church friends and the church itself should stay out of what is really a secular question on discrimination. Since, before we ever get the proof of whether or not heaven exists, marriage has many secular implications. Peoples taxes, property rights, health and death issues, all fall into the realm of secular legislation and as such, our government is expected to treat all people equally. This puts your feelings and faith second but it is the right thing to do.
