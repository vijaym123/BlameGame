I don't remember ever choosing to be gay. As long as I can remember, even when I was around ten years old, I had emotional feelings for boys my age that I did not feel toward girls. I liked girls then, and I like women now, but my emotional feelings are different toward women than toward men, and my sexual feelings toward women are nonexistent.If I had been given a choice I most likely would have chosen to be in the majority, where I would find a larger pool of mates and a greater number of people to whom I'd feel connected. I've had a successful life as a brown-eyed gay man, though, and I see as much need to change my sexuality as my eye color. In this world people are not all the same height and weight, and do not all have the same hair color and hair texture. Sexuality is merely one more characteristic that adds to our individuality.While it's true that Hitler and some others throughout history have viewed inborn characteristics as a measure of a person's worthiness of life, none of those other characteristics are questioned today, at least in polite   society  . People today tend to pride themselves as being special based primarily on the amount of compassion they have toward others; inborn individual characteristics are at best interesting individually but really don't matter to the whole of the world.
