Furthermore, your idea that children should be left to their biological parents (while holding no water) is moot in a discussion of -adoption-.  The children, if put up for adoption, will presumably -not- be raised by their biological parents.So let's see what evidence you have."How many of you have ever regretted NOT being raised by a same sex couple? If you were making the choice for yourself, is it what you would have chosen?"In light of the evidence I presented above, that argument is equivalent to any of the following arguments:Have you regretted not being of the opposite gender?Have you regretted not being born ten seconds after your actual birth?Have you regretted not being of a different race?Have you regretted not being born ten miles away?You get my point.  The argument you presented in that quote is moot, because (1) one can never make such a judgment unless compelling scientific evidence has arisen (which has not been provided); and because (2) aspirations of an individual don't translate to aspirations for the society."You can say a child's peers shouldn't haze them for being part of an alternate lifestyle, and no doubt they should not. That doesn't change the fact that they do."So you would punish the child and the child's parents for an injustice committed by -someone else-?  That's harsh.
