it does not hurt anybody if they do get married. it does not affect me. there is no reason for them not be be married. if your reason is about religion, then it really depends what religion you are talking about. most people who are against gays are Christians, but then it depends on the church. i know that some churches allow gay marriage such as the united church of Christ or the Quaker group. even if they didn't, gays could still get married in a court by a judge, in that case nobody would be hurt.
