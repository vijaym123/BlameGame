Yes, indeed; and someone should file a class action suit angainst the California Goverment and the California Supremem court for their responsibility in both the overturning of the people's vote and causing another propostion vote. California boasts the world's 6th biggst economy; yet you still bamkrupted it.  Their is no way California could afford the 10's to maybe, 100's of millions of dollars this issue cost. -Good job liberals! Now you have contributed to bankrupting your state.Additionally in response: So then that author, and other's making the same argument about wanting "ALL people having equal rights" then also supports consentual pedophilia. It does not hurt anyone either. -Or is it that ultimately, we actually,(truthfully, behind the smoke and mirrors) only really support the rights of those things that we think are acceptable or are not opposed to?  -Hmmmm...It does not take an intelligent philosopher to understand that "equal rights" are a "delusional illusion" How can everyone have equal rights for all of the things they want? -Proposterous! and a lie of society.  And until we admit this and get over our SELF-CENTERED agendas that seek only to have things as it pleases us; and give up on pursuing some of our rights; realizing "you can't always get what you want!" we will only keep going the wrong direction and losing ground; all the while thinking we are accomplishing the opposite. -Spells DISASTER and CHAOS.
