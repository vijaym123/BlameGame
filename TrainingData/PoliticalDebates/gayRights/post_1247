I and many others I have met and spoken with over the years can attest to the fallacy of the "normal family". My father was an abusive bully and my   mother   a depressive alcoholic needless to say mine was not a happy childhood. But they were "normal". I have known many others who were sexually and physically abused by their "normal" parents and had I had a child early (before I learned how to deal with my own problems) I probably would have been abusive. Just being Heterosexual doesn't automatically make you a good parent or person. I think if all couples had to go through the same screening process that gay couples go through the world would be a better place but try getting that approved.
