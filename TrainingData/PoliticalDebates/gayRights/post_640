Struggling with homosexuality is not necessarily a sin. The sin is actually giving into those desires both mentally and physically. As a former homosexual, I can say that even though I felt the attracted to the same sex, from an early age, I can tell you, I was not born gay. As a matter of fact, I know gay men that have told me they don't believe they were born gay, and still live in that lifestyle. Something that I noticed gay men struggle with is seeing themselves as the men that they were born as. I've asked a couple guys living in that lifestyle, about if they felt like men (even at an early age) and if they ever felt like they had to measure up to what they feel being a man is ( I know that was my case and as I mentioned before, plus I've asked other men who live in the gay lifestyle, and they could relate to me). Another thing that is important to consider is the issue of envy. I believe The reason of why I liked certain kinds of men was because I they happened to have some sort of physical or intellectual feature that I wanted to have, but felt like I didn't have. For example, let's say a certain man ( dealing with homosexuality) wants to have darker skin. He will (most likely) be attracted to men that have darker skin. Now that doesn't mean that he will never feel attracted to someone that has lighter skin, since they might have something that they want to have (physically or mentally).
