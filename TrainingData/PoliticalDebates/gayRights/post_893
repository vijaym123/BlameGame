Ok, let me try publicly stating my opinion using the "N-word" and see where that gets me!  Oh, but wait, we already have plenty of examples of lives that were destroyed and jobs lossed for doing MUCH LESS than that, huh?  So again then... is it not that we are only in suport of the "right to opinion" only under certain terms as it does not violate certain offenses or opposing views; and likewise we only support the "rights and freedoms" and protection from discrimination to things which we ourselves accept or believe in? -Hmmmm... So then what exactly is "free to have your opinion?"  And what exactly are "rights and freedoms" that are deserved or supported? -According to who??  I am sure EVERY person or group that does not feel civil or legal freedon to do as they prefer, is waiting in the wings of such the answer. -Pandora's box, people!! Try to burn a brain cell not be so short-sighted abd narrow minded, and look farther down the road, which we have proven as human's we suck at!
