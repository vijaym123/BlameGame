Yes, while certainly a literal translations would be "man-beds," what, exactly, did Paul mean by this.  Since he DID, in fact, apparently coin the word (there IS no concurrent usage of this word in unrelated Greek texts), there is no reason to assume that it refers to gay people as we know them.  There was certainly plenty of objectionable behavior going on in the culture surrounding Paul at the time he coined this word involving "men" and "beds."  The likelihood is that he was referring to male prostitutes, boy sex-slaves, or temple orgies.  The likelihood is that he was NOT referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender, anymore than the male rape discussed in re Sodom and Gomorrah was referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender.  Please.  We would say that the Bible condemns heterosexual marriage because it condemns heterosexual fornication, adultery or rape, would we?  The double-standards get pretty ridiculous.
