how does romans say homosexuality is a sin.(1) homosexuals do not have women..........not from their earliest sexual memories.(2) one cannot abandon something one has never had.(3) natural(dictionary)inclination of being according to personal essence(4) shame based lust....anything shamebased is a about self defilement that causes self hatred and self loathing. anything motivated by lust is committed to satiating the lust. the individuals involved are mere instruments for satiating the lust. there is no commitment between individuals.homosexuals bond out of mutual love, affection, devotion, trust, and respect for a shared committed life together, the same as with heterosexual bonding. it is about self affirmation.to say that romans is about homosexuality, is like saying that orgies are about heterosexual bonding.
