no apology to you, sorry.  to even suggest there's a gay "lifestyle" does show how naive you are.  if you would have phrased it gay "orientation" then you'd be correct.  by using "lifestyle" you're assuming people CHOOSE to be gay.  No gay person I know feels they had any choice in the matter.  You need to apologize to every gay person for making such a false assumption.
