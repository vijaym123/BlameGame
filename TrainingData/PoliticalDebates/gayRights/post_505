To say that "nobody knows what it means" in regard to "arsenokoitai" is completely incorrect and based on biased assumptive language - very poor debate form."arsenokoite" is a combination of the words "arseno" (male) and "koite" (bed, with a sexual connotation. We get our word "coitus" from this word).Paul, being a scholar of the Hebrew Scriptures, did with the Greek just as the Hebrew writers had done when writing what we know of as the Old Testament. They used the term "mishkab zakur" - "mishkab" meaning bed (with a sexual connotation), and "zakur", meaning male or males.When you say "Bible scholars think that Paul was either condemning sex with underage male prostitutes, or the rape of male prisoners of war," would you care to quote these sources? Being a Bible reacher myself, and having studies the texts in the original languages for over twenty years, I have yet to read any such scholarly work as you have mentioned. Please be sure that your sources are credible, yes?
