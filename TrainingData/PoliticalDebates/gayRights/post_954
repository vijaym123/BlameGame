If marriage between a man and a woman were declared illegal tomorrow.  My wife and I would still be together.  We would know who we are to each other.  We would raise our child together.How then is our union threatened by others also joining into marriage.  Choosing, not because of tradition or expectation or law, but because of the purest purpose and reward of marriage, loving union with your partner.The threat to marriage comes from those wanting to join into its covenant, but rather those ready to declare individuals unfit because of color or faith, station in life or their sexual orientation.
