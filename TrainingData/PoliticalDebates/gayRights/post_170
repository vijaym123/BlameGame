Alex, thanks for voting "no" on prop 8, but as to your personal feelings about which of you - you or your wife - is best suited to answering questions from your children on various topics, this does not constitute valid evidence that children raised by same-gender parents are disadvantaged as opposed to children of opposite-gender parents.  There are many times I refer my children to their other parent to answer certain questions or address particular topics.  There are also many times when she does the same to me.  We each have individual areas of expertise, and individual areas of responsibility within the family.  This is not something unique to heterosexual couples, nor is it necessarily gender-specific.  There are many men (even heterosexual men) who might gravitate towards some "traditionally feminine" areas of expertise, and vice versa for women.  Getting hung up on which parent has which sort of genitalia ignores the fact that all of us are different and bring different skills, abilities, perspectives and interests to our relationships and to our parenting.Evidence clearly demonstrates that same-gender-parented kids are equally happy, healthy and well-adjusted as compared to their opposite-gender-parented peers.  Try not to get hung up on the physical appendages or lack thereof, and focus in on the fact that we are all human, all individuals, and all have a great deal to offer our children as parents.
