As someone who spent ten years in the lesbian lifestyle before finding Christ and becoming a Christina, I can tell you that the mental and emotional junk I went through led me to believe that, “there has to be more to your life than this.” To base everything in your life around sexuality and sex is not healthy for anyone straight or gay. Sin is the human depravity that causes us to live and do things outside of health limits. I find that like myself and many others I knew, something in our lives led us to making the choice to live gay. Usually it was abuse, molestation, rejection, or parents speaking things over our lives that caused us to become confused about who we were made to be. No on eis born gay but people can be rejected before they even come out of the mothers womb. A baby knows If its wanted and can sense if its going to be harmed. Then again, we live in a society that defines life begins at conception. That’s a whole different issue.
