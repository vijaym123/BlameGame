So how does this hurt people? I have a religion that says being Christian is an abomination, does that mean I can outlaw Christianity?The Bible says a lot of crazy shit. You can't touch pigskin with your bare hands, you can't work on sunday etc... But my favorite is the one that says you're allowed to beat your slave to death so long as it takes longer then a day...
