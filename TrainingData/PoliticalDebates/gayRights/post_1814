http://godmademegay.com/Letter.htmThis is Letter to Louise, one of the best studies of the actual words in the Bible - not the English version, the real Bible, in it's actual languages it was written in - as it pertains to homosexuality.Read this. THEN tell me how you think homosexuality is a sin. Very, VERY, thin argument your side is making.Then let me throw a few verses at you about love, your obligation to help the disadvantaged, and your fundamental need to abandon your wealth if you truly seek God.That will make a very interesting session.
