If you check the laws, domestic partnerships do NOT offer the same protections as civil marriage.  Domestic partners are not allowed the same health coverage by Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Part D coverage policies for disabled and retired people or under the taxation laws of the United States or most states that have such laws.  The Supreme Court Decision stating that "Separate but Equal" is invalid in cases dealing with ethnicity (race, for those who believe there is more than one human race) needs to be expanded to cover all segments of society.
