I don't believe homosexuality is unnatural, but, even if it was, why does it matter?Air conditioners are unnatural.Televisions are unnatural.Phones are unnatural.Computers and the internet (and all of technology) are unnatural.Even marriage is unnatural, because it's a legal agreement between two people and the state, it doesn't occur anywhere else in nature: only humans marry.Allowing gays to marry isn't advocating homosexuality or anything like that, it's simply allowing gays to marry, so it isn't advocating unnaturalness, so why does it matter if gays marry?Anyway, we learn about computer programs in school, is that promoting unnaturalness?
