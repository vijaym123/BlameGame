If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that change for the good is always an uphill battle.  There was a time when slavery was considered necessary for the good of the country.  There was a time when women were not allowed to vote.  There was a time when keeping the races separated was thought to be an idea that God considered appropriate.  There was a time when Jewish persons were killed in gas chambers, just for being Jewish.  There was a time when Christians were killed for being Christians.  I hope that someday soon we'll be able to say... There was a time when we didn't allow same sex couples to marry.  Every single one of these changes were hard fought.  And every single time, there was someone on the other side, Roman, Nazi, KKK, who argued that the status quo was for the good of society.
