These articles say it best for me anyway.  http://www.onenewsnow.com/Legal/Default.aspx?id=529214   This article was very sad because what kind of message are these adults sending to   children  ? Disrupt church services and break   the law  , what ever it takes, to force ourselves onto people. Is that a healthy lifestyle for children? No way it is.Heres another article:  http://www.onenewsnow.com/Culture/Default.aspx?id=528376   More proof children should not be raised in this   environment  . When your an adult you can decide when you will become sexually active and with whom but this agenda is pushing it down the throats of American children and that is too heavy a burden for them to carry and it is in my opinion criminal to do so to them. Just my thoughts. Have a good day.
