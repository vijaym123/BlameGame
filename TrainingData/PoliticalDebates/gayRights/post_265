This debate is about same sex parenting, not the effects of divorce on children. Yes, it is true that same-sex parents all have step-families by default, but many (most?) times these are step-families since the time of the child's birth. I am assuming that most of this divorce research is done on children who are at some stage of development past the first year, when heterosexual parental bonding has already occurred. It appears this entire argument is invalid to the topic.
