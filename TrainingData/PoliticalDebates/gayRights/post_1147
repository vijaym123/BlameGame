If those reasons arent good enough for you I cant help that they are good enough for me. I also find these reasons to suit me as well:  http://www.bfamilyadvocates.com/homosexuality.htm  In 15 reasons why   homosexuality   is wrong I agree with these the most:1. Homosexuality injures the fabric of society, especially   children  . 3. Homosexuality does not offer the stability of a traditional family.6. Homosexuals have a much higher incidence of domestic violence.7. Homosexuals have a much higher rate of molestation than Heterosexuals8. Homosexuality is not condoned in the Bible.9. Homosexuals want to redefine   marriage  , changing the uniqueness of heterosexual marriage.10. Homosexual marriages will lead to other “unnatural”   unions  11. Homosexual marriage is not a “right”.13. God did not intend for same sex relationships to exist.14. Homosexuality is not genetic.While number 15 says that homosexuals should not be allowed to marry I have no problems with civil unions nor domestic parnerships however I draw the line at adoptions and Holy Matrimony. Need more reasons I feel homosexuality is shameful and unnatural?
