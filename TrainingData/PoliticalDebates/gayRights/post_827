   Your argument only takes in God's mercy and ignores His justice. Given your point of view why would Jesus need to go to the cross? Homosexuality is a sin as any other sexual sin. No different then adultery, fornication, internet porn or premarital sex. Many who look at this argument are stressing a point of perception that the gay and lesbian community and those who support them are trying to incorporate into American culture. God's righteous doesn't change to meets today's modern opinions. He does not condemn the homosexual from eternal life through repentance just as he doesn't bar the theft or internet porn addict, so long as they repent. None of us are permitted a "Mulligan", a sin we are allowed to engage in that is shielded from which God asks us to repent.    The most difficult ideal for gay and lesbian Christians to accept is their active engagement in their lifestyle is asked by the Father to be left at the Cross. Many liberal Christians have developed a pick and chose mentality of Christian faith and it has led many astray. V. Gene Robinson is a classic example, how can one lead a flock while being actively engaged in his most deep rooted sin. It engulfs his entire flock, they thus become embroiled in the entire debate of sexual sin, instead of growing in Christ. Sadly this has shielded active sinners into a false sense of security as they believe they are right with God, when actually they are in bondage to the one thing they won't give to Him. I tell you would a homosexual say it is ok to strike a brother, NO. Would he allow a child to be sexually abused, NO. Thus homosexuals pointing out that they don't live any more differently then straights, means nothing. Because some homosexuals display behavior openly means little, sin is sin whether out in the open or behind closed doors.
