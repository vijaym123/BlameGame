Not all those who oppose gay marriage HATE gays, as so many commenters have been instigating. Many seem to be focusing on the "love is love" idea, which sounds fine, but there is always the rebuttal that this particular kind of love is "unnatural." I have to say that I agree, gay marriage is unnatural. Many have posed the question, "what is natural?" Given, it is now popular and sometimes very necessary in society to make use of "unnatural" processes (i.e radiation and chemotherapy for cancer), as long as they have the potential for positive results. However, in the case of gay marriage, I believe that anatomy alone is sufficient proof of how a man and a woman are the only intended course, religious standpoints aside, and how anything else is not only impossible, but indeed unnatural.
