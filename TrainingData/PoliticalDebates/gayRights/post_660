 Lets not distort Scripture. No where in scripture does it say "hey everyone its ok to have sex with anyone and anything." In fact the scriptures say the opposite. They don’t even condone more than one partner. However though it is sin this does not mean anyone should hate over it. Scriptures tell the opposite of this too. Love the sinner, hate the sin. I have friends who were and are gay. Though I don’t condone it, I often just share with them the love of Christ and let the Holy Spirit work in them. Ryan a friend from church uses to be gay. He still struggles sometimes, but now he has the strength of Christ. He also now has a family. He gave a speech once at church. It was beautiful.
