"...no society has ceased to regulate sexuality within marriage as defined as the union of a man and a woman, and survived." The Roman Empire only fell after it banned gay marriage. Native American cultures used to have gay marriage but no longer do as a result of practices like, oh, the Spaniards setting dogs on them. The cultures still survive today, just in tiny numbers. It has nothing to do with their marriage practices and everything to do with having someone else come in and build an empire on top of them. The first hit were the Aztecs and Mayans, who did not accept homosexuality.
