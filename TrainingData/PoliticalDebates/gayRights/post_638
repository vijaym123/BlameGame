SocialistBetty,I've read several of your post now on different topics and it's very clear to me that you yourself will believe anything someone tells you as long as it promotes your viewpoints.Gay Gene? Please, that's been proved a forgery a long time ago. Only the pro-gay community keeps trying to dig up that dead horse and make it walk!Homosexuality is a learned behavior that can be fixed if dealt with correctly. Just like an alcoholic, though, if the person isn't willing and doesn't have the will-power or help from God then they'll fail. It's a deep issue that requires determination and help to overcome, but it can be overcome.
