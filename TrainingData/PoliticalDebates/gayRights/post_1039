There is no "Same sex couples should have the state and federal government recognize their union, but if their current religion disapproves of the union, then they [the faith] should not be forced by law to recognize the union [hold a religious ceremony]" button. I have no problems with same sex marriage, provided it doesn't infringe on other's rights.
