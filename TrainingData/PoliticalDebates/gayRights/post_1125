We all have our likes and dislikes in life, and some of the things we like are not legal because they harm ourselves or others.  Broadly speaking that's what law is based on. The majority of those laws are based on harm to others and harm to oneself.  Homosexuality does not harm others and homosexuals would obviously agree that it does not harm them.  If human beings are taught to fear and hate homosexuals as they very often are, particularly among religious groups, there is going to be an attempt to suppress it.  Fear and disgust of homosexuality is the root causes of all activity to suppress it.Now imagine if you will, a thousand years in the future, humankind is traveling the galaxy and comes across an alien world of alien cultures and alien reproductive habits.  If in those thousand years we have not learned to conquer our fear of homosexuality, how will we ever be able to face the shock of alien cultures on distant planets?We are provincial, paranoid, and feeble to succumb to fear that is behind homophobia. Future generations already show signs of courage and tolerance.  The embarrassing truth is older generations steeped in homophobia are in positions of authority to continue the assault on gays and lesbians.
