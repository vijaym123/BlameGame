I had a friend that got into an argument with some guy and she had quite a silver tongue (if you know what I mean) and he was loosing so he called her a stupid Jap. So she got up close to his face and said, "I'm not a Jap! I'm a chinc! So get it right!" I laughed ;)I've been called spic, beaner, you name it. And I just smile cause I'm like, "How old are you again?" I don't know, I just think that you should just ignore ignorant people and be able to laugh at yourself. Life is too short to spend most of it being serious. I rather spend most of it laughing. The best way to go would probably be at a family gathering at the dinner table. Someone says something funny and I choke to death laughing. Then when they get together again and retell the story, they wont be able to cry because they'll remember the funny line and then they would be like, "Yeah, that was so funny beer came out my nose and then Joe freaking keeled over HAHAHAHA!"
