RE: "I was relating this to the idea that children belonging to same-sex couples would be bullied, and I thought that your post was using this to create an argument."It is an argument. If you know there's a war, you don't send innocents into the war zone. If an adult, of his or her own free will, wants to become martyrs for a cause, that's their call to make. I'll refrain from expressing an unvarnished view of what I think about adults who martyr children as their proxies.
