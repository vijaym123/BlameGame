I would really love to string together obscenities to this argument.  I won't.  This argument that   children   are hit the hardest, and then going on about single   parenting   in the same opinion are both counter-productive and counter-intuitive.  It is precisely the desires of those wishing for marriage that define a two person household.  A homosexual couple is two people.  A divorced man and woman creates the single parent household.  Your argument may as well state that divorce should be illegal.  Perhaps you feel that way, and that is an entirely different debate.This social argument that gay marriage destroys conventional marriage is a boogeyman, fallacy ridden arguement and I am quite tired of hearing it.
