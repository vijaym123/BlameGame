"Don't ask don't tell" forbids homosexual acts, not homosexuality. "The Pentagon's New Policy Guidelines on Homosexuals in the Military". The New York Times. July 20, 1993 - "Sexual orientation will not be a bar to service unless manifested by homosexual conduct. The military will discharge members who engage in homosexual conduct, which is defined as a homosexual act, a statement that the member is homosexual or bisexual, or a marriage or attempted marriage to someone of the same gender."[14]
