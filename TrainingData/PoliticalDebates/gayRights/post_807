This argument relies on an unwarranted assumption: "Both are innate orientations" and then moves on to cite an individual whose opinion does nothing to substantiate the assumption as his credibility to augment the assumption is invalid.  Proof by association is specious at best. Proof by inapplicable analogy is flawed. Your conclusion that '  homosexuality   is no more a sin than heterosexuality' does not follow from any of the evidence you cite.
