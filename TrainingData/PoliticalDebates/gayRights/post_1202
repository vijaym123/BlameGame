Marriage does NOT mean that both Moms and Dads matter. Of course it is true that Moms and Dads matter, but that has nothing to do with the topic under discussion which is ÔShould Marriage for Same Sex Couples be Legal? Nowhere in the dictionary within the various definitions of marriage, is there mention of Moms and Dads. There are marriages where there are no children.  Should there then be legalization of marriage for same sex couples as long as both parties have agreed not to have children?There are single-parent families which raise exceptional children. Just look at President Bill Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. They turned out quite well. I have no doubt that there are single Dads who also raise great children. There are also two-parent families whose children grow up to be terrible citizens. Yes, there may be valid reasons for someone being against legalization of marriage for same-sex couples, but I do not feel that your premise is validated by your example.
