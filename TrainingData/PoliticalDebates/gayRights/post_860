"For all I'm concerned people can marry their cat if they want to. If it doesn't hurt anyone, what does it matter?"1) It would certainly hurt the cat if the person who married it tried to consummate the marriage. Aside from the physical harm it would suffer, I highly doubt that the poor feline would consent to being violated in such a manner.2) I'm pretty sure bestiality is outlawed everywhere. It's one of many so-called "alternative lifestyles" that federal and state governments neither protect nor should protect.
