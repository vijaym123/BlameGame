Chezdude1, you ask how your bisexuality could be genetically caused since "until this point in my family's history there have been no other bi or homosexual males?" I answered this in an earlier comment on this series. There is no need to suppose that gay genes or straight genes exists -- but rather that some genes predispose a person to a sexual attraction toward females and others toward males. Usually, males get mostly "lust for female" genes and females get mostly "lust for male" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers or other events during the genetic shuffle in the formation of a sperm, a male (Y) sperm may get mostly "lust for male" genes or a female (X) sperm mostly "lust for female" genes. Then his or her gay predisposition is genetically determined even though therie is no such thing as a gay gene and no family history of   homosexuality  .
