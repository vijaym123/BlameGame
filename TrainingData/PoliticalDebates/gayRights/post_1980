I don't like the word gay being associated with homosexuals, I think pervert is more descriptive. Most people view marriage as the unity between two people of the opposite sex. Perverts who perform perverted acts on each other are trying to hijack the word marriage and apply it to their perversions. Perverts are so quick to point out that they are homosexuals, I don't see people on TV running around yelling 'I'm hetero'. Years ago the perverts were out in the streets protesting that the Federal gov. wasn't spending enough money on AIDS research. Excuse me? It's like Reagan said: AIDS is almost a fully presentable disease - don't share needles, and wear a condom if you are going to insert your penis into another human being's rectum. But, but, the perverts don't like the way it feels if they have to wear a condom, and they want your tax dollars to be used to find a cure, so they can just go out to homosexuals bars, pop a pill, and then go insert their penis into a rectum. AIDS is rampant in parts of Africa - up to 70% of the population of some countries have the virus - because the men refuse to wear condoms. Why? Because it doesn't feel good, so the vast majority of people, married, single, man and woman end up with the AIDS virus. Some perverts think they can trick people into making people believe they are hetero by getting married to a woman, and at the same time they are engaging in risky behavior performing perverted acts on other perverts. So now there is a risk of a woman contracting AIDS because she is unwittingly involved with a lying pervert.
