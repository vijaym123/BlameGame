well, we all know the bible has been "edited" throughout the years (i.e. the book of judas).  perhaps all the pro-homosexuality references were deleted to justify the extremist position against homosexuality. prior to the printing press, it was left to scribes to copy the bible and we all know what can happen when different hands lay claim on text.and when david conveys his love for jonathan as "more than any women" I guess you should vilify david for the sin against his marriage, eh?  oh, guess not, since you have such a narrow interpretation.let's not forget there's many married men "of god" who are gay.  just look at ted haggerd.  unfortunately, when people scream about homosexuality, it tends to force other people in the closet.god loves everyone.  to suggest homosexuality is more of a sin than shaving is ridiculous, and cherry-picking what you think is sin and what is not simply shows that you're defying god...judge not lest ye be judged.
