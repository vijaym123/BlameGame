Not being Jewish, I may be a little confused.  I'm aware that the traditional rabbinical treatments of the question deplore the actions involved in homosexuality.  I also seem to recall that, as opposed to the traditional Catholic handling of the matter, the synagogues do not refuse homosexuals the right to attend schul because they feel that (I believe) learning and study are imperative in dealing with sins.  Does this mean that the families of homosexuals are less likely to disown their children?  Will the Jewish community easily accept civil marriage for same gender couples, or are they, in your opinion, deeply averse to such actions?
