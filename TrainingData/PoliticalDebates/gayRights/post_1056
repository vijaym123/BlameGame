It is absolutely ludicrous that in this day and age, while we tout freedom and democracy, we are still ruled by puritanical thought.  What business is it to anyone else whether a man marries another man or a woman marries another woman?  Does it hurt the economy?  Does gay marriage prevent Americans from getting reasonable health insurance?  Is gay marriage the reason we are fighting a war?   No, No, and No.  They deserve the right to marry, just like everyone else.  It isn't like the heteros have it right anyway, what with our stellar divorce rate and all.  Is god OK with divorcing, but not OK with same-sex marriages?  How does that work?
