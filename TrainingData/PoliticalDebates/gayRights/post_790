The question at the beginning is flawed.  Homosexuality is not a sin.  Homosexual acts are.  The book of Leviticus certainly outlines God's teaching on this.  Is homosexuality disordered?  Yes.  Does that make those who suffer from same-sex attractions sinful or less human -- NO.  There are many great organizations, such as Courage, which help men and women to live chaste lives in spite of their same-sex attractions.  There are psychologists who are successful with therapy for this disorder.  Gay and Lesbian people often don't like hearing this, but same-sex attraction can be, and often is overcome.
