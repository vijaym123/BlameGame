The only social experiment that we are doing that is undermining families in this country is economic. We have reduced wages in this country to the point that one person cannot support a household anymore leaving kids to fend for themselves or at daycare most of the time. We have increased class sizes to unmanageable levels because we can’t  afford (or don’t want to) to pay teachers and when we do notice problems with our children getting help is next to impossible unless you have thousands of dollars you can part with to pay for it.Most of us ignore reality thinking we know what a typical family looks like or is suppose to look like. We ignore what our children are really doing when they are out of our sight and refuse to take responsibility when they don’t turn out the way we think they should.  There is always someone or something else to blame, TV, video games, drugs, how about we blame ourselves for a change.Why is it that all of these arguments concerning gays, marriage, and parenthood are always waged by religious organizations? Why if there was any legitimacy at all to any of this we don’t have secular agreement. I respect the right of every individual to believe what they want but don’t state your superstition as fact.
