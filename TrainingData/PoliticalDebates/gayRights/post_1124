First let me be clear.  As a homosexual, I do not support gay marriage.  I agree with those who believe marriage only between a man and a woman should be legal because the institution provides the optimal framework in our society for raising children.  But let me tell you clearly.  Only one who is a homosexual can determine if it is a normal condition of life.  Apart from the dubious biblical interpretation, your argument is as silly to homosexuals as the idea that red hair is not normal because most people do not have red hair.
