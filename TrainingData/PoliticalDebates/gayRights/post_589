SidAirfoil, If you REALLY believe the   bible   is "God's Word" not man's and as you say "In any case, my major concern is that the source of religious moral laws (in this case,   the law   against   homosexuality  ) is   god   and not man",  then I challenge you to explore all of the scripture that I have assembled at http://WhatkindofGod.org/ and swear on the bible that you believe all of the horrible statements attributed to "God" in the bible! including for example:    "No one born of a forbidden   marriage   (no "bastard") nor any offspring from such a marriage may enter the assembly of the LORD, not even in the tenth generation."         If Deuteronomy 23:2 is taken seriously (which Conservatives must do, if they take the scriptures as seriously as they claim) , then these are the inevitable consequences :Not only are all the "bastard"   children   of the faithful to be unjustly punished (for something they had no power over), but all of the following as well:all of their children, (2nd generation)their grand-children, (3rd generation)their great-grand-children, (4th generation)their great-great-grand-children, (5th generation)their great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-children as well,(which could number into the hundreds if not thousands of offspring).         This also has serious ramifications going BACKWARDS, i.e. ,Can you be absolutely sure that you yourself aren't a bastard?How can you be sure that neither of your two parents was?What about your 4 grand-parents?What about your 8 great-grand-parents?etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,
