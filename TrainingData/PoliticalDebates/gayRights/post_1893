No obviously I don't think the state has the right to force churches to marry gays. If they want to be intolerant that is their business. However in a similar vein I do think all religions should lose their tax exempt status. Because I think it violates the Lemon Test decided in Lemon v. Kurtzman for testing the violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It forces the government to decide which religions are legitimate and this "needlessly entangles the government in religion." Furthermore all of the money that is lost in exempt taxes from churches does not benefit the entire country, only members of that religion. Yes money that goes to charity benefits everyone, but then only that money should be deducted from their taxes and they should pay tax on the rest. This also fails the Lemon Test because again it forces the government to decide which religions are legitimate and worthy of tax exemption.So for you is the second best option allowing gays to be married or do you jump straight from only civil unions for all to no gay marriages?
