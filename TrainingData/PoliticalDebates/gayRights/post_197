If were going to say having same sex perents is a disadvantage you might as well bubble rap your self in plastic and never leave the house.If you present the agrument that   children   will get teased by having same-sex parents your right, the simple and blind view of socierty is to not except anything that is too different. But as children we have to learn how socierty functions, whats the different young or later on when they dont follow the conformity of high school life. Yes the child of a family with homosexual parents may get teased but dont we all. Children have been taught buy there parent to reject to anything they dont understand. The children that do the teasing have been raised in familys no better then a same-sex family because they are already at a young age taught to disriminate.Children from homosexual familys arn't disadvantaged, they have the amzing choice to think freely about the world. They have the habit to think about thinks before they judge.
