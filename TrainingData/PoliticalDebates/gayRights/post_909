The whole purpose of the Constitution is to put limits on what can be accomplished by the will of a majority at any given time.   Any democratic government will go through periods where a majority of its citizens get upset about something and there is a call to take action because of the mood of the moment.  We need the constitution to protect us from our worst instincts at such times.    To use the Constitution to enact permanent prejudice and take away people's rights because of prejudice against them is wrong.
