Seeing how our son graduated with honors from UC Berkeley in the Fall, and is currently doing research via a Fulbright Fellowship in Africa and hopes to go on to graduate school, nope. We are more normal than is his girlfriend (who has a kid of three years) and her family both parents divorced a few times. All my GLBT parent colleagues report similar findings.  Now as a professor, absolutely ALL of the extremely messed up, problematic kids come from heterosexual “traditional” families.  As well, in the local high school I both volunteer in and do research with a teacher in, all the kids involved in gang oriented drug violent behavior come from “traditional” families, and despite being minorities, are the most homophobic and violent  kids I have ever  tried to work with. Thought folks would like to know… that when we talk of traditional families, the tradition doesn’t seem to be working so well.  Earlier, I asked my son about this debate and he only laughed.
