#originalTopic=Should_gays_have_the_right_to_marry
I knew what the debate meant, but since this debate has been brought up about a thousand times, I should do something different. So I instead pointed out how the title is misleading and is missing the point of the whole gay marriage debate.If anything, i've contributed even more by saying something different than from the usual routine. and as I pointed out, if this were an interracial issue, the title would have been "should blacks have the right to marry?" which would have also been misleading.Don't see why everyone has to make such a big deal out of this. Too much tension on this site sometimes... everything always has to be taken offensively. I support gay marriage, if that's the issue here.
