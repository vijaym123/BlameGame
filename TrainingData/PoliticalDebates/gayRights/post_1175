I see what you’re saying, but if we legalize gay rights then they will be living among us, and influencing the minds of our children in a negative way. So in the end it is in the hands of the Americans. I hate to say it but when a couple is gay they are just experimenting and playing house. Do you honestly think that those marriages’ will last? Then that will effect and children that might have been involved between that couple.
