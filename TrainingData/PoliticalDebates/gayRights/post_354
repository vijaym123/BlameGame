OK so let me ask this. How is it possible that there can be so many random cases of homo and bisexuality can be supposedly genetic when there has been no clear findings as to the gene or chemicals (as you talked about)? Also how is it that until this point in my families history there have been no other bi or homosexual males? Your telling me that my family (traced back to 1620) NEVER had this "recessive" or "chemical imbalance" before? What are the odds of that?!! Seriously if we can't predict the odds of homosexuality occurring, prove the genetic trait that causes it, or find the chemical imbalance then what makes you/or others think that it really exists? Really? You have to come up with a better rebuttal than that!
