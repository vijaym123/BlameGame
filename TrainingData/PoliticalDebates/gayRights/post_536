I never chose my orientation. Homosexuality is a complete biological feat. It's hormonal. The majority of transgendered women were at one point heterosexual males. However, once starting hormone therapy, their preference changed to the opposite sex. Curious, no? Whether we are born the way we are, or it develops in adolescence,   homosexuality   is not, will not be, or ever was a choice.
