Gayness is as natural as sex and food.Treating people worse because of them being gay is like treating black or Asian or Indian people worse than others.Except I've actually seen a black person change his colour (Michael Jackson), but I've never heard of a real story where a gay guy became straight (and not asexual or faking it trough whole life).
