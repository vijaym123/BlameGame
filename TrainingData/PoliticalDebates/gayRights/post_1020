Man and man were not made to have children together and neither were women and women. Therefore I do not believe the gay marriage should be legalized because then gay parents would be able to adopt children and I do not think that a child can be raised up properly without both a mom that is a woman, and a dad that is a man. That child would suffer from bullying by other children and eventually they might question their own sexuality, and I don’t think that their parents gay sexuality should make a negative influence on their child.
