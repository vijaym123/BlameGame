Well, I am certainly glad I'm not in Canada, but I am inclined to my view completely agreeing with the following verse (which I don't intend to offend anyone with, it is just my belief and therefore you need to tolerate it too, just as I suppose I will have to if you disagree)....the verses are 1 Corinthians 6:9-11: "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be decieved; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, NOR HOMOSEXUALS, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such WERE some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but yiou were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."  thus even from these verses you can see that homosexuality IS a choice if there were indeed some who practiced it and then turned from it after obeying the gospel.  It doesn't matter what I believe, it doesn't matter what you believe this verse means or says, it matters what it DOES say, and that my friends is quite obvious, homosexuality is wrong.
