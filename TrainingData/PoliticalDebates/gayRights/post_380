It was called the way of "Shudo", or youth. But it also showed up quite a bit--In monasteries, especially, where heterosexual acts were forbidden or simply impossible. Male   prostitution   was incredibly common throughout Japan's history. All of these things were written about by Jesuits--If they're something that Priests are being shown, they have to be somewhat normal.Europe: From Greece till the 18th century,   homosexuality   was an incredibly common occurence. Greece I feel like I don't even need to discuss. Every emperor of Rome with the exception of Claudius took a male lover at some point. This kept up until Theodosius, in 390, made it illegal to play the receptive part, and Justinian, in 558, did the same with the active part. So, for the majority of the Roman empire, homosexuality was accepted and common. In fact, for a lot of the Greek and Roman histories, same-sex love was the epitome of what we would term as romantic or meaningful love. Heterosexual love was what you did for   children  . The poets, from Plato and Aristotle to Sappho, spoke at length about that idea. And it makes sense. Familiarity breeds affection, and these were incredibly gender-segregated societies. Women were consigned to the home--Although this meant they really ran a farm rather than dusted--while men were either at war for a decade and a half, or in town doing the   politics   of the day.Throughout the renaissance, it was once again quite common with such public figures as Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and several more artists openly taking male lovers. It wasn't simply the art community. King James I was discussed at the time as being homosexual in a sort of joking context. Anything questions?
