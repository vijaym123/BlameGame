Oveja wrote:"When you quote Lev 18:22 as referred to the cult of Molech, is not precise. When you read the whole chapter, Moses writes a series of sins that include unlawful sexual relationships, amongst homosexuality is found. The fact that the previous verse condemned the parents who offered their sons to Molech, doesn't mean the next verse is related. In fact on every mention of Molech in the bible is related to the child sacrifices" As Christians, we focus on what the Bible actually says.     http://www.gaychristian101.com/Molech.html    God links the qedeshah, shrine prostitutes and zanah, street prostitutes because what they share in common is a type of prostitution.    ÒI will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, zanah, prostitution, nor your brides, daughters in law when they commit adultery, naaph, idolatrous worship: for themselves are separated with whores, [zanah], female prostitutes, and they sacrifice with harlots, [qedeshah], female shrine prostitutes.Ó Hosea 4:14.    ÒAnd there were also sodomites, [qadesh], male temple prostitutes [shrine prostitutes] in the land: and they did according to all the abominations, towebah..." I Kings 14:23.The Holy Spirit links the abomination-towebah activity of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 and I Ki 14:23-24 to shrine prostitution.The Holy Spirit, in I Kings 14:23-24 uses the Hebrew word towebah to describe the abominations of Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13 and I Kings 14:23-24.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html    This Links the sexual activity to shrine prostitution, not homosexuality as we define it today (a committed, faithful, non-cultic relationship between two men or two women).    ÒAnd he took away the sodomites, [qadesh], male temple prostitutes out of the land.Ó I Kings 15:12.    ÒAnd the remnant of the sodomites, [qadesh], male temple prostitutes...Ó I Kings 22:46.    ÒAnd he brake down the houses of the sodomites, [qadesh], male temple prostitutes [shrine prostitutes], that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove, asherah, sacred poles set up to worship the goddess.Ó II Kings 23:7.The Holy Spirit, in II Kings 23:5-10, links qadesh/sodomites with Molech worshipII KIngs 23:5-20 provides another undeniable Link between shrine prostitutes and Molech worship. Leviticus 20:5 also Links Molech worship to shrine prostitution, twice using the Hebrew word zanah (prostitute) to describe the illicit sexual worship of Molech.The bottom line is this. No matter how you slice it, the context of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 is pagan worship of the fertility goddess and same sex shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, non-cultic partnerships between same sex couples.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Abomination.html
