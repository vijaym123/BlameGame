The problem there is that the idea of marriage is embedded too deeply into our legal framework. State recognized married couples receive many benefits that gay couples don't. I agree that government should only deal with civil unions, but do you really think it's possible to take marriage out of government? No way, not in Christian America. The only practical, fair solution is to allow same-sex marriage.
