To Michelle:God is the one that created people (whether they want to deny his existence or not) therefore everyone has some measure of good in them and also a conscience. So people who chose to practice homosexuality or follow other gods are only searing their conscience.  Nature itself testifies that God exist, for instance observe the change in seasons no human being is smart enough to invent that.  Not even animals practice such depravity as some humans.  Remember sin came into the world because of Mankind.I am a Christian and I refuse to agree with three quarters of the people saying it is right when God find that lifestyle detestable.  Any Christian who tells you or anybody else that practicing homosexuality is O.K with God  he/she in their own sweet way is telling you to go hell and the spirit of truth is not them.  Don't be deceived the devil is a roaring lion seeking who he may devour.  The Bible said I present before you life or death choose life.  The life you live here on earth will determine where you spend eternity it is either heaven or hell.  Jesus is your savior while you are on earth and he is your judge once your spirit leaves your body especially if you are not a Born again Believer filled with the Holy Spirit.  A day will come when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.  There is only one God.You may not like what I have to say, that is O.K the truth alone is controversial.
