the same similarity's can be found throughout humanity. just because a guy has a high voice, doesn't make him gay. i don't think you can nit pick similarity's between gays, and call it genetics. i'm a  6 foot , white male. i am straight. does that mean that all 6 ft. white males are straight. no. no matter how you look at the world. there is a ying and a yang. there's a up and a down. there's a left and a right. there is man and woman. that's just the way it is. being gay is not in this balance. it's not the way it was intended. don't get me wrong. what people do is there decision. but, don't insult my intelligence by saying, "i was born this way."
