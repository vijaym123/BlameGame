Adultery is sex outside of marriage and a homosexual relationship active in sex is outside of marriage and therefore adultery.The overriding intent of scripture regarding relationship structure is that marriage is between opposite genders.  Our manmade laws that define marriage otherwise cannot stack up to scripture . . . that is if we accept that scripture is God inspired.Sex between two people of the same gender is no worse in God's eyes than two people of opposite gender having sex outside the covenant relationship of holy matrimony.  That basically makes us all guilty of sinning.  I thank God for His grace and patient love for all those who seek it.
