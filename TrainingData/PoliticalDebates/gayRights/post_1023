Your views that homosexuality is immoral does not translate to whether or not same-sex marriages are allowed.As the courts recognized in State v. Baxley:"In 1976, for example, the Protestant Episcopal Church issued the following resolution:ÒResolved, that it is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God, who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love, acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church.ÒThis General Convention expresses its conviction that homosexual persons are entitled to equal protection of the law with all other citizens, and calls upon our society to see such protection provided in actuality.ÒIn 1982, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirmed its position that Òhomosexual persons are children of God and are entitled to full civil rights.ÓThe American Friends Service Committee, Unitarian Universalist Association, United Methodist Church, American Lutheran Church, and other churches have held this same belief (Cases and Materials on Sexual Orientation and the Law.  2nd ed.  Ed. William B. Rubenstein.  1997.  West Publishing Co.  St. Paul.ÒAmici Curiae Brief of Religious Organizations and Leaders.Ó  State v. Baxley.).  They all think that homosexuality might be immoral, yet they also believe that homosexuals should be afforded the same rights.So ... what was your argument again?
