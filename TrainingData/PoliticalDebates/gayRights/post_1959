I believe my point rests unchallenged. It is clear from the letters of Jefferson, especially to his esteemed Deist comrades, that Jefferson's God was not the God of the Bible. If you can shake that case, I will relent. Until then, you have not confirmed Biblical authority over morality or the law of the United States, nor contributed anything I would call a refutation of my claim.
