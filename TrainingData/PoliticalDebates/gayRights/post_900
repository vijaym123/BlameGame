It is purely alarmist to think and believe that granting the liberty of legal marriage to same-sex couples or any set of non-traditional individuals is the end of what has been traditional marriage. Opposite-sex couples will continue to meet, fall in love and perhaps marry as they always have and likely always will. Perhaps it is time they no longer are able to do so as an elite set of human beings with their liberty purchased at the expense of denying such liberty to others.The liberty of legal marriage reserved for man-woman couples is elitism. It has little to no respect for the higher value of individual rights and mutual liberty. There is no righeousness in in denying homosexuals the liberty to marry whomever or as many as they choose in the pursuit of personal happiness.As for redefining "marriage", perhaps we ought not limit ourselves to the very narrow special-interest definition of the major religions. After all, "christian" is only a subset of "human".
