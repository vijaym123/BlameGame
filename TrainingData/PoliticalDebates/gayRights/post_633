i only know what i believe, and what the Lord has laid on my heart...my prayer for the gay Christian is that the Lord will lift the veil of deceit that the enemy has placed over their eyes and heart in regards to their personal relationship with the Lord.i know that i believed for the longest time, as i was fence-sitting in my faith, that "God knew where my heart was", which is true, but at the same time, God can't and won't allow sin into heaven. even though i knew what i was doing was wrong in His eyes, there was a hope and belief that He would still save me and welcome me into heaven. the thing is, i was struggling with my sexuality and my faith simultaneously, and even though i knew better, i still wasn't willing to give Him my all, my everything. or maybe at that time, i thought that i had given Him enough to work with.i was trapped in that corrupt and vicious circle of sin and repent, sin and repent, sin and repent...and if i'd actually repented at all, i would have leaned heavier on Him, gotten into His Word, and turned my back on the sin and walked away(or in my case, ran the other direction as fast as i could). so, i don't think i ever truly repented.i was also deceived into thinking that as long as i didn't actually go through the act of sex with another person, that it wasn't as bad...when it's scriptural that if we've even so much as lusted after another man(or woman) with our eyes, it is adultery. Matthew 5: 28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman/man lustfully has already committed adultery with her/him in his/her heart.so, i was guilty right there. whether it was self-abuse, or having sexual relations with someone else, it is still adultery, as it is sex outside the bonds of marriage, and that in God's eyes is wrong.there again, for so long, i felt or bought into that whole "God knowing where i stand" thing, what a sad joke...He did know where my heart was, and unfortunately it wasn't truly on Him.
