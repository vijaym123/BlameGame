Thanks for the discussion.There are a host of inherent differences, many of which we are only able to specify now with advanced genetic and biological techniques.  Some many blame some of them on society, such as the fact that there just aren't as many women in the hard sciences and engineering as men, even though women make up 55% of the college population.  The differences in how men and women look at the world and evolutionarily have developed is massive, and denying those differences to a child when there is another option is wrong.  While the real world sometimes makes a same-sex couple the best option, removing the ability of society to prefer that optimal partnership for raising children over alternatives is the travesty.The framing of this argument is very important.  One side claims it is one of the last big hurdles to achieving equal rights for homosexuals.  I feel compassion for them and that is a very difficult decision.  The other side, though, doesn't get their frame heard in the media.  I am not against same-sex marriage, per se, but FOR traditional marriage and holding it up as the optimal situation in society.  If society can no longer prefer traditional marriage over any other form, be it same-sex marriage or polygamy, etc, society can no longer prefer the optimal situation for raising children.I appreciate the discussion.John Haidt, a Social Psychology PHD, has a great lecture on TED about the moral differences between Left and Right.  It may help to shed some light on the place that half of Americans come from.  In the end, it is all a framing issue, and having both frames understood is extremely important.   http://www.ted.com/index.php   /talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html
