Did you ever try to find out why your   mother   is an alcoholic? Did you ever consider the ammount of love she has in her heart for you and that she knows shes a failure....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOVE that the homosexual community profess to have. Love your Mom and honor her no matter what kind of a mother she is and you will receive a blessing. No ones mother was ever perfect and you are fooling no one with the Im better without her and   college   is making me so happy. BS. You are hurting because you didnt get the love you needed in life and that was unfair to you. You want your mother to be what you need her to be and your child inside is crying to have her hold you and tell you that she loves you and you want to be able to trust and believe that you can rely on her and not be disappointed by her. Believe me she wants that too. If I was you Id grow and take your life into your own hands and make up with her even if you know she will never be reliable as a mother because someday she wont be there and you will regret not having had the nerve to walk up to her and say I FORGIVE YOU MOM...and until then dont blame the world for your chips and insecurities...YOU CHOOSE THE LIFE YOU WANT TO CHOOSE just be adult enough to own it. Gd bless you. Find a   church  . Quit drowning your sorrows in   alcohol   and partying, they wont go away that way and youll only compound your pain and suffering. Thats my motherly   advice   to you.
