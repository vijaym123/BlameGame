I second Ibauer42's request for scientific documentation of the claims you are making here, bagpiper2005.  The fact is that most molest victims do NOT become gay, nor do they have higher rates of homosexuality than those who were not molested.  Considering the statistics (last I heard, somwhere around 1 in 4 girls are molested (conservatively) prior to the age of 18 -- if someone has a more accurate estimate, please correct me), that would mean that young women would have astronomical rates of becoming lesbians.However, the fact is that only a small percentage of women identify as lesbian, and of those, many are neither victims of molestation, nor raised in "lower class" families.  Let alone circumcised. :rolleyes:Yeah, as a non-circumcised, non-molested lesbian raised in a typical middle-class family, I'd really like to see some SCIENTIFIC backup for your claims.
