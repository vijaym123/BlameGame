Ummmm.......Tamara I believe it was, yeah, she wasn't telling her your opinion... She was quoting scripture....who wrote the scriptures? Oh yeah, God did, thus in quoting Him, she brought His opinions to the table, and I tell you so that you may know it and know it well.  His opinion is one to be respected, he created you.  Deny it all you will, but that isn't my opinion.  It's not a belief, it's a fact.  The evidence is all around you and you only don't see it because you close your eyes.  She simply stated her agreement to the Bible, the Bible which is a set of moral statutes that we'd do well to obey if we want to go to Heaven.  If we don't want to, ok, fine, we can do whatever we want to, but it doesn't mean we'll get away from judgment.  Just because we feel it's ok to steal someones chocolate bar, and it's not against our conscience and we feel it's ok, that doesn't make it right.  So don't be all you have religion thus I don't like you to Tamara, she is only posting her thoughts as is the purpose of this site.  And she isn't imposing, if you don't wanna hear it, close your ears....but yeah, you'll be judged for that too.
