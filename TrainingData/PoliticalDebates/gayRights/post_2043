I believe people have two fundamental rights relating to this issue:The right to self expression and personal views/ideas.The right to be secure physically and emotionally.If someone gets married -gay or straight-, they are expression their personal ideas. This is their RIGHT in Canada and the United States, at the very least. Marriage is a legal thing between two people, and the only part of it that says it has to be man and a woman lies in religion- which is based on ideas founded centuries ago when women were considered objects anyway, and thus fundamentally flawed and not viable as the final word.If you are telling them that they are not allowed to get married, you are first of all denying them their right to express their ideas by saying it's not allowed, and secondly denying them their emotional security because you're descriminating.FINALLY. What does it matter to you if a gay couple gets married? Is it hurting you? No. Is it denying you the ability to say you don't like it? No. Is it infringing on those two rights for you? No. You can disagree with it, but that doesn't mean you should have the right to say it's not allowed at all!There's no logical reason to say it isn't allowed.
