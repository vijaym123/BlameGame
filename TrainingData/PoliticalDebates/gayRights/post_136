 ALL major world religions support marriage between a man and a woman. While some support multiple wives, NONE support homosexuals marrying. Religion recognizes the central importance of "creation of family" as the fabric of the human race. To the extent that mankind recognizes spiritual importance and the source of all creation, mankind must raise marriage to a Sacramental elevation. We are free to worship as we ought, and free to define just how to elevate marriage. But the fact that religion elevates marriage does not segregate it into a religious-only institution. The fact remains that throughout history, regardless of religion, ALL societies from primitive to developed have established some form of marriage to reproduce new generations of people.
