So... I'm going to assume that you are vehemently against transexual people as well then? Ok, so you've quoted the   bible   at me, I'm assuming. I'd like to quote back. John 3:16For God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son, that WHOSOEVER (hate to break it to you, that does include gay people) believes in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life. For the sake of arguement, let's say that a gay   christian   couple wants to get married, because they want to have sex after they get married, not before. Wouldn't that mean they are following what God is   teaching  ? Also, please point out versus where the Bible says being gay is wrong. Or how about John 8, 1-11? Let anyone among you who is without sin throw the first stone. There's also the issue of love. If I remember correctly, love is the word used most in the bible. Gay couples love each other, and they deserve to be loved. And the hate the sinner thing? It's like saying you don't like people being left handed, but you like left handed people. Being gay isn't a choice, whatever you may think of it, it's a piece of your brain that's hard wired into you, like being straight.
