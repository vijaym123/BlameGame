I hear constantly about the "outdated" and "no longer applicable" verses in Leviticus - I recently read about a youngish - 40 something man- who had lived-according to modern standads- a relatively "righteous" life; but now he has throat cancer - why? it turns out that if you engage in oral sex the chances of acquiring the pap virus that causes cervical cancer in women- will increase your chances of oral and throat cancer, and it increases when you have multiple partners. The manifestation of throat cancer in younger patients who have never smoked or "engaged in risky behavior" is rising at an alarming rate. Why? because we have changed and accepted as "normal" what the Bible has prohibited or declared a sin. A man was designed to enter a woman, and a woman was designed to receive a man.Jesus dealt with remarriage, divorce, and He clearly stated what constitutes marriage - a man and a woman. And only one man for one woman, and only one woman for one man. We have a wondrous beautiful God of order and elegant, beautiful design. That His creation has been warped and deformed by sin is a fact.   "creation groans under the weight of man's sin" we are told how ALL creation waits for the day of the redeemed - we live under Grace - "do we continue in sin in order to attain more grace? - may it never be!!!"
