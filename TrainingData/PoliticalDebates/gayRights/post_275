Fundamentally same sex marriage is based on the rejection of the other sex. It is not in the interest of society to support that concept.Discussing if an abandoned child would be better in a same sex home than whitout a home missing the point and the long term consequences.It is the same with divorces. We cant use the exceptions to justify them because we ended up with no fault divorces laws and broke the heart of 42 millions children. Some of them after seeing their parents separating are now choosing the homosexual lifestyle. And now we are discussing same sex marriages. We need ot go back to the causes and stop trying to fix the symptoms.
