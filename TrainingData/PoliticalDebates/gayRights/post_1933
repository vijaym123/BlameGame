ON YA JESSALD...HA HA HA LOVE IT....HERE IS MY THOUGHT ON THE MATTER...........BTW..Then why cant we just say gay marriage then.You blasphermous reli-goons piss me off -why dont you all get a life instead of trying to control every body elses right to live how they choose. If it doesnt involve corrupting the innocence of children who are you to condemn two peoples right to marriage,regardless of thier sexual preference.No amount of mds'/scientists oppinion based on their own research can establish those claims in regards to deseases,premature death etc Again i think we need to hear from some honest good christian folk who work LEGALLY in the sex industries and know who and what goes on behind closed doors,maybe they can enlighten everyones oppinions in this debate,or at least in effort to educate those that live their life through the words or beliefs of their religious bias rather than just living..might i add that all of these reli-goons forget, "that to preach the words of the lord in defence of your own beliefs is blasphemy in itself."
