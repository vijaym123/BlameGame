Your argument is too broad to actually support your position.  This fact, however, is not a refutation of your argument, I am merely pointing out that it is difficult to respond to the sum total of your argument.  Generally speaking, the various tests have overlooked a very subtle yet important philosophical principle, coincidence does not entail causality.  Brain studies, I've yet to read anything conclusive, most rely on ambiguous evidence and partial explanations. Hormonal studies, these attempt to define a causal link yet end up concluding only coincidence!Genetics, you covered this well, I disagree with both sides about using genetics to try to win this argument.  Until we have achieved a complete understanding of the totality of this field, you cannot use the lack of a thing to prove its antithesis and you cannot say that: "a gay-gene will eventually be found" (yes I have actually heard this argument before).  If you sweep aside ambiguous studies, you are left with a dearth of information, thus, "studies" cannot support either side.
