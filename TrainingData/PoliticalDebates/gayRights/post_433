This is supposed to be a rational debate about "nature vs nuture" in regard to   homosexuality  . You are claiming that nature has made people homosexual. Science is the proper method for explaining the natural world. Using annecdotal recollections as an argument should immediately disqualify you as an expert. This argument hurts your cause. You should be embarrassed to have posted this.
