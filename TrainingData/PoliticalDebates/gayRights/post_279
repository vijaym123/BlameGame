Well, this country is quite open and tolerant. We have seen during the last 4 weeks how intolerant the gay activits and been to the point of anarchy, retaliation, retribution, revenge, mocking and ridiculing their opponents in the most viscious wayIntolerance and imposing someone's own belief by silencing others through fear is for the gay community to deal with. I will never forget what I saw with my own eyes.The experiences are marked deeply in my soul. I do not expect that it is the end of it but now my eyes are open and I am drawing the line for the protection of my family. People can do what they want with their own life but they cant steal or hijack the core values of millions of people behind their back using some judgeocracy process and start a rampage if they do not get their way.The debate is at the very different level now. Many people feel under assault by a ruthless mob and hopefuly will not take it anymore. I know I am not.Sorry to be direct.
