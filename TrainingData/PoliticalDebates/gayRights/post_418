The study we cite regarding   children   with gay parents being more promiscuous and same-sex attracted was conducted by gay-activists Judith Stacey & Timothy Biblarz and was published in the peer-reviewed journal of American Sociological Review (66 (2001): 174, 179).  It is a meta-analysis of 21 gay   parenting   studies. The harm children sustain from engaging in the gay life-style is well documented in the peer-reviewed scientific literature we cite. More importantly: "loving males" do not rape anyone of any gender.  You are an individual of infinite worth and dignity and these men tried to take that from you to satisfy their own psychological needs.  But no one can rob another of his inherent human dignity.  You are not alone: More than 40% of men with same-sex attraction have been raped and/or sexually molested.  This is a well-accepted psycho-social factor that can contribute to same-sex attraction.  Many men in this situation have been healed with psychiatric therapy directed at resolving the trauma associated with the sexual abuse (as opposed to re-orientation therapy per se).  We wish you   health   and happiness along whichever path you follow.
