I'd like to hear more on this. I understand why you feel that government-licensed marriage for same-sex couples would be a departure from tradition. But would government-licensed "civil unions" for same-sex couples harm your institution of marriage? What about the non-licensed marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples that happen every day in America? Are you going to try to stop those?
