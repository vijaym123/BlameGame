As someone who knows someone with homosexual parents I can tell you with a great degree of certainty that:You are dead wrongYou also make the assumption that homosexuality is wrong when you say:He might think this is alright if he is gay tooOf course he/she will think this, because being gay is alright, and the only reason people like him will ever be discriminated against is because people like you say otherwise.
