quiet4no1-Have you taken the time to read the rest of this discussion? Your last post reads like you have no idea of the preceding discussion.Most of the material I previously cited can be found on this page, with the many Links provided there.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/My-Coming-Out.html   Suffice it to say that in previous posts, I have more than adequately covered each of the scriptures you quoted.For you too quote them again, as if they can only be negative statements about committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships is less than thoughtful.None of the verses you cited even mention homosexuality in Hebrew and Greek. You are reading your twenty first century notions into texts that are 2000 - 3400 years old.In some English versions, (I Corinthians 6:9 for example), translators have inserted a false translation, using the word, homosexual, when that word was never in the original.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Define-Arsenokoites.html   I encourage you to do additional prayerful study.Your brother in Christ,Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jesus-On-Hell.html
