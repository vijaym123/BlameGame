Actually, homosexuality could be argued to be an evolutionary benefit for a species that is overproducing. To help save us from our own over population of the planet the gays and lesbians may be the products of beneficial genes. So, your argument, from a "scientific" evolutionary point of view has failed to take this important point into account. Those who keep recklessly reproducing may be the perversions of natural biological laws, ever think about that?
