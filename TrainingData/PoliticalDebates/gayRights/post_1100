Civil Unions as I understand them would put Gay couples in an equal standing with married Heterosexual couples as long as they were recognized by the IRS. Other than Taxes the Federal Government could care less if you are married or not. Marriage /Civil Unions are state/local govt matters. In reality all Civil "Marriages" are in reality Civil Unions, simply a legal contract. It should be a simple matter to include Homosexuals, brothers and sisters or any cohabiting couple who want the legal protections and responsibilities afforded by such a union. I am totally in favor of that. Marriage is simply a word, nothing more. If the religious people don't like it just let them call Church weddings marriages. The Catholic Church does not recognize Civil Ceremony's between heterosexual couples as a "Marriage". Are you aware of that?
