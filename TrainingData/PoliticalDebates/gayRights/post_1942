Firstly, I think eating meat on Fridays should be illegal. Secondly, many of the things you listed that the bible bans are made acceptable in the New Testament. I do eat pork and shellfish. I do shave. I do wear cotton/polyester blends. The bible does allow me to do those things. But the New Testament does not make homosexuality acceptable. It is still, under all circumstances, immoral and wrong.
