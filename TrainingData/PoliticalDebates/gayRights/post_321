I understand it to mean that the motion is to out law non liberalism. the idea that 2+2=4 is to be out lawed. 2+2= anything. that's the   equality   you're talking about. Liberals need to be removed from   society  . there should be a liberal free society. It's societies obligation to remove liberals. when you make a decision, you don't just do whatever. The liberals want a 'do anything clause'. society was based on the opposite. we need to get rid of them.
