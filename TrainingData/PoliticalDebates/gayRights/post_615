You assume several things in your post.  You assume that rational truth is objective, that spiritual truth is not, that rational truth is higher then spiritual or religious truth and thus that those who believe that Bible is the literal word of God are then irrational with the implications that such people are wrong and absurd.  I would ask you why is so called rational truth higher then religious truth?  How is rational truth objective when it is the product of human minds, which tend to be very subjective?  What objective exists to show that the Bible is not God's word?  I don't bring up these questions to spite you, and though I may be coming off sarcastic I want to make it clearly known that I am not I am just trying to respond to your argument.  Peace,Spencer
