None of Focus on the Families arguments have any bearing on the argument.  They say kids are better off in married 2 parent households with their biological parents.  This is most likely true but the kids we're talking about have already been put up for adoption by their biological parents.  This is no longer an option for them.  The question we need to answer is whether they're better off in a gay household than an orphanage or bouncing from house to house in foster care.  Nobody can argue that  foster care or an orphanage is better than a loving home, whether the parents are straight, gay, black, white, religious atheist or anything else.They also argue that divorce is bad for children.  No kidding!  Again, that has no bearing on the argument.  Since we won't let same sex partners marry they can't possibly get divorced.  Seems like, if anything, this is an argument for same sex adoption.  I'd argue that anything that gets children out of the foster system and out of orphanages and into a loving home is a positive step for the children.
