The Focus on the Family have for years, been highly critical of any progressive or common sense thought!  They are so far to the "right" on the political spectrum, that sensible and fair minded people should not give homage to these reactionaries!  They are filled with hatred towards all gay people and those who support and more inclusive   society  !A child adopted by a loving and caring gay 2 parent household, will grownormally, feeling loved and accepted!  The hetorsexual experiece has done a wonderful job in bringing about huge numbers of divorce families,  children   out of wedlock esp in the Black community, and the children of ddivorced parents, feeling neglected and unloved! If 2 gay parents are truly in love and in a committed relationship and have the financial and emotional resources to provide for that child-then whats the problem?  The extreme right expoused by the Focus on the Family, believe fervently in the status quo and are always resistant to any   change   that can make our society better. I look forward to the day when ggays and lesbians will have the same equal rights as others have and take for granted!
