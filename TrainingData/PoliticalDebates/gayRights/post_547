When I refer to a Gay Lifestyle I of course refer to the obvious, sex and love with a member of the same sex. All the Gay people I have personally known, and there have been several, lead lives that were otherwise indistinguishable from anybody else so I don't even accept any other meaning. Be careful when you make such accusative, and incorrect assumptions about someone you don't even know. I expect an apology if your big enough to do so.
