When Hope7 quotes the Family Research Council, she shouldknow that the FRC is ananti-gay organization and their reports on research do not tend to be accurate.  Statistically, most child sexual molestation is perpetrated by heterosexual males by far.  And Angelman quotes the APA recent article which repeated their previous reports that they do nto recommend trying to   change   sexual orientation because it can do more harm than good.  But they did sya that if a gay person, for relilgious reasons, cannot accept being gay,  the therapists can ethically try to hep them accept themselves and to learn ways to remain celebate.  But they do not recommend trying to change sexual orientation.
