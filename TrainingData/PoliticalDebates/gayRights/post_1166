According to the Family Research Council, "A man and a woman joined together in holy matrimony is the time-tested “yardstick” for marriage".  So because homosexuality was not allowed one hundred years ago and same-sex marriage was the only right way that makes it the "yardstick" of tradition?  Tradition is not always best.  In many cases, with time comes knowledge and we are able to reform our ways for the better rather than relying on the beliefs of the past.  It could be possible that in the next twenty years a new invention will replace the yardstick, even though now we can't see that possibility.
