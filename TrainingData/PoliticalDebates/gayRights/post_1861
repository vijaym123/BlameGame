Gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry because this is America and we are build on the foundation that America is a land of freedom and opportunity. Look at Canada and how well their freedoms are looked upon. Gays and Lesbians can freely marry the person they love without the government restricting that given right. I say that prejudices needs to stop within the government and stop using it to control American society. Let gays and lesbians marry who they want to marry!
