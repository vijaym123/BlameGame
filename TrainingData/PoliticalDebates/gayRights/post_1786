I couldn't find one on why having gay siblings increases the number of offspring, but I did find a study that shows that people with older brothers are more likely to be gay and this one.I'm curious about that too, but if I had to make a very uneducated guess...think about how gay guys stereotypically go shopping with girls. Well if your younger gay brother keeps bringing around girls, then that might increase your chances of getting laid. A very complex scientific explanation, I know, but I'm just guessing.
