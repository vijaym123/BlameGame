quote, "there is no practical difference between civil union and   gay marriage   .' If there is no difference then my   vote   is no.Should   marriage   for same-sex couples be   legal  . My answer is no.You ignore a moutain of evidence that could save some   children   so a few can say what....they have a marriage which is as you say no different than civil union. I vote no. I choose to listen to evidence and base my decisions on that overwhelming argument that children are not better off, even in danger if placed in same-sex homes and not listen to the the, " because I want it", pissing and moaning of adults desperately attempting to justify their lifestyle choices by adopting innocent unsuspecting children. I say no.
