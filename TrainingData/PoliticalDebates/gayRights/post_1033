I see some of you are twisting the words and making personal attacks, again. This is the usual fare when you can not make your point through logic. Marraige is plain and simple the joining of a man and woman, period. If you must pervers the meaning of a word to make it fit "your'e" definition then it is indeeed a contrived definition. If same sex couples want to live together in wedded bless, let them enjoy their civil unions, this describes it very well lietearly and legally. But convulting the term marraige to suit "well" meaning otherwise intelligent people is sheer incompetence.
