If homosexuality is unnatural, then surely its behaviour would not be found in humans across the globe; but it is--even in cultures where acting it out is punishable by death. If homosexuality were a construct,  it wouldn't exist in the non-human world , but it does.The forced ideal that homosexuality is 'wrong', is a judgment call.  Living one's life the way that they see fit is not wrong, it simply is.  It's like telling a cat to stop eating meat.  You can do it and get upset, but they'll still catch a bird. America's resistance to sex and sexuality only perturb it and make it dysfunctional.  Judge not.  It isn't your place to tell others how to live their life.
