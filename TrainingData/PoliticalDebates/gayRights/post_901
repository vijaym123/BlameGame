This is not an argument against gay marriage, this is an argument for "traditional" families who are dropping the ball to step up.  If you really believe that children do best with married biological parents in a low-conflict marriage, why aren't you encouraging that?  Why not ban divorce, make fighting illegal, or forbid adoption?  All of those things are more of a threat to the ideal child-rearing environment you propose than gay marriage.  How exactly does two guys getting married stop you from providing your ideal environment to your children?  It shouldn't. On the other hand, I noticed that you argued that the purpose of marriage is to have children, and no other purpose should be allowed.  The vast array of legal benefits to marriage are completely irrelevant in your mind, right?  Fine, if the sole purpose of marriage is for the children, you will have no objection to immediately stripping all legal rights granted to spouses.  You said yourself, the purpose of marriage is not to grant rights.  It also seems that those who will not or cannot have children, like me, should not be allowed to marry even if they are heterosexual.  This is the logical end point of your argument, are you sure this is really what you're proposing?  I have a problem with that, and I'm sure I'm not alone.
