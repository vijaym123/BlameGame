argument 4:Because the theory is not in the Bible it is based on what one wishes to see in the Bible, not a good foudation for belief.What a case of projection.  It is just flipping the reality, supressing the truth.  The complementary nature of man and woman is clearly in the Scritpure just as it is that homosexuality is sinful.  What is really happening is that men are suppressing the truth in their wickedness and gathering around them all kinds of teachers who will teach only what their itching ears want to hear, since they will no longer put up with sound doctrine.  I have struggled wtih homosexuality since I hit puberty (6+years) and in the past identified as gay, homosexual, a Christian walking out of homosexuality, ex-gay and at last I can say that I am so glad I shed the false identities the world and the enemy of my soul wanted me to believe because he who is free in the Son of God is free indeed.  Although I still struggle with homosexuality at some level it is nothing compared to what it used to be and I have developed attractions for woman (something I never, never in my wildest imaginatinos thought would be possible no matter how many times I quoted all things are possible with God).  This article claims that homosexuals interperate the Bible differently because they approach it with their own suppositions (private interpretation) and then accuses those who actually believe what the text says of doing it.  It is falid and a satanic deception to those struggling with their gender and sexual idnentity.  I say satanic not just to bad mouth it but because satan is the father of lies and when he lies he speaks his native toung.  This article and website is about lies and perverting the truth (though be it with whatever peceived good intentions).
