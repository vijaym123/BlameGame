Focus on the Family is correct in stating that taking children away from their natural parents and giving them to a homosexual couple to be raised in some bizarre social experiment would be unethical.  That is not what anyone is suggesting, however.  What is the question is whether children would be better off being adopted by a loving homosexual couple instead of being left to a foster home or government program in the event that no one else is there to care for them.  While one could argue back and forth all day about whether being adopted by a heterosexual or homosexual couple makes a difference, and admittedly it probably does, there is little doubt that loving parents of any sexuality would be better than the alternative.  The problem with this debate is that no one is willing to forget their own biases and prejudices and think about the kids.  They can't seem to get past what they want for themselves or what their religion/society tells them is wrong.
