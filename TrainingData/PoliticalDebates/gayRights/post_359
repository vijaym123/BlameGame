The human mind is capable of many different concepts.  It can convince itself that it is capable of accomplishing practically anything.  Many people are in industries that they definitely should not be involved with but they stay there because persons of authority revel in superiority complexes.  The same condition exists for a person that chooses to be something other than what nature has basically provided. Many facets can affect and cause an effect on the psyche of an individual.  Female rejection, masculine overbearing by more macho individuals and a myriad of other conditions that can cause an effect on an individual.Homosexuality is just one more example of a twisted psyche!
