Personally, I do not believe a person is "born gay".  I do think early childhood experiences and   environment   influence sexual orientation.  I could be completely wrong and a person may be born as homosexual as Liberace.  I think the real question should be “Is   homosexuality   morally wrong?”    I, as a Christian, believe that it is a sin because the Bible says so.  However, nobody is guilt free as far as sin goes (with the exception of Jesus), we all have our faults.  Regardless if you are born homosexual or it’s a learned trait, I think you should try to overcome it, just as someone with overactive hormones should still be faithful to their spouse.  With that said, I don’t think any of us are any less guilty than the other in God’s eyes, as we all depend on the sacrifice of Jesus to make us clean.  God loves us all, and we should do our best to live by his laws, as this life is short and we all have our trials to overcome.
