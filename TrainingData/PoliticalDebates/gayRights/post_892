Are you suggesting that a constitutional ammendment is 'just an opinion'?  And are you further suggesting that it's ok to have an opinion on this matter as long as the law is on the side of your opinion?  And are you also suggesting that when the law is against your opinion, it has also stripped your right to have an opinion?  I have one question for you... In your opinion, is it better for you to have an opinion if another persons legal rights are trampled, or is it better for everyone to have equal rights and for you to have no opinion whatsoever?
