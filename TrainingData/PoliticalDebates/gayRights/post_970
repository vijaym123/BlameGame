The only reason to not allow same-sex marriage is religious in nature...that is it is an abomination to God. As a Christian myself, I realize that not everyone is Christian and that I have no right to impose my faith on anyone else. Do I agree with the lifestyle? Of course I don't. Religious institutions may refuse to participate or officiate in said ceremonies if they wish, but for goodness sake let people be happy.
