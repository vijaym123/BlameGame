both of those verses are in the Old Testament... Jesus came and gave His life for us so that we no longer have to live under the old law.  Now we live by Faith in Christ Jesus.Each one of us will give account to Jesus Christ for how we lived our life.   I sure want to make sure that I am on the right side so I read his word to see how HE wants me to live.
