Oil spills occur in nature, therefore they are natural and good. School shootings occur in nature, therefore they are natural and good. Interesting morality you got here.Oh but, you say. Homosexuality doesn't hurt anyone. Really? why is their life expectancy rate almost half that of heterosexual males? It's certainly not from bigotry and intolerance. It's more like suicide and infectious disease.So in short the morality you propose is woefully inadequate. I'll stick to basing mine on the immutable character of our creator, not the changing opinions of mere men.
