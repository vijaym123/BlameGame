By keeping homosexuals from marrying, you are sending the message that something is wrong with them.To say that they deserve to marry is insane. It isn't a matter of deserving. It is a matter of fair and equal treatment under the law.Some day, in the future, we will look back at the people who opposed homosexual marriage the same way we view those who opposed interracial marriage or the right of the mentally disabled to marry.Since a marriage is a government identified institution, the government MUST treat all citizens equally and afford everyone the same opportunities.
