"The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.The man said,         "This is now bone of my bones,         And flesh of my flesh;         She shall be called Woman,         Because she was taken out of Man."  For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed." (Genesis 2:22-25, NASB)  Here we see that the one flesh union (which is sexual union, 1 Co 6:16) has an intrinsic desgin between the one man and one woman.  This also is the design and beginning of marriage for we see that they are now husband and wife.  No marriage in Scripture is never anything but heterosexual and although at times polegomy is practiced by peoople in the Bible that does not mean it is God's favor.  We see here from the begining and from the teachings of Jesus and the church that clearly practices were tolerated because of hardness of heart, not because God favored them.  As for complementarianism, it is supported by St. Paul- or should we accuse him of basing his view off of Plato too?  "For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake." (1 Corinthians 11:8-9, NASB)Also notice that prior to woman being taken from man man is always reffered to as Hb. Adam, man as in mankind, human kind.  However, as the man declairs that woman is taken from man he no longer uses the word Adam, as Adam no longer sufices as a description of himself becasue he is no mankind in this sense without woman who is taken from him, he is (Hb.)'iysh, that is, man, male, husband, servant in contrast to the female.  Earlier in the first chapter we can also see that marraige is connected to procreation (which is obviosly not possible in a homosexual context).  Plato and the Bible actually agree on one point, homosexuality is against nature as it is against God's created design both for marraige and for the nature of marraige which is built in the complentary aspects of the male and female, masculine and femminine.  argument 2: God doesn't mention in Scripture that he will only bless heterosexual marriages. Actually it does.  Since marriage by nature is heterosexual and God only blesses sexual union in the context of marriage this is taken for granted.  In any case, where does it say he will bless a homosexual union?  It doesn't, rather He calls it an abomination (not a blessing).
