[arsenokoitai]- I Cor 6:9 in Greek, from the Textus Receptus.The problem with saying arsenokoitai means homosexual is that, in ancient times, arsenokoitai was never used with our modern meaning of homosexual.Conservative evangelical New Testament scholar, Dr. Gordon Fee (he's heterosexual) says that arsenokoitai is rarely used in Greek literature,     “especially when describing homosexual activity.” The quote is from p. 244 of his commentary, The First Epistle To The Corinthians, Eerdmans, 1987, by Dr. Gordon D. Fee.Dr. Fee still believes I Cor 6:9 refers to homosexual activity but he is honest enough to admit that his opinion is nothing more than  "a best guess."  I am not willing to be silent when Christians attack gay or lesbian relationships with faulty "best guesses" while ignoring actual historical usage of arsenokoitai. When we factor in actual usage of the word, arsenokoitai, honesty compels the conclusion that arsenokoitai does not mean homosexual. Some Christians admit that the word arsenokoitai was never used to mean homosexual. Then they insist that arsenokoites means homosexual anyway, since arseno means man and koite is a euphemism for sex. Their reasoning is that when the two parts are combined into one word, it must mean homosexual.Famous British scholar, Dr. James Barr, (he was heterosexual) 1924-2006, was called by the Times Online obituary, “probably the most significant Hebrew and Old Testament scholar in Britain in the twentieth century.”  Here is what Dr. Barr said about the etymology of words.    “The main point is that the etymology of a word is not a statement about its meaning but about its history... ...it is quite wrong to suppose that the etymology of a word is necessarily a guide either to its ‘proper’ meaning in a later period or to its actual meaning in that period.”    James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language, Oxford University Press, New York, 1961, p. 109.The way arsenokoites was actually used in the ancient Greek language must be our guide as to its meaning. In ancient times, arsenokoitai was never used with our modern meaning of homosexual.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Arsenokoites.html
