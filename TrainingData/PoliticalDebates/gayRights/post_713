argument 3: Pologmy in the Bible proves that the complementary theory is not how God sees it.  There is murder in the Bible, there is rape, there is theft but does God look favorly on any of these things?  No!  Just like homosexuality all of these things are condemed as sinful.  Just because it is in the Bible does not mean it is blessed by God or favored, that is terrible reasoning.
