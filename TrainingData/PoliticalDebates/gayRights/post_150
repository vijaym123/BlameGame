Civil unions create a "separate and thus unequal" problem Any proposed alternative to marriage itself would be unacceptable as “registered” gay couples would still not enjoy completely equal rights as married heterosexual couples in society. This would also fuel the idea that registered gay couples enjoy an inferior status to married heterosexual couples, thereby giving rise to discrimination all over again.
The cultural importance of "marriage" makes civil unions insufficient
Civil unions are frequently unequal to marriage in benefits and rights 
Gay marriage would be met by fewer instances of cross-state discrimination than civil unions
