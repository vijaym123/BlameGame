Just as left-handedness, sexual orientation is no known or knowable at  birth, but is recognized later.  Neither handedness nor sexual orientation is chosen. They are discovered when they appear.  No one knows all the factors that cause sexual orientation; it is complex and may involve hormones, genetics, rearing, and other factors; but it is NOT chosen, either heterosexual or homosexual. There doen's  have to be a gene, necessarily to have genetikc factors.
