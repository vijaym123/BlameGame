I realize that personal experience needs to be questioned, but my experiences tell me that sexual orientation is not a matter of choice.  I have known I was gay since I was 18 and if I am being truthful there were hints much, much earlier in my life that I ignored, because I didn't want to accept that reality.  When I discovered my gay identity, I became extremely closeted and spent several years in a quasi-suicidal mindset.  Had I been able to   change   my sexual orientation, I would have in a heartbeat.I don't know whether people are born gay or they "become" gay early in life.  I don't believe that it matters.  If there were a definite genetic link, the next stage would be for people to find a "cure" and honestly I don't believe I have anything to be cured of.  We should accept that sexuality is a complex part of human existence.  Some people are gay, some people are straight, some people are bisexual and others fall somewhere else on the spectrum.  And you know what, that's OK.
