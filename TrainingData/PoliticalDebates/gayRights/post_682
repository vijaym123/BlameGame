Why worry about it?  "Sin" is only a concern if you buy into that particular mythology anyway.  Besides, any   religion  's idea of "immoral" shouldn't necessarily be "illegal".  As long as you are harming no innocent person (someone who doesn't deserve to be harmed right now) what you do is no one's business but your own.
