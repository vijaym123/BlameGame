"Trust me thats the one aspect of   nursing   I can tell you with full certainty that hospitals and   doctors   give all considerations to the patients and their partners, no matter who that partner is, so the story you gave will very emotional is still incorrect."Yet you trot out the same tired bits of anecdotal evidence in virtually every argument you make about homosexuals.  Since gay couples cannot get married they do not have protection from discrimination IF a hospital decides not to allow visitation..."Just because you sleep with someone does not automatically make you the number one person in that persons   legal   and moral life! You cant force a Holy God to accept what isnt right and you cant force people to accept it either.And I should know because I am that person."What God accepts as right (or not right) is not a sound basis for legal rights.  Not everyone believes in the Christian God (many don't believe in any God(s)).The difference between a couple having an affair and a homosexual couple is that IF both people in the affair want to share legal rights then they can get married (after a divorce from their other   marriage  (s)).  Sates that deny homosexual marriage do not allow homosexual couples that same right...You don't have to accept a homosexual union... you are free to treat them like they are not married, but as far as the LAW is concerned they should enjoy the same protections as any other couple.
