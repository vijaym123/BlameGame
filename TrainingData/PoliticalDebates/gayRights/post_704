I offer these helpful free resources which do a great job of explaining the cultural, historical and religious situation Paul addressed in first century Rome.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1-And-Homosexuality.html    Remember that Romans addressed a real historical situation in the first century. Cybele, the fertility goddess, had five temples in her honor in first century Rome.     http://www.jeramyt.org/papers/paulcybl.html    There is no logical or thoughtful way to divorce our modern understanding of Romans 1 from the cultural, historical and religious situation in the first century. I know it goes against what you've been taught but facts are facts.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html
