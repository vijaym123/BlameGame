I'm really starting to think that "Christians" such as yourself take the words of Paul to mean more than the words of Christ.  If you're a Christian... show me where Jesus - you know... the person whom you're supposed to be following - says that being gay is a sin.  Tell me how you think Jesus would have reacted to a gay person sharing Christ's message.  Tell me if you think Jesus would have treated a gay man or woman any differently than a leper, or a whore, or anyone else.
