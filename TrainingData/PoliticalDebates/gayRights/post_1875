Replace the word "marriage" in government documents with the word "civil union", ta da! The government then only deals with civil unions between two consenting adults of any gender. Marriage would then be a word reserved for individuals and churches to define. If a church decides that only a man and a woman can marry then same sex couples will not be recognized as being married by that church or members of that church. They would still receive the same benefits of a civil union (previously known by the government as a "marriage") but the "sanctity of marriage" is maintained for groups who do not approve of same sex couples. Marriage is a word whose connotation and definition differ from individual to individual. The use of the word by government is provocation for misunderstanding and schism. Will people immediately say "Wow, the government isn't calling your union a marriage so I'm OK with you now,"? No. But that's too bad. A hundred and fifty years ago people looked at a freedman walking down the street and said "Somebody aught to sell him." Society has to change and we as rational human beings have to acknowledge that even when we don't approve of someone's choices they have a right to make them. We have to accept that all humans are entitled to equal treatment under the law. No one should be treated differently by the law because of their social class, their gender, their sexual preferences, their race, or any other traits unless they have in some way harmed another person through direct action or inaction.
