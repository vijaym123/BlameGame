Being Raised by two lesbians was brilliant they are my momsI was bullied but i got over it like most   children  .But i would like to say that i believe that children from 'Normal' families are worse of.I am healthier mentaly than most of my friends who come from Mom/Dad households, i dont take   medication   at all.Funny that my Moms are still together after 20 Years while most of my friends parents have long since seperated
