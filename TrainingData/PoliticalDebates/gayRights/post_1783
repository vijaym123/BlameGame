Not if you're gay it isn't...lol! Seriously john, this has been asked 10 times in the last 6 months. There is so much information out there on the subject it will make your head spin. Homosexuality is a very bad thing in a straight world due to the pre-conceived notions and prejudice that is just glaring. I am gay, which most people on the site are aware of and I can tell you that no one in their right mind would CHOOSE this as a lifestyle. It's much easier to be straight in this society...but imagine what it would be like for you if the positions were changed and the majority were gay, but you liked women! You cannot help what you were born to be and to live any other way would be an injustice to you and all you are. No...it doesn't have to be a bad thing, but people do try and make it so.
