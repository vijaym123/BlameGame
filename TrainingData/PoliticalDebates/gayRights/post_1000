  Evolution theory makes it clear that homosexual activities are perversions of natural biological laws. The basis of evolution is the reproduction of beneficial genes and the elimination of  detrimental ones in succeeding generations -- the "survival of the fittest." In our species that requires heterosexual intercourse.  If accidental mutation had ever produced a "homosexual gene," lack of propagation would have quickly bred it out of Homo sapiens.  Thus, homosexuals do what they do because they want to, not because they have to.  That they have a right to do it is no excuse for new laws to force others to approve of it.  Every known human community has had the sound scientific foundation of heterosexual marriage, which we are now urged to destroy for a minority's perverted pleasures.
