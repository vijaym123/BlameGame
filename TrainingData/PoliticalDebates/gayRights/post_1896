I'm mostly against marriages for all so the last one... although I'm being forced to chose from a set I wouldn't normally chose from. Especially since there's no explanation for being against marriages for all, leaving room for interpretation, accusations, and long drawn out arguments.... but then again, that's why I'm here ;)
