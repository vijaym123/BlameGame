Aegiltheugly,I believe that all they want is equal rights under the law.  We've seen how "separate but equal" worked in the segregated south.  It didn't work.  "Separate" can never be "equal".I firmly believe that the word marriage can be replaced by union, civil union, or household in legal documents and law.  In fact, that's what we should do.  Then, if you are registered in that status, you have all the financial obligations and rights that only married couples can share in now.  And that includes divorce.Then we could let the churches marry people under their beliefs and procedures. That way, the sacred covenant of marriage would be protected in your church.Would that not satisfy everyone?Michelle
