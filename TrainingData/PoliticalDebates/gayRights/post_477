You make a critical flaw in this argument.  A great many societies, and individuals, disapprove of   homosexuality   with absolutely no basis in   religion  .  A historical analysis will prove your conclusion quite utterly wrong.  I completely agree, however, that scientific data must stand on its own and have no taint of belief in it (on either side).  The fact of the matter is that a historical analysis will be able to show that societies of nearly every conceivable belief system have existed.  Societies have practiced, promoted or at least tolerated polyandry, cuckoldry, polygamy and many other things we disapprove of for many reasons other than religious; "we" meaning a western-European society.  I'm sorry but history does not help your position.
