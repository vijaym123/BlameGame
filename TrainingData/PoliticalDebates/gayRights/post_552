Substance abuse requires you to take some of the substance before you become addicted. If homosexuality were the equivalent, there would be only a few gay people, because nobody would be gay until they'd had sex with someone of the same gender. I like your handwaved claim that "most of the people do not experience psychological effects." Not only is that entirely different from the findings of groups who aren't funded by EI, but you also duck how severe they are. Are the people who were negatively psychologically affected dead?I also noticed that since the last time I visited your website, when you listed your "recovery" rate as 33% with no long-term follow-ups, you've stopped listing a rate at all; you merely claim it works with no information.
