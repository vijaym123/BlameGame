"few people would get married if it were not for the benefits attached to such a union."I seriously doubt this. People get married for religious, cultural, and personal reasons. I think tax benefits and what have you are just an afterthought for most people."Gay marriage hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion."By this logic, all marriage hurts us.
