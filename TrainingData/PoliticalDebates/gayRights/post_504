The word translated as "homosexual" is "arsenokoitai." Nobody knows what it means, because Paul apparently coined it  himself. Bible scholars think that Paul was either condemning sex with underage male prostitutes, or the rape of male prisoners of war. (Male prisoners were frequently sexually assaulted, and still are, as a show of control by their captors. The Vikings seem likely to have done it; so did the ancient Egyptians; so do modern armies. It was also thought at some times that by "making them women," they would no longer be manly warriors.)
