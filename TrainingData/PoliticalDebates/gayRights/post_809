The Bible, in it's original language and context, doesn't even address homosexuality as we know it today...much less condemn it.The bottom line here is that most Christians still use all the old arguments about the Bible condemning homosexuality when it has been proven, time and again, that isn't the case.  I live a vibrant Christian life and have a wonderful relationship with my Lord Jesus Christ.  I also live a wonderful life with my female partner of 15 years, who is also a committed Christian.  It is possible to please the Lord and still be homosexual.  I'm nowhere near perfect, but I know from speaking with the Lord and hearing His voice that He is pleased with me.
