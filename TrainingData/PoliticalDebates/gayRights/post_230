Same sex marriages are JUST AS MUCH capable, if not more, to provide the best environment, and love needed for a child, as opposing sex couples. And some people are saying you hate gays because of the way your talking. if you had said something like "i think same sex marriages can provide well, but opposing sex can do better, either way it works" then people wouldn't think you hate gays, but because your dissin on them and everything they think you hate them.
