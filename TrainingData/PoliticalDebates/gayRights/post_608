Why does anyone care that much about what goes on in someone else's bedroom?  Is it hurting your life? No.  If homosecuality is a sin, then let God deal with it.  Your job as a human is to love thy neighbor and notice that there are no disclaimers in that passage.The other thing is that, and I don't care who you are, what is considered 'moral' in the bedroom is not something you want to start judging because odds are near 100% what ever you are doing, even with your wife, is considered immoral by someone else.For example, oral sex is illegal and immoral in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia and Washington D.C.In fact, the bible is very clear that sex should only be performed for procreation and I am 100% sure that these morality police are not living up to that part of the bible.It astounds me how the far right of religon can throw out bible quotes to support thier opinions yet choose to overlook other passages.Hey Rick, try reading the whole bible some time.
