I suspect a philosophical fallacy in the Family Research Council’s argument here. They write, “This response is followed by “the purpose of marriage is to have children” (4 percent), which also recognizes a purposeful – and thus “natural” – design for human sexuality.” This, admittedly, may have some validity. Marriage, as it has been traditionally defined, may imply “procreation.” However, as David Hume argued, questions about what “ought to be” cannot be derived from questions about what “is.” The fundamental question in this debate is: Should two consenting male adults, for example, be allowed the right to marry? To respond as FRC has done, by appealing to what “is” (or what has always been) and therefore what “should be,” is fallacious because these are two fundamentally different questions. As their argument rests on this assumption, it should be questioned for its validity.
