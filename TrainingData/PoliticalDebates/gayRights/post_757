You can't define anything by saying, "It's whatever God/Zeus/Odin/Charlie says it is." Well, not if you expect to be taken seriously, anyway.When is an act a "sin", and why? Does someone have to be harmed? Is it enough that it offends someone?Can you do better than this? ÒSin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily. All other "sins" are invented nonsense. (Hurting yourself is not sinful - just stupid).Ó -  Robert A. Heinlein
