Religion can offer an out to those that cannot accept their Gayness, are unhappy, don't want to lead a Gay lifestyle and do believe. Like it or not a living a religious life style often leads to a happier more adjusted person than if they lead a purely secular lifestyle. I've known very many people where this was the case. It's entirely possible that some Gay people will be happier leading a celibate spiritual life style. There is no one size fits all solution. Your unilateral put down of Religion is totally uncalled for and reveals a very narrow minded  and hostile attitude on your part. Before you stereotype me, I am not Religious and am not a believer but have utmost respect for those that do.
