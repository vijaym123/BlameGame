"Marriage is defined as a religious institution."Wrong.  Wrong, you're already wrong.Nobody is arguing about whether or not churches should sanction same-sex marriages.  The point in question is civil (secular) marriages.  Religion is absolutely irrelevant when we're talking about secular law."Do I think that it is wrong to ignore the already given rights of a religion, violating them in order for a person's choice (what religion they belong to) to be kept unchanged? Yes."How about the Buddhists and the Shinto and the Hindu who don't oppose same-sex marriages?  As a Shinto, I would be offended if my First Amendment rights were abridged solely on the basis of somebody else's First Amendment rights being upheld.  Is it right that my Shinto beliefs be put down for somebody else's Christian beliefs?To clarify, same-sex couples do not and should not request religious institutions to sanction their marriages.  They are and should be appealing to the government to sanction their marriages.
