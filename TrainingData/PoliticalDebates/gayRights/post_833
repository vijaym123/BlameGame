I disagree with your reasoning in a number of areas.First, you have simply reworded (however inadvertently) the anti-gay viewpoint of Robert Gagnon which asserts that scripture condemns every same sex partnership without distinguishing between committed faithful non-cultic partnerships and shrine prostitute couplings (Gagnon, The Bible And Homosexual Practice) when you say:>>>>"we partitioned, outside of the context of the scripture... same-sex unions into acceptable ones... and unacceptable ones... This partitioning did not exist at all in scripture"<<<< I submit that scripture does differentiate (partition) same sex sexual activity and that this differentiation/partition was recognized by the authors of scripture who wrote about Sodom, by the authors of scripture who alluded to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and by Jewish rabbis and philosophers like Philo of Alexandria. All of them focused on shrine prostitution when discoursing on these verses, as did the rabbis whose human wisdom fills the Babylonian Talmud.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Babylonian-Talmud-On-Sodom.html  Further, Dr. Gagnon (THE most ardent anti-gay evangelical alive today) contradicts your assertion on pages 100-110 and 130 of his book when he asserts the primacy of shrine prostitution in ancient Israel and remarks that shrine prostitution was the primary manifestation of homosexual activity in ancient Israel.Gagnon, the anti-gay crusader, differentiates committed faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships from the shrine prostitution against which Moses and God inveigh in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.Second, EVERY human author of scripture who mentions Sodom fails to link Sodom to homosexuality.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html  Third, EVERY human author of scripture who alludes to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 links the verses to shrine prostitution or the qadesha (shrine prostitutes).  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html  In attempting to buttress your argument I believe you vastly overreach when you state:>>>>"I submit, because at *least at that time*, the writers of scripture quite probably saw any same-sex sexual union *only in that context*, and couldn't conceive of it outside of an idolatrous, cultic context."<<<<Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Repentance.html
