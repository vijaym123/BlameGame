I'm all for same sex couples getting married.  But it's the legal part that I disagree with.  IMHO, the legality of marriage should have nothing to do with government recognition or benefits. Governments should have a concept for Civil Unions for any two people to enter into.  A contract between the couple and the State in essence.  If the government wants to provide benefits, i.e. tax deductions, to people in a union as a result of them having kids, owning property, etc, then do so as encouragement and recognition that stable relationships can benefit the greater good of society (not that single people don't as well.)Marriage then should be, as it has become, a religious institution.  Let each faith in the world decide if they will allow their religious leaders and followers to participate in same sex marriages or not.
