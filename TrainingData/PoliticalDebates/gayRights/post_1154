I partly agree. I believe they should be able to file   taxes   together and get all the   legal   benefits in theory off married couples. But should not be allowed to wed. In theory, but i think that we shouldn't open the door for any advance of the homosexual   society  , I am completely against it and think that it is evil. But so is a lot of stuff in society.
