This may be a question that many have considered already, but I feel that it's fundamental. If it wasn't natural for somebody, why else would it exist? Why would there be homosexuals at all if it was "unnatural"? Unless it is some kind of innate attraction, how would it have come about in the first place? Has the proposer of this question yet considered this?
