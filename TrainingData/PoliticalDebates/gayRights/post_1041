I believe that   gay marriage   is wrong & should not be legal. as ejones said...1 Corinthians 6:9-11: "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be decieved; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, NOR HOMOSEXUALS, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such WERE some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but yiou were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."
