This argument seems to rest on the fact that gay marriage would require different labels for the partners. While I agree that "Party A" and "Party B" are unromantic and absurdly bureaucratic designations, this seems more like a matter of taste than of fundamental values. "Cold, contractual" language? Well, yes. To the extent that marriage is a legal issue, it is in fact a contract - it involves two people making a commitment, in exchange for which they will receive certain rights and benefits. In New York it is possible for a gay couple to enter into such a contract, only they have to call it a domestic partnership rather than a marriage. In theory, this protects their rights, giving them access to the same benefits associated with heterosexual marriage.My question is this: why do we need a legal distinction between marriage and domestic partnership? If domestic partnership truly protects gay rights, the contract should be equivalent to a marriage contract. If this is the case, what is the significance of the label "marriage?" If it is a matter of tradition, or taste, or religious preference, it has no place in the law.
