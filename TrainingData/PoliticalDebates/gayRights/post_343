While the Family Research Council (FRC) is a fine organization, the American College of Pediatricians is not in any way supported by or associated with the FRC. The College is an independent, national organization of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals dedicated to the health and well-being of children. Its goal is to produce sound policy, based upon the best available research, to assist parents and to influence society in the endeavor of childrearing. The mission and works of the College can be found on its website, www.BestforChildren.org.
