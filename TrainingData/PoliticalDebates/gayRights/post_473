This animal kingdom reference is shallow and jumping the gun.  Lets look at other primates and dogs as examples.....we have all seen the male and male copulation simulation on TV and the local dog park.  We cannot conclude these acts as   homosexuality   as we humans understand it.  It is understood as either an act of dominance or part of a calming/making up activity.  These actions are not exclusive from heterosexual activities if given the chance to mate.  Please be more specific about your case studies (natural history). Another point.  What is natural?  Yes, it is natural for an outside male lion to challenge the male lion of the pride.  After the new lion wins...he kills all the young of the previous leader of the pride.  Many do misunderstand this as you did with the animal kingdom homosexuality issue and call it murder.  No it is not murder.  Both of these issues that I brought up (homosexuality and murder) allows us to compare and contrast human from non human   animals  .  The only factor that makes sense of these comparison is human morality.  We do not call a bald eagle taking fish from an osprey as stealing in the sense that a thief can steal your   money  .  Human morals do not apply to other animals.  You are creating a fallacy called anthropomorphism. Excluding morality, your misunderstanding of the animal kingdom is the problem.  Given the chance these males that supposedly were acting in "homosexual" activity would breed with a female or the alpha female.
