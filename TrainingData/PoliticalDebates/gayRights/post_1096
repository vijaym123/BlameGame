The failure of the courts should not be a reason to deny same sex couples the same rights and privileges.The reason same sex marriage should be legalized is to protect the religious freedoms of others. Any law that permits same sex marriage should also include provisions which permit people to exercise their own freedom of religion to not get involved with such ceremonies if it is against their religion. This is how same sex marriage is dealt with in Canada presently. Noone is forced to perform a same sex marriage ceremony.
