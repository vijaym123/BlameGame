It does refer to many parts of Idolatry in Romans 1, but even so it describes same gender sex and attractions as "vile affections." That means God did not approve if it was called "vile." Another point, "lusting" is a sin. If homosexuals are lusting towards another, they are sinning as well.The point I am trying to make, is that "homosexuality" is never described as "good" in the bible, meaning we should consider not being involved in it. It is considered as vile, impurity (v. 24), to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves (v. 25). He gave them up because they we committing idolatry to many things, including other men and women. Their is due penalty for their error in practicing their lusts for the same gender (v. 26-27). That is why homosexuality is a sin. It involves practicing the "opposite" and "unnatural" ways that are against the way God created us to function.
