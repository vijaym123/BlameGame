Laurie, I fully understand and agree with your point about wanting to be with your spouse when one of you is in the hospital...or when any time of celebration or heartache occurs.  You should be able to file joint income taxes, and to be covered together under insurance policies.  I understand all of that.  I want that for you, too.  I want that for my daughter and her partner, too.  But whether or not your relationship should be called marriage is not something that I and my fellow voters should determine.  That should be determined by your church and mine.  I am weary of government sticking its head into issues which are not the pervue of government.  What I do with my body is between me and my God.  What you and your partner choose to do after you receive a license from the state to be joined in a civil ceremony would be entirely up to you and whatever religious beliefs you follow.  Marriage simply does not fall under the items over which the government has dominion.Over the years, Government has taken a larger and larger bite into our lives, until it seems that they now want to take control of almost everything - how our children are raised and educated, what we can and cannot do about disclipine, and who we can marry.  Both major political parties have lost sight of the intent of our forefathers, who left England to seek a life here free of intrusive government.  You and your partner should never have had this problem in the first place....so there...nanny nanny boo boo.
