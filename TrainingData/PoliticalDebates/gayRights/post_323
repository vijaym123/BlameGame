While I agree that most obese people are that way because they simply over-eat there are those that have medical   conditions   that make it nearly impossible to lose   weight  . One of my friends had a thyroid problem. She ate right, she was on three different   sports   teams and she *still* could not get down to her optimum size.And if you want to have a civil debate it would be nice if you would refrain from insulting my   religion  . I love God but I'm not a   bible   thumping lunatic either.I personally believe wholeheartedly that being gay is genetic. It just doesn't make sense otherwise. Honestly, why would someone *choose* to be part of a persecuted group?
