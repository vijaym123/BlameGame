No one says you have to LIKE gay people, or gay marriage.  What you do not have a right to do is force what your notions of right and wrong upon others by preventing them from attaining equal status under the law.  You can wear a shirt that says "I'd rather lick a pig's anus than agree with gay marriage".  You can be just as vocal about being irrationally against something just like the KKK is.... you don't have to accept gay marriage.  But you don't have a right to legally prevent another person from attaining the same legal protections marriage offers.  No one is "indoctrinating" anyone.  It's the indoctrination of society that had prevented gay people from being accepted as even people until recent history.   Aaaand you would appear to have been indoctrinated.
