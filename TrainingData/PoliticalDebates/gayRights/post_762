My friend. You will either suffer for sinning or for doing what's right.I'd rather suffer for choosing the right path. God desires to rescue us from suffering as sinners, but that means we'll need to suffer ridicule as His children. Humans are in a battle for their souls. You can either surrender to the enemy and sit in a cell as satan's prisoner or you can suffer with Jesus Christ as a soilder and take some hits."Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus." 2 Tim. 2:3Secondly, you're making an assumption from a perspective of someone who's obviously never experienced a true encounter with the very real God who sets people free from lust and dysfunctions.God came in the form of man in the person of Jesus Christ and suffered with us against sin and won our freedom. He paid for our debt. That's worth suffering for if it means gaining life eternal.Hbr 2:10 ESV - For it was fitting that he (God), for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder (Jesus) of their salvation perfect through suffering.
