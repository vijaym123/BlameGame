as that all the time. They tell girls that if they are tom-boyish they are lesbians, they tell boys if they even pick up a doll they are transgender, they tell   kids   that they arent allowed to even consider the games or toys or life of a typical opposite sex person without being branded homosexual. The homosexual movement is sick and as a parent Im pretty sick-n-tired of it! Kids love to play with mudpies, even boys and that does not make them sissy boys. Girls love to climb trees and play with remote control   cars   too and that does not make them lesbian. The   children   of today are being robbed of their childhood by homosexual activists. Shame on them!
