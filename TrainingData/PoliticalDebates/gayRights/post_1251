I object to the assumption that the purpose of marriage is for procreaion.  Were this the case we would prohibit couples where either the man or the woman were sterile, couples who had progressed past the child-bearing age, or couples who did not intend to have children with the same legal strictures that we place on gay couples.Accepting same-sex couples marrying is not the same as relatives marrying, nor is it the same as multiple marriage, or "marriage" to an animal.  Each of these are very seperate and distinct arguements.The legal basis for marriage exists to ensure the rights that the states and federal government provide such as visitation in hospitals, tax incentives, etc.  Should there be an objection on a religious basis this is for each church, synagogue, mosque, etc to determine on their own what they choose to do, from their own religious standpoint.  The seperation clause should keep that decision out of a legal framework.
