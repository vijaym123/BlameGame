As far as the state is (or should be) concerned, marriage is essentially a business partnership between two individuals. They share financial responsibility of property, income, taxes, children, etc.Any factors outside of that partnership are purely dependent upon religion or the personal beliefs of said individuals and therefore should not be regulated by the state as it would violate the separation of church and state and personal rights as provided by the First Amendment.
