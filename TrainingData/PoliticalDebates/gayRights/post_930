There is no way that legalized same-gender marriage would lead to "discrimination against religion."  Religious groups have been free to pursue their own beliefs since this nation was founded, even when those beliefs have been odious to the general population.  Churches were among the main proponents of antimiscegenation laws, which prevented people of different races from intermarrying.  When those laws were overturned, churches continued to preach against interracial marriage, and even to refuse to marry interracial couples.  A couple was denied marriage as recently as 2000 because the bride was white and the groom was black.  To my knowledge, no legal action has taken place against the church involved:  http://www.skeptictank.org/wedband.htm    http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-29802943.html  The Roman Catholic Church has been denying holy orders to women and denying marriage to previously divorced persons for their entire existence in this country, and has never been the successful target of a lawsuit or prosecution for these activities.The separation of Church and State is strong enough in this country to protect churches from undue interference from civil legislation which affects other agencies and non-profits.  The problem is that separation of Church and State is suddenly not proving forceful enough to protect innocent citizens from undue influence being exerted by churches to deny those citizens basic civil rights protections.
