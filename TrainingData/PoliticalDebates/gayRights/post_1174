Most of Americans don’t want to legalize gay marriage, but how does that affect all that oppose it? If gay couples want to get married, why is it up to the whole world to decide whether or not they can?  To all opposing and opposite-sex couples; why should you get to be happily married to the one you love and same- sex couples are denied the right in most states? Whether or not you think “being gay is wrong” doesn’t matter. There will still be gay couples so why not let them live life as happily as you are.
