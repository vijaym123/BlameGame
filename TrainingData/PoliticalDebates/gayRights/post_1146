This is absurd. Do you realize how easy it would be to counter these by posting criminal or unusual acts of heterosexuals? Posting links to articles about homosexual rapists is as easy as finding articles about heterosexual rapists. Or posting links about controversial activisists who are heterosexual-based crowds is quite easy. The point is:  you posting various links proves absolutely nothing in regards to how "shameful"   homosexuality   it. There are countless atrocities that could be cited which were performed by heterosexuals.
