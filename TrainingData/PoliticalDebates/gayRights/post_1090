"But I guess one of many of my concerns with this absurd phenomenon is the fact that we know that NAMBLA has very strong and documented ties to mainstream homosexual organizations and ssm is only a front to their attempts to rape little boys."Can you document that documentation?  Something recent?"We only have to look as far as the latest caper pulled by homosexual activists ie the big kiss-in orgy in front of churches to know that they are about destruction not about building anything."Can you cite instances of the Great Kiss In that occurred in front of churches?"And I guess lastly I would just like to say that you have all the rights you need in a Civil Union so there is no reason to tear down someone elses belief system so you can walk all over them."I've got to ask... is your belief structure so fragile that homosexuals getting married will destroy it?
