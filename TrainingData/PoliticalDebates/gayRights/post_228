I had two dads LONG before this entire debate hit the spotlight and the only disadvantage I feel that I've had when compared to my best friend (who had a   mom   and a dad) is that I have to put up with all the talking heads wondering if I'm disadvantaged/in danger/abused/maladjusted/"influenced to be   gay  "/etc...I may have a few quirks (find me someone who doesn't) but aside from that I'm about as boring as plain white bread. I'm straight, with my girlfriend (now fiance) for the last 2 years, I'm in   college   and almost done a bachelors degree in childhood   education  .Want me to describe my childhood? In a word: Boring!That's right! BORING!! Outside of a couple jerks (oh noes! bullies!) who gave me a hard time for having two dads, no one cared.Especially not me. I loved them both and they loved me, we did a lot of "normal" family things that a good number of   kids   with only one parent never got to do, so on and so forth.I think I had it pretty damn good and while I know a single individual does not a study make, I honestly think that kids with no or single parents are at a disadvantage, NOT those with two parents, no matter WHAT their sexes are.
