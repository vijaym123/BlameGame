Understanding what causes deafness or other physical conditions--and learning to treat people with dignity and respect--is not the same as inventing a new philosophy on sexuality and gender and pretending it has a basis in science or Biblical tradition. Which again, has not been "proven" at all. You and many other people want to believe it because it works for you, and that's fine. That's not proof of fact and it's not justification for rewriting Scripture."We all want progress, but if you're on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive."C. S. Lewis
