a basic tenet of   education   is to teach both what is and what is not. therefore, in order to grow up normally as an adult male, a boy needs to learn via observing his parents know how to be a man, and how not to be a woman. conversely, a girl in order for her to grow up normally needs to seeing how it is to become a woman, and how not to become a man.
