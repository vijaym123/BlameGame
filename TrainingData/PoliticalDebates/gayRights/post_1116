When does Religious Marriage truly exist beyond the ritual associated with it? You need   legal   documentation to be married according to a number of institutions. Civil Marriage is paperwork. Religious Marriage is ceremonial and is mostly a superstitious event. Does Religious Marriage hold up in court just as well as paperwork that's been documented? I don't understand the difference between the two.All I know about   marriage   is that it's something that cultures did to consolidate two families' resources through arranged marriages and it's also been used as a form of social engineering. Many people have seen it ingrained into their   religion  , which is the origin of Religious Marriage I suppose. The true origin of marriage is pretty arguable and its merits are mostly social and somewhat questionable outside of things like tax codes and religious belief.Two people, no matter what their   race   or gender, may consent to whatever they want with one another? Who cares? If you're gay or straight, it's your business. Not mine. Do whatever you want! And as for hate, if it isn't because of your sexual preference you'd be hated for being fat.
