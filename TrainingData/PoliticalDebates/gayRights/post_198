There are currently about half a million   children   in America's foster care system. Why deny any of these   kids   the love they'll receive from someone who wants to raise them? Love they may never have gotten had their biological parents kept them.Other than the fact that they share the same reproductive organs, a gay couple is no different than a heterosexual couple.
