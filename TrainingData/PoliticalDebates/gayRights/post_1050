"(1) Homosexuality has always existed, but in the thousands of years of history of civilization, every   society   has defined marriage to one man and one women, Why do we wish to change this definition in 2009?"Actually marriage was not always between one man and one woman.  It was also a vehicle for dynastic succession, property transference, and political alliance."(2) Why wasn't same sex marriage an issue 200 years ago? 100 years ago? 50 years ago? 20 years ago? What has change?"In Christian and Muslim world there were (and still are, in some places) laws that would have lead to the arrest of someone who was known to be a homosexual.  Thus there would have been no way to even ask this question until after those laws were rolled back.  There is also the matter of public opinion, which has changed now that homosexuals can act in the open and reasonable people can clearly see that said homosexuals are no threat."(3) As a civil right, should same sex marriage be a protective class/status? be given the same status as other catagories of civil rights? such as civil rights for minorities (African Americans)?, the aged (senior citizens)?, the Handicapp? Sex/Gender?, discrimiantion based on sex/gender?"Yes, homosexuals should be extended the same rights and protections granted to other minorities."(4) And we need to ask the most important of questions; Does a young child/toddler NEED a Mother AND a Father in their life?"Having a mother and a father may be the ideal situation... but it is not always the most practical one.  Isn't it better for a child to have a loving family, even if that family is not the 'norm', then to have no family at all?
