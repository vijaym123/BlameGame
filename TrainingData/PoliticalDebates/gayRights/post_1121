Otherwise I would be arguing the apparent, but not true, reason for the assertion. To directly refute the assertion - no, homosexuality is not unnatural. It occurs across all cultures, geographies and throughout the history of mankind not to mention in other species of animals. President Ahmenijad of Iran was publicly laughed at when he claimed his country has no homosexuals. By definition since it occurs in nature it is not unnatural. That's a much less interesting response, in my mind, than my original posting.My argument is that this whole line of debate is a manufactured topic employed by politicians who force their opponents into an argument that's irrelevant to most people but so emotionally charged that it attracts attention away from more important topics. It's a very useful tactic for a politician who could not win on the issues with an opponent but knows how to manipulate the electorate for a win. It should be called out as such to push it aside in political debate and make room for more important issues.
