The U.S. was not founded on religion... in fact the first Amendment states "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." Whether you want to follow the teachings of a religion in your private life is one thing, but when you deny others rights based on the teachings of your religion you are limiting the rights of others.What if a law was passed that made it illegal to eat meat of fridays? It shouldn't matter if a religious group is the majority, they still shouldn't be allowed to force their beliefs on others. The majority of the people in this nation are also white, but does that give white people the right to take away the rights of minority groups? Of course not.The reason our nation is not a full democracy is to ensure that the majority are not allowed to take advantage of the minority. We have checks and balances to stop the tyranny of the majority.Why though do you consider homosexuality wrong, and not the other things I mentioned? Do you ever eat shellfish or pork? Do you shave? Have you ever touched a woman while she was on her period?To make laws on religion is foolish. Our nation is not a theocracy. Do what you want in your personal life but don't force me to follow to your rules.
