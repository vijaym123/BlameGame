As I have grown up I have seen the lustful behaviors and sexually driven relationships. I see this as a sin because it not only does a disservice to those involved but it is against what we were naturally created for, a man and a woman. If this were not a sin there would have been two guys in the beginning or two women for that matter. Since men and women were created for the purpose of completing each other as well as to reproduce it is easy to say that a homosexual relationship is sinful. That is what is taught however for Christian homosexuals such as myself it causes a major debate. God says no to this but every sin is forgiven if a person strives for a personal relationship with Christ.Therefore I believe it is a sin but nothing greater or less than any other sin such as murder, lying, betrayal, hatred, etc.
