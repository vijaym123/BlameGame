In my experience people who have feelings for the same or opposite sex often wish they did not. After all many relationships start with irrefutable infatuation, followed by much pain as couples hurt each other yet cannot separate.  There are men who just find other men more attractive even whilst they fear what their friends will say. They just dont find women attarctive enough.   I have had clients who have pleaded with me to help them change their feelings, to no avail.It does not seem likely that a person can be made to feel gay or heterosexual by external influences though people can follow trends unless their feelings stop them.One thing is clear.  The   law  , public opinion, persecution or persuasion are as unlikely to change sexual inclination as preventing drug or   alcohol   use.  And there is enough   crime   to indicate   the law   has little influence over that, either.
