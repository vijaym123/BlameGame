You have no right to tell anyone how to live their lives. Not everyone believes the same way you do. What you are trying to do is impose your religion on everyone else, which is just as immoral as allowing corruption into your religion. If your religion or any other religion does not want to ordain same-sex marriages, fine. But keep religion out of politics and let those who don't believe the same as you live their lives the way they see fit without you interfering with their right to do so. I don't see them interfering with your right to Bible-thump, so don't let them interfere with their right to unbelief if that's what they so desire.
