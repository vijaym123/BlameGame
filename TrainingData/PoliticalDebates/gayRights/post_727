This is what Christ say about marriage relationships & sexual immorality.Mark Chapter 10 vs. 6-9But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh:  So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.Romans 1 vs 25-32.Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.  A-men.  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient;  Being filled with all unrighteousness, maliciousness; full of envy murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whispers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.This is how you know you belong to God.I John 1 vs 8-10If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude and lead ourselves astray, and the Truth  [which the Gospel presents] is not in us [does  not dwell in our hearts].  If we [freely] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins, He is faithful and just ( true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [ dismiss our lawlessness] and [ continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action].  If  we say ( claim) we have not sinned, we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar, and His Word is not in us [ the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts].1John Chapter 2 vs.3-4And this is how we may discern [daily, by experience] that we are coming to know Him [ to perceive, recognize, understand, and become better acquainted with Him]:  if we keep (bear in mind, observe, practice His teachings (precepts, commandments).Whoever says, I know Him [ I perceive, recognize, understand, and am acquainted with Him] but fails to keep and obey His commandments (teachings) is a liar, and the Truth [ of the Gospel] is not in him.
