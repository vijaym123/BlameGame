freedom of   religion  .  Which country has the most diverse religion?  The majority (90%) of the US founding fathers were christians.  I think that at least has some weight.  What does Shinto say about marriage, sex, gender, homo, hetero etc..  Not your opinion or shinto/japanese cultural attitude....what does Shinto have to say.  I am curious.Thanks,
