Sorry, buster, but this makes no sense. The evidence has all been refuted big time, and I was raised by my dad and my brother. My mom was a wacko alcoholic who thankfully didn't raise me. Yes, I had an unhappy childhood, but it would've been ten times worse has my mom been there - she's anything but motherly. Now that I'm in college away from my mom, I am as happy as can be. My first roommate, a girl, has been like a mother to me and made a much happier person out of me, but I'm also sexually attracted to her, so try to use your puny evidence to prove which one of those matters!!! And don't tell me that I'm attracted to her only because I never had a mother... that couldn't explain what being one of the happiest people in the world has to do with disadvantages in childhood.
