If proposition 8 passes, it will be challenged at the earliest possible convenience, and it will end up in the same supreme court that allowed gay marriage in the first place.Can't we just let this go? Can't we just allow people to live their own lives the way they want to? They don't hurt anybody.  Do you think that they don't get married in their own Churches?  What makes your beliefs better than theirs?  They use the same Bible.Let me tell you what.  I want ALL  people to have equal rights.  If they have to borrow a word to gain those rights from straight America to achieve them, I'm all for it.Michelle
