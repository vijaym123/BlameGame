"Well if that's the case, look up the second   law   of thermodynamics, it states that everything is moving to disorder, when   evolution   says: bang = life and order. "-eJonesThat is a rather large misrepresentation.  the 2nd law states that the entropy of a closed system increases over time... but the Earth is not a closed system, the Sun adds most of the   energy   to the biosphere (with vulcanism a distant second)."And survival of the fittest? How come apes are still around if we evolved, wouldn't they be weaker and have died off by now?"-eJonesBecause they are well adapted to their   environment  .  Evolution is not a strictly linear process, ancestor species can branch into more then one decedent species... which is to say that modern apes and modern humans are 'cousins'"And matter cannot be created or destroyed according to   the law   of conservation of matter (or mass), so how did all the matter appear on the earth, even the gases that allegedly were there to cause the 'big bang' had to have come from somewhere....right?"-eJonesMatter did not 'appear' on earth, the earth formed from a cloud of interstellar dust (the same cloud that gave rise to the sun and the rest of the planets).  The origins of the universe are not yet known in any great detail... the Big Bang is the current theory, but many questions remain to be answered."Forty people wrote the Bible."-eJonesThat is a fairly specific number, how exactly was it arrived at?"How could they be in complete agreement with one another? The writing of the Bible spanned thousands of years."-eJonesThe most direct answer is that because the Bible is a compilation of religious texts that they were chosen because they were consistent, and that the different authors had all read the earlier texts and were building on them. "There are no contradictions whatsoever in the Bible. But books written by even one person can contradict themselves."-eJonesSo if everyone in the Bible was in complete agreement with each other then the OT passages supporting genocide and slavery are still acceptable?
