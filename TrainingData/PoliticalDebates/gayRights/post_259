It seems the "experts" from Focus think they can dismiss a growing body of work by dicing up the semantics of the APA's general statement.  They could have instead taken a trip to google and found any number of research papers that directly address their question of what kind of heterosexual couple do the   children   of same-sex couples resemble. Dufur, M. , McKune, B. A., Hoffmann, J. P. and Bahr, S. J. , 2007-08-11  "Adolescent Outcomes in Single Parent, Heterosexual Couple, and Homosexual Couple Families: Findings from a National Survey" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City Online  .  2009-03-04 from   http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184075_index.html  The abstract reads,"...In this study, we provide the first empirical analysis using national representative data that compares adolescents from these various family types on several different social outcomes. We utilize data from the National Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) to compare a variety of academic and behavioral outcomes across seven family types: two-  parent   biological, single mother, single father, father/stepmother, mother/stepfather, two   gay   male parents, and two lesbian parents. Comparisons across these family types show that adolescents raised by gay and lesbian parents typically behave more like youth in two parent biological families, providing little support for gendered-deficit theories."There is the answer, "...adolescents raised by gay and lesbian parents typically behave more like youth in two parent biological families..."How can you call yourself an expert when you are not willing to do a 10 minute google search?
