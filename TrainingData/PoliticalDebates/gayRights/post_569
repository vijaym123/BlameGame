...there is no "cancer gene." There are a few genetic combinations that can put you at risk of cancer. But even if you live a low-risk lifestyle, you still might get cancer because of your genes. The greatest benefit to knowing a family history of cancer is not that you live trying to avoid cancer, but that you go in frequently for testing. This raises the odds that any cancer will be found early and treated. None of this harms the idea that there may also be unavoidable genetic factors to homosexuality.  Furthermore, all research shows that sexuality is fairly well solidified by the time a child is born; people come out at 18, they don't turn gay then. So the environmental factors that cause or effect homosexuality are likely prenatal or occur quite early in development. As to your claim that gays in "reparative therapy" treatment are unhappy with themselves and their gender, the gays I know that aren't in "reparative therapy" are happy with themselves and their gender. This is either self-selection, or something about the "therapy." Either way, it's not surprising.
