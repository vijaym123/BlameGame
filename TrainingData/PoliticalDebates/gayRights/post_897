Majority rule is all well and good ... unless the majority behaves as a tyrant. Tyranny of the majority is tyranny nonetheless and anyone who values individual rights and liberty is within their rights to take action to dismantle such a culture's hold on its victims. One is free to define the characteristics of one's community, provided one's community behaves in a way respectful of its individual members' rights and liberties. No community ought to be free to rule with an iron fist, just as no individual is free to do the same. Right to self-determination does not include right to the determination of others against their will, provided such others are not themselves in violation of your rights and liberties.If tyranny of the majority is what you advocate, might I suggest some locations elsewhere on our planet more friendly to the tyrannical. We will have none of it in a nation that allegedly values individual rights and liberties. In such a society, ONE is the majority and always must be.If religious individuals refuse to recognize the authentic marriage of any two individuals, they are within their right to refuse, however, they are not within their rights to forcibly prevent such a union. Opine all you wish, however, you may not turn opinion into a rope around someone else's neck.You may or may not be at liberty to do so, however, you have never been nor ever will have the right.Of course, because an authentic marriage is one of the heart and spirit, no man can prevent it when those who wish marriage desire it truly. A paper and stamp, law and community opinion are irrelevant in that regard.
