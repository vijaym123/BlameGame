Perhaps many supporters of Prop 8 do not, personally, intend to be hatemongers.  However, so long as homosexuals are treated as lesser members of society there will continue to be murders and beatings of homosexuals by bigots who feel their acts are vindicated by such social treatment.  In that respect, no matter what the intention, the acts are those which support hatemongers.I made an error on my prior posting and clicked on "yes" rather than "no because I didn't watch what I was doing.  Don't pander to the bigots by doing the same thing by voting yes on prop 8.  It is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and humane actions.
