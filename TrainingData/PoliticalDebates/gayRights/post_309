Quibbling about the potential adjusted percentages doesn't change the fact that being molested does not make people gay.  If one wishes to scientifically that "being molested makes you gay," it would be necessary to demonstrate scientifically that a significantly higher percentage of molest victims are gay than the general population.  Even demonstrating that a large number of gay people are molest victims (if that were the case) does not provide a causal link, as there may be other reasons why those people were were selected for victimization -- perhaps a predator saw them as particularly vulnerable due to their social isolation.  All of this is hypothetical, anyway.Any way you look at it we don't even have reliable statistics on child abuse (particularly sexual) to begin with, because its very nature causes it to be grossly underreported, both by children who are actively being molested and by adults who were molested in their past, let alone any studies demonstrating anything remotely approaching a "causal link" to the etiology of same-gender attraction.  This is just so much folklore trotted out time and time again until it has become an urban legend.
