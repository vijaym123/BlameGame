Though I personally think that Exodus is a seriously misguided organization, I'd have to disagree. Buchannan is the director of the largest organization in the United States dedicated to helping gay persons achieve "freedom from homosexuality," and he has self-professed experience as someone who has "struggled with homosexual feelings." Just read the Exodus profile here or visit their site. On a related note, the very idea that anyone can achieve "freedom from homosexuality" is not only sadly misguided, but very wrongly implies that homosexuality is something that should be broken free of. Of course, considering the serious legal and societal discriminations against gays, it's no wonder some people try to avoid being labeled gay at all costs.
