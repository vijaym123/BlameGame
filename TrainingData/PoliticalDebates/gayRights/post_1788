Wow, throwing in Intelligent Design...you're just trying to piss me off now aren't you ;).Actually you are looking at evolution on a very limited scale (i.e. individuals evolving). Looking at humanity over the past hundred thousand years you can see that we are social creatures. Therefore, we have not evolved as individuals, but in small groups. In fact, this same process describes how we developed morals. Those societies whose members didn't kill each other survived better. In times of need societies whose members worked for the common good, and didn't make selfish decisions that hurt the group, lasted longer. I tend to be a critic of religion, but those societies that developed religion were able to last longer then those that didn't have traditions for the same reasons.But I digress...Individual homosexuals help the group as a whole to survive better. Therefore if we look at evolution of groups of individuals, and not of the individuals themselves we see that those groups that had a certain percentage of homosexuals in them would survive and pass their genes along.As usual, no deity is needed.
