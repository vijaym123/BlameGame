Paragraph by paragraph all your staements are naive assumptions which are in addition very very unfactual!What say do   kids   born to heterosexual couples have over who their parents are?People dont regret being raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents, people regret being raised by unfit parents, which come in both heterosexual and homosexual packages. Ask a lot of the happy thousands of kids and adults raised by homosexual couples if theyd prefer to have been raised by heterosexual couples and the answer will be different from your assumption.Your parents having divorced when you wree so little is regrettable, but what you really wished for at that age is the idea of a happy loving couple to raise you as you have no idea what the reality of that union would have been. You could have been raised by a bickering always-at-each-other's-throats couple and you would have begged your parents to divorce under those circumstances.  People who give you life in the first place are not guaranteed to build a happy home and living with them in an unhappy home is a huge disadvantage and anythiong else becomes an advantage.a heterosexual loving couple is nomore of an ideal than a homosexual loving couple, this is purely a matter of different strokes for different folks, lets open our minds and thinking a bit here.Some kids and folks are nasty, it does not mean we should ban interracial, huge age gap and homosexual marriages and families as long as both parties involved in the home building and   parenting   are adult and of sound mental   health  .U say "It is irrefutable that it is only possible to produce   children   through heterosexual means. Millions of years of   evolution   has defined heterosexuality as having the highest advantage for every life form higher than bacteria. In the game of survival of the fittest, that's what works best"...and I say take time to pull out a scientific article or watch a documentary or two on   homosexuality   and parenting in the animal kingdom and you will see that homosexual parenting in the wild is not only happening but is quite widespread in some species and that but same-sex parents in some species have exhibited a higher frequency of raising their young to adulthood as compared to their heterosexual counterparts.  http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/more_just_bromance_same_sex_animal_behavior_pretty_common_says_study    http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1288633.ece
