Well said. Too often Christians make homosexual behavior the unforgivable sin. It is not.However, that being said, it is still a sin. The line between law and grace is a tough one to walk, but we must do that nonetheless. There simply are no Scriptural references to homosexuality in a positive light. And the Church has always taught (for nearly 2000 years now) that it is a sin. It is only in our highly sexualized and self-indulgent culture that some people have sought to question that view.Thank you for posting an honest, grace-filled article. And for sharing a touch of  your personal experience.
