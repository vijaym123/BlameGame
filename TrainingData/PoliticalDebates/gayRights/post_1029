Using terms such as "wrong" and "unnatural" does not develop an argument. These terms are used in a definite way when in fact they are indefinite. Who is to say what is wrong and how do we know what is unnatural. There are studies that say homosexuality is natural. So if one says that it is wrong because it is unnatural they might be wrong. On the other hand linking homosexuality to same sex marriage may seem like an acceptable leap but as someone else proved in a comment before it is a false analogy. Episcopalian churches are known to be advocates of gay rights - including gay marriage- although they do not think homosexuality is necessarily "right." It is easy to use faith as a crutch to an argument against something; it is also easy to manipulate words to form an argument as well. I would like to see an argument against same-sex marriage that does not rely on these methods and uses logic and proof as the foundation, instead.
