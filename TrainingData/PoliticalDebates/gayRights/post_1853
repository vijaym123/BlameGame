In the Loving v. Virginia case before the US Supreme Court (which struck bans on interracial marriage), the decision states, "Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival.... The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State." Marriage is a legal contract formed and recognized by the state, and the people have the right to choose their partner in this contract. Nothing could be simpler.
