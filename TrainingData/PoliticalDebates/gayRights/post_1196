When Iowa legalized   gay marriage   the argument was over! Article IV, Section 1of the US Constitution, the Full Faith and Credit Clause says public acts (  marriage  , drivers licenses, ect.), of one state must be recognized by another. Gay marriages done in Iowa will have to be recognized in all the other states.
