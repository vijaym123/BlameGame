I am not gay. I have nothing against gays.  It is their life, not mine. I am not religious.  Why must I face this barrage over this book which I feel has no mandate in MY life? This is a collections of writings from a time when very few people could write. I find it no more binding than a collection of National Enquirer's from the 1950's.When it comes to civil rights, the Bible should be left at home. Government and religion should not mix.  Ever.I respect your rights to have your faith. Please respect my absence of faith.Where gayness and sin are concerned.... leave them alone.  Don't they have enough to deal with?  Can you imagine how difficult it is to be different and on top of that to be told that you are a "sinner"?  How cruel can you be to do this?No, it is not a sin. Show me where it is a "sin" without using your book. How can love be wrong?  Honestly, I just don't get it.Michelle
