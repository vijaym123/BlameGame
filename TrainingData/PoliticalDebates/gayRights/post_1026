Oftentimes, when discussing this issue, religion is brought up.  Basically, the argument is that homosexulaity is a sin and marriage should be between a man and a women.  I'm not here to debate whether it is or isn't a sin.  If your beliefs dictate that it is wrong you are fully within your right to not be gay and to express your opinion.  However, concerning laws on this subject, since when has religion ran our country?  Our government must be seperate from our religous institutions.  I'm not positive, but the way I see our country is as a pretty free place.  Is it not?  I believe laws against same-sex marriage violate that most basic freedom of choice that we so love here in America.
