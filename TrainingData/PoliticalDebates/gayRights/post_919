How is your right to hold an opinion legally weakened? Are you actually being persecuted under the law for simply holding an opinion?  Or, are you allowed to keep your opinion while you are being forced by law to treat people equally?  I think what you're really trying to say is that your right to force your opinion on others is legally weakened.  Isn't that more appropriate?  Let me ask... Do you believe in Equal Protection under the law?  Or do you believe that some people deserve more protection than others?  Do you believe that there is a chosen class of people who should receive preferential treatement?  Perhaps a class of people who's opinions are so important that they trump the fundamental rights of a lower class of people?  Have the meek really inherited the earth?  Is this really the legacy of Jesus?  When his 'Chosen' people would become the "Romans" who stripped the lower class of their humanity?
