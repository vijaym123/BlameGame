The statement "throughout history, marriage has only been between a man and woman" may be true if one limits oneself to a very narrow definition of "marriage" in order to ignore the overwhelming numbers of authentic marriages that existed and exist now outside of your limited definition. Human beings are quite talented in marrying themselves to places, to times, to objects, to individuals of other species and, of course, to one another in a seemingly infinite number of ways. All that's really required of a "marriage", at least for one involving at least one human being, is authenticity of commitment.It is quite demonstrable that there have been and are many legally-recognized or community-sanctioned "marriages" lacking authentic commitment from the very beginning and many non-sanctioned "marriages" with unwavering authentic commitment. All this to show, community sanction and legality have little really to do with authentic commitment and genuine marriage.The statement regarding "throughout history" is unsupportable. Throughout history "marriage" has been defined in a long and growing list of ways and can be expected to be widely and diversely defined in the future.Bigots can define words for themselves, however, they may not define them for others.
