I have always been mystified by the extreme emotion, even violence, engendered in certain people against homosexuals. It is what we call 'out of proportion'."It is actually obeying the definition of "normal" and "weird" to say that people who are different from me are "weird".  That is just the fact of the word.  The   environment   I have grown up in dictates what I see as normal and weird.  This is a layover (perhaps vestige) of our   evolution  .  A homosexual does not find heterosexuals as weird because the homosexual has grown up in an environment wherein heterosexuality is "normal", the opposite is not true.  The reason why we look down upon those whites who are   racist   or bigots is not because they find Blacks or Jews or Mexicans as weird, it is because they are unintelligent enough so as to be unable to deal with the differences and learn and move on.  Be very precise about why it is wrong to be racist and you'll see what I mean; it is natural for a white person to think a black person weird and vice versa, it is socially acceptable to think them weird, it is not socially acceptable to act on that prima facia judgment.
