God can certainly make the decisions in your church.  Unfortunately, he is not in charge of the government.  Remember the phrase "give that which is Caesar's unto Caesar?"  The government has recognized "marriages" as civil unions in the legal system since the beginning.  Unfortunately, we used "that word" instead of "civil unions" or "households" or whatever else you choose to call them.  In order for all people to have equal rights, we either need to change the word "marriage" to something like "civil unions" in all of the legal documents and laws, or just take the easier route and allow everyone to use the term "marriage" in the legal sense.Why can't we allow two different meanings for the same word?  It's not like it has never been done?Michelle
