Reproduction is the main argument for marriage, though not the only one--  If a heterosexual couple chose to only engage in oral sex, would they really need to be married?  Like homosexuality, this behavior would be an abnormal expression of natural love.  But, beyond that why would they need to marry?  Is it that they need a contract of marriage to prove their love for each other? Really?  Do homosexuals argue that they need a contract to prove their non-proliferative (and therefore unnatural) love for each other?
