By your 'logic', only those who are both capable of having children and fit into your idea of a role model should be allowed to marry or adopt, I'm guessing.And these are not facts we all know to be true. Quite a few of these are outright lies or opinion. For example, your idea that the parents should be straight so the kids will be straight--and how many children of gay parents turn out gay? Did this 'fact' of yours just not apply when the gay parents themselves were raised by their straight parents? Most of all, how does this even begin to put kids at a disadvantage?
