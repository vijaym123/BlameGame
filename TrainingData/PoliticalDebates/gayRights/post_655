In response to your answer about a "broad" statement.  Yes you are right, it is a broad statement, but I am one who is on the other side of the situation here. What do you say about a man who has been married for 24 years and then decides to cash in on the deal of family and wife.  Not many would of guess that he had those tendencies. (not even myself for a long time) They became very noticeable when he stopped being involved with his church family and became involved in other activities.  Are you suggesting that there is such a thing as being a homosexual but not engaging in the activities of it; because I could vote "yes" on that idea, therefore the vote of "NO" to the question of is Homosexuality a Sin.
