But some Gay males, a far greater % than among straights, display very feminine traits. 3 of the Gay people I grew up with in a small town had feminine traits to the extreme right down to always preferring to play girls games with girls, and their whole demeanor was that of a young girl. It's like I don't know how to define it but I know it when I see it. I will say the fourth   gay   man I grew up with displayed male traits only so his coming out was a complete surprise. Not all gay males are feminine.
