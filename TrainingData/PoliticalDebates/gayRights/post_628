One who has been raised with the knowledge and experience of the scriptures already feels condemned. We don't need to do the condemning but we do need to follow what our hearts and scriptures tell us is right. For most men it is disgusting to think about, nonetheless, we have to face it daily that their are people who think it is perfectly OK to engage in the homosexual lifestyle. It's the society we have helped nuture that has brought us to this choice of yes or no. Pick up your cross (whatever it is),deny yourself, and follow Christ.
