As the push for same-sex marriage continues, I believe that homosexual people will find that they are the recipients of  a great deal of enmity and hostility from other people,  all brought on by their political lobbies – the gay activist organizations.But same sex marriage is not the goal of the gay lobbies.  Their target is nothing less than a program to indoctrinate the public to accept the idea that the homosexual lifestyle is a normal, acceptable  and  desirable alternative to heterosexuality.They’ve already begun.  In April 2006, in Lexington, Mass. a second-grade teacher read a story book to her class about a prince who marries another prince...they even share a kiss.  The irate parents in Lexington tried to get some assistance from the court in their efforts to reject books of this kind from the classroom, but the court turned them down since same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts.  We’ll be seeing more of this kind of indoctrination from the gay lobbies.
