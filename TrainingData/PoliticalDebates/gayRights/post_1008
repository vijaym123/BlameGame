The US is one of the few countries with a constitutional separation of church and state.Within such a system, marriage should only be defined by the state and 2 people (same or different sex) should go to city hall to get married. Priest should not be able to perform legal marriages.Only after a couple is legally married, should they have the option of going to a church of their choice to celebrate their marriage within the rituals of that church with their church community.Because of separation between church and state, churches have no say in how the state defines marriage but in pure symmetry, the state can not require churches to organize religious celebrations if they do not want to.Same sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, Belgium in 2003, Massachusetts in 2004, Spain and Canada in 2005, South Africa in 2006, California and Connecticut in 2008 and will be in Norway in 2009 (see    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage   ).The sky has not fallen, heterosexual marriages have not disappeared and divorces have not exploded, these countries have not gone up in smoke, ... In fact, except for these happily married same sex couples, nothing has changed.So, don't be afraid of your own shadow and support same sex marriage.Society has to continue to eliminate any form of discrimination. We did abolish slavery, gave women the right to vote, allowed mixed race marriage, ... This is one more thing that makes the world a better place.
