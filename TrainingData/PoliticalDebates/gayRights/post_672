I don't believe the Bible was created or related to the exesentence of GOD. If god thinks Homosexuality a sin, Then why would he make Homosexual's? Not to be ridduculed! It's purposturous to assume that Cause it's in the bible that it's real! There are many things in the bible that don't make sence, this being one of them. I think the bible might be a Fictionary tale. It is not a sin! Cause if it was then he would make people born with knives in there hands and a motive to kill! Then if being gay is such a sin, then what are the people that critisize people for who they are? Not sinning? Judgeing people,Not sinning? People shouldn't judge people like that. Is it a sin?Not anymore than judgeing someone who is.If it's a sin that their gay, then it's a sin that your straight.
