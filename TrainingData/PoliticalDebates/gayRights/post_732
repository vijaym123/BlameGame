I had lesbian attractions for years before embarking on a series of lesbian relationships.  I was out and I was proud.  After coming to know Jesus, I read Romans and realized that I could not be a Christian and a lesbian.  It wasn't God's intention for human sexuality and if I truly loved God, I would be obedient to His word.  I didn't need a tortured interpretation of the Bible to convince me to follow my own proclivities. Instead, a common-sense, historically sound reading of the Bible convinced that God didn't need to change, I did.  It was then that I began the journey of transformation and sanctification.  Never have a I regretted and never have I looked back. I always enjoyed being a lesbian, but never did I have the joy and peace that I do now.  Praise the Lord!
