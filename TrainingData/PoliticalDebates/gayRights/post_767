The writer for Exodus wrote, "the biblical definition of “sin” means “to miss the mark” or “to wander from the law of God." I think that Rick Brick Brentlinger would adhere wholeheartedly with that definition. However, we disagree with Exodus as to what God's law is.There is a difference between God's Law in the Old Testament and God's law in the New Testament isn't there? The New Covenant, that the prophet Jeremiah predicted (Jeremiah 31v31-34), is now in force, and the Mosaic Law no longer applies to Christians. That's why Christians eat pork.But what law does apply. Is it not what the apostle James called "The Royal law," and "The Law of Liberty" (James 1v25, 2v8), "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."The Old Mosiac Laws, which were necessary for Israel at the time of Moses, were made redundant after Pentecost. The believer of the gospel is personally redeemed to God, regenerated, and filled with his Spirit, and laws that have nothing to do with love, nothing to do with the Royal law, are no longer relevant.When other Christians lambast me for my long-term committed and faithful relationship with my Partner, I ask them, "How am I breaking the Royal Law?"
