"The church has been clear for thousands of years that homosexuality is a sin." This may be the case, but the "clarification" has been gleaned from a few snippets throughout the bible and strung together to make a mountain out of what may never have even been a molehill. My fervent wish is that the churches of today give as little time to the whole morality - or lack thereof - of homosexuality as the Bible itself does. They happily do this for many other rules and sins in the bible that are quietly sidelined as no longer relevant to today - for example, women as chattels of men, the nationality of slaves, the correct ways of killing various animals, etc. Yet they fixate on gays and lesbians - who really just wish to be left alone.I am a gay man in Sydney, Australia, in a committed homosexual relationship that brings me the most amazing love, joy and fulfillment. I have the blessing of my whole family - because they see how happy I am with my partner, who is a beautiful, loving and faithful man. I have never used drugs and my many days of charity work extend to all parts of my community, not just HIV/AIDS. I try to give to society as much as I've received from it. I have many friends of all kinds and ages - including my wonderful parents - and my life is rich and free. I refuse to believe that any god would not wish this for all people. Everyone, regardless of their sexuality, should be able to live like this. The bible, the koran, or any other religious tome that is no more than the word of men, should not be used to clobber the rights of those who find the interference of religious obsessives totally inexplicable.
