So much effort to try and "prove" where homosexuality comes from. It doesn't matter.  They are with us and always will.  Yes, they are born that way, and on a spectrum that defies simple description.  Is Rev. Ted Haggard gay?  Ask him, and he will deny it.Stop the hating! Love your lesbian and gay family members like all others.  They deserve no less. We have been working to eliminate discrimination in our country for over 100 years.  We now have a black (and white!) president.  We are turning our attention to the LGBT community to help them up, next. Bigots beware, you will be exposed!  Speak up!The people arguing the origins of "gayness" are often the same people who don't believe all living things evolved from a common ancestor.  With all the overwhelming evidence in support of   evolution  , just how much evidence do you think it would take to convince a "religious person" that gayness might be a natural thing?  The "religious community" is immune to logical discussion.  Why are they even on these pages (Opposing Views)? They have little to add.
