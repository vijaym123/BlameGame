I really don't have a problem with polygamy either. Seriously. It's part of some people's   religion   (as stupid as organized religion really is and the fact that God is a non-existent figment of people's imaginations). Now 17 might be pushing it a bit. The age of majority may still need to be enforced, but you know, that's about it. Of course you have to be 18 (or have parental consent) to enter into other contracts as well. People do need to butt out of what two consenting individuals do and focus more on issues that matter (i.e. the   economy  ).
