This “debate” is about defending what those who have taken the “YES” position believe to be an indefensible prejudice: Not allowing consenting adults to marry whom they choose is derived from traditionally entrenched prejudicial beliefs about homosexuality. The FRC’s argument here is that as this prejudice is held generally, it is justifiable. If they are committed to the position that “great numbers represent justification” then, would they similarly react to polls in the 80’s that showed an overwhelming disapproval of making “spousal rape” a crime (i.e., wives are the property of husbands)? Or polls throughout the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s that approved of “Jim Crow” and racial separation? On this line of reasoning, these policies are seemingly justifiable. If not, the FRC is engaging in selective reasoning and should be criticized as such.
