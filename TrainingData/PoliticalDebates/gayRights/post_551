Yes,  one can choose to deny being gay but that doesn't change who they really are and it can lead to early death.My brother did his best to deny being gay.  He even went as far as to have girlfriends.  He came out to his family just 1 year before he died and that was the happiest year of his life!  During the time that he was hiding his true self,  he was depressed and unhappy.  There is scientific proof now that depression accelerates the aging of the heart.  My brother was just 36 years old when he died,  but his heart was that of a 90 year old.Some will tell us that God says it is a sin to be gay and a gay person won't get into heaven.  I believe in God.  I believe in Jesus Christ and I also believe that you are judged by the way you treat others in life and not by your sexuality,  at the gates of heaven.  I also believe that for all the "gay bashers" or wanna be "healers of homosexuality",  you have yet to learn the lessons that have been handed to us by God.  Tolerance and acceptance.  I guess some people have forgotten the part in the bible that states "judge not lest ye be judged" and "love thy neighbor".  When it says love thy neighbor,  it does not go on to say,  only if they aren't gay.  God wants us to love all people.  I think it is time to "practice what you preach."
