 I read this article at the citizen link web site calling for the APA to acknowledge and respect personal autonomy and religious diversity. Stating that the APA has not acknowledged that personal decision or self determination of ones sexual orientation is possible and has even said it is dangerous. This article dispells those fears and shows through actual scientifc study and research that one can change their sexual attractions and decide for themselves whom they will be attracted to and respond. Apparently in 1973 the APA adopted a principle to always have public declartions backed up by research and not follow public opinion but some how according to Dr. Jones has forgone that directive to bow to cultural pressures in regards to many things including sexual orientation. This lack of professionalism has caused quite a rift in the scientific world regarding the APA making any public pronouncements. The APA recently released a task-force report that shows some patients may want to change, but stops short of giving its blessing to such programs, accordig to this recent article which can be read at   http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000010710.cfm
