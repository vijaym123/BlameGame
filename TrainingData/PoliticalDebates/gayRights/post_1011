Government should not determine or exercise legal supervision over marriage.I favor a domestic civil contract for all people who choose to live together.  You get married in your church and file a domestic civil contract with the government.  The contract would provide you the rights to kinship, survivorship, joint ownership, insurance privileges (and all of the other some 4000 rights that only married people can now claim). And, for what it is worth, this would cover other cases such as a son taking care of his aging stepmother.Would that not solve this insane problem?No. Some other stupid thing would come up where gays would be denied their rights.We will never have equal rights until all people share those rights. I am not gay. But I will stand with them until they share equal rights under the law.Michelle
