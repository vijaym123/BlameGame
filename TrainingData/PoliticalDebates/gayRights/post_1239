What gay people seek is equality. If a heterosexual relationship can be formalised by the state in marriage and thereby attract certain privileges, then the same should be true of homosexual relationships.  If not, then inequality exists.  The attempt to tie in procreation as being essential to marriage is a contrivance used by those who simply don't want gay people to be able to marry each other.In any case, your arrival at the assumption that gay marriage will somehow damage other people's children by making their straight parents less likely to marry, seems bizarre.  It is essentially just the opinion of David Blankenhorn, who as founder and president of the Institute for American Values, is hardly an independent voice on this issue.  The fact is that marriage was on the wane for many years before the relatively recent phenomenon of gay marriage.  The idea that a straight couple would decline marriage simply because gays can also marry, seems highly implausible.
