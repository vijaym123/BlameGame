"Because God says so" is not an acceptable answer on its own, for if   homosexuality   really is immoral then there should be a a logical explanation to   support   it. God would not forbid something without reason. The ill effects of homosexuality should be observable in society. Most respectable scientific organizations that have done research on homosexuality have concluded: 1) Homosexuals are just as stable, healthy, and functional as heterosexuals.  2) People do not choose their sexual orientation. 3) Homosexuals desire the same things from their relationships as heterosexuals (companionship, love, raise families); they are not simply perverse and   sex   driven.  4) Attempting to   change   sexual orientation is usually ineffectual and can be psychologically damaging.List of Health Organizations that analyzed the research and issued policies in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and   transgender   people: American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy, American Counseling Association, American Medical Association, National Association of Social Workers, Child Welfare League of America, American Academy of Family Physicians, North American Council on Adoptable Children, American School Counselor Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Bar Association.Scientific evidence is hard to refute, but many still try. Some argue that their research is effected by liberal   bias  . This is complete fallacy. These organizations are national groups that represents people from a diverse range of political, religious, and racial backgrounds. These organizations do research on many topics out sexual orientations and have no invested interest in supporting   homosexuals  .
