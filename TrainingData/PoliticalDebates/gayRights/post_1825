"...studies that have discovered discrepancies in the brain between homosexuals and their heterosexual counterparts..."I don't think sexuality can be just explained by genetics, that would be way too simplistic. "Some are born gay, others aren't." What about bissexuals? Do they also have their own brain pattern? What about guys who spent most of their lives honestly liking girls and now honestly like guys? Have their brains changed? Are they "wrong", because they weren't born gay?I see sexuality as just a matter of taste and preference, we don't need to explain it biologically the same way as we don't have to explain why some guys (straight, if you want...) like pink.
