I find very interesting the concept that a person is defined by how they "feel."  There exists an entire field in psychology, known as cognitive therapy or cognitive behavorial therapy, started by Aaron Beck, which works on the presumption that how you "feel" is not immutable.  Once upon a time, one of the marks of a "civilized" person that distinquished us from animals was our ability to control our emotions, and not simply act on instinct. Now we are reduced to "if it feels good, do it."  As a society, how do we draw a line between not requiring a man who feels gay from going against his natural emotions and inclinations, and not requiring a man who feels very angry going against his natural emotions and inclinations?
