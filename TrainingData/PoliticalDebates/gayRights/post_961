Well, I'm not entirely sure what you mean now, but I guess that "divorce" would have to also have an alternate name because it deals with the separation of two "married" people.  Simply put, what I meant to say was that many laws and specifics of the system would have to be altered, whether severely or not, and I'm not sure how easy it would necessarily be to do....thus, it'd take a lot of work and careful planning...
