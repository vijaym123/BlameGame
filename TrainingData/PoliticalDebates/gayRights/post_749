Honestly, the reason I am uncommitted on this argument is because it isn't up to us to decide who the sinners are. And I while I believe whole-heartedly in the existence of God I'm willing to bet he's just about the most chill guy ever. I mean seriously, Jesus comes down, tries to get everyone to chill out and everyone just goes freaking nuts! Plus, if a true Christian reads the bible, they'll notice that God says "thou shalt not judge, dude" just about a million times. So who are we to point fingers at homosexuals and say "sinner"?And you don't sound antagonistic - I understand about the seeing red thing. I hate hearing people talk about prop 8 because most people on either side of the argument just don't know what they're talking about. People refuse to see past what the media portrays (or what they're parents have raised them to believe) and so we have endless discussions of rhetoric and it makes me SO ANGRY. Anyway, I think you and I may have had vastly different experiences when it comes to homosexuality. I have to say, most of my close gay friends come from religious backgrounds and they usually don't differ from my straight friends. So things like the gay parades in San Fransisco, marti gras, and flamboyant drag queens seem to me cliche, and I'm automatically biased against them because I think they do a huge disservice to the face of the gay community.
