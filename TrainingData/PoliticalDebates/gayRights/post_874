...........you're perfectly willing to live in a society with self-centered agendas.... as long as it's yours. No one can do anything that you don't like.  Not that will harm you, not will harm your children... it's just something that you don't like.  And because it's something you don't like, you're willing to pursue laws that are corrupt and bankrupt of any integrity.  As long as you get to dictate to people what's acceptable, it's okay.  You're right, it doesn't take an intelligent philosopher... all it takes is a bigoted, close-minded perverter of justice.  Or... you.
