"First of all, these groups are too small to have any statistical meaning. Second, there is no indication of how these so called studies were conducted, how participants were chosen, how questions were phrased, or answers were graded, or even the least indication of anything resembling a double blind. Among other major considerations, what passes for a control group is children from broken homes. Give me a break!!!"Two points: (1) Just because I didn't place the entire study in my post you presume that the studies weren't controlled for many variables?  (2) I haven't seen you provide anything other than speculative reasoning to back up your point."No one is talking about "punishing" anyone."I was relating this to the idea that children belonging to same-sex couples would be bullied, and I thought that your post was using this to create an argument."As stated previously, a stable, opposite sex parent home, is the ideal environment to raise children. Your three post rant shows nothing to refute that claim. That the researchers you cite won't waste their time trying to compare same sex couples to that model speaks for itself."Except... they did?  I don't understand how you think they would have come up with those numbers without comparison to opposite-sex couples within the same community at the same time raising similar children, etc.
