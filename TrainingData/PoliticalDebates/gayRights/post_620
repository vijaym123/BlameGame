By saying homosexuaity is a sin I am not destroying God because God did not create homosexuality.  This is in part why homosexuality is a strong sign of rebellion against God in a society because it goes exactly against the created order and natural intention of the sexual gift.  Lastly, that was a case of begging the question because he was assuming the thing he was trying to prove, rational truth is higher than spiritual truth.  He elaborates, I see, in the next post so I give him credit.  Thanks for taking the time to read Betty.  Peace be with you,Spencer
