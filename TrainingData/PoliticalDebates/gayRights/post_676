Homosexuality is not a   sin   according to the Bible. Any educated Christian would know that. Scholars who have studied the Bible in context of the times and in relation to other passages have shown those passages (Leviticus, Corinthians, Romans, etc) have nothing to do with   homosexuality  . These passages often cherry-picked while ignoring the rest of the Bible. The sins theses passages are referring to are idolatry, prostitution, and rape, not homosexuality.   http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=10620&pid=805    http://www.jesus21.com/content/sex/bible_homosexuality_print.html    http://www.christchapel.com/romans_inter.html    http://www.stjohnsmcc.org/new/about/homosexuality.html    http://www.gaychristian101.com  /Thats why Jesus never mentions it as well. There is nothing immoral, wrong, or sinful about being gay. Jesus, however, clearly states he HATES hypocrites. If you preach goodness, then promote hate and twist the words of the Bible, you are a hypocrite, and will be judged and sent to hell. Homosexuals will not go to hell, hypocrites will. This is very similar to the   religious   bigots of the past, where they took Bible passages to condone slavery, keep women down, and used Bible passages to claim blacks as curses who should be enslaved by the white man. People used God to claim that blacks marrying whites was unnatural, and not of God's will.
