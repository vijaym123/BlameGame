first off, both david and johnathan were married - they weren't gay.second, it was common for people to greet one another back then with a kiss (paul even suggests it in 1 corin 16:20).  look at judas and Jesus ... judas gave Jesus a kiss before he betrayed the Son of GOD.  does that mean that both were (are) gay?  bring it into today's standards, if i kiss my son does that make us both gay?  or how about if i give a simple kiss (peck on the cheek) to my best friend - as david and johnathan did - does that make us gay?  no.  it just means that i have a dear affection for my best friend (and my son).  it means that these men in my life mean a lot to me - that i value their relationship.  how about when certain ethnic groups greet each other with a kiss; are they all gay too.  this is not a good argument for the pro-gay side.and here's another thought, i will listen and understand someone's argument that homosexuality isn't spoken against in the Bible (even though i do believe it is).  so the greek may be misrepresented and misunderstood (though i don't believe it is).  still though, one question comes up time and time again for me:  where in scripture does GOD say that homosexuality is right?it seems to me that whenever GOD talks about marriage, it's always between a man and a woman.  whenever GOD talks about lusting after another, the issue is between a man and a woman.  whenever GOD talks about parents raising kids, it's between a man and a woman.buckeyenutlover, you state that "GOD deliberately made homosexuality" ... but if HE did, wouldn't you think that HE would have stated positive reasons for it - and not just negative ones?some things to ponder.
