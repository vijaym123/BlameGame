Pliskin (Snake?), Of course you're right that sex is a personal matter that is no one else's concern because it harms no one else.  "Live and let live" is a pretty good basis for morality, in my view, precisely because its basis is respect for other humans,and not obedience to god's law.  Clearly theists don't see it that way.  To them "good" is doing what god says, "evil" is not doing what god says.  How an act affects (or doesn't affect) other people is irrelevant to them.  "Live and let live" is NOT the basis of religionist morality.  I believe that most people choose religionist morality 1) because it requires less thought, responsibility and effort to do what your told than it does to decide right and wrong for yourself, and to live with the consequences, and 2) because it can be used to justify personal prejudices (i.e. homophobia) and give them divine support.  Hence people cite bible passages that support their views, while ignoring (or "interpreting" others that don't.  Often, people don't form beliefs because of what the bible says, they interpret the bible to support their preconceived beliefs.  And the bible lends itself well to this kind of rationalization by being vague and downright self-contradictory on most issues.  Sid
