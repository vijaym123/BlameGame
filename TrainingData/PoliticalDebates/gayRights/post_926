"Let's be clear: Jews have been denied civil rights; we aren't looking to deny others anything.  But this is not about legal rights for gay couples.  It is about a threat to religious institutions under the guise of civil rights."Let me be clear, this is a denial of civil rights, plain and simple, and you are very clearly denying Gays of their right to wed -- you can't honestly debate that fact. Your religion is under no obligation to recognize these people as married, nor will you ever be required to wed these couples, and it does not affect your religion in any way whatsoever. We're not going to regulate or change your religion at all, all we want is for you religion to stop oppressing us and guiding our religious practices.There is no "guise" here or whatever you want to call it. Gays are being denied an opportunity everyone else has. I honestly don't care what your religion says, just as you should not care what mine says, but we should both have the right to practice our religions. My religions says it's A-OK for gays to marry one another, yours doesn't.Therefore, don't let gays marry in your church. We'll let gays marry in mine.From the Bill of Rights:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." We aren't prohibiting your religion from doing anything, so you shouldn't be able to prohibit the exercise of my religion from doing what it feels is right.
