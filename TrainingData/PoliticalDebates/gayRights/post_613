Mangueken,I'm glad we agree on the non-sinfulness of homosexuality. But you also said "Live and let live is hardly a good basis for morality. It pops up in the people who walk by and ignore one person physically hurting another person. ".  I disagree.  "Live and Let Live" does not preclude stopping one person from hurting another.  There is no moral law that says one must tolerate gross immorality.  "Live and Let Live" is a universal principle, not just my personal one.  It applies not just to myself, but to other as well.  When I accept it as my principle, I acknowledge that EVERYONE has the right to "Live", as well as the responsibility to "Let Live".  If someone harms another without justification, then they violate the social contract and may be stopped/punished.  Granted, on an individual level, one is not morally REQUIRED to intervene (If one fears for one's own safety, for example), but one is morally PERMITTED to do so.  But on a social level, a civil society is both permitted and required to intervene.  It is for this reason that invading Iraq was a moral thing to do (although not handled particularly well).  But that's another topic.  I reiterate.  If everyone swore the following oath, we would need no other moral law.  "Everyone has the right to do whatever they want."  This oath demands that my rights be respected, and also demands that I respect the same rights of others.  In a free society nothing else is necessary.  To call homosexuality a sin, and to try and stop it, violates this simple idea. Sid
