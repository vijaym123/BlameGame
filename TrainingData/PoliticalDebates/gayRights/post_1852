The way to look at it, in my opinion, holds that you should ask yourself the question "In what way would allowing gay marriages make me think different about the value of my own, straight, marriage". When you ask yourself this the answer is obvious, of course it wouldn't, as it's completely separate from your own. If, for instance, two convicted criminals would marry, you probably wouldn't attach this marriage to your own. The same counts for gay marriage, you may not agree with it but the marriage is completely separate from your own and wouldn't affect it in any way. The only argument people opposed to gay marriage could make is the religious one. But as the constitution specifically states a division between religion and state this argument is moot.
