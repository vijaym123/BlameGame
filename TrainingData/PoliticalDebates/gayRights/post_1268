Again, I'm not equating African-American   civil rights   to   homosexual   civil rights. I'm just opposing originalist thinking."And when the government steps in and requires me to become a   vegetarian   like you, will you stand with me in opposition to that intrusion?"I will. Because individuals should have the   right to choose   their lifestyles so long as it doesn't disrupt another person's life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness. Until it can logically and empirically be shown that non-  vegetarianism   directly harms another individual, and that that harm is great enough to warrant government intrusion, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming   vegetarians  .Similarly, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming heterosexual. THIS is the point I'm making.
