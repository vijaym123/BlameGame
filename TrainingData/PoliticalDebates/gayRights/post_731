Exodus International has put out a call to its membership to come here and support Jeff Buchanan's position that homosexuality is inherently sinful and that the Bible condemns it.  Sorry, but I can't support those concepts.  Much of what I would like to say has already been covered in the excellent posts above, but I'd just like to add that the handful of Biblical passages which have been historically misused to condemn gay relationships have nothing to do with same-gendered persons engaging in loving, faithful and committed monogamous relation to one another.  Rather, they have to do with heterosexual people (men, in all but one instance) engaging in practices such as adulterous behavior with another man in their own wife's bed; sexual intercourse and orgies with temple prostitutes in service of false gods; buying and selling of sexual slaves; males raping other males by way of showing conquest and domination.These are most certainly vile and hideous practices. But they have nothing to do with homosexual persons engaging in committed, loving relationships.  In a paraphrase of an unknown author, "These are not homosexuals behaving badly; they are heterosexuals behaving attrociously."God does not condemn loving, committed, supportive partnerships which display and represent God's love for humanity.  God condemns those who abuse and exploit and do harm to their fellow human beings, regardless of gender.
