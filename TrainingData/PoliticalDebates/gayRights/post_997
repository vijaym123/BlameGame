Wow, bagpiper2005, every time I want to reply to a post you beat me to the punch and convey your opinions intelligently as well as passionately- kudos to you.It I've read various posts for and against this subject and it seems as though the only people who are against it straightforwardly are those who come across as Fundamentalist Christians who can't seem to adapt very well to the changing times. In fact, after reading the primary article we are all debating on, my first impression was: "so... we shouldn't adapt- because 'that's the way things have always been- why change it?' how lame is that?" I mean, we've adapted so much as humans- all different cultures- we wouldn't have   technology   if we had maintained that mindset.I also have deep rooted Christian beliefs- I'm 22, saving for   marriage  , (though I refuse to marry until everyone in my country is granted that right- guess I'll be a virgin for a long time, hahaha) and I have a lot of strong Christian beliefs- however, bagpiper2005, I agree that my personal beliefs should not prohibit anyone from loving whoever makes them happy- and marriage may be somewhat of a farce as of late (Celebrities are making marriage into a fad, it seems, what with the constant divorce rates and all that lovely jazz), but when I think of 'marriage' I think of happy people committing to loving one another for the rest of their lives- and the prospect of this right being denied to anyone makes me scoff.When I was 12 years old, and a goody-two shoes Christian freak, and I was first presented with the prospect of homosexual marriage (by my super religious aunt) I was so puzzled and confused by the contradictory feelings I had regarding the topic- knowing that, per my aunt, 'and the   bible  - supposedly' God doesn't love 'fags' yet God is a God of love- yeah, you can see where my brain just exploded for a while, there...So all the Fundamentalist Christian hubbub- regardless of the 'grounded evidence' presented in the bible- is just mind-blowingly asinine- even a twelve year old can see it.
