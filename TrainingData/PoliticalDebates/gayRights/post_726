Jesus is the way the truth and the life. He is also Light of the world.Therefore, there is no such thing as a gay Christian that's an oxymoron.Your right in that there is no such thing as a gay christian, there is only a christian.  Jesus loves us for who we are, if we love him.  It hurts Him if we swear, if we curse, if we sex out of marriage, if we   murder  , if we..... I could go on.  The thing is, He will always love us and forgive us.  He will also lead us to walk a closer walk with Him.  If a gay turns to Christ, Christ will lead him on his path.  As fellow christians, it's not are job to condemn but to build up and love as Christ loves us.  If a prostitute with a habit handed their lives to Christ, I wouldn't expect them to stop earning a living in the only way they know how, even if it is sinning.  They would need our support and understanding to help them move into a new and productive career over a period of time.  They would also need to be taught (with love) the message of the   bible   and help to understand how to accept His unconditional forgiveness. Why do you seem to have difficulty with showing His love to fellow christians on their path?
