My dear Baba, as a scientist in a different field, I can tell you that there has not been enough time to come up with a scientific proof either way. Besides, I did say that the children from homes with same sex parents will grow up and become very good citizens. But that's not the point. Just like the kids growing up in certain areas like East LA, Compton etc are at a disadvantage but can grow up to become the president of the united states. But the disadvantage is still there and those kids will either have to work harder to learn what is a given to the kids with opposite sex parents or they may never get to know certain realities until they get married to the opposite sex and discover a whole new world.Another point many of us forget is that science is not everything. When it comes to emotions of a human being, or the behavior of a child science has a long way to go. There are 1000s of therapists trying to help people but they admit that help comes from within, therapists (who could be the scientist in this case) ca only give opinions. no facts involved. This is not Math or Physics, it's feelings. Finally as a father I know facts about my children that no doctor, psychiatrist or scientist could tell me. It's not a matter what I can answer or my wife can. It's the difference between a femail sensitivity and that of a man's that makes my wife and I a perft team to deal with our children's emotional needs.
