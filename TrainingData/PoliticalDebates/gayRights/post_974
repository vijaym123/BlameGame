    Where I seem to run into a a problem is the claim that what is wanted most is rights. I have seen the idea of a union of two people with all of the legal rights of a heterosexual community floated only to see it rebuffed because the term "Civil Union" was used instead "Marriage". Presumedly because it implies acceptance by the broader community. Like it or not you can't legislate acceptance by a community or a religion. Attempts to do so generally result in resentment by both parties.
