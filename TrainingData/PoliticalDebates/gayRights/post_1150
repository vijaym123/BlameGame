"man and a woman joined together in holy matrimony is the time-tested “yardstick” for marriage"this is simply not true, as is evidenced by the many, many wives of certain rulers of antiquity.  that too was considered "time-tested" in its day.  the ultimate failure of many appeals to tradition--which this is--is that it seeks to artificially define one point in human history as the golden standard against which all other periods must be measured, but ignore previous such periods, which are usually in direct contradiction to such a decision, as even a cursory review of biblical genealogy will reveal.the argument as presented amounts to little more than simple fearmongering about some cataclysimic consequences never actually identified yet which are somehow supposed to be inevitable.  this has some admitted rhetorical force, but no logical force, because all actions have unforeseen consequences.  this is known in some circles as chaos theory.
