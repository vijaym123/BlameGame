So because of the actions of a few same sex couples, they should all be punished? Yeah, that's totally fair."The Lambda reference to denominations willing to “bless” same-sex unions changes the argument not a bit.   Said denominations may hold such ceremonies right now. The “unions” just wouldn’t be recognized in most states. So the argument that imposing same-sex “marriage” on Americans somehow expands religious freedom is not to be taken seriously."Weather same sex marriage should be legal or not in those states is exactly what this debate is about. And religions that believe same sex marriage is ok are just as legitimate as ones that don't, such as Christianity. To suggest they aren't is discrimination.
