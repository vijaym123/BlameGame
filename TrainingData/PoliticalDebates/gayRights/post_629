lessofself wrote:"we have to face it daily that their are people who think it is perfectly OK to engage in the homosexual lifestyle."This seems to be a common argument. Make a broad, all-encompassing statement which condemns the homosexual lifestyle and then insist it just a sinful choice.This argument is illogical because it assumes that all homosexuals live the same way and believe the same way, therefore all homosexuals should be condemned.Would it be fair to lump all heterosexuals together into one group and then condemn the heterosexual lifestyle based on disgusting heterosexual activity at Mardi Gras?   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jonathan-And-David.html
