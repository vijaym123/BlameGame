A   civil union   can be defined just as marriage can be defined.A dog is not a cat. A man is not a woman. A man wedded to two wives is not the same thing as a man wedded to thirteen wives.We went down a long road as a   society   demanding there is no difference between men and women. There is not a little 'expansion slot' in the brain into which a card is inserted that is labeled "male" or "female." But on the other hand, it did not   add   to the richness of the human experience by failing to note that a man and a woman are different.There is no harm in notating that a man wedding a woman is different than a man wedding a man; and that is different from singleness.Justice does not demand that a single person be defined married for the sake of having access to the same legal and social benefits. Or that a single person in some form of ongoing sexual relationship be defined as a marriage.We could have a long and valued debate as to whether "marriage" should receive the social/legal benefits it does (or if it should receive more). But to me, it is silly to deconstruct the meaning of the word for the sake of correcting what we deem to be an inequality.We can go down this road, but it is the equivalent of saying there are only persons instead of being men and women. It answers a question and opens up a larger question. This is not the only route to the needed outcome.
