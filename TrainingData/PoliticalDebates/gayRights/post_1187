Assessing the validity and bias in statistics is a tricky business, and to do it right would require a thorough examination of the study itself, which I certainly can’t do here.  However, I can say that it is does not make for a good argument if you cite sources that are outdated.  All of these polls cited here are from 2003-2004—if there hasn’t been a more recent poll, given the proposition out in California and the election, I’d be quite surprised—are over four years old and do not reflect the current political trends in the American public.  Thus, the assertion that “Americans Reject Gay Marriage” is not adequately supported by evidence.  Even if it was, why should that stop our advocacy?  If we should make laws to allow gay marriage, then we will be doing so by a democratic process, an instrument of the will of the people.
