ppl serisouly waste way too much time on issues like this when there are bigger things going on in the world. its so tireing listening to this argument. BOTTOM LINE....why does it matter?!?!? i am a straight female...i love my boyfriend...and i do not care if 2 women or 2 men are in love and want to be married. you cannot stop it...if they are in love and want to be together for the rest of their lives...they will!whats the big deal with making it official by allowing marrige??? who cares!!! i get that religious ppl go by what the bible says....but would you really care if you didnt have your religion to back it up??? its fine that ppl have their beliefs....i respect that. but this issue to me seems like it shouldne even be an issue. times have changed...and ppl continue to change as well.i have relatives along with friends who are gay. and guess what...their just as normal as everyone else i know. i dont see the big deal. ppl feel what they feel and they shouldnt be belittled bc of it
