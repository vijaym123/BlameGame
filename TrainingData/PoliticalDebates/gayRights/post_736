First off I want to thank you for being faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ in the very difficult walk many people, including myself, who struggle with homosexuality face.  As much you want to argue around the teaching of Scripture it is very clear that homosexuality IS mentioned and IS called sin.  The good news is that, like all sinners, in Jesus Christ we have the hope of salvation.  In Jesus Christ a new word is spoken, a word of freedom, a word of healing, a word of restoration, a word that calls us back to move forward, to become who we already are in the dreams and love of God.  It is not a freedom that permits sin but rather frees us from it to be the people of God, the people of the church, followers of Christ, Christians.  Thank God I have found this freedom.  Leaving the crippling false identity of the "homosexual" has been a breath of fresh air as deep as the breath God put in me when he nit me together in my mother's womb.  Know my identity is shaped in and under the Word and Lordship of Christ instead of my self-claimed identity lording over my faith and life.  Peace be upon you brother,Spencer
