You should, perhaps, question your assumptions that a child "needs" two parents. For the reasons I stated before - the variable personality of the child and variable personality of the parent(s), one can make general statements of what is common to all children and common to all parents, but one really can't say definitively that the specific needs of one child are the same specific needs of another. You will no doubt find individuals in all cutlures who got along just fine with only one parent - of either gender - and likely will find individuals who had more than two who profited from that arrangement. You will also find plenty of individuals who had what is considered by some to be the "optimum parental arrangement" - two parents of opposite genders who are permanently scarred by that experience.All of this to say - the assumption that a child needs two parents of opposite gender to grow up happy and well-adjusted is likely as false as the assumption the child needs two. I dare say - and from personal experience - some children need no parent at all.
