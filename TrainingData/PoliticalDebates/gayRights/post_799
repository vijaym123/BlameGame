The argument that sexuality is determined innately from birth, may be true, but there is a problem with those who want to rape children, have many spouses, murder and so on. Although it seems extreem to use these as examples, many years ago no one would have dreamed in our society that Homosexuals could be married here in the US. It was against the law to practice homosexuality, as it is now against the law to have sex with children and other sexual acts. To be true to yourself, the philosphy of Jean paul Sarte, Existencialism, I believe breaks down when considering that some are born with sociopathic tendencies, and sexial deviencies, homosexuality may be one and we have just chosen to allow it out of compassion. Who doesn't love these people, they are wonderful, but their activities are not. Do what you feel or be what you are is not necessarily the best activity, so we must talk about the argument for homosexuality on another foundation. Thank you for your comments.
