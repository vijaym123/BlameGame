You ask is someone born homosexual? I ask is someone born a pedophile? Is someone born a murderer? Is someone born a rapist?The answer to all the above is NO. They are learned behaviours and there is sufficient evidence that those who have entered into the homosexual movement had been seduced by someone in their childhood...seduced/raped/molested by perverts and then now you have another person with tendencies toward this lifestyle. Isnt it time we started helping these folks out of the slimy pit of sexual hedonism into healthy relationships by at least starting by telling them the truth that you are NOT born homosexual, you choose that lifesytle, and then teach them to be responsible adults and not to solicit   children   and   teens   for sex! Just good   advice   if you ask me.
