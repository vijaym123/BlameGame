First, that's all the more reason to be more accepting of it and encourage this to be more normal!But secondly, I wonder if there's any research that supports your claim. Children as far as I've seen are not initially hostile towards children of same-sex parents: when they are hostile, it's thanks to the parents being intolerant. Research has shown that children of same-sex couples are happier and more confident, so perhaps it's not as simple as you claim.
