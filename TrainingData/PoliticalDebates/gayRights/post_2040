Going by the history and the need for marriage from the days of the caveman and before, I would think that the institution of marriage is meant more as a protection for the children that result from the instinctive act of sex. Civilized society would have decided long ago, that there was a need to protect the offspring and therefore sanctified marriage through religion etc., The importance of marriage is therefore for the protection of all children and to provide for them through the responsibility attached to the marrying couples in exchange for the previlige of having their own children. There are legal rights attached to children and the heterosexual marrying couples such as succession of property etc., Obviously a marriage of gays is meaningless in this context, and serves no purpose and also has no liability on the society at large. If they want to co habitate for their mutual pleasure, then they are just in the same position as a heterosexual couple who dont have any children - either by their own choice or by happenstance.So, let them get married if they want to, it has no harmful consequence on any one.
