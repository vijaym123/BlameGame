If we accept what the   church   has always taught us that God created us in his Image and that God would never creat imperfect humans, than how can Gays be considered sinful as a group? Most scientific and theological scholars have determined that gays don't make choices to be gay but are born with this!  I never wanted to be gay-but to have a loving wife and   kids   and live a life devoid of discrimination and sorrow at times!  We are all sinners but if you lead a righteous life and follow the example Jesus set for us by loving an acepting everyone, than we will be in heaven!  Jesus Christ never once preached against homosexuals-there is no shred of evidence in the New Testament.I personally do not believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible because it has been interpreted so many times over the years and when you do that, we lose certain meanings as a result.  The far right has always needed to find scapgoat for their hate-being blacks during the civil rights era, the fight over   abortion   rights or now attacking and spreading lies and contempt towards gays and lesbian people.  We aremaking progress but is slow and ever forward despite the huge amount of   money   and hatred that spews from the so-called religious right and other fanatics!  I wonder after they fail trying to convince the American people how wicked and terrible we are, who will they single out for their hatred?  Native   Americans   or maybe the Canadians?
