I do not believe that babies are born gay.  However when they grow up or during they tend to turn the other way.  More interested in their own kind than the opposite females or otherwise. I am from the west--and my wife is from San Francisco California--where there are a lot of gay people.  I was a little stunned at first--but got over that--as I have met gay people on both sides.  They all are pretty nice people. So if they are happy with the set up--I have no problem with that. People tend to be judge mental mostly because the gay people are different than regular people.  So let them be and let them be happy--like we are hopfully.
