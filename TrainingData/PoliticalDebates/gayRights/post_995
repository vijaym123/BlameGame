To Bagpipe2005It is impossible to separate religion from politics and this is why, whether you like it or not, or whether you are a Christian or not God is the one who created laws and how we as human beings should live in a society.  The 10 commandments is the very basis of almost every county's law in the world today.For example thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, thou shall not commit fornication etc. And from these laws spring forth other laws.So when people say separate religion from politics that is not a valid argument.  God's standard  will always be the best way, anything from that is lawless. So you not loving God or don't care anything about Him does not change anything. You have your opinion and I have my truth.  Peace
