I feel terrible that people who have same sex attractions feel condemned by the church. All of us are sinners - period. All of us are made worthy by God - period.The notion of "sin" has taken on strange nuances that have become bigger than what I believe God intended. While sin does separate us from God, >Christ< bridged the gap, not our good behavior. (See Christianity 101.)So none of this conversation should lead to anyone thinking that homosexuals are unworthy of taking Eucharist. The whole point of that ritual is to remember that we are forgiven, for crying out loud!The purpose of paying attention to what God tells us is "sin" is to a) keep ourselves and our community out of harm's way, and b) help lead us toward God's plan for our lives which are to give us hope and a future. (Jeremiah 29:11-13)
