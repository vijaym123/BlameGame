There are heterosexual couples whom cannot pro-create. If homosexuals are not allowed to marry due to the fact that they cannot reproduce, then you must also deny marraige to men with who are sterile, had a vasectomy or low sperm count. Also, you also must prohibit marraige to women whom have had their tubes tied or have gone through menopause. If you agree that these people should be allowed to marry, then you negate the argument that reproduction is the key function of a marraige.
