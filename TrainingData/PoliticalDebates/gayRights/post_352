the area of evolutionary psychology has within itself those who believe that   evolution   has stopped more or less and that all our behavioral structures were created in ancient history.  these persons are regarded by the reaches of their logic as POP EPers.  the popularized elements of EP tend to lack credibility due to their overaching claims, but when one considers the grand questions that the field at large still considers unanswered one sees that the field is still alive as it has not by even its own admition remotely solved many of the questions which lay open.  perhaps this was a rubutal by Ehrlich against the over reaching conclusions of just some in this arena of investigation.
