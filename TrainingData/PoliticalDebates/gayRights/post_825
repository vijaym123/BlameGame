Hey there,I have two problems with the view that David was gay.  Firstly the Bible never says David and Jonathan "lay together", which supports the cultural view that D&J were not a couple.  If the Holy Spirit REALLY wanted to say that same-sex sex is okay, surely telling us D&J had sex would have been the simplest way to say so?  My second problem is a larger than life woman called Bathsheba (2 Sam 11).  Surely if David was gay, his adultery would have been to   murder   her, and chase Uriah, her husband?!  His actions with her are VERY inconsistent with those of a gay man, aren't they?  Just a thought... :-)
