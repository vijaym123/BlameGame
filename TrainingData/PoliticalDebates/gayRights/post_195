RE: "So   children   should not be placed in potentially loving homes?"Children should be in homes where they have some chance to grow up normal. If you want a gay penguin for a pet, go for it. You have absolutely no right to impose your will and lifestyle on an innocent child. Your lame rap about how it should be okay because other people who aren't gay screw up children's lives is disgusting. Two wrongs don't make a right. My last post on the topic.
