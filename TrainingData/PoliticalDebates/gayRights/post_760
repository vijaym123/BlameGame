I grew up a Catholic so I had some convictions about homosexuality. Yet I still practiced it. I was later convicted of it in my early twenties and became a born-again spirit-filled Christian. However, I started to recognize that I wasn't completely over my affections toward men, and though I never engaged in another homosexual relationship or sex since I became born again, I have struggled with it.Having confessed that, I also want to point this out too; I never gave in to the belief that it's okay. I will always continue to fight and resist and struggle to gain the complete victory over those illegitimate feelings. I recognize that Jesus Christ didn't suffer and die so that I can live a life as a slave. He promises that who the Son sets free is free indeed. So there must be a problem on my side and with the way I am doing things, and there has been. I've learned that God's weapons are mightly and capable of pulling down strongholds. Don't compromise on this. That's the first rule. God is committed to your complete deliverence in this life. Believe in Him, that's the second rule.Thirdly, consider yourself dead to your old nature and your carnal nature. Don't obey the lust of your flesh, rather subject yourself to the Spirit of God and live for God.I leave you with this amazing tool and weapon from Romans 6:6"knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;"  (Rom 6:6)Don't stop here though, go ahead and read all of Romans 6 and consider your beliefs and way of living out your new gift of salvation in Christ Jesus.-God Bless
