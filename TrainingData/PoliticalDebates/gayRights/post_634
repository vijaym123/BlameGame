I've talked to many gays and lesbians, and call some of them my close friends. ALL have told me that they KNEW they were gay from an early age! I've been quite saddened when they've told me of their struggles, their self hatred and concomitant self-destructive behaviors. I've listened as they've told me of their families disowning them. I've been awestruck when I've heard their stories of redemption and self-acceptance. Many have told me that they wished God had not created them this way. That tells me that, indeed, GOD CREATED GAY PEOPLE! If God is perfect, then this wasn't a mistake! Maybe he created them so that prosthelytizers might learn a lesson about what Jesus would really do!Here, as always, the problem lies with those who don't practice what they preach. The real problem is those who would control another's actions in the name of religion, social conservatism, or saving the sanctity of marriage (and the children, of course)! The last time I checked, marriage wasn't in any danger! I, for one, will always like women, no matter who or what my neighbor likes. Many of the most ardent opponents of gay rights are repressed homosexuals!  Most gays, along with christians, atheists, and everyone else, just want to be left alone to live their lives in freedom and peace. I know I do!
