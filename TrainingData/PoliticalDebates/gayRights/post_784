quiet4no1 wrote:[Romans 1] "describes same gender sex and attractions as 'vile affections.'"In the Bible, there are a number of passages about heterosexual rape - Genesis 34 and Judges 19 and 2 Samuel 13. No thoughtful person would conclude that heterosexuality is wrong based on Bible passages about rape.Just so, no thoughtful person would conclude that committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships are wrong based on a Bible passage about idolatry and shrine prostitution (Romans 1). When pagans engage in same sex activity to worship the fertility goddess, that cultic activity never provides an honest basis to condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex relationships.In reality, your conclusion is at odds with the cultural, doctrinal, historical and scriptural context. The context is shrine prostitution - pagan sexual worship of the fertility goddess - not lesbianism and not homosexuality in the sense of loving, committed, faithful, same sex partnerships.   http://www.jeramyt.org/papers/paulcybl.html   One need not be gay or lesbian to understand that Cybele was THE leading fertility goddess in first century Rome.   http://www.forumancientcoins.com/moonmoth/reverse_cybele.html   The context of Romans 1 is not now and never has been lesbianism or homosexuality.The context of Romans 1 is idolatry and the sexual practices which spring from idolatry.Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html
