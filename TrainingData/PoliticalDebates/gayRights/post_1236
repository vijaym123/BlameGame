"In contrast, there is a mountain of non-partisan social   science   research supporting the growing consensus among family scholars that   children   do best when raised by their own mother and father, and that the best odds for that happening is for the mother and father to be married."So link that evidence. Put up or shut up. The way I see it, Lambda cited direct quotes and linked to more than one national organization that supports their position and provides evidence. And ADF just asserts those groups are all partisan without showing evidence of such... and says they have evidence that they do not site... i wonder who is BSing us?
