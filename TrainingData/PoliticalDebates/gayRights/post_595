Thanks for the reply, Rick.You said "The idea is that Jesus in His life, death and resurrection, fulfilled all the demands of the Law, therefore we are not required to keep the Law ourselves to be right with God."In other words, Jesus died not only so that we could be forgiven for all the sins committed BEFORE he died, but also so that we had a path to be forgiven for the one's committed AFTER his death (i.e. today).  Right?  But forgiveness still requires not only that we repent, but also that we accept Jesus as the only path to penitence.  And that's the part I don't like.  It's off the current topic, but to me forgiveness has to come only from the person I've wronged, and not from Jesus or god, or any other supernatural being.  That's because my secular morality is based on respect for HUMANS, not respect for god.  To me it's offensive that  hurting another person is considered "sinful" because it violates the law of god, rather than because it violates of rights of a person.  It's offensive that repentant murderers ask for god's forgiveness, rather than the forgiveness of their victims and their families, and find peace through god without regard to the person they've killed.  But all this is for another discussion.  Since homosexuality hurts no PERSON, it is not immoral, although I acknowledge that it is "sinful" according to your arbitrary religious dogma.  Sid
