Sivan claimed "But same sex marriage is not the goal of the gay lobbies."So it should be easy for Sivan to provide 25 statements from 'gay lobbies' with external links of course, explicitly stating that same-sex marriage is not the goal'.If Sivan does not or cannot, then Sivan is posting false information, and every claim by Sivan must be interpretted in light of that.
