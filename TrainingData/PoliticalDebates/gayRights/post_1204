Marriage from a legal standpoint is simply a contract between two people that gives certain legal rights and responsibilities and affects property ownership.  If you're talking about the sacrament of marriage, i.e. religious ceremony, you can exclude homosexuals all you want.  The law is not the same as religion, however. This issue is about the legality of "marriage" as recognized by the state. Legal marriage does not mandate, require, or even encourage children.  Society encourages children.  If you have a problem with children who aren't raised by a mother and father, you need to try to bring about societal and attitude changes, not trying to suppress the civil rights of a group you dislike. If you don't think homosexuals should be allowed to raise children, that's an adoption issue. All you're doing by fighting gay marriage is ensuring that children of homosexual couples will have unmarried parents.  Is that somehow better?
