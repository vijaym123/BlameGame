"Also, "eunuch" means a guy with out testicles or testicles that do not function properly."Again, you're simply incorrect. Many anti-gay Christian scholars disagree with you. And I notice you simply give your uninformed opinion with no facts to support what you say.Dr. Robert Gagnon, the most prolific anti-gay evangelical Christian scholar alive today, commenting on Matthew 19:3-12, admits on his website that:"Probably "born eunuchs" in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined, which incidentally puts to the lie the oft-repeated claim that the ancient world could not even conceive of persons that were congenitally influenced toward exclusive same-sex attractions." - Dr. Robert A.J. GagnonThe Babylonian Talmud was very clear in pointing out that eunuchs were not necessarily without testicles.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Same-Sex-Attracted-Eunuchs.html  According to the Talmud, a saris/eunuch could produce semen. Therefore he had functioning testicles."ÒR. Joseph said: It must have been such a saris [eunuch] 6 of whom I heard Ammi saying. 'He who is afflicted from birth...Õ Our Rabbis taught: Who is a congenital saris [a born eunuch]? 13 Any person who is twenty years of age and has not produced two pubic hairs. 14 And even if he produced them afterwards he is deemed to be a saris [born eunuch] in all respects. And these are his characteristics: He has no beard, his hair is lank, and his skin is smooth. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said in the name of R. Judah b. Jair: 15 Any person whose urine produces no froth; some say: He who urinates without forming an arch; some say: He whose semen is watery; and some say: He whose urine does not ferment. Others say: He whose body does not steam after bathing in the winter season. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: 15 He whose voice is abnormal so that one cannot distinguish whether it is that of a man or of a woman. " - Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Yebamoth, 80  http://www.come-and-hear.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_80.html  #PARTbAncient Roman Law also taught that a eunuch was not necessarily diseased or lacking testicles.     ÒThe name of eunuch is a general one; under it come [1] those who are eunuchs by nature [born eunuchs], [2] those who are made eunuchs [by castration or crushing], and [3] any other kind of eunuchs [those who voluntarily abstain from marriage].Ó    The Digest of Justinian, Vol. IV, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1985, p. 944.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html  Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jesus-On-Hell.html
