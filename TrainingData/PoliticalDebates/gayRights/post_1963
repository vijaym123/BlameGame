That is all very nice; thank you for supporting your Deism argument. But Jefferson's exact religious beliefs are not relevant here.The First Constitutional Amendment did not retract religion from the Declaration of Independence. Neither is it separating the United States from religion. That is why it says:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
