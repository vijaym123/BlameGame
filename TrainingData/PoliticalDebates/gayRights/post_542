  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_displaying_homosexual_behavior  Yeah, no mammals ever display homosexual behavior naturally. You have to be kidding me. I mean, it's not like LeVay discovered casual relationship between brain structure and sexual identity. It's not like we have epigenetic studies on the x chromosome in the   mother   that shows significantly greater inactivation for those that have gay sons. It's not like the hypothalamus is larger in gay men then straight men. However, it is clear that those gay people chose to have a different neurological structure. Those gay people chose to have their mothers one x chromosome respond differently than those mothers who have straight   children  . Those gay people had neurosurgery to make their hypothalamus naturally bigger. They chose to respond to pheromone samples differently.We are no where near understanding all the various biological factors that determine sexual identity. No there isn't going to be a "gay gene", there is going to be a collection of factors - epigentic, genetic, neuronal, etc that determine are sexual orientation. What is clear is that there is overwhelming scientific evidence that biology places a large role. The question is just how large and how exactly. To say that there is no evidence and it is motivated by the "politically correct" is ignorant and laughable.
