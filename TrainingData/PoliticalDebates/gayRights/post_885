I'm sorry civil union or marriage, homosexual marriage is not the same as heterosexual marriage. They will have an uphill battle because over half of the US states and many foreign countries have already voted to preserve that marriage "is a man and woman." You go California with your liberal ideologies. I am a bigot because:...1. Throughout history, marriage has only been between a man and woman...2. The natural law of humanity only allows an egg and sperm to procreate...3. Civil Liberties is not civil rights..4. Civil rights is not conduct...5.  We are being indoctrinated by society to accept conduct when it goes against personal ethics..6. Businesses, churches, government and families should have freedom of speech by the foundation that this land was based on and not be tried for discrimination....
