“Too much talk about something that is a biological mistake of nature.”Describing   homosexuality   as a mistake is an interesting choice of terms.  It seems to represent a sound survival strategy for a species, by creating individuals who can care for young without producing young of their own.  This is similar to the survival advantage brought by menopause, where   women   lose their reproductive capability after it becomes unsafe for them to reproduce… yet they are still able to care for   children  .“If   homosexuals   were left to their own, literally, they would eventually cease to exist, unless within their confines they abandoned their sexual practices and reverted to normal reproductive sexual intercourse.”It is true that if you were to place a population of homosexuals on an island and then come back in a hundred years you would likely not find anyone alive.  However this ignores the fact that homosexuals arise from within the heterosexual population, so even if you somehow isolated ‘all’ the homosexuals there would still be new homosexuals being born.“This being evident , homosexuality is clearly outside the norm (un-natural) opposing nature etc.”How exactly does homosexuality go against nature?  Being outside the norm is far from un-natural, rather it is often an aspect of   evolution  .
