While I am glad you do not support restricting rights based upon your own perception of morality, I encourage you to do research on the nature of homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association defines homosexuality as a normal variant of sexuality. It wouldn't really described as an anomaly. Approximately 10% of the human population is homosexual, and homosexuality has been linked to genetic factors. It is a natural thing that has been observed in approximately 1500 other species.
