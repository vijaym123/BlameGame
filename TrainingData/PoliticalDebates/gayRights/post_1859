Can a person have the right to choose if they can marry or not? I mean, does a total stranger have the right to change someone's life completely by opposing their marriage? If you said yes, why? Is it that you want to feel that you have more power than they do? Is it that you want to feel like you're above them? If so, imagine that someone opposes your marriage. Can u accept this? I'll say no. No one has the right to choose if they can marry or not unless they have a real head-nodding reason.
