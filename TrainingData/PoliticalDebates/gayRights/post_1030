While I do not agree with some of the things you are saying, I do see what your saying about having an argument with something to back it up. What I have also noticed is that people who do agree with same sex marrige do not have their own arguement a lot of the time. The just restate the one that is presented and say that their argument is wrong. But I would like to know what side you are on, and what your argument is?
