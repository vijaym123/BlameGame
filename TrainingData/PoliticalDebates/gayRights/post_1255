That's precisely what you're doing.  How is it just to deny same-sex marriages on the unfounded argument that "it might open the door to other kinds of marriages"?  That's like saying that, since allowing people to ingest green ketchup, people will begin to ingest everything green and slimy including pickles and toxins; therefore, green ketchup should not be eaten.  Or like saying that, since it's okay to put your child in time-out for one minute, it will be okay to put them in time-out for two minutes, or three, or all eternity; therefore, time-outs should be prohibited.  Or perhaps since it's okay to slip in one red herring, we'll slip in a second and a third and pretty soon the discussion of same-sex marriages will become one of metaphysics and philosophy, neither of which have a standing in law; therefore, we should abandon discussion of same-sex marriages altogether.I don't think I need to slap you in the face and tell you to focus on what's actually going on here.  The question is whether same-sex couples -should- be allowed to marry.  That question can be answered by asking the question: In today's society, what does marriage signify?
