This is a pointless and fruitless debate, even though the answer is clear: Yes,   of course   children with same-sex parents are at a disadvantage compared to the children of stable, monogamous, traditional families. Boys learn how to relate to women and girls substantially through their relations with their mothers; girls learn how to relate to men and boys substantially through their relations with their fathers. A same-sex couple is all but certain to under-serve one of these developmental needs.But the question is   still irrelevant.   The proper questions are:1. Are children with same-sex parents disadvantaged in comparison to children who are never adopted?2. Would any degree of disadvantage,   assuming we could measure such a thing objectively,   justify forbidding same-sex couples to adopt children?The answers to these questions cannot be collectivized. The answer to #1 is "Sometimes; it depends on the adoptive parents." On #2, there cannot be a satisfying consensus, because we don't know how to measure "advantages" and "disadvantages" in a way that will both command agreement and satisfactorily control for non-environmental factors. After all, heredity and free will always play a part, and one cannot "run the experiment" a second time.
