If you study history, it is crystal clear that people have universally labeled things they could not comprehend as god. Mankind has created thousands of gods in its image during the 100,000 years that humans have existed in our 4.7 billion year old earth and 13.7 billion year old universe.As we learn more about all aspects of the universe and the evolution of biological life in it, the gods we created keep getting smaller and smaller. At this point, we can explain pretty much everything without invoking a sky daddy.It is way more intellectual honest to say that "this is something we don't know yet but we are looking into it" than to say that because we don't understand something that it must be "god did it".Again if you study history, you can only come to the conclusion that we are all 99.999% atheists. Most people only believe in one of the thousands of gods we have invented. Some go one god further and become 100% atheists.Now then, any argument against same sex marriage that makes reference to any of the gods we have invented is not an argument at all.Laws made by the state should not rely on such fake arguments. The state should use science base its decisions on evidence.In contrast, faith is belief in something not based on any evidence. Churches of course are welcome to use their version of god any time and make their decision based of faith.It is, however, dishonest to put faith and truth in the same sentence. Only evidence and truth belong together.Separation of church and state means freedom OF and FROM religion.People using their god argument against same sex marriage, are welcome to use it within their church but join the 21st century and let the state make decisions that do not discriminate anyone.We have a supreme court for a reason: to prevent any majority from discriminating against a minority.Be happy within your faith and let other be happy within theirs or be happy without any faith.
