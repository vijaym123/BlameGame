While there are "homosexual"   animals   these animals only participate in sexual activities for procreation. In other words they HAVE to in order to further their species. Humans and dolphins are the only 2 mammals that have sex for pleasure. Humans do not have the ability to procreate thru homosexual activities, thus one can conclude we are not born homosexual.
