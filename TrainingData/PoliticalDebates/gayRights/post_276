I believe that somewhere along the way someone's emotional development can be altered or misdirected.Same sex love is fruitless and cannot multiply. There is no descendance and no future blood lineage. In the case of 2 magnets the + side reject the + side but join the - side.Do not just disreguard what I am saying lightly.It is the same with children. When I hear an adult saying: I do not like children but I love dogs or my cat is like my baby. I wander what happened in their life for them to speak that way.The issue of abandonned children is a separate subject. In any case, some studies show that when children are raised by homosexuals, the chance for them to become homosexual or bisexuals increase 7X.(from 2% to 14% of the population). We are just increasing the problem of homsexualityDo we have to create new organisations that will provide a mother or a father figure for these children like big borthers or big sister.I do no buy the idea that a lesbian will play Dad while her partner will play mom successfullyWe are just multiplying the problem for these children and the suffering that homosexuals say they endure because of their condition.Still in order to satisfy your request for me to answer your question, I like to say the following.I do no know the specific data but I hear that 500,000 children are in the family services' care.250,000 or more are still connected to their original families and half of the 250,000 left are not small babies but are more dificult to adopt because they are older or have been abused or hurt in some fashion.The answer is to raise the consciousness of the whole country on this issue big time and mobilise all the goodness in the USA to tackle this problem.Most people are not aware of it.Instead of adopting children, people with same sex attraction should be helped in healing themselves.
