I'm genuinely astonished that people seriously:1. think it is rational that a book written by human beings could actually represent the views of God, and reasonable to use the Bible as a literal supernatural rendering of right and wrong. All religious texts are an expression of human values, specifically those of the authors. It is a noble endeavor to engage questions of morality. I think it is hubris if people aren't deeply troubled about using a book written by human beings as the basis for claims about God. 2. I'm also astonished by people who use the Bible as an expression of God's will so easily ignore the things that don't trouble them, like Paul's instruction that women should cover their heads in church (and keep their mouths shut, by the way), while being so certain that homosexuality is a sin and going to great lengths to shame, stereotype (in many cases, commit false witness against - intentionally, or, through their lack of education about these issues, unintentionally), and discriminate against gays and lesbians.I pray for the day when it is no longer acceptable for people to deny responsibility for their beliefs or actions by saying "well, that's what the Bible says, that's what I was taught is true."  We can and must do better than this for the sake of humanity.
