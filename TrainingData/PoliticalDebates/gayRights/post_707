In the opening chapter of Romans the Apostle Paul is not listing a command of "do's and don'ts" but a listing of chronology of the falleness and depravity of mankind.  St. Paul is going back to the early history of man's rebellion in turning a way from the true, one and only living God and to the worship of created things and other types of idolatry.  Because of this God gave them over to a depraved mind.  A chief sign of this rebellion is the inappropriate sexual actions between women and men.  It is clear in this homosexual action a high abomination is occurring because it is going directly against the created design of  God as revealed in Genesis.  It is a rejection of God and his way and an embracing of a counterfeit.  This is why prevalent homosexuality in a society is a sign that a society is moving away from God and his truth in open rebellion.  It may seem extreme to the modern person but not anymore extreme than the call of all disciples to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.  Jesus makes a way out.  As someone who has and does struggle with homosexuality this is something I can attest to that the walk is not fun or easy but it is what is truth and what God calls all sinners too, repentance.  May God lead you by his grace to the freedom and changing power that grace brings,Peace,Spencer
