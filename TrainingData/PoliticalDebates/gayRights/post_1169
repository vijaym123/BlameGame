This is a poor argument since it presumes that traditional marriage would not be upheld and that there are no obvious instances of discrimination. First of all, the value of traditional marriage is in no way reduced by extending this right to other parties. Second of all, people who are not married face a myriad of issues which their married counterparts do not face such as access to one's partner when in hospital, access to healthcare, insurance, and more. While more and more companies are adapting their policies, it requires an act by government to extend the same rights across all, and the only reasonable approach is to recognize same sex marriages as no different from 'traditional marriages".Certainly the argument that it somehow trivializes 'traditional marriage' would be a flawed one, the argument that same sex relationships face no discrimination is easily laid to rest by pointing to some self evident facts to the contrary.And so far I have failed to hear any good reason why marriage for same sex couples should be kept illegal?
