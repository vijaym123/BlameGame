"It's funny to me that if for any reason other than   religion   you acted the way you did, you'd be considered to be crazy." Uh...you do realize that   atheism   is a RELIGIOUS view, right? It's funny to me that if for any reason other than your cliche, bombastically hateful views of religious people you acted the way you did you'd be considered an asshole. Oh wait...This is what I gather from your conversation: michaelz wrote about a difficult personal decision he's made, and you decided to go ahead and tear it all to pieces on a public forum because you can. Thanks for trying to make atheists look bad, buddy. I'm sure they appreciate it more than you know.
