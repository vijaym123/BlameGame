How can you say that genetics doesn't dictate a persons entire life. If some is born with a genetic disorder like perhaps cerebral palsy. There whole life is going to be dictated by that disease there going to have limitations on what it's possible for them to do and ,its sad but, they are also going to be looked at as "lesser" by other people. Just like certain people Look down others because there gay, people look down on others because the have genetic disorders that can't be helped. So to say that genetics doesn't dictate your life is completely wrong. Even If you were right about being able to  control what your sexual orientation is, A strait man will never be happy if he's in a relationship with a gay man, and a gay man will never be happy in a relationship with a women. You make it sound like being gay is a disease that can be cured when that's not the case at all.
