I didn't see any comments suggesting that human genes should be modified.  Are you referring to people who think "gay" can be "fixed" through genetic manipulation?  I certainly did not suggest that, nor do I think such a thing would be desirable.  Maybe I'm just not following, so perhaps you can elaborate.
