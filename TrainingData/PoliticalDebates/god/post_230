No need to attack. When you say things like "You are seriously misinformed about the nature of scientific knowledge." then you lose a civilized debate. Debate the topic, not the person.I agree with you on most of your points about what science and research are.  I'm an engineer, not a scientist, if you care to draw a distinction.  So, I know science changes when consensus changes.  God's laws of nature don't change, but the human understanding of those laws changes via peer review.  No need to go back to Aristotle.  Just go pull some textbooks off the shelf from the 1930s.Yes, conservation of mass and energy are not up for debate here.  This debate is about God.  He is free to violate any law of physics he wants, since he created them in the first place.  Look at the elegance of the universe. How could that have happened by accident?  Also, if we hold to the fact of conservation of mass and energy, then how did the big bang happen? Faith and Science are two very different things.  God created the laws of nature that we call Science. No doubt, he has violated them a few times as serves his purpose. God also created the faith that humans must exercise in order to understand a bit more of him each day.
