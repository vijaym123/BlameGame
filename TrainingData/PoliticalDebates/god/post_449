There is a mountain of evidence to support evolution, such as fossil records, DNA, and selective breeding. Scientists estimate that only 1 in 1000 SPECIES (not specimen) ever become fossilized; and of those we have still only discovered a fraction. So there's bound to be holes in our ancestral lineage, such as 'the missing link' (the common ancestor we share with Chimpanzee's and other apes). However, despite these tiny odds we have discovered another 'missing link', tiktaalik, the common ancestor we share with all vertebrates. See link for more information.
