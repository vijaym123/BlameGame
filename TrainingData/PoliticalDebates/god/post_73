Reason is the enemy of faith."Faith is not an emotion. It is objective trust placed in a very real God.""Don't worry about proving God's existence, because no one can disprove it.""If you"re wondering how God speaks, commands, and leads-read the Bible."Nature itself testifies of God existence and so does your conscience.  People who refuse to retain God in their knowledge it is because they don't want to change.
