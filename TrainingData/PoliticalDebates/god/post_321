Yes, that is a correct observation. But it is merely an observation. For example- everyone has dreams. My dreams are completely different than anyone elses, and the way I dream is completely different. I may think that my dreams are another portion of reality, you may disagree. Does all of this disprove the existence of dreams? One person may never in their entire life dream... does this mean that no one dreams? The truth to this entire debate is that every argument can be answered logically and infinitely, and therefore no logical decision can ever be made. It all has to come down to faith. Either faith in atheism, or faith in theism. That is the key to decision. But how does one acquire that faith? The only way to acquire faith in either direction is either to close your mind and convince yourself, or open your mind, and ask. (this is presupposing the assumption that if God exists, he is a personal God.) If God is there, he will answer. If he isn't, he won't. It's the only way.
