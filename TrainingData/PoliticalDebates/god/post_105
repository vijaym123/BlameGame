Yes, I do understand evolution perfectly well.  I'd be interested to see what you regard as credible research on intelligent design.  Wishful thinking is not a substitute for decent research.  At least Darwin did make predictions which came true.  Lord Kelvin (who was probably one of the pre-eminent physicists of Darwin's time) said that evolution by natural selection was impossible, because the Earth could only be 30 million years old, and there was therefore not enough time.  Darwin just said that Lord Kelvin was wrong; how spectacularly wrong is shown by the current accepted age of the Earth of 4.5 billion years.  Lord Kelvin was wrong because he didn't know about radioactivity (no one at the time did) which was was keeping the Earth warmer and throwing off his estimate.  I have no doubt that those who don't accept evolution will be shown to be wrong for the same reason, except it will be because of deliberate ignorance rather than inadvertant.  Intelligent design is just a theory.  It makes no predictions.  I'd be interested what your university training was, and how much actual teaching you have had of evolution or even biology.  Evolution is completely compatible with religion.  Francis Collins quite happily accepts (theistic) evolution, and the Catholic Chuch doesn't insist that Genesis is literally correct, equating creation with the implantatation of the soul in humans.
