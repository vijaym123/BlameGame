First off, the mightiness of God does not at all determine his existence; simply- no matter what God is or does, he either exists or does not, and attempting to disprove the bible's God by showing what it inherently is (which does not disprove), doesn't disprove all definitions of God. This being said, we must realize that the utmost strategy of this argument is pathos. It tries to turn your emotions of wanting God to be all powerful into a conclusion for atheism. This argument completely skips logic. Logically we can see that if God exists, and he can in the framework of the bible despite these observations, then atheism is not the best answer. The argument presented here assumes omnipotence and the bible, therefore atheism. It fails to provide ANY logical warrant. It completely skips every other argument, and the simple fact that the arguments are not mutually exclusive. It therefore fails.
