#originalTopic=God_Does_Not_Exist
 There is no personal creator God who cares if you are 'sinning' and wants to send you to hell.  That's fantasy.  I can't say with absolute certainty that there is not a superior power that may have created the universe.  It's one really easy explanation to explain where all this came from, and life itself.  It's not based on anything more than a hunch though, and it comforts people.  Plus... Where the heck is God if he does exist?  So... I'm about 99% sure there is no God.  Science and reason show us how things work in the world, and nothing that has happened required a creator or God to make it happen.  Rather than ask how can the universe seem to come from nothing (common misconception), ask yourself how a supreme all-knowing force can just exist, where does that come from? Oh of course... God doesn't need an origin, does he?  It's a simple way to fill in gaps in our knowledge without using our brains so much, to say that God just made it all.  The evidence for God not existing is much greater than the evidence of his existence.
