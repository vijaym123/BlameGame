OK, as a guy that spent many years wishing I could believe in   god  , the Cost/Benefit argument has to be one of the least inspiring reasons someone might believe in such a thing.Is god such a tool that any schlep with a calculator in one and and crossed fingers in the other gets saved?And is the point spread the Rabbi refers to on "faith" in no god(mischaracterizing skepticism anyway) supposed to scare the nonbeliever?  We already we live in an inherently meaningless universe alone on a mote of dust with steadily declining viability for the future!  What do we care what the odds are things might be different when we die?This whole argument revolves around the definition of belief itself, which typically fails to acknowledge if one chooses what to believe and then organizes the facts of life, or if one is lead to beliefs based on the facts of life.The last defense of theism typically resorts to the logical problem of proving something does not exist or highly covoluted discussions about how free-will and determinism are actually coexistant and how morally bankrupt the world would be without the relentless pandering, sycophancy, coercion, bribery, and extortion behind most faith and arguments therefor...So just get there already if this is the best you got.
