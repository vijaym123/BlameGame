Welcome the liberating world of the agnostics.  Come on in, the water's fine.Then mental gymnastics required to justify faith in a   god   and defend him / her are simply not worth it.  To argue the unknown without working toward substantive proof is folly.  For every question the non-believer has, the believer always answers with the mystic.  Surely this will not be popular, but in my opinion, if there really is a god, you can keep him.  He / she is either cruel, incompetent, or both.  Defending his / her positions only makes a person look foolish.
