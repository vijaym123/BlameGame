I might get hazed for this, but what the hell~Faith is hope. Even if it may or may not be false hope.For those who have been dealt a bad hand and have nothing to cling on to but dirty old rags and bread crumbs, sometimes the only thing that gets them up in the morning is believing that something is out there that cares for them.For the rest of us, maybe not so much.
