And FYI, the original text of the Sixth Commandment read "thou shalt not kill other Israelites." You could kill all the Canaanites, Babylonians, Akkadians et. al. that you liked.That is pure Grade AAA bull crap. For there was a period of the Israelite history wherein they were Babylonians. And no, the original text of the sixth commandment was originally translated into English as : thou shalt do no murder. The commandment did not imply exceptions for the commandment. If you were to read the next chapter of Exodus that follows the Covenant with Israel, you will find that murderers are to be killed, including Israelites. What say you?
