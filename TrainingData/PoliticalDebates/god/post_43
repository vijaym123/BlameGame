Let's be frank here. Over the past ten millenia mankind has created in excess of a thousand gods. Ultimate gods, pantheons of gods, nature gods, fertility gods, vengeful gods, merciful gods, gods that sleep with humans, gods that walk amongst humans, and gods that commit genocide.To actually entertain a theist when they say "I don't believe in those 1,000 gods, they are clearly false and wrong, but I believe in this one God, with absolutely no more evidence than any of those others" is ridiculous.I give as much credibility to the silly notion of a christian god as I do to harry potter and Zeus. All of them, entertaining works of fiction.The christian god is just another mark in the book of gods, and will fade with time (like every single god man has worshiped has).
