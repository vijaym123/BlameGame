Ahh The Problem of Pain“However keep in mind, "Science doesn't provide us with truth. The practice of scientific investigation involves tools that help us explain how the physical world might work. The explanation doesn't have to be true to be useful, just consistent with most of the evidence." (Spencer).”Yet   religion   does not provide us with the truth either…“The evidence when studied just facts points towards a designer.”Actually no, there has been no demonstrated evidence that even suggests a designer.“Chance is ruled out through mathematical probability.”Blind chance, yes… but Evolution is not about blind chance.  Evolution is the process by which life forms   change   from generation, with those changes that benefit reproduction having a greater chance of being passed down to successive generations.“For more on this read Robert Collins, Jay W. Richards, or Guillermo Gonzalez. For scientific evidence in molecular biology read Michael Behe, and Johnathan Wells. I would encourage reading opposing view from   evolution   scientist such a Ruse. It is good to know why you choose you evidences. “To which I’d   add   Richard Dawkins, Ken Miller, Sean Carroll, and Stephen Gould.  “The argument is evolution believes that nothing came from nothing to create something over billions of years.”That is not quite accurate… everything came from the original singularity, including space-time.“The bang has a cause.”Yes, and that is currently an area of much Scientific investigation.“The idea that something comes into existence un-caused is absurd.”Very true… so what caused the designer?
