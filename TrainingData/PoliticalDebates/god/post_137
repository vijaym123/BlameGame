No, really.But also, Einstein was really not keen on being cast as a believer in a personal   god  .  He publicly ridiculed the notion and those that took his quotes out of context.  So in a way, Rabbi, you should consider yourself chastised by the SMARTEST MAN EVER!Anyway, regarding the question.  Have you checked out physics in the last century or so?  I hate to be overly sarcastic, but I think the most qualified answer to you question is in that field of study; look under "big bang", maybe.So, this is a terrible arguement for the existence of god.  First, the idea that the univers HAD TO HAVE a creator can, must be applied to God, if the question is relevant at all.Perhaps the world come from us, in the future, when we send the catalyst for the cosmos back into the past to start the big bang.  I see no reason why this is less likely than any theistic explanation.
