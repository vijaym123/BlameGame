There is. And every knee will bow before Him for judgment. Those who believe in Him will be judged differently than those who don't. When I pray to God, He in fact sees Jesus Christ standing in for me. He will see Jesus' blood. Jesus will then judge my deeds in terms of rewards after I pass—some shall receive many rewards, some shall receive fewer, but all will be saved. Unbelievers, if persistent in their unbelief and unrepentant, will not see God. That is their final judgment. It's funny that atheists claim this as punishment (which is how I, a believer, do see it), but for the atheist, this is exactly what they want—they don't want or have any need of a "God," so why would they care if they're eternally separated from Him (which is what Hell actually is)? God gives them what they want.Plus a note: What is "good" to mankind is not the same as what is "good" to God. He's so good and so loving and so pure and so wise and so powerful, our best efforts at even trying to attain these things are "but filthy rags to Him." The only way He can look upon us is if He sees His son in our place, since His son is, was, and will always be, not just good, but perfection. Non-believers can do "good" or "nice" things—this does not make them unspoiled, perfect, obedient, or ample in true goodness. And, as I've said, believers, too, can be nice and charitable and whatnot, but without a genuine faith in Christ, this does not make them good.
