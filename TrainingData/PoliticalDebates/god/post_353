In the car analogy, "crashing" together is instantaneous.It took literally trillions of years for our universe to become the way it is and throughout that time things have gradually developed. Human life didn't spawn out of nowhere, that's what YOU believe, that man was crushed from dirt, if you actually believe Genesis. What science actually supposes is that multiple forms of life exist down to the simplest level, we've recorded and documented the process of evolution in current years, there are fossils that point exhaustively at a common ancestor, and that life gradually developed up to our level, each predecessor and prototype sustaining itself.
