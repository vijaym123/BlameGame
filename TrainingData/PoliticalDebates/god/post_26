I'm an atheist - always have been, always will be. Most people don't change sides once they've come to a decision. So my comment is really about the nature of the argument. I'm weary of believers saying that evolution isn't true, or that they see god when they look at children. Even if there were merit to any of it, it's no basis for the existence of god. Nor is evolution's truth a basis for the absense of God. Can't we dispense with this silliness? Neither side can win the argument, because neither can answer the first and foremost question of being: Why is there something instead of nothing? I believe in the Big Bang Theory, but even that doesn't answer the question. My biggest argument against god so far is that religious people came up with him - the same people who have been denying scientific progress for hundreds of years. But both science and religion come from a human need to seek order and truth. So far science has won the battle but not the war.
