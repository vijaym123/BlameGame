 And just who do you think provided that medical team with the skills to save anothers life? I have to say I feel sad for people who think as you do. Specious reasoning, ten dollars words won't convince me nor anyone else who has faith and hope by the grace of God that He does not exist. The text book you should be reading is the Bible. You speak of African   children  , why go so far from home, there are plenty of children in the states who have some of the same problems as those in Africa. Maybe just maybe if you read the   bible  , you would learn more about God and why things go the way that they do. Exactly what makes you so sure God doesn't help African children or any child for that matter. My niece spent two years of her life in Africa helping and teaching the very children you speak of. God comes in many forms through many people, I am sorry you feel the way that you do. It must be difficult to know what's out there walking around with blinders on all the time.If you want to know why God does what He does, why don't you go to the source and ask Him?                         Have a Blessed Day.......
