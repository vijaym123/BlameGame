#originalTopic=God_Does_Not_Exist
 I've never been able to justify a belief in any sort of higher power(s). I'm also not comfortable admitting that I don't know either way about the existence of a deity, because I don't really see any logical reason to leave the possibility of belief on the table. I see people on here saying roughly the equivalent of "How do you know? Have you done a complete search of the universe and not found a god?". There's also the common "You can't prove a god DOESN'T exist!" argument. These two arguments can be used against any sort of mythical/hypothetical thing. If I questioned everything in my life this way, I would be leaving room in my mind for every Bigfoot-esque concept in existence.   />   /> Frankly, I am comfortable with just not knowing certain things about the beginnings of our universe and humankind. To me the existence of a supernatural power(s) is just another theory humans have come up with regarding the genesis of the world, the universe, and man. A few others include the Big Bang and evolution. At the moment, I am inclined to believe more in these than the existence of a god simply because of certain proofs. Notice that I say "believe more" than "believe completely". I have complete faith in neither, as parts of both theories have been proven wrong by the very scientists who formulated their creation. They have been changed and tested (and continue to be) by the international scientific community. Theories don't claim to have all of the answers, but they do stand up to logic (and when aspects of them don't they are thrown out the window). The concept of a higher power does the opposite.  />   /> Basically, I'd rather admit to not knowing about my origins (as a human and as a resident in our solar system) than believe in something that isn't logical, which is why god doesn't exist in my life.  />   /> P.S. If anyone has evidence against the theory of evolution I'm plenty open to it. I completely accept microevolution but I'm still trying to find more proofs for macro so if you have any thoughts please share. Thanks!
