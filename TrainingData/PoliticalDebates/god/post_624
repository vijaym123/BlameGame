You really should do your research before making comments like these because you lose credibility with those who have.Take all the religious killings and they still don't come close to those done by atheistic ideology(communism) What these Communistic regimes did was the logical out working of the atheismism they held to. It should be painfully obvious that atheism is a flawed worldview.
