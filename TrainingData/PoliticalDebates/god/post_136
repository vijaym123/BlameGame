Rabbi - I don't see how you have actually justified the existence of a higher being. Your claim that it is the only argument that can provide a full explanation of how the universe came to be is inherently flawed. It doesn't explain who created the creator which results in infinite regression. That's one of the most basic problems with   religion  .Ralfe - Making unsubstantiated generalisations such as "More and more respected academics are seeing the immense flaws in the   evolution   argument." doesn't really help much. Intelligent design uses pseudo-  science   to come up with a seemingly scientific explanation but all it is really saying is "that physical characteristic is too complex for me to understand so God must have designed it".
