What you've done is set up a straw man and knocked him down.  You basically assert, with no support, that if there is a God, "laws would work in a helter skelter manner.  There simply is no rational support for such an assertion.  Therefore, you're presented nothing but an assertion, certainly not an argument.  I stand by my statement.
