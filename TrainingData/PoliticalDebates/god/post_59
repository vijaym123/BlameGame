Whether or not there is a god doesn't matter.  There is, or there isn't.  What matters is whether the existence of god is relevant to our lives.  Obviously, if there's no god, it is not relevant.Just as clear: if there is a god, we can never know its nature (or alternatively, we can only understand god through faith without proof; same thing.)  This is the only possible way to explain the complete lack of real evidence.If there is a god, but we can never know its nature, then the only way we can get some relevance from god is to believe in a version of god that is relevant.  But this version is a complete guess!  That's self-delusion; instead we ought to just think honestly about what is morally right and wrong.Another way to think about it: if god's relevance is to give us a moral code, then either the moral code is right in itself (in which case we don't need god to get it) or, the moral code is arbitrary and we should ignore it.
