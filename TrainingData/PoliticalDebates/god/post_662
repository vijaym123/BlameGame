Nobody broke the law in Florida that's why the teachers where exonerated. The teachers who where being prosecuted by a wing nut weren't even the ones who asked to pray it was a member of a church. Remember this was off school property and the teachers where off school time they were there in support only. And it was in a church. Put aside any religion on this, this was a impediment on the first amendment. You and I have debated many things on this lets just agree to disagree I'm not forcing anything thats not my style and it shouldn't be anyones style. Talking about just the fact that on a daily basis that we are losing freedoms everyday and that a something like this would have gone as far as it did is ridiculous not to mention the tax dollars spent for the courts.
