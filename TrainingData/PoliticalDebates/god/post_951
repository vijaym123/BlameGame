 I am actually laughing at the feeble nature of your arguments. Irrefutable evidence? Ha! For the love of God (and yes, I used the Lords name in vain on purpose), why must everything complex and wonderful have to be made by a superior mind? Why do you have such a problem with accepting the possibility that everything just happened and we are the beneficiers of this Great Accident?  /> And as for contact with God? There are cases all over the world of such claims, all of them disproven.  You want to believe that you have been touched by him, so the brain simulates your desire.  A simple psychosomatic reaction. Cases have been so extreme as to induce "stigmata", Christ-like wounds upon believers.  I have no problem with people accepting the possibility that either religion or science is the answer, but people like this, the ones who deny any other reasoning, who make pathetic arguments for their side, despite tangible evidence of any kind, that really grate on me. God is simply another form of control that drones follow without question, because they are too foolish to question authority. Simple.
