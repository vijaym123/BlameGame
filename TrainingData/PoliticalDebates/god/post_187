Jesus is a character in a story that attempts to show what God would do if he was a man IMHO.Did he ever really exist ? There is no proof you can CHOOSE to believe He did or you can choose to believe he didn't. To me it is irrelevant based on my only now exists post. He does exist now for me however. Based on the words and actions attributed to this character and my understanding of the teachings attributed to him he is a reality and part of my way of thinking.John says it so well, In the beginning was the WORD our first awaremess of the concept of TRUTH and the word became flesh and dwelt among men.Jesus represents the Truth of God. Which he synthesized from the   ten commandments   each of which represented one of these two concepts from Jesus.1. Love truth and righteousness above all else.2. Love others.William Booth the founder of the salvation army was forced to synthesize it even further when asked what ONE word would he leave to his followers. The word was not God, the word was not Jesus, The word was not even Love. The one word he left was the word OTHERS! Because the truth is in order to have peace and understanding we really need to think about OTHERS and not be selfish.
