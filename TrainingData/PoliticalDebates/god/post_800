Love in a real sense doesn't exist. It is something in our heads. I revel and delight in it, yes, but this doesn't mean there is an objective source for love. Are two corpses who were married in life still in love? You also give your own arguement away by argueing love because ,like love, god is in our heads too and while the idea is very real in the sense that it affects reality through the actions of people there is nothing substantial to back any of it up. Saying god told you to hug a tree for the rest of your life holds the same weight as if you said I love this tree therefore I have to hug it for the rest of my life. The differnce is love is innate and the idea of god has to be taught and indoctrinated.
