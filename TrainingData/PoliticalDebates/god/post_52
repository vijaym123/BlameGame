This discussion in about a belief in God.  Yes, science is about observation, pulling together a consensus on what can be observed, experiments that can be replicated, and peer review.  God doesn't fit into this neat little, man defined box, called the scientific method.  So, the whole idea of using science as a method to answer the question of whether God exists is silly.  God has a plan for everyone, but it is up to each individual to have enough faith to believe it.  Using science as a justification to not believe in God is folly, but those who don't have enough faith to believe won't realize it until it is too late for them.  I wouldn't call it wishful thinking.  The beauty and massive complexity of God's creation is enough for me to realize that none of this world or universe could exist by accident.
