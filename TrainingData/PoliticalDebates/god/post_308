  Fellow naturalist,it is so true about that burden. Now I do ever try to reflect nature not needing God to direct or sustain it.   Faith is not a warrant for belief,contrary to Alvin Platinga, as it is just the we just say so of credullity. It begs the question of God as there is indeed no evidence whatsoever for Him. With Sydney Hook, we naturalist find that science is acquired knowledge while faith begs the question of being knowledge. Faith keeps believers in the darkness of superstition!    We rationalists do not have to be omniscient but to find no evidence for Him as presented and no logic in the arguments for Him.
