Within your question you have two major assumptions that are false...First of all, you assume that God can contradict himself, which is logically impossible.Let me state for the record, God absolutely cannot contradict himself.  If you think you see a contradiction, check your premises. God created a world where people had freedom and free will.  Hence, it follows logically that God cannot create people with absolutely free will without the possibility that people might choose evil.  Secondly, you assume humans and God share the same definition of "good."You say that if a person is in poverty that is bad.  Yes and no.  It is true that they may lead an exceptionally painful existence, but God's measure of good is how many people accept him freely and enter heaven.  If the only way a particular person might turn to God is through suffering, then that suffering was good.  Since while the short term suffering may seem terrible, it is nothing compared to an eternity away from God.
