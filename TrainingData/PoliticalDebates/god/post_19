You compare God to Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. Do you think they might exist, too? Somehow I doubt it.You're right that not having experienced something does not prove that the thing doesn't exist. However, it means there had better be a pretty good reason for assuming that it does. If I told you that the air around us was full of tiny invisible fairies that are undetectable in any way, would you say, "Yeah, maybe"? I hope you'd say, "Get real, that doesn't make any sense." But my positing of invisible fairies is just as arbitrary as positing the existence of God, or Santa Claus, or the Tooth Fairy. It might make me happy to believe in the fairies. I might even have some complex belief system about them that causes me to be a nicer person. That doesn't make the fairies real.Whether or not there is a God is just as much an issue as whether or not there are invisible fairies around us all the time. If there's no good reason to think something exists, we should default to "no," at least for the time being. I don't claim to have proof that there is no God. I just think it's an arbitrary concept to make up, and I think the burden of proof lies with the person making the outlandish claim.
