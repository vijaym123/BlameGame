 There's the odd thought of "what if?" but nobody's given me any proof. I have just as much evidence that the universe is actually a toilet.  />   /> @Homestar: That's completely incorrect. For example, I could reason that Bob is a robot, because I've never seen him eat or sleep. Or, I could lop off his arm, noting the flesh, blood, and bone inside, proving him to be human. Which is more convincing?
