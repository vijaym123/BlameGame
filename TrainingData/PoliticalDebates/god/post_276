"We want there to be a god, but in order for a god to be real, everything we know about science would have to be wrong."This is simply a restatement of the previous argument, which is nothing more than an unsupported assertion.  There is no reason to suppose that science would have to be dropped if God is real.  Indeed, modern science exists precisely because early scientists believed in God.  They believed that the world, and by extension the universe, was rational, ordered and knowable precisely because God created it that way.One may well reject the idea of God but the (non) argument above does not provide support for doing so.
