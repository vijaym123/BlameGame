think of a places in the world where there is no God Good grief. Find me a place on earth where there is no god or gods. Just because other parts of the world don't espouse your religion does not mean they do not espouse a religion. I myself am quite religious, although I doubt my faith has a terrific amount in common with yours.and you will only see death, poverty and despairBecause Latin America, which is very very Catholic, has none of the above; whereas inexplicably, the non-Christian countries of Singapore, Brunei, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, and Qatar are all among the 10 highest per-capita GDPs.evolution is a farceNo, evolution is a very widely accepted scientific theory, and if science is incompatible with your religion then your religion is simpleminded. "If science were ever found to contradict Buddhism, then Buddhism would have to change" -- The Dalai Lamaprobably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.AHAHAHAHAHAHA! Wait, lemme -- AHAHAHAHAHA! lemme catch my -- AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!Did you REALLY just suggest that Christians do not found more charities because they are afraid of STATE PERSECUTION OF CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS?AHAHAHAHAHAHAAA ... Damn, that's just funny.You have denial issuesNope. In fact, again, I am quite religious, and also quite committed to a scientific understanding of the universe. I just do not subscribe to YOUR beliefs.
