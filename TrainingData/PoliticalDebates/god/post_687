I'm constantly amazed by people who cannot pick-up on sarcasm.You're point was that walking through a cemetery would somehow make one believe in god,which is an excellent point actually, as fear of death is probably when all is said and done, the number one reason people buy into religion - even more so than indoctrination.However, I was joking. Everyone thinks of death, even atheists. It's not as if people who don't believe in an afterlife aren't aware that death is immanent.Everyone knows, old news at this point. Walking through a cemetery is nothing but a pretty picture and self-validation for those who have chosen to believe in a myth out of fear.I'm an atheist because 1. If there were a god it would be much more obvious. I mean... why the mystery? come on now, 82% of the world population believes in him in one form or another, you can't get that many humans to believe in anything. So what's with all the hiding? 2. It doesn't make sense. It makes far more sense from observation that humans are a happy mistake (for humans) and nothing more. All science shows pretty conclusively that life was inevitable on this planet, and likely many more considering the numbers involved. So no creator is necessary. 3. From my experience, religious people act as if they're the victims of some mass hysteria, therefore without further proof available, I must assume they are victims of some form of mass hysteria.
