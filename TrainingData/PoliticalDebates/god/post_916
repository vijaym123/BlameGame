 This depends on who believes in god, all i'm saying is that a statement like this one would technically require proof if there is a god how would you know? And say for example you had an encounter with him, would anybody else know? I am a christian but i don't like the way this statement has been shown i couldn't be more proud of my belief in god however the same comments are gonna be used because there's no PROOF.
