Einstein's statement reflects his view that the universe could be explained in an experimentally deterministic way. He spent his last years in life trying to come up with a unified theory of physics because to him the notion of quantum uncertainty was so unsettling. The next great discovery in physics will likely a unified theory (after we find the Higgs boson of course). Regardless, Einstein's view has more to do with a certain view of nature rather than the existence of a   god   that shapes all things with some omnipotent guiding hand.
