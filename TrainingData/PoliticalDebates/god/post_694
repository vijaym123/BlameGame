I don't remember saying there shouldn't be some sort of authority. I honestly think you're construing my words insanely though. So I'll say this as simply as possible:If there is a god, and he is truly the Christian God, then he would not want people to be afraid of him or do the right thing just because he exists and is there.My whole point is, you should be a good person because being a good person is the right thing to do, not because your religion says it or because your belief dictates you should. You should just be a good person.You don't need a god to have the ability to be a responsible, loving, and caring person. If you think that, you're lost. I understand everything you are saying perfectly. You do not understand me.
