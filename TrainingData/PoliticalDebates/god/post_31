Faith is belief without any evidence at all.  Personally, I always insist on at least some evidence for important matters, particularly when the item concerned is highly implausible.  Since you mention it, can you name 5 "archaelogical and" (/or) "historical correlations" (whatever that is supposed to mean) "to stories" (and that is just what they are, stories, fiction) "presented in the bible", for me to consider?  And don't mention Josepheus.
