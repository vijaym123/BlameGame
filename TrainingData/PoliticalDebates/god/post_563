The idea of being alone in the universe can be scary. It is comforting to think that there is someone looking out for us, loving us, telling us how to live good lives, saving a place for us after we die, and it is convenient to have an explanation for all the overwhelmingly confusing origins and mechanics of life and nature. I write this specifically with Christianity in mind, but most religions give varying answers to the important questions of how we got here, why we are here, and what happens next. The concept of powerful supernatural being/beings is a very convenient way to allay all those curiosities and keep people from having to think too hard about them.So for me, it makes sense that the invention of God/gods is just a defense mechanism against confusion and spiritual crises. But the fact is that, despite a diversity of beliefs and 'true paths', no one on this earth knows better than anyone else what the truth is.
