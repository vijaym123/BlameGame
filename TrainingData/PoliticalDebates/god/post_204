You shouldn't give orders to people you don't know, or anybody for that matter.  If you want to learn about the Bible, I suggest you get one and read it yourself.  It was not written by the same man at the same time, but with study you will find it relates to today's world as much as it did 2000 years ago.  It does so in an order you will discover if you read it instead of baiting others for arguments.
