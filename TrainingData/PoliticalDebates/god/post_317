Mkovach is reaching for an old argument that one can find in Aquinas and elsewhere. As he states it, though, it has some amusing consequences. If something is omnipotent because it can do all things that are possible, I am omnipotent because I, too, can also do all things that are possible. The fact that I can't bench press 300 pounds doesn't disprove my omnipotence since that's clearly something I'm not able to do, i.e. it isn't possible. What is possible, I can readily do. Maybe I'm God. By the way, why should anybody entertain for an instance the notion that there is anything omnipotent in the universe? Mkovach is assuming both that omnipotence is a meaningful attribute and that something possesses it. Unfortunately, omnipotence is just the answer to the absurd game of "let's now come up with the best thing that might be true about our tribal deity." I'm reminded of arguments I had with my friends in grammar school about whether the universal solvent was able to dissolve itself, etc. One last note: mkovach writes "God cannot contradict himself." I, however, am able to contradict myself. Therefore I am greater than God because I have an ability he lacks.
