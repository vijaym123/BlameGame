I believe in God, but I consider myself a Deist.  I think that he gave me the logic and the power of knowledge to question a lot of things such as this subject that is very debatable.  I also think that there should be separation between church and state because the idea of America was to have people worshiping what they wanted.  I think people have the right to believe what they want, and if you want to be an Athiest it is fine with me.
