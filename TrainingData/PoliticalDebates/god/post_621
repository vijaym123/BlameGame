You seem to miss the question at hand. The question is not can you or do you have morality, I agree you do and can. I also believe you can come up with all kinds of reasons for it; which you clearly prove you can. The problem is that all the devices you use do it; reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc you come up with are not characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature.  The Atheistic worldview is purely naturalistic by definition and asserts that matter is all there is. It therefore can't, by definition, have non-materlistic things in it, like logic, reason, morality, ethics etc. So your use of such things disproves your assertion and confirms mine.So then the grounding question becomes critical. To form a correct view of the world one must have an adequate explanation for the things he finds in it. Otherwise your view will be inadequate and quite possibly incorrect. So I assert that your worldview is woefully inadequate to explain all of reality. And is therefore faulty because it's scope is to narrow and explanation far to simplistic.I've included a link to another book for your consideration. And again You'll have to adequately over come the arguments that are made in this book to change my mind.
