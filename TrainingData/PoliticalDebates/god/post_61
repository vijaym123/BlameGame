You provide absolutely nothing other than to claim your claim cannot be claimed, unclaimed, or counter-claimed solely by claiming it is so. God doesn't exist because he can't exist, by definition from BOTH sides of the argument.Why don't mono-theists understand that their belief in a god, is no different than believing in gods. Mono-theists think it's foolish to believe in multiple gods, but are aghast and dumbfounded when someone doesn't believe in their god. All forms of god-worship are simply a waste of the persons time and energy. Only atheism and agnostism are intellectually honest positions as only they are willing to admit that they have not seen or heard OBJECTIVE evidence that the laws of physics can be false.
