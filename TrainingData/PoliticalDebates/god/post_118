Why do you find it easier to believe in a supernatural creator, than creation as a natural process ?If God made the universe, what did he make it out of ?You cannot prove a negative.  I can tell you that there is a tea cup in orbit around Alpha Centauri 4.3 light years away, and the ask you to prove me wrong.  You cannot.  However I would say that it is extremely unlikely.If there is an intelligent designer he was not very bright. Blind spots in eyes, flesh eating bacteria, parasitic wasps, nice fella.Whilst I cannot say "there is no God" I can say that the evidence, at this time, shows it to be extremely unlikely.
