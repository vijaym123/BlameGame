We can observe the presence of a black hole by seeing how the stars behind it distort or by observing the accretion disk that forms as a black hole siphons matter from a near by star.Black holes are also defined mathematically... appearing in the Theory of Relativity long before they were observed (the math is really quite enjoyably elegant).
