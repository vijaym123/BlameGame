We can't fully place our faith in science, because it is continually changing. The theory's and truth's of 100 years ago are not always considered truth 100 years into the future. I think it is questionable to fully rely on the thoughts and beliefs of man for we have not obtained full knowledge and will never obtain full knowledge of all things. There will always be unexplained matters in our existence. It's almost like we are lost on a weird country road, but do not want to stop and ask for directions because we want to do it ourselves. Although we may never find it and it would be a more pleasant experience if we stopped and asked for directions, we want to see it with our own eyes, so we never stop thinking we might be heading in a totally wrong direction.
