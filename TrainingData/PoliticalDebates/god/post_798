Pascal's wager means nothing. It is neither intelligent or moral to believe in something just because you can't do something that is impossible, prove a negative. "To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise: but I believe I am supported in my creed of materialism by Locke, Tracy, and Stewart. At what age of the Christian church this heresy of immaterialism, this masked atheism, crept in, I do not know. But heresy it certainly is."-Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Adams, Aug. 15, 1820
