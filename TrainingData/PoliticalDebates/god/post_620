iamdavidh,You seem like a very open minded guy, so I'd like to buy a book for you. I want to do that since I think you would give it a fair reading and I would like to get your opinion on it since it weighs heavily in my opinion on the existence of god. Anthony Flew held many of the same views you do, if not more. But something changed and I find it very compelling. If you are going to change my mind you need to overcome his argument, I've included a link to amazon.com so just say the word and I'll buy it for you.
