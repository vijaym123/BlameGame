I think the real question is, DO YOU REALLY EXIST? or, do you believe in miracles? are you a creation of your own imagination?do you believe in ghosts? I think therefore I am I think? what is the meaning of existence? what is the point? is this reality only yours and yours alone, everyone else you have drummed up to be a part of your existence? do you know why we do not know the answers to all domains of reality? if you knew what is and what is to be, would you still want to be in it? isn't the unknown part of the charm of being at all? the mystery, is still out there.
