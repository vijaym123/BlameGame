#originalTopic=God_Does_Not_Exist
 Although I never really was religious to begin with, in recent years I began to lean towards a sort of skeptical agnosticism. However, if pressed to choose a side, I would certainly consider myself a basic atheist. I really don't believe in God in the traditional sense-I don't believe that God is an old bearded guy sitting on a cloud that can poof a donkey(for example) into existence. I just feel as if there is less and less reason for me to buy into the snake oil that organized religions try to sell me. I feel very good about my beliefs(or lack thereof)-they feel right to me. However, I am not the stereotypical depressed, bitter atheist that you may see in your mind's eye-far from it, in fact. There are so many other good things to believe in, what should keep me from getting up in the morning?
