Lol. I think either you completely misunderstood my post or I wrote it very badly. I'm against the abrahimic Gods. The thing about those mass suicidic cults is that the same has been done for aliens, not just God. It's complete brainwashing that is a relatively new phenomenon that has only affected lets say 2000 people? Within the last 30 years? My point is that it is so irrelevant and anomolous with humankind's history, especially when it comes to religion, it should not hold any strength and if it does, it shows that religion needs to be in place to stop people from doing that... (as they did it on scientific reasoning)Facts are facts, but they can be used subjectively. The thing about saying we need to know about everything before making a decision is impossible and tbh says that as people we can't make a decision. ANY decision we make, we will never know the impact of it, not only is it because we can't see into the future that would have been, but also we can't see everybody it might've affected.I personally believe sodomy is wrong. And it's not science if both parties consent to it. If that is the mentality, then when the time comes IF I WANT, then I SHOULD be able to be part lion, part tiger, and have sexual intercourse with baboons. It means if a girl of 12 consents to a 90 year old, it's ok. Don't act like it won't happen, because slowly everything is becoming legal. Even drugs are becoming legal. There's no science to everything... Now I'm not against oral sex... but anything more than that is imo not right. Religious people to do not do things just to please God, but because they also think it's the right way of living.
