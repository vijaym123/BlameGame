that's not quite accurate. First of all, the unified force isn't really a thing. You might be talking about a Unified field, which is a description of how strong   nuclear   forces, weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism and gravity interact and are similar. That would give us the ability to say for certain how everything is going to move, but doesn't really give us much in the way of how the universe was created.And it's not true to say that we cannot know what that unified force is, but that we don't currently know. That's why we're looking.
