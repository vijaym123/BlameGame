"For life to exist, you must have this metabolic motor. But this metabolic motor can only be produced by life." (Dr. Ron Carlson)"The 'complex metabolic motor' is the end result of 3.5 billion years worth of   evolution  ."It's the same for DNA. So...if you believe in Spontaneous Generation aren't you going against the basic rule of biology (Biogenesis - life only arises from life. It does not come from nonliving matter) Or is nitrogen, ammonia, salts, and   carbon dioxide   living matter?"Biology dose say that modern life cannot arise from 'non-life' however the same is not true of the oldest forms of life which did arise from self replicating protens.
