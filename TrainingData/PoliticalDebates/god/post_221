They cannot be proven to exist if 1. You do not have instrumentation that can detect them and and relay that information in a manner that our 5 senses can sense them.2. If you do not have that instrumentation tuned into the frequency those   energy   signals are transmitting on. 3. There may be many other energy waves than radio tv infra red ultra violet light rays. Thought waves for example, we cannot even read thought waves who, who knows what other energy signals are out there that we simply cannot detect withn our current detection facilities.Just because you don't know its there does not mean it doesn't exist.
