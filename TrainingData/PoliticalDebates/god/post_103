I disagree with you completely.  Evolution is fact.  The fossils prove that.  Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  Intelligent design is just another theory, a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design (the proponents accept change has occurred and that natural selection occurs at species level),  They have failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for ID.  What would be proof?  Well, it would have to be a big jump in evolution, perhaps something like a fossil rabbit in Jurassic rocks along with dinosaur fossils, something showing that large and unexpected changes have occurred.  One theory doesn't become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories.  The theories you want to favour have to have some (any???) facts supporting them.
