This is just plain silly. Are you saying only through education can people be right? There are millions of people out there who are uneducated and I would say they are more likely to go to heaven than I am. Education has f*ck all to do with this.I've said from the start not to bring different cases of religion in this. This is purely an argument about God, regardless of what religion is brought in. Not religion, not religious texts, scriptures, rules etc. I could go into greater detail and dismantle your argument but we'll be going into something completely different.
