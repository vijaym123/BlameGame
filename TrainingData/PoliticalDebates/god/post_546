I am an Atheist meaning I do not believe in "God" of course. I was raised by two Very Christian parents and yet I still do not believe in "God" I believe in logic, not religion it makes all the more sense to believe in logic than religion. All ten of the "plagues" from the bible can be explained by reason and logic. I mean I do not look down at anyone who believes in "God" because it is their life and their choice. I am simply just stating what I believe.
