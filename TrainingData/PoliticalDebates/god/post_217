Well, that's a pretty lame explanation.  Who is   god   trying to impress, himself or us, by creating a universe with billions of galaxies. Just one, the Milky Way, with its 200 to 400 billion stars, would have been impressive enough, particularly since we only realised there were more than one galaxy only in the early 20th century, and we are most unlikely (what with Einstein's special theory of relativity, of even visiting the nearest star (other than the sun).  Whatever good qualities you find in the   bible   (and I admit Proverbs generally is pretty good), it is still a pretty shoddy piece of fiction.  I don't know how you can seriously claim your work of fiction is any truer that the sacred texts of any other   religion   that humans have made up.
