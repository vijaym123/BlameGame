He's definitly not the God of the   bible  . I have trouble believing that our earth just happened, along with all the rest of humanity. What I don't understand is how God created the human race and then destroyed the entire human race. Then allowed it to flourish again, and now all of us who don't accept Jesus into our hearts will go to hell. Wait a minute isn't he all knowing, didn't he know what was going to happen when he originally created me. He loves me so much he sent his son to die on the cross for  me so my sins could be forgiven but... he made me this way and he knew it was going to turn out this way before I was born. If I don't believe in him he knows my heart and he'll judge me accordingly.
