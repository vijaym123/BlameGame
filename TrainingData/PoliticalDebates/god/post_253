"The existence of a god would invalidate the most essential laws of science..."An interesting argument indeed.  Why does science have laws?  Why do we accept that there is a natural order (design?).  Why is it an accepted proposition that those laws can be depended upon?  If I were to believe in a designer, I would expect a design. I would expect that the universe he created would have evidence of his design.  If I were to take your side of the argument I would wonder why any laws or formulas would exist at all?  You are speaking out of both sides of your mouth- arguing from the perspective of a highly ordered universe out of the one side, and denying the source of that order out of the other.  If the universe has laws as you say, then you must be intellectually honest enough to say that those laws had to come from somewhere.
