I respect your opinion that's just the way you feel. I hardly ever see or hear about agnostics giving anything to any charity. It's a given fact the Christians and Organizations help more than any other. If tomorrow God came down and took all the the believers away and there was no more Christians this world would go to hell in a hand basket fast. I guess the argument is for the greater good. For years we have asked God to get out of our schools and our life and our country. So when something bad happens like 9/11 we all of a sudden ask God why did he remove his protection. Total Hypocrisy
