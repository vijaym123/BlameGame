"One theory doesn't become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories. "There is actually insufficient emperical evidence for both intelligent design as well as for evolutionary theory. I am not suggesting that intelligent design is magically correct simply because one cannot completely prove evolution. What I am saying, however, is that if you take an objective look at the research conducted by those in the scientific community who support intelligent design as well as those who support evolutionary theory, intelligent design theory makes more sense, and has fewer logical flaws than evolution. I have studied evolutionary theory in depth at university level, and I notice that most people who respond to discussions such as this one either do not even know the basics of evolution, or have extremely limited knowledge of peer-reviewed, published research done on intelligent design, and thus make ignorant assumptions and statements regarding intelligent design.
