I'm straight.Also, I've never attacked anyone in my life. You have the right to your beliefs, which i may or may not agree with, and I have the right to mine. Also, I don't understand your story- did you shoot blanks at them? What sort of sixteen year old were you, with three previous assaults? A violent lunatic? Also, two sons at sixteen? Huh, that sounds quite chaste to me. And if homosexuals said to you that you had no rights, wanted to stone you, etc., then you would be angry. You're angry for far less. Being gay doesn't make you a god-hater, nor does being straight make you a Christian. Acceptance is important, and you seem to be really, really short on that trait!Intolerance is hurting others for their beliefs. Intolerance is using offensive language because you can- whether it's about one's race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. And if you hate gay people so much, move to the Middle East! they don't have that problem there.
