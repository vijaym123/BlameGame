if anything is not physical, then there must be a god? i think you took a few leaps too many there. animals have fear etc and differring morals based on the changes their species has encountered over time thats exactly what evolution is"no ones head gets bigger the more they know" - a hard drive doesn't get any bigger as it stores more information either
