A scientist comments on Rabbi Jerrit’s 3 conditions:1. Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source for the Universe constitute the longest standing range of explanations for the source of our world. I guess that it is a basic tenet of science that this fact has no value whatsoever. Countless ideas have longest standing (e.g. the sun goes around the earth) yet are wrong.2. Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source for the Universe constitute the most agreed-upon range of explanations believed by human beings – throughout history and still today.This is a testimony to the limited education that has been available to human beings. The comment about 1. applies here, as this is simply another statement of 1.3. Each and every other explanation for the source of our world is lacking in one fundamental area; they cannot explain without significant problems on the one hand, or an articulation that resembles one of Divinity without the label on the other hand, what existed prior to the world. The existence of a God, without beginning and without end, spatially or temporally, solves this problem.The first sentence is true. The second is trivial, and I’m much more comfortable with the curved space-time general theory of relativity description of the universe, without beginning and without end, spatially or temporally. Evidence  Text The Expanded Quotable Einstein “I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know his thoughts. The rest are details.” Einstein is speaking of God as Nature. There are innumerable quotes  (e.g. see the Isaacson biography) that show Einstein was an agnostic.I’m getting the feeling that I’m discussing “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin”, and that is a waste of my time.
