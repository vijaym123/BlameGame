It is philosophically,logically and scientifically impossible to prove that God exists or does not, for the following reasons:1) A supreme Being is totally perfect therefore cannot be measured, defined or even " sampled" as per the scientific method,but if we could...2) God, if he or she exists, is above dimensional space and time (metaphysical) therefore being above and beyond  our capacity to understand or even interpet any supposed " meausrements" or information we could obtain using scientific analysis.In other words we wouldn't be able to understand or inerpret any evidence for God, even if we had some that was scientifically valid.3) We cannot , by definition ever understand or know The First Cause (God) because we are only capable of anthropomorphizing any Creator or Force that is metaphysically beyond us. In other words, we give a Divine Supreme Being characteristics that are entirely human such as emotions: anger,jealousy, pity, and physical attributes .
