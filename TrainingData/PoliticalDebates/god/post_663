No, it's not an impediment to the First Amendment in any way, shape, or form. No one is being restrained from practicing or believing in their religion in any way. You just can't use the authority of the state to force your religion on other people. That is in fact what the First Amendment says. What on earth is so difficult about that to grasp?Whether the students are on school property or off it is irrelevant. Whether the activity is school-sponsored or not is the critical issue. If your daughter gets raped on a field trip you can goddamn well still sue the school. If your son cracks his skull open during a school-sponsored extracurricular, you can damn well still sue the school. And if teachers start imposing prayer on students at a school-sponsored event, you can damn well still sue the school, because the school is responsible for a civil rights violation.
