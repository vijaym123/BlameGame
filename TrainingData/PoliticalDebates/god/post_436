Yes I do. To think we were just plunked down here out of the star lit sky when there were two moons in the sky is stretching it! Look around at the miracles you see every day, but most of us take it for granted. There is something within each human (even those that deny) that has God in them (or a Supreme Being if they so choose to call Him that) whether they like it or not. I have seen grown men that have denied an existence of a God, but, have seen them in a hospital Chapel on bended knees praying to God to save their little girl or save a loved one. One can think there is nothing out there and it's just a belief system until the rage of a horrible incident comes into play and they're kneeling down asking for help. You simply believe or you don't. Believing is a whole lot simpler (if you mean it) and a lot more peaceful. I've seen many miracles in my years on this earth. http://www.puretravel.com/Guide/Africa/Eastern_Africa/tanzania
