Come on, do you really think that if there is a god who watches over us, they will just stand by and let us suffer? Yes, I know that some things are our fault, but bad things happen to innocent people. If God is heartless enough to let someone get raped or murdered and not do anything about it, I wouldn't want to worship him anyway.
