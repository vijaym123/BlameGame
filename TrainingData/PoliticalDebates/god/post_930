 If God did exist, where is the proof? Just because the Bible is the most popular book that existed, does not neccesarily mean that it exists. Harry Potter, is a perfect example on this topic. Just because there are over millions of copies sold, does not mean that magic exists. Oh, and a little comment on Christianity. I think there was good reason that Jesus was crucified. Okay, if a white man said that he was the son of God in the Middle East (where most people have colourred skin), would that not be just a tiny bit strange?
