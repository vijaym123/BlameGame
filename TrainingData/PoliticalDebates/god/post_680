Why should you be good for the sake of being good? because you would have a deeper and more educated understanding of the needs for kindness (for example) for you and your peers in this world. Education allows us to understand our importance in this world, not just as individuals but as members of a society. My well-being in this world depends on how well I am able to relate to others. Education allows me to see that some actions cause harm to my peers and this is undesirable because, through education, I have attained an understanding about their personal dignity. I do not do things based on some reward, I do things based on a practical (and scientific) understanding on the consecuences of actions. Morality becomes objective and factual, not subjective like most religions that impose rules and norms only because "God says so". Religious morality for example has been changing over time, proving that it is as subjective as any other type of opinion. the bible itself contains examples of the changes that occurr in the laws given to the people. At one point in time christians were not allowed to eat animals with hoofs, however this changed over time. We cannot base our concepts in books that change with the interpretations given to them. If we are looking for a solid conception of what the greater good is, we should find it in science and factual evidence as to what really is right or wrong behavior based on whether or not it is harmful to us.
