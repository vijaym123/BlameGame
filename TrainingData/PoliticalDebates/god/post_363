although your solution is a god with infinite power, infinite knowledge, infinite presence, infinite morality, and has existed infinitly. if 2 infinitly existing planes of energy collided and caused the big bang - that would require infinite time, but no morality or involvement/presensce in our current universe. there are many explainations that do not require a god to create our universe - the fact that we haven't narrowed it to one for you does not mean the demonstrably flawed bible is correct
