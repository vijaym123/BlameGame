Everywhere in nature, in flowers, in trees, in leaves, in animals, in mountains, and in women is beauty. Is it just that it has become beauty because we have been around it so long? or is there a common brush stroke, a style.  Like that that can distinguish a Monet from a Rembrandt. There is a common brush stroke, a golden ratio, a golden curve, the fibonacci series that is repeated throughout nature, and is present in all things we preceive as beauty.  There is no survival reason for it, no reason for it to have evolved.  It is art for the sake of art, and the artist is God.  To look around you and not see the hand of the artist is the same as assuming the Mona Lisa was created by accident when a house painter was cleaning his brushes on some canvas. Beauty in nature is what has instilled in man a sense of God even in times and places where there was no religion, or writing, or even language.  Go to Yosemite, look around and think which is more outragous, that it is all accident or art created by an artist.
