The weight of evidence since the big bang has nothing to say about conditions before the big bang.  What laws governed are the subject of mere speculation.  There simply is no experience and no empirical evidence from which to draw conclusions.As for laws as we know them, no one has claimed that we should doubt them.  Certainly the possibility of a God does not preclude them fron functioning just as we expect them to.We could go back and forth with a "yes you are" - "no I'm not" conversation but that serves no purpose.  Baring anything that actually supports the position that a God would invalidate all physical laws, I don't think there's much more to discuss.
