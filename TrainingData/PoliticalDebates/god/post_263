If you gain, you gain all. If you lose, you lose nothing.

The reason why people have always come up with different religions and theories is yes, to search out an explanation of the universe and its contents. But, instead of seeing this as a pathetic foolishness that you seem to, it appears to me that it is the amazing inborn reactions humans have to discover where they have come from, where they go to, and why they are here. Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there's more to this life.
