Science deals only with the creation. It cannot deal with the creator because the creator exists outside the box of creation that   science   is trapped within.The best science can do is say once there was a "big bang", something happened and a bunch of   energy   exploded into what we know as reality and cooled and formed the universe and created laws of physics that we have discovered.Science cannot tell us what went bang nor why it went bang.
