People used to tell stories to children. These stories are passed on and extended. Children brains can be formed, so children will believe those stories to be true and pass them on. The stories have become religion. That is why people believe in stories from bible, koran etc and therefore think that there is a god. We could also believe to live on a toe nail of a really big giant (guess what the score on a debate with that statement would be...). There is no god unless we have strong indications or proof which we don't so there is no reason to think that this statement is true. Stories from the past are no proof or even indications as they are mostly made up.If you believe in god, you are brainwashed pretty well by parents and/or society. (to be verified by the fact that your belief matches the belief of people around you...)
