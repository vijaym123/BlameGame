I applaud your honesty. Science is not what is or isn't, but instead what might or might not be. Science explanation does not have to be true to be useful, just consistent with most of the evidence. How much of   science   has been disapproved with new technologies. I mean look how much of Darwin has been disputed as inaccurate, thanks to molecular Biology. Follow the evidence, make a decision. I would encourage you as a seemingly logical scientist to study more on Robert Collins Fine Tuning, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells (molecular Biology), and David Berlinski. Good life to you
