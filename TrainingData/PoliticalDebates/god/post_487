I was not planning on using every known country that worshiped Hinduism I was making the example that I am sure there are quite a few people in the world that do not know who Vishnu is and it is safe to say that Vishnu is a god of India but better put would have been Hinduism. and just 1 question why did you say they were not? what is the answer? "I'll give you a hint; they're not the god/s of India."
