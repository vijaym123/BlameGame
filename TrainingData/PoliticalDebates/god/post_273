As a scientist and skeptic of religion, I am offended by this inane post. Where to start?"everything we know about science would have to be wrong"First, the areas of science and the scientific method that would be affected by a revelation depend entirely on the specific powers of the g(G)od in question.Second, most of what we currently "know" as scientists is wrong to some degree. Science is a path to understanding, but don't get on a high horse about how great we are. We are just getting started."Absent proof that matter and Energy can be created, there is no reason to doubt science in favor of a wish"We know that matter and energy can interconvert. A lot of miracles could happen that way. As pointed out by jdefriez, it is a false premise to say that god is equivalent to the creation of matter and energy.I believe you are refuting a specific God, perhaps the God required to accomplish the literal word of the bible. Even with such an easy target you have mishandled the argument and discredited your own side with your fallacious appeals to authority. You can't even preach to the converted.
