The "wait and see" philosophy isn't the greatest idea. It's like a deer caught in headlights. You are like the deer and the headlights are the afterlife. You have no idea what is coming toward you. Then suddenly, boom. You're dead. You now just experienced the "afterlife". Is it what you expected? No. But better to believe in something and be wrong than to not believe in something and still be wrong.
