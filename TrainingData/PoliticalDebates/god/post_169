Faith IS truly required to believe (i.e. KNOW in one's heart) that God exists.  Yet, Faith in faith alone gives little comfort that Faith will one Day be proven to be fact.  Faith THAT God exists is based on the presuppositions that God can exist, and that His existence is beneficial to me.However, by the same token Faith is required to believe that God does NOT exist!  The Faith that God does NOT exist is based on the presuppositions that the Universe can exist even if God does not, and that the lack of God is in some way or ways beneficial to me.Though I will probably add another comment later, I will close this one with an investment-return analysis!Belief:  God exists!   Investment:  This Life with all its problems & blessings...on average 100 years or less.   Return:  Eternity of significant existence minus problems plus additional favor for believers.Belief:  God does not exist!   Investment:  Time & Effort getting to the top of your field, and the staggering task of proving your own omniscience of all things in order to be able to prove that God does not exist!    Return:  A Life of pleasures that lasts for 100 years or less, and the possibility of being immortalized in the hearts of those who adore you, even though YOU yourself cease to exist.Cost-Benefits Analysis shows heavier value on the side of Belief in God and His certain existence! (Hebrews 11:1, KJV)   It's not even close!  :)
