Just how do you explain faith to the faithless. Our faith in our states that faith is not brought on to another by us. As Jesus stated, "The Father calls them on to me". Mans faith in himself blinds him to faith in God. Outside of Christianity all other faiths are forms of humanism, just as science is. Are evening and morning news cycles are filled with endless news stories of scientists have done this or that study, or experts suggest this or that. Only later to conclude the opposite may be true. This is the problem with modern day politics, liberalism has basically come to the conclusion of "This is ok for this moment". With God nothing changes.
