 Of course God exist. There is no question about it. There is evidence all around us. I am sick of these atheists saying there is no proof. I mean, if you cannot open you eyes and see all that he has created and done, then you must be pretty blind. However, when these atheists are dying and need help, they will be wishing they knew God. I have no doubt that God exist.  />   /> Joe9...your story sounds interesting. I also had an encounter a few years ago, but I did not get a number. I just got hope and assurance of a better place.  Go GOD!!!! He does exist. He is around us. Just open your eyes and look.
