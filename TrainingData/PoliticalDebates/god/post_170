Faith cost nothing it is the GIFT of GOD,you do nothing but get out of it's way & allow yourself to be used for a purpose..You are salvaged from a life of eternal torment but you live to a life of eternal reward.YOU are salvaged for the purpose of becomming GOD like in character & IMAGE, RESTORED to how GOD made man originally...YOU will do as HE would do ..REPRESENTATION is your purpose in eternity & in the here & now..
