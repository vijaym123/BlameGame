I do believe there is a higher power that most people would refer to as God.  My Interpretation stems from intelligence and how we understand the world around us and then to the higher levels of intelligences.  For example my dog is a wonderful pet, but he does have a lower intelligence than me.  He experiences the world very differently than me.  Am I a God to him? I think to him we would be.  If we didn't know better if a alien race came down to this planet and had intelligence that we did not understand would they be a God? In ancient history probably yes, watch Chariots of Fire. Nowadays thats a tough one, we have a much better understanding of what intelligence is.  If God walked the earth would he cease to be God?  I think it boils down to intelligence and the authority that intelligence perceives to have. Last thought intelligence a entity born out of energy derived from a source called GOD.  We all possess a piece of it, that we have to grow to return back to the source.
