  pbeaird, indeed. That is no argument from ignoracne but one acknowledging all the failed arguments for God in line with the auto-epistemic rule.   The presumption of naturalism reflects that not only are natural causes and explanations efficient but also necessary, primary and sufficient. They, contrary to Gottfried Wilhem Leibniz, are the sufficient reason.  This neither sanbags theist nor begs the question but demands evidence as Einstein so did to overcome Newton.  Science explains the how and the why. The why is not according to a pre-arranged plan [ the atelic challenge] but according to natural forces, including those random ones. So those are indeed primary causes; one cannot then declare God the primary cause and them the secondary ones. As our naturalist arguments are defeasible, then there is probably no God.
