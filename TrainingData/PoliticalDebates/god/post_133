If the world is so complex and ordered that it must have been created by a devine God, then surely God must have been created by an even greater being.  How else could such a devine creature exist if not created by an even greater one?  How can you accept the fact that God has always existed, yet you can't accept the fact that the universe always existed.  Where did he exist before creating the universe.  If God created the universe, then where does he keep it?     If God is good, all powerfull, and all knowing, yet evil exists.  That proves that he either doesn not exist, or that he is not good, all knowing and all powerful, and therefore NOT devine.    We are made in his image, yet we are imperfect.  Therefore, God is imperfect and therefore NOT devine.     All of the   religious   texts were created by man, so using thems as proof is a fallacy.  It's not as if the good book magically appeared.  The STORY of the   ten commandments   is the only aspect that supposedly was drafted by God himself.  He exists because I read it in a book that some man wrote a long time ago.  Well there were a lot of books written a long time ago about the supposed ONE creator, and none of them are in agreement.  The fact that the three major religions all worship the same God comes from the fact that all three religions came from the same screwed up part of the world that still cannot abide by the   teaching   of peace found in all three religions.   How can you dismiss the many Gods of the Romans, Greeks, Pagans, American Indians, etc.  Why didn't God give these cultures the same teachings as the Middle East?  Their religions ceased not because they were wrong or disproven.  They fell by the swords of those who sought to spread their own OPINION on   creation   and kill those who would not convert to their will.
