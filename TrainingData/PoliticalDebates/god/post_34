Oh well, if you don't think that gravity is a fact, why don't you prove the theory by jumping off the top of the nearest tall building?  With regard to abiogenesis, formation of polypeptides is not thought to be the first component.  RNA (or some early simpler version of it) is thought to be the first critical component, because RNA has both catalytic and reproductive properties, so it can do the jobs of both proteins and DNA.  Evolution has nothing to do with abiogenesis.  Claiming that because   evolution   can't explain the origin of life proves intelligent design is just ludicrous.  ID is not supported by ANY evidence; it is a theory without any scientific support.
