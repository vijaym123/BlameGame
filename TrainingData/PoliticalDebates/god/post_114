The pro ID post at the start of this thread makes many claims about an alleged failure of science to explain things.  I disagree - but let's accept it for arguments sake.But even if all scientific knowledge (every last bit of it)  were faulty, that would say nothing about the possible existence of God. The poster then goes on to say that they can't prove the existence of God - in other words there is no evidence for the existence of god.There follows an unsubstantiated assertion that ID is better.  As a post apparently designed to support the existence of God it seems a little unconvincing.
