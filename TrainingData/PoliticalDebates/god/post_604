Kinda,I almost guarantee Lawnman understands your debate just fine. He's pretty bright.I know I understand this debate just fine.but your description does indeed show your hand that you believe in a god. Though attempting to be altruistic in that you say as your example the author of a religion does not himself believe it,the assumption of the reasoning behind an author of religion if there is no god to author it them self (that people were out of control) is both unknowable, and quite debatable.There is no way to know if 1. whether people ever stopped acting out of control because of the introduction of a god. 2. whether people would stop acting out of control because of the introduction of a god as opposed to any other method of persuasion.The assumption that even if there were not a god, there must at least be a reason to believe in a god,is a deep deep indoctrination within all but a small small percent of humans on earth.It shows you believe in a god.I submit that laws work just fine in and of themselves. People do not need now, and never have needed a god or hope of eternal life or fear of eternal damnation. That religion is a decoration and another means of power, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but unnecessary either way.You want atheists to argue while accepting a premise that most of us do not accept at all.I not only believe a god is not for the greater good. I don't believe it ever would be under any circumstance. Not even the circumstance you wrote in the debate description.
