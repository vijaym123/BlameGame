So your argument is, "believe in God just in case he's real"?What if you believe in the wrong God? What if the Romans were right about their Gods? What if the Hindus are right about there Gods? How about Buddhism? Or the Egyptian Gods? How about the Mayan gods? Or the Flying Spaghetti Monster?What if you don't believe in God but are still a good person? Is God really so self centered as to make belief in him the only stipulation in getting into heaven?What if you've never even heard of God?What if you believe in God, but are also a complete asshole?so after that even if there is no God believing would have the most benifit since you wouldn't have trouble with the laws or drugs or other teachings of your religionBelieving in God makes you above the law? Or are you saying that belief in God makes you follow the law better? The former is just plain stupid, and the latter is presumptuous.
