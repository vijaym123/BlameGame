1- This arguement tries to disprove God within the framework of the "omni" God. But it fails because it fails to adopt the utmost argument- that we are not all-understanding. Because of that our logic is inherently lesser, and can fail.2- On the whole issue of God's omniscience disproving his omnipotence-This completely depends on which view of God you are talking about. Every person and religion define omniscience differently. And again, when you argue under this framework you have to acknowledge the paradigm that we can't understand everything.
