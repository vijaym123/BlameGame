"Science does not busy itself with disproving *anything*."Well, since God, by nature, would be and certainly is outside of the laws of physics, he would be difficult to disprove.  But to your point, your non-interest in attempting to disprove God, is no evidence He doesn't exist.  I would rather point out that your inability to prove the origin of life, the origin or very nature of the universe, the irrational behavior of forces in the universe that lead us to flip-flop on our publicly held opinions regarding "the beginning"- these at least leave a door open to the possibility that someone else is in charge.  For those of us who have personal proof- that is enough for us.  For those of you who are unable to come up with other rational answers, I recommend you at least open up your mind to the possibility that man's foolishness is the wisdom of God.
