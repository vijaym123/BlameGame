What about when that god's followers determine that anyone who doesn't believe in their perfect, smart, wise, fair god is a dangerous heretic who should be put to death immediately and in a horrific way?You put to much emphasis on man. Man will always make mistakes Christian or not. Our model on how to be a Christian is how Christ walked the earth. He was peaceful never forced anything upon anybody never put anyone to death for not believing in him. Anything other than this is an abomination on God, one of the ten commandments though shall not kill. I have never known of any Christian who is a firm believing to ask for anybody to be put to death.
