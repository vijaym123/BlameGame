#originalTopic=Does_God_really_Exist
I live in south korea so I'm not really good at English. If there are some wrong Grammers or words, just turn to a blind eye , please.... My opinion is this. God really exist.I've never seen him before, but I can assure that God exist.When Most scientists are faced on problem which is beyond of his or her ability, they usually rely on the BIBLE. because BIBLE tells eveything. Have you ever found something wrong in the BIBLE? May be you haven't. because it's real. real God and Jesus story.
