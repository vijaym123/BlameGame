The real question to ask about any proposed god  - Allah, The Christian God, Thor, Zeus  or whoever is "What evidence is there for the existence of this being?"This is exactly the same question that one could ask about unicorns, fairies, Steve Jobs or Paris Hilton.In the case of the last two the is testable empirical evidence which can be pointed to.  In the case of Zeus and the unicorn this evidence is lacking.  We are quite happy to accept that such lack of evidence is sufficient for us to dismiss the existence of Thor and fairies.  Logically we should take the same lack of positive evidence to dismiss the existence of Allah and the Christian God as well.
