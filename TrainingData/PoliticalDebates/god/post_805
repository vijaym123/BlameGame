You know, most societies would consider that kind of ranting a sure sign of schizophrenia...Anyway, I'll have you know that no one has any need of a "God"Because he doesn't exist.And even if he does, no one has seen or heard anything from him, so we're kinda getting along fine without him anyway.Unless you think you go around talking to him, and he talks to you,In which case, yeah, you definitely have schizophrenia.
