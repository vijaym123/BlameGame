The way I view religion is... I just need proof.I don't think any religion is specifically wrong... don't think any are right. I don't think that science is right.Until I can see for myself what lies in the afterlife, I will not believe one way or the other.Therefore, it is not worth it because I would most likely be wrong and that would be a waste of life... and very disappointing.If I don't believe in anything without specifically turning away from anything, I figure things will turn out for the best.
