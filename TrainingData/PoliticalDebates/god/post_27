Evolution is fact (the fossils show change).  Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  Intelligent design is just another theory; a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design (the proponents don't deny change, nor do they deny natural selection at species level).  The proponents of ID have failed to provide any evidence or ways of recognising ID when or if it occurs, and until they do so, it can't be taken seriously.  Natural selection, on the other hand, has a lot of evidence in its favour.
