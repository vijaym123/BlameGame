Your argument is based on a flawed conception of omnipotence.You say that God's omniscience, being all knowing, proves that God can't change things from how he knows them to be.  Essentially, God can't change things to be difference from what they are.  Now you say, "therefore God cannot be all powerful because in contradicts his omniscience."So, your argument is essentially that God is a contradiction precisely because he cannot contradict himself.  This argument is clearly logically flawed.God's omnipotence means that he can do all things that are possible.  That fact that he is all powerful means that there are things that he cannot do.  God cannot be wrong.  God cannot make himself cease to exist.  Hence, God cannot contradict himself.  Your own argument is a contradiction, not God.
