I'm sorry this is getting retarded but when did I bring up a particular religion or religion at all (apart from the fact that religion = following God). You're the one whining about Christianity and all the evil it's done to you etc. etc. Do you have any knowledge of other religions? Or other religious ideals outside of Abrahmic faiths?Who are you to say whether or not God is real? Nobody can answer that question because nobody knows. you THINK you know, but you don't in the same way i THINK God exists. You can't prove or disprove God.
