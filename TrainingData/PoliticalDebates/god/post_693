Ofcourse People need other people to guide them. THAT IS WHY GOD SENDS DOWN PROPHETS. They are there to tell people God's word.If god were real then he could just tell people himself. This is ridiculous logic.Let me repeat - GOD IS NOT JUST THE ULTIMATE 'PUNISHMENT'. HE IS ALL. HE LOVES YOU THE MOST, HE GUIDES YOU THE BEST, HE DOES EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN REAL LIFE CAN. THAT IS WHY HE IS GOD. If you have an IQ above 50 you would understand what I'm saying. So far you haven't.Um, name one thing god has done in the history of mankind and you may have an argument here.So doesn't that mean by following somebody who knows all is the right way in life?... I don't know about you, but to me I would follow somebody who knew everything and would do the best for me rather than to follow somebody who knew quite a bit and would do the best for me. ANYdayProblem is, there is no god who knows everything. I mean, even the books of any religion that were supposed to come from this mythical being are riddled with contradiction. I mean, wouldn't an all knowing everything at least not contradict themself?The only real excuse one can make is "well, it was written by man."Well in that case, if it's ultimately just other people you're listening to anyway when you are "hearing the word of god"why bother with a god at all in that case? Why not just have people? - since that's all it is anyway even by the admission of the religious.
