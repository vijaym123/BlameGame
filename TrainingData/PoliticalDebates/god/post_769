science has proven that people who have some belief in a diety or higher being live longer, healthier lives, and are more likely to survive a tradgedy (such as an unexpected death, or fatal disease). The study cant tell if in the end what the person believes is actually true, but that doesn't apply in this case; just the simple belief that there is more to life than living and dying is enough to make a life more enjoyable.
