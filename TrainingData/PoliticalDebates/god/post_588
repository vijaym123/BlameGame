I firmly believe that for MOST people in the world it is best that God exists. Purely because the consequences of crossing God are much worse than the laws. You can escape from the law, you can challenge the law, you can appeal against the law. The law is not perfect. The law has it's flaws. GOD IS PERFECT (in the believer's mind). You cannot disagree with God as he is MUCH smarter, wiser etc. he is not corrupted and gives what the person deserves. What's better/worse is that He takes everything the person has done at the end of their life - all the Karma added up at the end of life. So not just one bad incident, but fairly judges him/her after all of their actions.I will contribute more later.
