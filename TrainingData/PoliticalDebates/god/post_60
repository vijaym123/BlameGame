Naturally, for something to exist we must be able to either observe the god itself or observe other things that prove its existence. I know my dog exists because I can see him, touch him, etc. It is extremely reasonable to believe electrons exist because of the massive amount of observable indirect evidence for their existence.Now, obviously we cannot directly experience god. We cannot see him, touch him, etc. Therefore, we must observe indirect evidence of his existence. Unfortunately, there is none. The only "evidence" religious people use is attempting to DISPROVE the big bang, evolution, etc -- not PROVE that THEIR side is correct. Why? Because they have no evidence. No archaeological evidence for a Garden of Eden, no direct link between prayer and healing, etc. Suppose there is a god. For something to exist, it or evidence for it must be observable. However, neither a god nor evidence for a god's existence can be observed. Therefore, a god does not exist.
