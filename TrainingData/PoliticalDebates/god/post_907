 Yes God exists, there is evidence that he exists. Enough evidence for the open minded to call it proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But there is still some faith involved. Likewise you have to have faith in athiesm in order to ignore the evidence and not believe in god. One bit of evidence for God is the creation of the universe. "the big bang" theory is generally accepted by scientists today. So all time, space and matter had a beginning at some time in the distant past. Before the big bang there was no time space or matter. Christians say God (an infinate being outside of time space and matter) created something out of nothing. Athiests say nothing created something out of nothing. Both views require some faith, but the christian view makes more logical sense and requires less faith. Creation of life on earth is more evidence that points to god (intelegent design). Athiests, darwinists, evolutionists claim that uninteligent, randomizing nature took dead random matter and mixed it together and first life was born. Then every living thing evolved from that first life. Of corse christians think God created man, the animals, and the vegitation. The fossil records show that all life appeared between 600million and 500million bc, and that all life appeared all at once, fully formed, and showed no directional changes through extinction. The fossil records also do not show any transitional forms to support evolution. Again we cannot go back and witness what happened so some faith is required, but the evidence agrees more strongly with creation rather than evolution/athieism/darwinism. And there is much more evidence pointing to God, but if you rule out God to begin with, then all the evidence in the world will never provide "proof" that God exists
