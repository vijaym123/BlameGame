 I think God is real because if it weren't for God how would you have been born huh? And you might say evolution er sum stupid stuff like that and that all leads up to a big bang but big bangs don't just happen.....something has to cause them so what do you think? There is no scientific explanation for how the big bang happened but it did and you people who say God doesn't exist need to look at yourself and think how could any of this happen without something to make it happen? Big bangs don't just come flyin outta people's asses!
