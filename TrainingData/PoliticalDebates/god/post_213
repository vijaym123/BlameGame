Flying Spaghetti monsters make no sense, the possible existence of a Creator and speculation on ITS nature makes sense. Equating God.s existence to fantastical creations of the irrational is poor argumentation. Because we cannot prove a negative does not mean that, within the Laws of Nature and Physics, there is no God per se. We will never know for sure so atheists hold to the No hypothesis. Maybe we should all be agnostics...we simply do not know nor will we ever know.
