Just because we don't know how the world came to be, doesn't mean God made it.  That means we don't know how it came to be.  The same thing can be said about God.  How did he/she come to  be?  I do not see how it is a bigger leap of faith to say that you don't know how the world was created than to say that God has been around for eternity, and made the world.  And even if there is a God, how can you possibly know that your god is the real god?  Maybe Zeus is the real God.  There is simply no way of knowing.
