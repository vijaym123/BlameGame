roy 1167 writes "It would be extremely difficult to definitively prove that human life actually derived from another species, and simply seeing some evidence is not definitive proof." In fact, the case for our close kinship with the other apes is absurdly strong. In principle, one can doubt any factual claim, which is why the law distinguishes between any doubt whatsoever and reasonable doubt. There is no reasonable doubt about the matter. Even in the 19th Century, it was pretty clear on the basis of the visible anatomy of the higher primates that human beings were very similar to chimpanzees and gorillas; but fossil evidence was scanty. That's no longer true--the missing link hasn't been missing from some time now--but even more importantly, modern molecular biology has demonstrated how our genome matches up with that of other primates in a way that would be inexplicable were we not related. I'm reminded of an old joke. The worried husband hires a private eye to check up on his wife. The detective reports back with bad news: "I watched your place last night. A very handsome guy showed up and they went off in a taxi to a night club where they danced cheek to cheek and had several drinks. Then they took another taxi. I could see them making out in the back seat. After they got to his place, they had another drink and started petting on the sofa. Your wife took off her dress and the guy pulled down his pants. After she was stark naked, he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom.""And then what happened." sez the husband. "The lights went out and I couldn't see." "Always the lingering doubt!"
