Hopefully you're not being serious in the first paragraph. In general human kind is decent. You're making it seem that the world can live without authority. My point is that we need some form of authority and that God is the ultimate authority.Again people are decent and do things out of their own hearts, but the world doesn't work in that way, the majority of people need to be pushed in the right direction, no matter how big or small that push is.I am not trying to portray God as a terrible guy with a whip which keeps as in line. Only showing His superiority to the police or law.Who is God? The Almighty, Benevolent, Omniscient etc. He is the most moral, righteous, loving, wise etc. He is perfection. That is God. God tells people to do out of love, nobility, righteousness etc. But he has also set the law. Because He is God, His law is right, so living by His word is right. We cannot decide what is right or wrong, as we all have different opinions of what is wrong or right. So if you are to say tread the noble path... wtf is the noble path? It's easy to say, but your noble path is completely different to my noble path and if everybodies noble path is different then there is only one being who can truly decide what is right and wrong as He is Right. THAT is God. He loves you, He takes care of you, He guides you, He juedges you, He punishes and rewards you. In the end He can do everything that nobody else can do.You understand where I'm coming from?
