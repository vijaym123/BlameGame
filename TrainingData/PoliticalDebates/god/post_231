"All we can see, measure, and know shows us that matter and energy have always existed."The author's statement above simply is not accurate.  Big Bag theory, while certainly not an established fact, is widely accepted.  According to that theory, matter as we know it did not exist prior to the Big Bang.  Indeed, the physical laws of the universe that we are so familiar with did not exist.  We cannot know what laws prevailed because the conditions prior to the Big Bang are beyond all experience and, so far at least, are untestable.  One may well deny the Big Bang and that's fine, but the statement that matter and energy have always existed is not supported.
