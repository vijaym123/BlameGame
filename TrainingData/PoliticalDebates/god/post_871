 I fully agree, there can be no omnipotent God, for omnipotence requires for the ability to transgress the laws of physics, which cannot be done, for no substance made of either matter or energy can transgress the bonds of physics, and existence s defined as something of either matter or energy. If God exists, show me! Concrete evidence, none of the faith argument.
