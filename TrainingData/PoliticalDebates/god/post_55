Whether a construct labeled ÒGod,Ó by humans as an explanation for the origin of the universe exists, or its attributes been accurately described, appears of little import. There is no reliable set of procedures to govern its behavior or its effects on humanity. This is not to say that such constructs have no value There are many theoretical constructs that we put to everyday use Ð electricity, atoms, electrons, etc. I find it very difficult to justify making an unmanageable, invisible, and unobservable phenomenon so much a part of what motivates people to think and behave as they do. Specifically, teaching children to rely on, pray to, or make requests of this construct seems particularly unproductive.Just as new learning in evolutionary biology have opened our understandings of both human motivation and behavior, so too are we discovering that both core morality, and a propensity to respond to supernatural explanations for events is deeply wired in the human brain.
