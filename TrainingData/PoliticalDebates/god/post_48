You have bought into global warming, "just in case".  While there is evidence on both sides of the hypothesis, you made a statement that leaps to treating it as a fact. My point is that it is silly for people to apply the scientific method as a way to say that there isn't a God, while they turn right around and embrace fake science as fact.  Darwin's stuff is still considered a theory, for instance.  It is not a fact.  Global warming, caused by human actions, is still a theory, not a fact.  It is a fact that the earth has warmed and cooled many times in the past, without any help from mankind.Sure, please do read all the so called holy texts.  I have read many of them, but won't claim to have read them all.  I find that the ones I have read have common themes about loving the unlovable and generally buy into the same 10 commandments that are found in the old testament.  My issue with the other texts is that all of them, except The Bible, promise a way to heaven thru some kind of action by you, a mere mortal, no further action by God being required.  Only The Bible makes it clear that nobody gets to heaven unless God physically intervenes and allows it. That's the text I choose to believe since it requires the existence of God.  The other texts simply don't.  Yes, The Bible also clearly states that many people who read it won't believe it.
