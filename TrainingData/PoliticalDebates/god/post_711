I agree with this guy 100% and he's right with some of the declines in modern society. But he said himself; we need some rules, just not too many and use practical wisdom to make the right choices. I guess we can apply that to some of the scenarios we have. My bad if I've made it seem like everything is black and white (i guess I might've) but it was only to keep the debates as simple as possible.One thing you're assuming is that people are smarter now than they used to be. There's no way of knowing and in many cases this is true, especially when you look at western civilisations, however when you look to the east, we could say they're just as bright as we are, from the egyptians and greeks, to indians and chinese to aztec and mayan (very little knowledge on them btw). Not only did they have numerous powerful and compelling minds, but they also based their reasoning around God and religion. However religions were completely different in those days compared to the religions these days and so to take my argument one step further it is that belief in non-Abrahimic Gods are for the greater good.
