That's sounds nice; but why should I? It's a whole lot easier to live for myself. Besides who cares if things get better or not? If there is no God what difference does it make; everything just becomes an exercise in futility. We have no purpose or meaning apart from God. Without God what then is the moral imperative? What then is the "ought" to. Why should we care? Without God we are all headed for nothing. You should take some time to walk through a cemetery and if you get a chance to see a fresh dug grave, stare at it for a while because that my friend is your destiny.
