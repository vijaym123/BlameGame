"But that's not what the Bible says..."You're right. The bible says to kill gays and to kill unbelievers. It preaches hatred and discrimination in the worst way. It pretends that it preaches a holy, merciful message. But it legitimizes hatred, intolerance and murder.The ironic part is your precious Bible isn't even original. Your silly creation stories (yes, your bible has more than one of them) can be found in Sumerian texts that predate the old testament by centuries, even millenia. Which makes sense - the Hebrew tribes would have been decendent from Sumerian tribes. In fact, most of Genesis (the Ark and the flood? Pah-leeze) can be very easily traced to earlier, non-jewish stories.But I'm sure it's just god spreading seeds of dissent to test the resolve of believers. Keep denying logic, fact and the truth of your very existence. I'm sure your god is pleased.
