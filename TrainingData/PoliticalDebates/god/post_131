The rabbi writes: "they cannot explain without significant problems on the one hand, or an articulation that resembles one of Divinity without the label on the other hand, what existed prior to the world. The   existence   of a God, without beginning and without end, spatially or temporally, solves this problem."It DOES NOT solve the problem at all. How did a   god  , without beginning and without end, come to be? No one knows for sure how the universe started, but one thing that is for sure is that there is not one scrap of evidence for the existence of a supernatural being. Not one!! There is ample evidence for the non-existence of any god, because where has he, she, or it shown him-, her- or itself? Nowhere. We only have probably fictional accounts in the so-called holy books, which are full of inaccuracies and falsehoods. For example, the Bible says that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it. This is patently false. Therefore, we cannot believe anything in the Bible or the Koran for sure. So there have been no uncontested proofs of any miracles. So no evidence for anything supernatural existing.Leon Marzillier
