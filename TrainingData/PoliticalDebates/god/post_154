It appears that you see God as a punisher rather than a redeemer.  I see Him as the source of all that is good in this world and beyond.  Here, we struggle in our lives to live with limitations which keep us from viewing the truth without the shadows of the flesh.  God sent His only Son to enter into our humanity, so that we could enter into His Spirit- and live.  He is transforming us from being mere creatures, into children with life breathed into them, and preparing us for true union.  God made the rocks, trees and all that exists here- but people are different.  Yes, people create lots of God, and somehow struggle against the only true God who asks that we be willing to give up all others.  He is looking for hearts that seek Him, because He knows the better end in store.  Free will allows us to choose the pastures that satisfy us with earthly things.  But while here, we get glimmers of the better things of the Spirit.  I actually do understand your outlook.  I know it will insult you if I tell you that I will pray for you, so let me just wish you well in your search or avoidance.  It is your choice to believe that this is all there is or not.  The key to transforming love, which is what God desires, is that it is reciprocal.  But He allows us to make our own choices.  He has already expressed the greatest love through Jesus Christ.  That is not vain or petty.  That is sacrifice that invites us all to free, unrestrained and eternal truth.  There is no coercion.God bless
