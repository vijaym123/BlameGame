 All the religious fanatics in the world cannot show you one piece of tangible proof of their belief. However evolution has been proven. Not that humans evolved from monkeys but the fact that the evolutionary process is real. They offer their bible as proof, but humans wrote that. A good piece of fiction but dry and hard to fallow. Everyone, have a nice day!
