 Good is the   health  , well-being and longevity of our entire species and planet. You can believe in a   god   and be for the good of all humanity or you can not believe in god and be for the good of all humanity. On the other hand saddling people with original sin, the fall of man and a final judgment day is definitely not good for the psychic of humankind. If we become extinct through our own suicidal self-destructive tendencies taught to us by people who claim to believe in god, will it be god's fault? Therefore the Abrahamic god and all gods are irrelevant compared to love.
