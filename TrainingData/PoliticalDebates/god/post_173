You wrote: "Given the lack of proof, in scientific terms, either way, those who do not believe in God may actually be faithful equally to those who do believe in God, only their   faith   is in the lack of a God."Although I agree with what you're saying, why do we continue to run to   science   for validation of our beliefs?  There are things that science cannot do.  Scientific knowledge has proven to be false in many instances... by science itself.  Science is limited to areas of naturalism-- it CAN'T prove or disprove the SUPERnatural.  I say, let's run to the principles of jurisprudence, where probability is honored.  I believe BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT that God exists.
