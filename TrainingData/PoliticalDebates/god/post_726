I wouldn't really say it's monotheism, but definately the religions that are strongly monotheist. However, I do not blame 'monotheism' for it, it's more of the agression these religions (abrahimic) have. Your thoughts on eastern religions are interesting and I'm guessing you're saying they are based on philosophy?
