I've indulged this debate for over two decades and its essence boils down to this - We need not debate the existence of a "god". The true debate is whether or not those who claim the existence of such have sufficient evidence and reason to support their claims.Do claimants of the existence of a "god" have sufficient evidence and argument to support what they claim?That's the more relevant question.I cannot reject a "god" whose existence has never been conclusively proven and accepted. What I reject is the weak or absent evidence and the poorly reasoned arguments for such.
