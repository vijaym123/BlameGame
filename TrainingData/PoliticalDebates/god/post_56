From Letter revealed May 08There are plenty of people with high IQ's, but that doesn't make them right on everything.  Remember, they say a Harvard Grad can be distinguished by the ability to "speak eloquently, and at length, on subjects they know absolutely nothing about."  Of course, Einstein was smart enough to not even try something like that.  He rejected silly ideas people have come up with about the Bible and accepted what he understood from colleagues in Biology.If Einstein pictured cute little animals on a cute little boat, and Mt. Everest covered by water coming from rain, then yes, that's a silly story.  If he pictured a red colored guy with horns, pitchfork and funny tail, then yes, that's a silly story.  If he thought that the Bible teaches that the world is flat, or that the solar system revolves around the earth, or that the earth is supported by some structure rather than floating in space, then yes, those are silly stories.But that's not what the Bible says
