We're just going round in circles. Firslty, I don't believe in Christianity. However as I've said SEVERAL times that people ARE good in GENERAL. So if YOU think that I think that we NEED GOD to be w/e.. then again you have completely missed what I've said. Not just once, or twice, but now 3 times. (That's quite a lot of times ehh)People ARE good. But explain to me what being good is? Is murder good? In certain circumstances is it justified? Or is it never justified? I feed my kids because I love my kids, not because God tells me to. Even if he did not tell me to, I would still feed them. It's the right thing to do.One example. Adultery. You tell me is it right or wrong? Those who have thought of or have actually cheated will say its right, but those who haven't will say its wrong. Can we make a decision on whether or not it should be punishable? In the end, God says its wrong. I think He has a better idea of whether or not its right or wrong. THAT is why we take his word, because we cannot make the right decision.Hopefully you understand this time. Fourth time lucky. Yay........
