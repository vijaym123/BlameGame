Are you kidding me?Does that mean that PLuto did not exist until   science   discovered it?Come on that is just silly. Of course the agnostic position should be the null position, because we just don't know.But I am on the yes side because I have defined God in such a way as to be quite confident of Gods existence not as a physical entity but as a spirit of truth and righteousness
