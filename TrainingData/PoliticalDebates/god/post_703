LOL!Who said to tell the truth is the greater good? You're assuming that telling the truth always results in the greater good huh? I bet you can think of 1 billion ways in which a lie can work better.Again, I am not saying God is a lie. I am first trying to state whether or not belief in God for the masses is better than lack of belief... and then whether that belief should be promoted.You're now bringing religion into the argument. It's kind of annoying when people do that when it completely misses the point. But just for the sake of it... let me destroy it. it has given way to horrible things through fanatismThe key word in this is FANATISM. NOT RELIGION. A fanatic in ANYTHING will always result in extreme actions. Take PETA for example. They are not religious, but they can definately take a lot of shi far.It has also allowed governments to control populations through the use of those beliefs.Governments will always control populations. That is what they do. If it's not religion they're using, it will be something else. The GOVERNMENT is RESPONSIBLE for USING RELIGION, NOT RELIGION ITSELF!It has also fostered artificial divisions between different cultures, eventualy leading to wars.Whether you like it or not, people are ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENCES. These differences are ALWAYS GOING TO BE USED by PEOPLE OF POWER for THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES.Do you get the picture? Religion should not be taking the blame.I don't think we need God anymore to know what is good or bad. I think people are capable to figure things out on their own.Well atleast you've answered the question. However it's not really an argument.The point I've CONSISTENTLY made is that people are NOT able to figure out things on their own. That is why we have laws and rules. My point is that God is better at this than any human alive.
