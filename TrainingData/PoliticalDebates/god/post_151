"I would rather point out that your inability to prove the origin of life, the origin or very nature of the universe,"A hundred years ago we couldn't prove what lightning was. We couldn't prove what the sun was. We couldn't prove what stars were. We couldn't prove anything regarding atoms, molecular theory, or most of the modern principles of biology and physics.And people, religious people, simply claimed they were God acting in his way. Further back, when it was offered that the world was round and the sun was the center of our galaxy, not the earth, the church killed people over those views. Further back, the Egyptians attributed the sun, the moon and their harvest to religion. Happy gods brought good harvests. Angry gods brought plagues. No science, and religion filled the holes.Religion has always said "Science can't prove it, therefore it must be god". And, given enough time, science has always found evidence.
