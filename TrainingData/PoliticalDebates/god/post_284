"Science has been proven, God hasn't." It doesn't take a scientist to know that the first rule to scientific theory is that nothing can be proven. Nothing. Not even that the world is round (and it's not. It's shaped like a pear.) All scientists can do is come up with massive amounts of evidence over time to support their theories. Which is what Christians, Jews, and Muslims try to do all over the world every day. "You essentially say “he did it with magic” – which also doesn’t exist, so there we are again." Okay...What if there is a god? (I know, I know you're an atheist, bear with me here.) Let's assume God's the all powerful type and he came up with *gasp!* the laws of the universe (Scientific laws included)? Would it be so ridiculous for any believer to suppose that he works through the scientific manner which he himself created? In which case, science doesn't disprove the idea of God, it actually supports it."Is there a god?  I’m afraid not. Too bad." Just fyi, about two thirds of the human population can be documented and classified as a certain type of believer in God. So for you to attempt to crush their insights and beliefs in such a trite way without any evidence to back up your claim not only makes you look insensitive, but says nothing for your credibility. And you are speaking on behalf of an organization, man! So you're making them look bad too. Nice.
