I never made such an assumption...We cannot even assume God exists, less so that He is the creator of all we know and the unknown. If God exists, He or She or IT may in fact have ordered existing matter but the problem lies in explaining who created matter BEFORE the supreme Being and how can a Being be Supreme if it came into existence after matter!
