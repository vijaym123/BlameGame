I consider myself an atheist, for I see no need for a god to have created the universe or have any role in the playing out of events in this existence.  However this does not automatically mean that god does not exist.  Yet if a god does exist, I do not believe it would be at all the sort of god which any of today's religions adhere to.  It would not care about humans anymore than the air around us, for we are all simply made of matter, energy, and void which interacts according to strict rules which we have never seen broken.  Why would the creator of EVERYTHING care about one small bit of its creation which is in no way different than any other bit except in its own heavily biased opinion.  The universe may just be some pan-dimensional teenager's science-fair experiment simulation on his computer which they created to study the formation of galaxies.  Humans and other life are just things which happened to develop due to this set up of the laws of physics.
