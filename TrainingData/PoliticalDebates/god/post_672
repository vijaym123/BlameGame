It comes as no suprise that you sound like a moron, because to believe the point you're trying to make you would in fact have to be a moron...realize that.

Why has "god" neglected the people of North Korea and just chose to give us happiness and swimming, and football, and walking with our girlfriends. Ha you are so naive it's pathetic
