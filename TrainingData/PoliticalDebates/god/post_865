 There is no evidence for god.  Not one single bit.  Take your time, read the entire opposing side of this thread and you will not find one single thing that could be considered scientific evidence.  Stack that against evolution, or the big bang, or any other modern scientific theory and you understand why I cannot accept the existence of a god.
