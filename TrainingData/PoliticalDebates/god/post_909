 I believe that a sentient and unseen power exists--like a cosmic awareness.  That is what I think of as God.  And I can believe this God exists without believing IN God to DO anything.  And I do not have to be religious or even have a religion to think this.  And the God that may exist may not be like the biblical version  at all.  But we all have a source beyond the physical realm, I think.  We should respect this source in some way, simply for giving us our existence.
