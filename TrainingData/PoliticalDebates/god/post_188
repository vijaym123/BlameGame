This ties in nicely with my perception of there only being NOW. The past is forever gone except for "memories"(not so reliable memories) I NOW have and the future has not arrived except for hopes and plans I have NOW that it will arrive in a way I would like it to. But in reality I wave only this milli micro moment to DO anything that might create a future NOW.As the   bible   put it.These three remain FAITH - that what I now think I remember actually was HOPE - that what I wantand am now planning will actually occurand LOVE and the greatest of these is love because it is what I can do NOW based on my memory of a past to create the future I am hoping will come into existence.
