lulz, for a second i thought you were serious though.yes, most psychics have been proven to be fakes, but many haven't. are they real? i would say that 99% of the psychics out there are bullshit artists. the other 1%... i have no comment. I do know one personally who has scared me sometimes with her predictions though (and she's just a little old lady living in a trailer home). ghosts, idk. probably not. if so, i truly believe there is a science behind it, and not the spirits stuff. but who knows, maybe one day we'll figure that one out.
