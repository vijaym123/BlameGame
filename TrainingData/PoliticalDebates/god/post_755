Why does life have to have an absolute meaning? I ingrain meaning into my life through those around me and my actions, not the hope that once I die there will be another chance at living a life that I'm already currently living.This life is perfectly good enough for me, thanks. Once I die, I'm gone, and knowing that makes the life I have now even more special.
