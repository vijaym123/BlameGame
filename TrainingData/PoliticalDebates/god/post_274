Granted that science never 'proves' theories, it merely rejects theories which have been falsified, but that's kind of a minor clarification.You have to admit that the above comment (while poorly constructed) does have a point insofar as the existence of an omnipotent being would mean that the so-called immutable laws of physics would be more like traditions of physics given that they could be 'over-ruled' at will.  If the object of science is to whittle away false theories in order to leave behind the theories which can't be falsified, then the existence of an omniscient being would defeat that purpose (since it could falsify any theory).
