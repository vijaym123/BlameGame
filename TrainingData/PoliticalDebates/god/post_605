Nicepost.One thing though.. don't take the debate description as my main point. I didn't want to put too much there as it would've all pointed towards my side of the argument rather than just give a brief intro to what we should be talking about.So let's go into your talk about how law work just fine. Laws are changing all the time right? Now if they were good, then they wouldn't need to be changed. And if they have been changed then whose to say that they do not need to be changed again? God's Words will always be right till the end of time. We just don't see it, but in the end we will see it. So we can be here right now running around trying to make it all right, or we can follow Gods advice and we'll get there in the end. It's hard and loooooong to explain but ask me what God says that is wrong (one of those rules thats in all religions) and then tell me that if what he says isn't wrong... why should we not follow him.
