Countryboy is right. G-d very clearly talks about other Gods, usually Baal. We don't like Ba'al. There are supposed to be other Gods out there who are very powerful supernatural beings--Zeus, Ra, Gozer, etc. But Yahweh, the Jewish G-d, is supposed to be the one who created the universe and sort of maintains it. Different levels. Like, other Gods are players on football teams, but Yahweh is the high commissioner who decides who plays, when and where.
