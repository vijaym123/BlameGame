#originalTopic=God_Does_Not_Exist
 God does exist because I exist, and I felt his love and received the Holy Spirit. I'm the proof of his existance because I believe in him and he wants me to live strongly no matter how many evil and horrible events circulate around the world. Also, why did so many people sacrifice their lives just to spread the word full of love from Christ, even today? And think of the opposite: Why do so many people rail against God a lot? The world will fall apart, but God stands for all eternity.
