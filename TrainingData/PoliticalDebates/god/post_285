You seem to be forgetting that current evolutionary theory also breaks the laws of physics.  It requires life to spontaneously arise from non-life, which, according to science is impossible.  It would make more sense to have a being who could break the laws of physics willy nilly (though that is not what I, nor many others, believe is the case) than it would to have the laws of physics randomly break themselves.
