 I believe God exists... Because...  /   /> I want something to hope for other than being a machine suggested by evolution.  />   /> Prophecies from the Bible are ever so being fulfilled. Like Israel returning as a nation (remember the Walk in WWII?[and hebrew as the only language to have fully died off and revive)   />   /> Because I have had way too many complications with the varied evolutionary theories. (I used to be an atheist goth, mind you)  />   /> And btw a trend of the age is new age or matrixism because its 'cool'.  />   /> (I hope i put a few good respectable reasons)
