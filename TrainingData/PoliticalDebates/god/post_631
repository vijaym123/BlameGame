The decent of man more aptly accounts for our dichotomous moral values that treats people of our clan/country/team etc better than others. during the process of evolution we had to learn how to cooperate with human beings to be more successful hunters but compete against other tribes etc. for resources.if we went with: love thy enemy, love thy neighbor as thyself, and to be perfect sell everything you own and follow me - we would have a much different society than we have today
