Its sad that the (no its not side) is winning, God has made such a great impact on my life IT iS WORTH BELIVING IN HIM!Are people these days really doubting the belief that there is someone who is more superior than our selves? The world didnt make its self, and no big bang theorie put the world in the most perfect conditions to where we benefit to every little thing in it. have you ever thought about the structure of a human being, who are you gonna say put that together, the big bang? Those scientist and their predictions, they aren't nothing but human beings just as confused as me and you. Humans have the natural tendacy to be curious, so we come up with answer for everything. This is sad, people you need to believe that there is a god. Im not good at making people believers and i really wish i could pursuade you, because through my eyes there is no other reasonable way other than a god that made this world what it is.
