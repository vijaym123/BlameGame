It's not God who orders that though is it?Perhaps I am not getting your point, because your original argument seems to me to rest entirely on how belief in a "perfect, wise" creator being affects human behavior. And my point is, not always in good ways. Sometimes in good ways (as I have posted on at greater length), and sometimes in very horrible ways. The question wasn't about the existence of a god, but about belief in a god, and as an extention how such beliefs affect human actions.
