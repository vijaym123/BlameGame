No, I'm not confused. I think you're unclear on the law.If it was a school function, then it doesn't matter whether or not it was on school property; the critical issue is whether it's school-sponsored.If it was not a school function, then there's no law being violated. If it is a school function, they've got no business holding a prayer circle during it.Again I ask, would you be cool with it if your kids left the school campus for a charity drive and were then instructed to bow to Allah or chant Hare Krishna or spit rum and tobacco in honor of Ellegua? I'm betting the answer is "no."Similarly, the Muslims, Hindus, Santeria et. al. aren't real keen on having their kids indoctrinated with foreign faiths.It is flat inappropriate to inject prayer into a public school function, on or off school grounds, period. Prayer is what our churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship are for. It is not what our public schools are for. Pray all you want on your own time -- in your house, on the street, at your place of worship, in your car, in the park . . . pick any event NOT sponsored by state authorities at any location NOT owned or operated by the state, and have at. (Your example fails the first prong: a public school function is by definition "sponsored by state authorities.") But using the authority of the state to promote or enforce a religious belief is just plain illegal.
