Absence of proof, true, is not proof of absence, however, the absence of proof to support one's extraordinary claims is proof that one hasn't done one's factual homework nor does one appear to be interested in consistently logical reasoning.As I've said many times before in debates such as this, one need not disprove any so-called "god" or "goddess" or other claimed related entity. One cannot prove a negative, i.e. non-existence, because one cannot possess all there is to know everywhere and for all of time. What one can do and must do is check the facts and logic of those claiming the existence of such assumed entities. If their facts are incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent and if their logic is poor, one can in the least show the claimants arguments do not support their claims. One can show that the claimant has only very poor to no reason to believe what they do. One need only prove that the claimant has proven nothing at all.Absence of proof is proof the claimant's arguments - from beginning to their conclusions - are wrong. It makes no statement about the unknown or unknowable.
