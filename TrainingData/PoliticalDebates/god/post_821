I have faith because I have experienced the peace that comes through God. I'm not saying I've seen miracles, but I go to morning mass at my school in the mornings. I feel more peaceful on those days than I ever do in any other situation. God is a universal entity in that no matter what culture you are talking about, there is a notion of a supreme being. It's human nature to believe so. It's just that as time progressed, we realized that there really isn't a god for everything, like in polytheistic religions. Instead, we have God who watches over us. He allows the world to run on its own and makes sure good things come out of evil acts. And what else would compel people to do good. I want to do good, primarily, so that I can feel a sense of pride in myself. After this, I also feel I owe it to God to help others the way he has helped me. Even in ancient religions, people acted morally in order to avoid the wrath of their gods. They also sacrificed animals, etc, but that was culture specific.
