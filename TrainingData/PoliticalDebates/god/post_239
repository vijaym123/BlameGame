I to have always had strong beliefs about god and the universe and have as well made my decision about religion and I do not believe in a god. But if matter can not be created nor destroyed, where did it all start out at? The BIg Boom theory states that the universe was like a balloon which under compression finally exploded causing a chemical reaction beginning life in our universe and our universe itself. But something can not come from nothing. How did the first universe come to be? My argument has always been "we are still discovering this answer" but i have yet to see scientists evaluate this answer any further than I myself have. Any words of comfort?
