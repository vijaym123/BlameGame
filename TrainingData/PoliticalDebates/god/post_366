Ok, so the Bible says the descendants of the Israelis will reunite. That one happened. But the other predictions are just absurd."Europe, revived roman empire, to be the final world government. EU gives rise to Antichrist, who will come out of Spain (10th nation of EU) and form a peace contract with Israel for 7 years."How is Europe the revived Roman Empire? Even if we pretend that it is, there's no way Europe is going to take over the entire world."666: mark of the Antichrist - a biometric identification system that will facilitate commerce."Seriously? I can't believe people up-voted this crap.
