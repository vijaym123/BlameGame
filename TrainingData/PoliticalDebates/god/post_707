1. These prophets MAY just be intelligent people as you said. But they have ALL claimed to be related to God in some way. If they ARE followers of God, then great. If they're NOT, then why have they 'used' God? THAT was my original argument.. the reasons for having God. (I've been completely sidetracked).2. The reason I do not want to bring in religion is for the reasons you've stated. There are several different religions all doing different things and as soon as we start discussing God's word as interpretted by these religions, we'll be arguing about religions and not God.The mother does not explain to the child because the child will not understand, it will just continue to cry and beg. In the same way we do not understand God's word, but in both circumstances the child and us people will benefit if we follow God's/mother.we know that we shouldnt kill because it is common senseSomeone rapes a child.. should he be killed?You go to war, should you kill?You loose your temper, should you kill?Someone is trying to kill you, should you kill?You've had enough of life, should you kill yourself?You're in a vegetative state, should you be killed?God will tell us the right answer no matter what. However people have different opinions on those questions and both will argue their side. Who's right and who's wrong. Nobody on earth truly knows the impact of the decision they've made. This goes to your education point too. You're telling me all the finest, most educated people on the planet make the choices? in terms of ethics, religion etc?
