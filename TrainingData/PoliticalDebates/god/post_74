Isn't it amazing that Mankind still debates the existence of God?Man isn't sure that he believes in God,...yet all the while God still believes in Man, and extends His hand in creation of the foundation for reconciliation and the offer is still open while Man breathes.Hebrews 11:1 offers us confidence that even as God believes in His own existence and the existence of Man, Man has the opportunity to believe in God with confidence.The LORD has apparently never seen the NEED to prove his existence because He doesn't need it!  He KNOWS He exists!On the other hand, Man HAS apparently often questioned his own existence, ergo a statement of belief in Man's own existence was necessary to be codified, "I think!  Therefore, I am!"If Man who is often agnostic about his own existence can't use the Five Senses to verify this simple premise, why then does Man thinks that God can trust Man with greater knowledge of God's existence?If man questions what he CAN see, and demands that God show himself in order to make Man believe, how then is Man really going to believe (should God chose to "jump through that hoop") when he already questions the SEEN?With all due respects, Man is a religious being!  Belief toward God or Belief away from God is a presupposed position held-to religiously that rebels against logic tenaciously!An atheist may call me illogical, but only if he or she is willingly to wear illogical as a moniker, too!  :)
