i too believe in god but its just r imagination or it is just in d minds of people who cannot actually do anything without d concern of others, & as it is quite insulting to ask someone every time about everything they do,even though he/she is v.close to us.So old people considered a mythic person to tell 'em wat to do or wat not to do but it is their heart who orders 'em to do d job.And these mythic persons r d great people who once lived on earth & brought glory to the society and altogether every society or religion has a HERO ,so these men & women OR in other words GODS & GODESSES r still considered alive in their spirit or ghost forms.Wat do people actually do? at d time of crisis or according to students like me, v remember god at d time of exams only.Well,if v see through d indian culture,people put a type of powder on their forehead v which is made of sandal wood,wat people think is dat it purifies their body sins & apply it on d forehead and neck but d main reason y this is done is not seen by d indians. As sandal wood cools d forehead and d neck old people living in past said it was something done for so called the god. So it is simple to understand dat this all was only & only about logic.It is just about d scientific reasons which has forced d people to take it in a way dat is interesting & entertaining too.I still believe dat god does not exist but i will continue to worship it coz it is like a friend who tells me everything or it is just my own conscience.
