You say that on the one hand we are created in God's likeness. You point out an important problem in our definitions of good and evil, that would make a benevolent God seem very confusing, if not actually impossible. (We can also acknowledge that there are many, many concepts of God, most of which are contradictory with each other, and all of which are equally arbitrary definitions. How can we pick one and say it must be true?)On the other hand, you say, we evolved from apes. (I'll set aside the fact that evolutionary biology actually says that apes and humans evolved from a common ancestor.) You say that there is "strong supporting evidence," but that you would just "hate to think" it was true.Seeing you cite logical problems on one side and strong evidence on the other, I'm surprised that you opt for indifference. The fact that you aren't happy with a conclusion doesn't make it false. Maybe you just need to reflect on what it is about sharing an ancestor with apes that makes you sad. Is a world with evolution and natural selection really that much less amazing and awe-inspiring? I don't think so.
