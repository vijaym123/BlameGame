God cannot help you and bring you to heaven, he can only guide you and show you the path.Guidance will only be help if you do something about it.If not, it is not help it is just some instructions or ways to go to heaven.God bringing you to heaven is called direct help whereas god showing you directions to heaven is called indirect help.There is a difference..
