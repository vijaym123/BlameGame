Christians are not burdened to prove what they know.  You feel no burden to seek answers with an open mind, and that is your choice.  That lack of interest or belief on your part should not be used as an argument that God doesn't exist.  Those who believed in a trade route around a round world didn't make it true by proving it.  Our world was round despite the proof or lack of.  It wasn't flat till proven round.  It was simply believed to be round by those who refused to accept the possibility that there was evidence in the stars that we rotated, leading some to accurately come to the conclusion that the earth is round.  I would suggest that your unwillingness to examine the mysteries that would be explained by a Creator God, may indicate an error in the scientific method.  You are willing to accept that some things defy science, or can't be explained by science, but you are unwilling to rationalize that ANY explanation that fully explains the mystery could be true.  Like the flat earthers, you require proof, when the very universe testifies of God.
