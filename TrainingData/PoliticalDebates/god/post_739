So if everyone gets to worship whatever religion feel like, doesn't that negate your point of uniting behind a common religion? What you are saying here basically agrees with what I said about people having freedom to believe whatever they want. If there is no common religion, then there is no single religion to unite behind and therefore no point to religion as a unifier or peacekeeping tool.
