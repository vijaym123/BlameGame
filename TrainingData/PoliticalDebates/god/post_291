Much of the understanding of scientific logic here is incorrect. The very laws of physics are based on theory. We can measure but based on presuppositions. For example: we know that gravity existence, but we presuppose the theory's of how gravity came into being. Thus Gravity is still a theory. Through Physics we have discovered that the earth is fine tuned for life to exist. Mathematically life elsewhere is improbable  There are very few facts of   science   much more theories. Perhaps there needs to be studying more on these aspects and let the evidence lead you to a conclusion rather than searching for a conclusion to meet your belieifs.  There is good research by Michael Behe "irreducible complexity", and the Robin Collins "Fine tuning." If there is going to be a debate there needs to be a better knowledge of scientific exploration and theory.
