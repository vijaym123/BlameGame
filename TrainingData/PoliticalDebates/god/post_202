God is, always has been, and always will be.  That's a hard thing to wrap your mind around, but if we didn't dwell in a finite mindset, it would not be.  Many of the same people, who reject God, or Creator, can easily phantom infinite parallel universes, intelligent beings from other planets or even galaxies, but not a Creator.  For me, God has always been the only plausible explanation for life.  If you really study the Bible, you'll find that it must be divinely inspired if only because of the obvious logical sequence obtained by so many authors over so many years.  For me, however, I only have to look at a child or maybe something as small as a butterfly, to see the handiwork of God.
