You've missed the point haven't you. I haven't at one point said I myself believe in God. Even though I do. Not very strongly... but I do.So you're telling me the world would be better off believing there was no God? EVER.Again you've missed the point of this debate. In a debate.. you don't just make one statement.. you got to have something to back it up. All you've done is make up a sentence.Groans...
