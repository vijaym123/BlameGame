 This is not irrefutable proof, and nothing you can say can make it so. In my view, both the theistic and atheist arguments are flawed.  We cannot prove the existence of God just as we cannot prove the non-existence of God.   />   /> It's also interesting to see that you say (in relation to the Universe) that an infinite cannot exist, and everything must have a beginning. I ask, where does God begin?   />   /> We cannot understand the mysteries of the Universe just like Christians say we cannot understand the mind of God. Science theory says that a Big Bang give birth to the Universe. It does not explain what set off the Big Bang. Creationist theory says God created the world in six days. It does not explain the evidence for the aforementioned Big Bang. The argument should stop here - there is no proof - irrefutable proof - for either. All we can discern is what is the more likely theory.
