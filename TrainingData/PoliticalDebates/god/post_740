It's a common religion, not the only religion. Even if there wasn't a single dominant religion. If there were several thousand religions, if they could live side by side with only minor conflicts, if they had tolerance it would be ok. However that's only possible with these religions as abrahimic have a looong and thorough history of not being able to get along with those next to it.It's the mentality of the religions that's most important. The abrahimic religions feel everybody has to convert to their beliefs... which is why it is dominant, because they followed that aggresively. The other religions respect other's and don't agressively convert others and don't feel it's their mission to convert, but more to respect and understand. If religions had that mentality.. then it would definately be a better world and half of these 'religion causes wars' bs ideas would go out of the window.
