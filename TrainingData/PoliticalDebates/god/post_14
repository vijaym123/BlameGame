If the world were perfect, we would all be robots without the choices to do good or evil.  That is not love, that is slavery.  This is not what God wanted for us.God created us and knows our nature, therefore at creation he knew that we would have to sacrifice his son on the cross for our sins, in order to perfect his creation in heaven.  He also knew that we would suffer for the sins of our fathers and our fellow souls.We can not see the entirity of our existence, for example when my nephew was killed in Iraq, it was an incredible sadness, but now four years later we appreciate the fullness of his life and the splendidness of his sacrifice. He gave up his earthly life to save others in his battalion.  Yet these two things existed together at the same instant, though at his death we did not see his ,and the effect of his life on others for years to come.A really good book to read on this subject is called "The Shack."
