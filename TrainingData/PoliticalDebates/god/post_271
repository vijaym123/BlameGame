I apologize, this is not much of a response to your work. I am tired. I should not really be writing now...but I just want to say a couple of things...the belief in God or a god or gods is quaint. There is now extensive neuroscientific "evidence" for "god on the brain" which neither proves nor disproves anything much...but it is interesting to see how the brain functions. I take all human knowledge to be human constructions (we can only see what humans can see; we can only hear what humans can hear etc etc). We can only think or imagine what humans can think or imagine. Anything beyond the scope of our brains is by definition unknowable. If there was a god we could not possibly know it. In the same sense that no human being can possibly know everything that is going on in the universe. God, is apparently, bigger than the universe, after all he, she or it made the universe, so he she or it must be bigger (in some sense) and therefore as a mere humanoid I cannot know him her or it. And it would not make a blind bit of difference even if he she or it did exist...the world is just the same...Hamas, Al-Qaeda, the US military all still exist, they are all still torturing and killing each other. All the people doing compassionate loving helpful things in the world are also still there. If god is there or if god is not there...there is no difference. Perhaps, the new US President will help bring some peace into this world, I certainly hope so, but even he cannot bring a non-existent god into existence.
