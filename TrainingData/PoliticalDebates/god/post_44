I am a 100% atheist because there is NO evidence of a god, heaven, hell, devils, angels or a soul that leaves the body.  They are ALL figments of our imagination.  Heaven is an attractive illusion.  All thoughts about god exist only in our minds.  Look for evidence and you will find none.  All animals and plants came about because of evolution which has been going on for 3.5 billion years on Earth.Jimmy Dunne  281.584.9707
