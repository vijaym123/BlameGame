Actually, 84% of the world is crazy,since only 16% are not religious - in the world that is.And no one is "rending" you, just laughing.And who talks to themselves on a social networking site? "Must, must get this through my head..."Just curious, do you think Jesus is reading what you write? And judging you on it or something? Like, are you trying to score brownie points with all the quotes, to show how much you love Jesus?Because as far as actually debating, continually quoting from a book the person your debating thinks is rubish, isn't very effective.
