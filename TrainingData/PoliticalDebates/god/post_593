You put to[o] much emphasis on man.This whole discussion is about how belief in a god or gods affects humankind -- not about your personal belief system. Emphasis on man's reactions and how a belief in a god affects said reactions is, in fact, the entire topic of the debate here.one of the ten commandments [is] thou[ ] shall not kill.One of the other 10 commandments - in fact the 1st -- is that "thou shalt have no other gods" business that is the source of so many holy wars.As a point of interest, the original text of the Sixth Commandment read "thou shalt not kill other Israelites." You could kill all the Canaanites, Babylonians, Akkadians et. al. that you liked.I have never known of any Christian . . . to ask for anybody to be put to deathYou've never known of Christians asking for someone to be put to death? Then you've not read history. Start with imperial Rome and its campaigns throughout Europe and Asia, and also pay particular attention to the Reconquista, all nine of the Crusades into western Asia, the Saxon Wars and spread of the Holy Roman Empire, the Baltic Crusades, the Inquisition, the Reformation, the European witchcraze, the conquest of the Americas, the McCarthy era, and the bombing of abortion clinics by wingnutty members of "Christian Century." I'd be mighty surprised if you could find a single ten-year block anywhere in the last 1500 years during which Christians were not asking for some other group of people to be put to death.
