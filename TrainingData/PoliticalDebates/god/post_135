Unless I've missed something, you've started out by saying that because humans have believed in gods for a very long time, it must be true.Does it not matter that we've also believed in a very long list of things (ghosts, world being flat, monsters, etc) that have been proven wrong? And don't you think it a bit odd that, if popular belief in a   god   lends some credibility to the idea of a god, there'd have been an agreed upon god as opposed to everyone disagreeing on how many gods, who, and what there are?How about, instead of using popular opinion as an argument, you actually argue the case for the existence of a god?
