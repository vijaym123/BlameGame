I can not see how what the Bible says is true. How can someone live to over 1000 years old. Humans evolved from Cavemen, and whatever existed before then. The Bible at times simply defies all logic, science and life as we know it. You can argue about religion and science. But science makes the componants of existance and what has actually happened. So the science is 100% correct and you can not modify this in its complete state. We are mostly talking about the Christian God but what about others? Muslim god Allah and others? Do they exist too? So which God made the world and created life? 3 solutions here. Either only one exists making all but one religion true. Non of them exist making all of them false or all gods are one also making all reliigions false. Whichever way the majority of belief is flawed and contradicted through other religions. Who says the Bible is fact and the Quaran is false?God has supposedly created life and brought a beautiful world upon us. He has the power to do anything. Why has he not done any of these so called miracles in our life like turning water into wine etc. The world of today is a sorry state, with murders, diseases and even terrorists. How and why does he let this happen when he can easily stop it? If thats the case he is supporting terrorism and that is not such a nice creative being!There has been more evidence to suggest life form on other planets exist more. Did our God create them to?
