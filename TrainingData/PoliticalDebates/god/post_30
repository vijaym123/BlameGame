Believers have faith.  The Bible is clear that faith is required.  However, these citations claiming to disprove The Bible are false.  Saying The Bible is wildly inaccurate a few hundred times and getting others to site the statement, doesn't make it true.There are plenty of archeological and historical correlations to stories presented in The Bible.
