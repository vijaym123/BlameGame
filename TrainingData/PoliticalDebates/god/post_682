CASE STUDY: Why it's impossible to have a meaningful debate about god with the indoctrinated.Sentence 1: "There are millions of people out there who are uneducated and I would say they are more likely to go to heaven than I am."Sentence 2: "This is purely an argument about God, regardless of what religion is brought in. Not religion, not religious texts, scriptures, rules etc.""This class is classic behaviour of those within a cult. They can in one sentence make a broad statement reflecting specifically their religious beliefs as stated as fact with absolutely no supporting evidence at all,then in the next sentence accuse the one being debated of doing what the cult member just did, whether the original argument in any way reflected the response.It is odd behaviour to any outside of that person's mind. But to that person, it is nearly impossible to see the hypocrisy, and frankly the silliness of the statement.
