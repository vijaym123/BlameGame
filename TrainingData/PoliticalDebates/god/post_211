It is how you look at it. Science can deal with creator in psyholigical sense. Why we (humans) created creator (deities) in the first place. Also any school of philosophy takes chances on idea of creator as such.However   science   may tell you some day in the future why there was big bang and what caused it. Like science told us that lighting is not an act of God and Earth is not the center of Universe. Scary thing to do is to do nothing in fields of science and teach our childrens scary stories about gnomes and so on.Even if we are in some kind of box and Creator is out of it - then he also can't interact with us. But anything what gets into the box can be in some way or another observed by us and by our scientists as well. It's simple.
