I was under the impression that Bhagavan Vishnu was a god in the religion Hinduism and I guess its been awhile since I last checked so is Hinduism no longer in India ?Second ever read the epic of Gilgamesh? Utnapishtim ( I definitely don't remember how to spell his name ) tells Gilgamesh a story of how he obtained eternal life through surviving a flood that killed all men across the earth except for those that had been on the boat which I believe were his family and some animals ... that is a poem from Mesopotamia which I believe held the worlds first civilization, the Sumerians. The Epic of Gilgamesh was written between 2750 BC and 2500 BC ( or BCE which ever you prefer ). Their is also "The Five Worlds adn Their Suns" mentions the gods punishing the people with a flood and do not tell me that the Aztecs copied off of the Sumerians.I do believe that the points you stated regarding my 2nd paragraph were undebatable. Cheers
