Do you understand the meaning of greater good? It's basically that the end justifies the means. If people were to behave better under a lie (IF God is a lie) then wouldn't it be better to promote that lie? THAT is the greater good.I'm sorry, but just because you're right doesn't mean people will automatically follow you. World doesn't work like that.
