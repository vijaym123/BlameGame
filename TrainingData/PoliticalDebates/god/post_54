I find it interesting that today quantum physicist are searching for the first cause, the god particle, and dark matter.God revealed to Moses thousands of years ago, "I am who am"  In effect I am what is, the ultimate cause, and it is by faith that we understand this, and faith alone.  We will never figure out the ultimate cause until it is revealed to us in heaven.God has chosen us and the only question that remains is, Will we choose him?  Sadly most won't!
