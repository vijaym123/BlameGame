I believe in God, there must be a God of some sort because really, you have to look at other theories. Evolution- if evolution really existed, dont you think you would see half monkies and half man walking around. Or half man half donkey since evolution wouldnt just stop when it reached homosapien. And the big bang theory, really, how does this make sense?
