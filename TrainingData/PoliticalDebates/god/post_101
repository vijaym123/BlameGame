This one is going to be long. First off. If there was a   god   who created everything, how would you...Prove he exists?Prove that he DOSEN'T exist. Prove that he pointed at the ground and said "I want a cat there" and there came a cat.Prove that he didn't make a couple of bacteria and work his way up from there. Bad things happen because god made a world of order. It may look like chaos but it is an order. And for order to work some things have to happen every once in a while. If you have a large body pulling in on its self your going to have friction. That friction makes heat which melts rock. This rock makes a molten core which causes convection currents which makes; earth quakes, tsunamis and volcanoes. Does the occurrence of these things prove or disprove god? It does neither. Some people live in   poverty  , some suffer and live in pain and death. Does this mean that there is no god, or that if there is that he doesn't care? The   bible   says that he gave man free agency. If he were to pop down here and say hello to all of us, and help us out of our miseries what would happen to our agency? If he jumped in and made a   murder   stop, wouldn't he have just over ridden that murder's agency?If you wanted to know how people to make certain decisions, would you let them know that your there and watching, or would you keep your presence unknown?Where in the bible does it say that god condemns people to hell? What I read is that people condemn themselves, by not ever going back to god in the first place. As in "I don't belong there, might as well not try" not go back. Why is there evil if there is a god? Why is there down if there is an up?eh, I'll post more latter. Its like 3 am here.
