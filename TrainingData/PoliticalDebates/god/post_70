Yes, that is what I label myself. I am a fairly devout Christian (Episcopalian) that attends church regularly and prays often. However, I cannot, and nobody can, say with 100% certainty that there does exist a God/Gods, thus I do have what you would call a little bit of doubt as well. We all do, we're being dishonest with ourselves if we say we don't. Here's what I DO NOT believe: earth is 6,000 years old. I don't see how ANYONE can believe that nonsense. The watchmaker argument. Pretty much anything put out by CSE and that tax-evading conman Kent Hovind is to be disregarded as utter bogus.
