In my point of view it is. yes we may not see God but i dont think life was just an accident, I view life as a test that we either fail or win. The consequence of failing the test, breaking the rules or just trying to cheat our way out is eternity in hell. The treasure of suffering, going through stumbles and believing without seeing but by living by faith results in eternal life in heaven, by trustong God when things seem unreasonable or like a joke we show God just how much we really want to get to be with him by paying the price which is being viewed as a weirdo and being disliked by others for his cause
