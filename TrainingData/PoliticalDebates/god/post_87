And why, precisely, it is on the person proposing the   existence   of an object. If you propose a pink elephant is floating above my head, it doesn't mean that you must therefore prove it. I can live my life as if there is a floating invisible pink elephant, or I can live my life as if there is no elephant. If you believe all believers in any deities require a change of behavior from the world, then you are mistaken.You originally defined athiest as "the denial that supernatural beings exist" and went on to posit that since most individuals profess to one single   religion   and deny all others, they are already atheists. This is inconsistent with your definition. Despite my disbelief in Zeus, or more accurately, my unwillingness to change my behavior to reflect the validity of the assumption that Zeus exists, I still may believe in other deities. Also, you're assuming that every   religious   person approaches their own belief with a lack of skepticism, uncritically and wholly. This is simply untrue. Look over this site and you'll see examples of people examining the ideas of   faith  , but still remaining faithful. From your last post, with the fear of eternal punishment reference, I believe you may have confused "Theist" with "Christian". Please do not equate "Belief in a God" with "Belief in Hell".
