I appreciate you posting the link. I looked through it, but honestly the site is kind of difficult to find the answers to my questions on. Not that I doubt that they're there, I just couldn't find them.In general the questions I asked were just to prove that the creator of the argument had a simplistic view of the world. I don't really care about a person's personal beliefs, but his argument was just hilariously flawed.I will point out one thing funny I saw on the site, just because I can't help myself.Is it okay to think and talk about issues that aren't taught in church? Find out what your LDS Guide, the scriptures, and Church Leaders have to say.I'm sure it's well intentioned, but I just found it a hilarious statement on religion. No offense intended.
