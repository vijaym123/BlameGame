Then that doesn't answer any questions. Why was life put on Earth? Why does Earth even exist? Wouldn't it make sense to believe in God: He put life on Earth, either directly or indirectly(I'm not getting into that), so that we could live life in order to return to Him. Life is like a trial period. God wants to know how we can act with free will, sin, and detachment from pure good.
