Naaah... this downward spiral has nothing to do with religion imo. It's through what I've seen, done, heard of etc. that I believe this, whether religion was there or not. I think religion plays a big factor in it, but it's not a religious thing for me.Science has no morals. Moral is based on judgment, opinion etc. It's not a religious thing either, but right and wrong is not science. Science is simply an explanation of things.You commit suicideScience says you are dead. Morals say it's wrong (or in certain culture it's right).Science can't judge whether dying is good or bad. It can only state what happens. Morals are judgments.It's kind of silly to say religious people do not base their morality on evidence..lol. You hear them all the time arguing, debating continuously using evidence to prove their righteousness. Both sides rely on evidence... and if you think otherwise, you're deluding yourself.
