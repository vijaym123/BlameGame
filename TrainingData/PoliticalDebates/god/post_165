Each must search this answer on their own.  That is the nature of faith, and the evidence of the truth that is given to seekers.  I wish with all my heart that I could give you my faith- but each must find that on their own.  Many can testify of the existence of God.  But I understand your questions about the variety of belief systems and the confusion over whether or not God can be known.  I have to say that personally (I believed at one time that there was truth in all religions), I never knew God until I got saved and met Jesus Christ.  I knew He existed- I just didn't know Him.  In your search, you might find it helpful to ask those of the various religions you know about their relationship with God, and ask them to describe how well they know God.  I believe you will find that your Christian friends have deep and personal interactions with their creator, while others follow human leaders and a bunch of rules in the hopes of someday coming close to God.  God bless you
