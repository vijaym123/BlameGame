 There is no proof for the existance of God.  / And you cannot prove a negative.  /> And given that the burden of proof lies with the person claiming something, we shouldn't have to prove anything.  /> Logical reason is:  /> Person 1: "I have a baseball"  /> Person 2: "Prove it"  /> Person 1 pulls out a baseball and thus proves himself.  /> Person 2: "Awesome, let's go play catch"  />   /> Religious reason  /> Person 1: "I have a baseball"  /> Person 2: "Prove it"  /> Person 1: "You can't prove I don't"  /> Person 2 walks away because that argument is nowhere near substantial.  /> It's as substantial as eating a seed.  /> A single seed.  /> Neither are substanital.
