This reasoning is even worse as some of the most extreme creationists - they do give at least one single reason (God said it). This post contains only statements.One bold claim for each shameful recommendation:Bold claim 1: "Most religious adults, particularly those in developed nations(A), reject the simple storybook god(B), just as atheists do(C), or preserve only parts(D) of it in their personal theologies."(So many claims in one sentence, at least all four A-D would be very hard to prove.)Bold claim 2: "believers don’t start out as theologians"(One counter example suffices, and I will have one.)
