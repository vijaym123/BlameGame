This question is a definite No-Brainer!Early in Man's existence, those people seeking power over their fellows, set up as Medicine-Men - Witch-Doctors - Soothsayers & Sorcerers etc, all claiming to have insights & contact with a 'Power' - of sorts. Little effort would be required due to the ignorance & fears of the unknown which must have prevailed at that time.Over millennia, via many devious pious paths, evolution has now landed us with their modern equivalents - Archbishops - Ayatollahs - Imams - Rabbis - Popes plus a host of other hypocritical sect leaders, incessantly brainwashing the largely unthinking masses with their ridiculous 'Holy' beliefs.Fouling up our minds with a rag-bag of archaic religiose twaddle doesn't help at all to further our understanding of this truly awesome Quantum / Astronomical Universe.The need to consult Biblical, Koranic, or any other crap-laden fairy-tales in order to pursue a decent & considerate existence beggars belief! As with everything, ethics evolve quite naturally.Everyone is infected with an imaginative 'Spiritual' tendency, sentimentally induced, that is 'merely' the natural wonderment of our existence & surroundings.The Human mind is fundamentally prone to the generation of illusions. Elemental reasoning must be applied to give all 'fantasial' thoughts a TRUE perspective!More common sense via attached link.
