weedonald - you said: "A supreme Being is totally perfect therefore cannot be measured, defined or even " sampled" as per the scientific method,but if we could..."Isn't your assumption based, in part, on the subjective concept of perfection? By removing God from man's capability to define god you can not both say God exists and God does not exist. In essence, you've defined what you state can not be defined by creating a definition."God, if he or she exists, is above dimensional space and time..." - Again, this creates the same loop as above but this time resting on the assumption that extra-dimensional space and time exist to support the position that God exists."We cannot , by definition ever understand or know The First Cause (God) because we are only capable of anthropomorphizing any Creator or Force that is metaphysically beyond us." - I'll defer to my prior arguments and note that this point is what paradoxically refutes your own arguments.
