 Which came first, the chicken or the egg? If you say egg, how do you get an egg without a chicken? If you say chicken, how do you get a chicken without an egg? The obvious is that the chicken came first, created by spiritual being we call God. This is the only logical way to explain the existence of the chicken or for any other thing on earth or in the heavens. If you say evolution, why aren't there chickens still popping up out of thin air without an egg? Again the only logical conclusion is that there is a creator.
