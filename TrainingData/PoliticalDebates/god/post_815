It's called Paschal's Wager. Let's say you live a religious/moral life, then there are four results:1. You believe in God. He exists. You get to go to Heaven!2. You believe in God. He doesn't exist. Nothing happens(rot in ground).3. You don't believe in God. He doesn't exist. Nothing happens(rot in ground).4.You don't believe in God. He does exist. You go to Hell. Eternal suffering! Yeah!Therefore, wouldn't your odds on the afterlife be better if you DO believe in God?
