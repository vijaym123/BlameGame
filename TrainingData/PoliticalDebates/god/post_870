 Everything in our world is made up if you think about it, who thought of the different languages, the alphabet, yes each word is derived from different roots but where did it all come from everything we know is based on definitions that we were taught as a child. This includes religion, it is a made up story that someone thought up a long time ago before the theory of the big bang or the theory of evolution to explain why we are all here, they did so because most people in earlier  times were simple minded and could not  understand the scientific terms for why we all exist. Assuming we exist regardless of our lack of understanding, everything in our world is flawed, man 's ultimate flaw is how naive he is to the environment in which he was placed. To be honest there is no way to prove that god exists, but someone once told me that life is much easier to live if you have faith in some thing much bigger than your own existence. God only exists because people believe in him. Other than that there is no solid proof, i personally don't see the evidence of his existence anywhere, but there has to be something else out there to explain the strange fate we are all on the path to meet. I believe that if there is a god he is cruel , that he placed such a flawed creature in this environment to, watch it react purely for his own entertainment. Man is ignorant, therefor man is his own downfall.
