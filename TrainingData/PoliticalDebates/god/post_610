Also, you do err in your inference that I implied you believe in God.Oh yeah...A lot of bs...Your debate is nothing more than the illustration of demagoguery without the use of the word demagoguery while at the same time a debate about whether or not a demagogue should use the word God .Finally, we have a winner!.. Kinda. You're right. (although I never knew the word demagoguery) Right so you DO know what my debate is about, but I don't know you're position.So it's kinda useless to argue when you don't have a position.
