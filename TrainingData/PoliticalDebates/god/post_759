I don't know if life is created from some god or if I'm just a random spawn of the universe, but life is a gift either way. The only meaning life has is the meaning you give it. Before you die, accomplish that meaning. We're born, we live, we die. The beginning and the end don't matter. It's the middle that makes life beautiful.
