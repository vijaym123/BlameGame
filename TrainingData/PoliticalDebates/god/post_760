Let's play your game, shall we...&gt;So here's the situation:-&gt;You live a life of:--&gt; sex--&gt; drugs--&gt; partyingAlright...-&gt; You continue to live without GodAlright...-&gt; You die.Ok.-&gt; Now what?According to observation, the body decomposes.You rot in the ground?It depends on where you put the body, I guess, or where you die. Most people don't die in the ground. What do you have to live for then?Nothing, you just made me assume that I'm dead. Part of living for something is being alive. Dead things aren't alive, it's part of it's definition. What would be the meaning of life for you?Dead things cannot know the meaning of anything, because they are not conscious. The question wouldn't be applicable to me either though, because you address me as "you", which is the way you would address a conscious being that is aware of itself as a component of it's environment. In fact, it's odd but you've been calling "you" since my death as though I was still alive, even though you were the one that claimed I was dead.Is it our fault that you assume a dead body possesses the capability to answer questions?;PIn all seriousness though, you're asking the wrong questions. When you come to a middle ground for discussion you should be ready enough to know that there are answers that are unlike your own. This isn't a place for you to preach to everyone.
