-between giggles-okay, ignoring nearly every sentence you wrote is wrong,dumb,misrpresentation,or some hilarious combination of those things, I want to focus on the funniest presumption I've ever come across (and I read nearly all of Joe's posts, at least he's funny on purpose)"Jesus is great, but He's not God" (an illogical argument)Please, please explain to me in logical terms, why it's illogical to think that Jesus is great, but not god. Is it because one can only be great if they are god? So like you couldn't say George Washington was great?lol, I really don't understand why that statement would be "illogical."And I would absolutely love to hear an explanation. I'm quivering with anticipation of a "logic" arguement from you.I'm going to dim the lights, and pop some corn in anticipation of your answer.
