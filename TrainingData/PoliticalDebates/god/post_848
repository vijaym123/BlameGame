#originalTopic=God_Does_Not_Exist
 When I was a child I believed, because I followed after my parents' example.  When I grew up and began asking questions...I began to realize there are no answers...at least no sufficient answers.  I certainly do not disrespect anybody who does believe; that is their privilege just as it is mine not to believe.    />   /> My biggest problem believing in an all loving, all knowing god whom supposedly created us in his own image, is that he allows such evil, sickness, wars, etc to go on.  That if he is all knowing, then why did he give us free will because he had to know we'd screw that up.  And how did the earth populate so well from Noah and the humans he had with him on the ark?  Things don't add up...The bible is far to vague and can be interrupted by many angels...clever men, who wrote the bible...and yes, it was written by men...and a rather successful book...top seller..made god a lot of money...or made and makes somebody a lot of money.  I wonder if god has the copyright on it????  />   /> I figured I'd just go ahead and jump in the deep end with one of my first debates...Am looking for a friend who suggested this site...and I know I will find him here...hopefully he will read this and make himself known to me...BS you around here somewhere?
