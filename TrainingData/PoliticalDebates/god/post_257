 jdefriez, yes indeed, science is provisional- our best knowledge now, ever subject to revision. Theists cannot say that God violates those laws, as you say, we discover more. You use the petitio to assume that there is this God who made those laws! We naturalists ever disprove God but the burden is upon theists to reveal Him. We do have naturalist arguments against Him - the problem of Heaven, the hiddennes problem, the atelic challenge, the presumption of naturalism and the ignostic-Ockham.   The law of the conservation of mass-energy, as I show elsewhere in these pages, reflects eternal Existence in the form of quantum fluctuations, whence matter-energy as David Mills exhibits in 'Atheist Universe."  William Sahakian would claim that we atheists commit the fallacy of multiple questions in askig  : what caused this First Cause and what designed the Designer but rather it theists who beg the question and special plead to exempt Him from those two questions!That bane!
