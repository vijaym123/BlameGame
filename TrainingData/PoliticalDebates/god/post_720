The reasons we should give for guiding our morality should have a real foundation. You didnt answer WHY you are against zoophilia, why it is harmful to engage in such behavior... is it because god's word should be followed blindly? just "because"? I'm against following for the sake of following, and against giving people rules without proof of why those rules are good for them. I am not an advocate of zoophilia. But I accept that I have no reason, other than my personal OPINION that it is disgusting, to make a moral judgement and condemn it as "wrong". So, again, if you say it is wrong... what is the reason behind it?? please convince me with something other than "god says so".
