i don't think there's a god because i think some people are scared of there being nothing when they die so they want 2 believe in something and kings and queens used gods 2 get there people on there side like the Egyptians i reckon they did it for their god but were really only doing it because thats what their pharaoh wanted. So the pharaoh says the gods have spoken and if they didn't do it they would go to hell and die over and over again and this would put fear in the peoples eyes, i also the reckon the bible is a fairy tale and just been taking out of proportion. People say there was a Santa Claus so children would be good so how can you trust anything that is said when there is no hardcore evidence.
