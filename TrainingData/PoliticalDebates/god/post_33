Truth is you can't prove it.  Ask any scientist.  Not saying it isn't a very good theory, I mean even gravity is just a theory, but it is still just a theory, not fact. Secondly, the existence of a diving being or beings does not require it to be a Christian   god  , or for the Bible to be anything more than a book.  Furthermore, more and more scientists are beginning to say that for the universe to have occured, there would have had to have been a cause for the Big Bang.  Also, while experiments have shown that in stimulations of Earth's early   conditions  , simple amino acids, the building blocks of life, will indeed form, statistics have demonstrated that the chances of these amino acids happening to line up in just the right way to form a protein are so small as to make it virtually impossible.  This isn't opinion, it is what has been shown in experiments and calculations by real scientists.  Intelligent Design is also a theory, not some mumbo jumbo.  It is not an invented explaination, and it does have evidence.
