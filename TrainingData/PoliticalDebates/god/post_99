Question: What created the matter and   energy   necessary to create the universe. Basic Fact: "Every cell in plants,   animals  , and human beings has what is called a "complex metabolic motor". This is the ability of the cell to extract energy from its   environment   in order to supply energy for the reproduction of the cell and other cell needs. For life to exist, you must have this metabolic motor. But this metabolic motor can only be produced by life." (Dr. Ron Carlson) It's the same for DNA. So...if you believe in Spontaneous Generation aren't you going against the basic rule of biology (Biogenesis - life only arises from life. It does not come from nonliving matter) Or is nitrogen, ammonia, salts, and   carbon dioxide   living matter?
