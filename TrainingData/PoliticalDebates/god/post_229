You are seriously misinformed about the nature of scientific knowledge.Yes, our understanding of physics is constantly being refined. However, there are some basic concepts that have been confirmed over and over again and are not in doubt. Yes, occasionally we find a special case in which an old rule seems not to apply, but that leads us to the discovery of new, broader rules, which can be simplified in each special case to the old ones. We have wholly rejected some very old theories, most of which were formulated before the idea of the scientific method was popular. (As a "scientist" Aristotle claimed that objects fall because they want to, and that projectiles move forward because that is in their nature.) However, by and large we are building upon old knowledge rather than scrapping it entirely.One of the concepts which we come to, time and time again, in all different areas of physics, is the concept of symmetry and conservation. There are several fundamental quantities (or related pairs quantities, like energy and mass, or space and time) that follow invariance rules. Conservation of mass and energy is a very basic, foundational principle, and one which is not at all in doubt among scientists.
