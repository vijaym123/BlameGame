Molecules do not randomly fit together- they have a certain shape that predisposes them to fitting to some but not others - then they build up bigger forms that un-randomly fit to other molecule clusters and so on. The randomness is only if and when they will coma against forms that fit. Most of the time they bump into molecules that dont fit.
