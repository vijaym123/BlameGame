hi i really appreciate your view ,i m a hindu and like u say the christ calls u i do experience some things which we do not notice and when we realize we tend to fall suspicious or name it as coincidence or something likethat.but hey there has to be something superior which created life and he calls to understand him.we completely lost in ignorance and worldly belongings like parents ,money,wife and children get worse to understand this creator free himself from all bondages and lying very within us
