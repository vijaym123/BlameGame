Ahh ok. When it comes to sexual acts.. its a lot harder to argue with because you can't really explain why it's bad. Same as homosexuality.. it's hard to explain why it's bad. All I know in my heart is that it's wrong. You're asking me why... I don't know why.. I do know that it's wrong though.. and it goes hand in hand with this 'downward spiral' in todays society. 1 thing though, I don't do anything because God says so. I agree with Him... not follow Him blindly.Thing about right and wrong - There is no proof to it. That is one thing I can garauntee you 100%. It's purely opinion or one's own thoughts. Science has no morals. Nor has facts. Morals, right and wrong does not go hand in hand with numbers, statistics and tests. Morality is outside of explanations through science. Sometimes you do things for the sake of doing. You don't question everything. Some things you can question... and still do it, some things you question and don't do it, but questioning everything is just as bad as not questioning everything.
