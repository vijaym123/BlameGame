Well said, Da Wolfman you got it all there.I also come to believe that we have our own reason why we are living on this earth and that God really exist. I believe in his Salvation, His love, and I have a strong faith in Him. As a blind man, who strongly believes that color blue really exist I have strong belief of Him.
