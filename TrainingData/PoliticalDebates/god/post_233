   Had the law been violated, then one might invoke Him but then one would still be saying fatuity as He is so incoherent as His properties so contradict each other as we ignostics so loudly proclaim. The law is perpetual: the present is key to the past.   One should always look for natural causes and explanations as that is our experience that makes for the presumption of naturalism. They are despite      Leibniz the sufficient reason.   Ex nihilo is fatuous as it is contrary to experience and to posit  nothingness is to posit nothing whatsoevr as knowledge. See Peter A.Angeles "The Problem of God: a Short Introduction."      The occult adds nothing to knowledge! As atheologian Keith Parsons notes , it merely invokes the fig leaf of ignarnce.
