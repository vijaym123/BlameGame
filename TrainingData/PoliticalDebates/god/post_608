this would be far more helpful if you said what exactly you were refering to in your responses, butI was using Christianity as an example of a religion in response to you mentioning how laws are always chaning.You brought religion into it when you used how laws change as an example of how it would be better to have the "word of god" because it does not change.And this is the second time in this debate that you first brought up religion, then when a response was made to your introduction to it, you say "this isn't about religion, this is about god."At any rate. This is just dumb, because the only people espousing the existance of a god are of one religion or another, and there is no religion that does not change, just as laws change, so my point is incredibly valid, regardless of which religion's version of the "word of god" I use as an example.At the end of the day, it's just people.And yeah, I think people who think they hear the word of god are usually schizos of con-artists, because he's not real, therefore they're hearing voices or just making stuff up.
