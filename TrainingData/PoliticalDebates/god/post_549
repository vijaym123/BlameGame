Man this was awhile ago.Well I would call it faith, I have been raised with an open bible in front of me. Why should I believe otherwise? I like the whole idea of it also. Sounds great to me and hundreds of millions of others. Why do so many believe it? Since they either A so it as a way to lose themselves of their problems B sounded good C beaten into the brains of children till they believed it or D AOFB. To me everything sounds good I do not have doubts I like to believe my grandma is watching over me every day may she rest in peace.
