The major question is why is this even a question? It because if there is a God,   faith   must have a purpose that nothing else could accomplish--and indeed it does. Faith is the ultimate value upon which all relationships prosper or fail. I have faith in my bank that they can be trusted with my   money  ; and they trust me with a check book. Our relationship continues on the basis of that mutual trust. That trust is it own reward. If we want God's benefits, it's only consistent with all other things in life that he should ask us to accept him by faith. He has offered himself as the reward of the one who will seek to know him by faith. It's a fair deal, and a very good one. No one is forced in. And he isn't trying to fill heaven by coercion. It's for the willing.Lately, the thing which has me awestruck is God's love of paradox (apparent contradictions that seem impossible, yet with a change of viewpoint, they resolve). The resurrection accounts (Mt. 28, Mk. 16, Lk. 24, Jn. 20,21, Acts 1:1-12, and 1 Cor. 15:3-8 appear contradictory when merely compared side-by-side, but when the events described by each of the five writers are broken into pieces they can all be brought together to form one complete story, without contradiction. Who but God could conceive such a grand puzzle? Find out more at   www.easteranswer.com
