What is the basis of scientific "proof" ? Experiments that produce the same results tested by various people right? If you give   religion   the same benefit of proving itself by this way then there are millions upon millions of people who experience   god   and therefore have proven his   existence  . Now many people experience him in a different way but we have to, I think, chalk it up a lot to culture and ideas about what he is. Some people are actually incapable of experiencing god because they lack the prerequisites usually sucked out of them by a lifetime of incredulity. Or in some cases never there in the first place. I'd like to give an example. My mathematics professor was once asked by a colleague how he could believe in god and still be such a logical person. His reply was more or less along these lines, "I'd explain it to you but you couldn't understand in the time we have." "Why not?" "Could we pull someone off the street and explain to them complex number theory until they understood it as well as we do? Of course not, they need a basis to start from." Besides,   science   lives off of   faith   I wouldn't start to decry it. Has anyone seen a quark? What is a quark made of? There's my two cents.
