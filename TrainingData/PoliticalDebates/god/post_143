All our children each have 50% of our genes (and that is not blue genes for you morons).Add to that that they grow up initially in our environment.And voila! We can see al lot of ourselves (and our spouses) in our children.Stop wasting your time studying bibles and other "so called" holy books.The truth is in biology, not religion.
