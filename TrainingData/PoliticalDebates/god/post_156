The absence of proof does not prove absence.  The absence of proof does not prove presence, either.  The absence of proof does not provide reason to consider God even possible.  After 10,000 years of belief. there is not even a decent collection of evidence, let alone proof, one must conclude that such an entity is misconceived.  The pervasive Judeo-Christian-islamic God should have been clearly proven long ago.Is there something "bigger" than us, something which is everywhere at the same time, something which contains all the knowledge there is?  Nature, which we do perceive, certainly qualifies.  Conceiving of God as a conscious being is a wrong way of conceiving of answers to the questions above.  That's why there's such a long-standing absence of proof.So, we can validly say, There is no such thing as God, as described by those who claim to think so.
