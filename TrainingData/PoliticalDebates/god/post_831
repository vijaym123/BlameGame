No, for very simple reasons.There is no requirement for the intervention of a God to live a healthy lifestyle. We're capable of making our own decisions without knowing where life comes from, when and how the universe began, etc. And religions like Christianity attempt to reach into the realms of the unknown and not only fill this gap with definite answers, but it tells you not to do this or that and creates antagonistic behavior towards people like homosexuals, sexually active people, and people who drink or smoke pot. In other words, victimless crimes. Then it takes credit for basically the entire universe and people's natural tendency to grow and prosper. I don't see the benefit of following a cult that claims to know the intentions of an almighty creator.The atheistic countries of Europe have already worked this out amongst themselves. It took centuries of religious persecution and violence to create countries with the foremost standards of living, without religion. I live without it too, I don't hurt anybody, I help out, and any culture knows that the best way to approach life is to live happy and help others live happy. No commandments required.
