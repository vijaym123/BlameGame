Here we have 2 option to believe or not to believe and both can't be proven to 100%.____________________________________________________________ In case 1: God Don't Exist...You can ask then who created god...u ask for evidences some even ask for photographs...but that doesn't prove god dont exist... science say that world came to existence thru bigbang and life through evolution(disputed theory). but for the bigbang the first mass was neccessary and for evolution the first environment that initiated it. For a big bang also a first initiation was required...as science say nothing starts without something starting it or nor do it stop until some one stops it._________________________________________________ Case 2: God Exist: Claims that nothing can be created by its own, and rather than believing that things was came to existence by its own its logical to believe god exist... Because if a friend visited my home and see my new computer and ask me " Wow, where did u get that?" and if u i answer him..."oh that, ya i had some waste metals, plastic, silcon board etc in my garage and it gradually in years evolved into a PC that works" what will be the response? BULLSHIT right?!! Its greater bullshit say that man with complex anatomy and high grade intelligence came into existence by chance and probability. Its just and escape from the real scene.... "Let us give chance the unbelievable number of attempts of eight trillion tries per second in each set! At this speed on average it would take l0 raise-to 147 years to obtain just one stable gene."u call this science??!So when both the side are in shadows it logical to go by that make a little sense.____________________________________And many of the Holy Books prediction has come true!!!
