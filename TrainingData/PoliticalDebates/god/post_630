The problem with pascal's wager is that it doesn't say which god you should believe in - using pascal's logic you should probably just find out which god is the most jealous of belief in other gods, has the best reward and worst punishment. So if the flying speghetti monster promises worse than weeping and gnashing of teeth, then you should believe in it rather than YWYH.
