We could blog here all night and all day for years on end and it comes down to this simple conclusion:Atheists believe God does not exist, they are putting their money down on no eternal life. Their payoff they believe is humans living in reality while alive for their short time here on Earth. Here is their problem, what if God does exist? They have basically doomed themselves, its their payoff they have been afforded all the information of Christ and have decided that it is mere folly.Christians on the other hand have taken the 50/50 bet. If God doesn't exist they have lived in a fairy tale land for the last 25-50 to 75 years. But given their religions good precepts they have at the least lived a decent and kind life. But then comes the payoff, He does exist, they reap the rewards of their faith and achieve eternal life.I'll take the later. There are no lasting payoffs for Atheism. I'd rather not pay a huge price for the honor of science and theories. What if the atheists theories are nothing really more then explaining God? Isn't that what the weatherman on TV does every night. Everything explained by Scientists could be nothing more then a play-by-play of God. Simply put scientists are nothing more then the Vin Scully's of their field
