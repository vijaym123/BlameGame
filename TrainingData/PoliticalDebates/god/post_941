 What "god"?  /   /> Prove one exists.  Come to the city where I live, let's go to a hospital and find someone dead, perhaps decapitated <i>(head cut off)</i> in a car accident.    />   /> If you can bring the dead guy back to life, I'll believe.  />   /> If you can't bring the dead guy back, get your "god" to do it.  />   /> If you can't get your "god" to do it, then it doesn't exist.    />   /> You're the one who says it's possible, so you have to prove it.  />   /> <b>Edit:</b>  />   /> Hey, Mabak: Prove you're not a pedophile.  />   /> What's that?  You say you don't have to disprove it, just as you say "god" doesn't have to prove itself?  />   /> Okay, that must mean you are a pedophile.  />   /> --  />   /> Now do you see how stupid your argument is?  All propositions are false until proven true, including your mythical "god".    />   /> You're free to believe it all you want, but nobody has ever proven it.  You're just a believer in regurgitated fairy tales, not a viewer of first hand experience.  />   />
