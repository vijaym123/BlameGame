Ya know, it's psychotic attitudes like that which only goes to prove you homos are violent lunatics! And for the record, I've been persecuted and abused all my life by fags - just for being Christian. I remember when I was just 16 year old, a fag-lovin liberal Judge put me in prison for ATTACKED at a Gay Pride Parade. Hey, it was only blanks, and you'd think they'd see the funny side, but he was REAL mean about it. He even included 3 prior assault charges, an tried to say it was some sort of hate crime. He called me all sorts of hateful words, and my two boys were crying all thro' the trial. It was shocking! My whole family were in tears, but my daddy said he was real proud of me for showing those fags what for. I served 2 years for that, and had to be apart from my two sons all that time, and it hurt real bad. It still pains me that I missed so much of their childhood. Now that's TRUE persucution! You fags wouldnt know what persecution was if it walked up, and smashed a brick into ur teeth. I was persecuted because of my faith. Because i'm a Christian. Christians are always a target from God-haters. But we have to stay strong, because we can't let our Lord down and give into all this fag-rights nonsense. God said in the Bible exactly what rights fags have - NONE WHATSOEVER! I still pray everyday that our Laws get changed to the Laws of the Bible, so that we can smite all those who God wants smited, and stone all those God wants stoned. Praise!Until then my family will always suffer abuse from fags in the street, who know our names and follow us everywhere we go. They throw things at me and call me a psycho, and try to get me to violate my parole. Yes, we live in a small town, and Christians are always a target in that kind of enviroment from God-haters and lunatics. You talk about intolerance, well what you fags are doin to my family is intolerance, and you know it!
