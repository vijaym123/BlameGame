You can't convince a group to hate people who are different when you are different.  Hitler was evil, yes, but also intelligent.  Once he was in power and had the Germans firmly united behind him, he quickly phased out that pesky Christianity business.  If you accuse some one of being like Hitler based on his brief stint as a Christian, you can say make the comparison to just about anyone.  He was a man, for example, and a veteran, he was Austrian, and he even happened to be part Jewish.  Do you really want to say that all men, veterans, and anyone who is part Jewish are like Hitler?
