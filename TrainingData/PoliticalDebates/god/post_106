Your response shows exactly the type of limited exposure to research that I previously spoke of. I do not have enough time nor space to enumerate a list of published work here, but if you are interested in broadening your knowledge, then have a look at some of the peer reviewed works mentioned at     http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2640&program=CSC    %20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Science . On another point, making arbitrary assumptions about individuals in a mocking fashion on open forums such as this one is completely unnecessary and does not aid your credibility in any way. This site is about informed opinions, not people trying to be witty. I suggest reading through those articles in the link I provided and then forming an objective opinion of intelligent design instead of mistakenly referring to it as "Wishful thinking" and implying that it is not credible research.
