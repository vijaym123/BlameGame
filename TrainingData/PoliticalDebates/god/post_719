A religion cannot be cultish.. because they're both different things.The fact that you argued for zoophilia shows that this has gone beyond point. You're telling me that I can go up to somebody and kill them. He's dead so I don't hear him complaining... so it is ok. Kids should be slitting their own risks. Even even they cause permanant damage, it's ok because they're only doing it to themslves. We should take drugs, because we're doing it ourselves. I'm glad you think that way.By saying alcohol is bad you ARE agreeing with 'God's word'. God says 'alcohol is bad', you say 'Yes, it is bad'... you are agreeing with God. Maybe for different reasons... but the conclusion is the same.I just want to know now if you are against zoophilia, yes or no. If you are not against it for the reasons that people should be able to do what they want with themselves... then I really do not want to continue debating.
