science can attempt to evaluate whether there seems to be a why, and i think it could make at least a significant case that there isn't. Christians, Muslims, and Jews all believe in the God of Abraham, yet all have different stories, different traditions and different morals. there were 1000's of gods before that one which we now believe do not exist. at a time with very little understanding of the earth's place in the universe, we created stories that tried to describe how and why we are here. as science described the how, god became smaller and smaller, but our desire for purpose and science's inability to disprove our desire, we have left to god the reasoning rather than throwing out the immaterial god with the material one.
