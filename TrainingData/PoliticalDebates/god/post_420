Just a flaw with your initial argument. "Suppose they are. That is, suppose there is no Uncaused Being, no God. Then nothing could exist right now. For remember, on the no-God hypothesis, all things need a present cause outside of themselves in order to exist."That's assuming time has a finite beginning. If you believe that God is and always was, and considering that we don't see time having an end, then why does time (an infinite dimension, therefore) have to have a beginning?
