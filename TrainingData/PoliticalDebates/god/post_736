hmmm.........People will have differences, but what about religions that not only accept other people's beliefs or lack of them?I do not think it's right to accept people for what they are... or SOME people anyway. When it comes to race, nationality, eye colour, hair colour, religions (not cults) etc. people should and do live side by side. Some issues are contreversal i.e. sexuality, cross-gender, physical enhancements etc. which I think should be eliminated.I ain't not hitler dude, lol. I don't have a problem with differences and in touch with points made earlier the religions I am in favour of have always been very tolerant to certain issues, so wouldn't it be better for not just an extremely tolerant religion, but broad, flexible and continuously evolving religion?
