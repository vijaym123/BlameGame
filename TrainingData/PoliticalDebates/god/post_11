I suspect there is a "God" or a first cause we have named God. However, human explanations that come in dogmatic presentations from organized religions can never be proven nor dis proven. As the above article states, "GOD creates everything, there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR." Yet we have a Bible, a Koran, and countless others all claiming to be the revealed word of God....can they all be correct? When humans do find out which explanation is the real and true one let us all hope it is similar to the Janis explanation, since they seem to have the more benevolent view of this entity we have named God.
