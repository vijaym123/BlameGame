You say we are ignorant, but I think it is you. There is no evidence of   god   for us to be ignorant of. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that leads us to question his/her/it's existence. You should go to school, read a few books, and start questioning life and your belief system. There's no reason to feel sorry for those of us who's minds are free from the shackles of blind faith and ignorance.
