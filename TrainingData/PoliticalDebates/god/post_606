God's Words will always be right till the end of time. We just don't see it, but in the end we will see it. So we can be here right now running around trying to make it all right, or we can follow Gods advice and we'll get there in the end.lol, alright, that's really funny. 1. If what the religious think god wants is always changing, and so are always changing how they act (don't eat pork, okay eat pork, have hookers, okay now be celibate, stone people to death, okay turn the other cheek)lol, then how is that any different than how laws change Kinda?It's no different I'm very afraid.I mean, you say his word never changes, we just don't always get it. But you do see that there is no way for you to know that don't you? Whatever, it's really lame. If no one knows what god is really saying, then it's just as likely he doesn't exist.Jeez, I hate debating the religious.The fact is, even if that god does exist, it's a ridiculous way to run things. I'll stick to laws, they're based on living people we see and who feel, live, and die, not some dude no one has ever seen and random people (who are usually schizos or con-artists) say said to do this or that.2. And listen, I have read the silly bible probably a dozen times growing up, I was raised Ultra super religious, church 6 days a week, I took 18 credits in religious studies at a very good University, I dated a Baptist preachers daughter all through high school and not only had to sit through the lame sermons, but had to discuss the meanings for hours and hours and hours.There's nothing about the Christian religion I care to learn, that I probably don't already know, unless it's from a historical or anthropological point of view. And if it's from one of those points of view, I probably already know it.
