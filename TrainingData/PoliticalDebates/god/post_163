It just isn't the case that you can't prove a negative. Impossibility proofs are common in mathematics. There are lots of them in Euclid.  A particular concept of God could indeed be proven self-contradictory and therefore impossible if only anybody were willing to adequately define a God concept. Formerly, philosophers and theologians were able to specify what the hell they were talking about; but god talk is now merely emotional blather and theologies can't even properly be said to be wrong. I make an exception for the God concept of sects like Jehovah's Witness that represent God as a big, powerful animal in the sky, That's goofy science fiction; but at least it makes sense; and the argument against negative arguments does hold in its favor. Maybe a giant bearded tyrant will turn up one of these days.
