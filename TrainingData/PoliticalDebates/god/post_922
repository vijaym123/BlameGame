 I believe that imagination is truth, meaning whatever YOU believe is true to YOU, nobody else. If YOU believe in God, then it is true to you and will always be, if you don't then that is still what YOU believe, never speak for anyone else and don't let anyone speak for you. This is religion, it's stupid to debate religion, because you are telling others what they should believe. I am not saying I believe in God, I am not saying that there is no God, I am just telling you what is what.
