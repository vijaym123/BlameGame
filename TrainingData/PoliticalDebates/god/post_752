If "it" is used properly it could either mean, life or believing in God.So there are two different questions here...&gt; Is life spent believing in God worth the belief in God?or&gt; Is life spent believing in God worth life?I'll stick with the latter... This is a value comparison essentially between a persons life, where they do believe, and a person's life where they don't believe.There is no way to qualitatively measure the worth of someone's life without factoring in happiness and suffering. Would the person with no belief in God suffer less than the person with faith? Would the person with no faith be happier, over all? I don't think the question can be answered. No matter which way you look at it, though, it's life, and there's nothing greater than life... Life with or without the belief in a god is still life. Anything beyond that is a value comparison with no way to evaluate each way of life, so if your argument lays claim to any idea of a life or life style's value it becomes about as valid as you see the belief in God.
