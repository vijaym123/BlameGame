 GOD does exist! If you pray for something and you don't get at all or right away, does that mean that God don't exist, No! It just means that maybe you are not supposed to receive it or not at the moment. It's like when you were little and you asked your parents for something and they said no or not yet maybe for Christmas, does that mean your parents aren't real, No!   />      K9, God can raise someone from the dead and has before, He has also healed people from all sorts of things. Believing is not seeing it is the evidence of things not seen! Pray and ask God to reveal Himself to you and see what happens!
