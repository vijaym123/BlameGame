By "Darwin's stuff" I'm assuming you mean evolution. That isn't "just a theory," it's a scientific theory. Please tell me you know the difference. Science doesn't make things up as it goes along, as religions do.And about the other holy texts, you are incorrect. I hope you choose to expand on what you know, but if not, that's yours to deal with. I'm not going to argue this any longer.
