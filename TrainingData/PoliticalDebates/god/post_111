You argue, as do many theists, that human ignorance about the development of life, the nature of life, or any other aspect of reality, constitutes proof that a god must to explain that which is otherwise unexplained.  This is the worst and most desperate kind of argument.  Just because something is unexplained does NOT mean that it is inexplicable.  It only means that it is NOT YET explained.  Human intellectual history is nothing if not a consistent set of evidence that, given time, ANYTHING is explicable by the power of the rational human mind.  Remember, the sun, moon, and the Nile river used to be considered gods because no other explanation was evident.  Those gods DIED when science explained them.  So it will be with the Judeo-Christian-Muslim god, as well as all others, when the light of human intellect exposes the shadows that your religions require in order to thrive.  For 5000 years the human mind has been narrowing the realm in which your gods can exist.  And every day that realm gets smaller.  Stop fighting it. Reject fear as the basis for fundamental beliefs, and join us to promote the light of reason and the grandeur of humanity.
