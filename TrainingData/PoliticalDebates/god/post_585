I've tried to make the point that without a real God there can be no good because of the grounding question. Apparently some people aren't familiar with this question. So I've included a link that explains it and demonstrates why there can be no good if there is not a real God. And please don't commit the genetic fallacy of dismissing the argument because it comes from a Christian source. If you disagree please do so on the merits of the argument, not the source.
