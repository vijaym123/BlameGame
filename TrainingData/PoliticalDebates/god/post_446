I affirm this, we forget the logical flaw of attributing somethings complexity to God. "Well, it looks really complicated, THEREFORE something beyond our realm of physics must have done it". It's a very vague premise that if something currently unexplainable happened that something beyond all explanation did it.Note also that words like "complicated" and "beautiful" are self-assessed and subjective. It's statistically a random chaotic mess, it's easier to gradually learn to like something then have the entire universe arranged specifically to our enjoyment.
