It doesn't answer any of your questions because you're asking different ones than myself. You keep asking why, as if there has be a reason and/or purpose for everything around us. I, on the other hand, always ask how rather than why.How was life put on Earth? How does Earth exist?All these questions are answerable, meaningful, and don't require a god. God has never made sense to me because it leaves me with far more questions than answers. Why do you assume that there has to be a succinct reason for us being here? I haven't ever experienced anything that suggests purpose to us being here. Maybe you have though, and maybe that's why you and I are interested in different questions.
