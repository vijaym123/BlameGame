For FAITH to exist GOD must exist...The human heart, as we all know, is despirately wicked & totally without a means of control, outside of fear from law & retribution from the law...Mankind would not make up an outside influence to dominate the human mind..FAITH brought to fruition ,yields un-human capabillities & anyone who is truthfull in the matter can see by this evidence, (that man would not go against himself to his own demise or subjection),in essence self-representation & self-preservation..True "faith" comes only from GOD by way of a change in a man's heart because of an outside force acting on that heart, heart being a person's inner makeup that has to manifest outwardly,that change..FAITH in GOD is the very evidence that GOD exists..IT goes against ALL human nature & behavior to submit to a higher authority..GOD is love,not a man-made mind control option, LOVE, being HIS character shown to mankind in CHRIST's manifestation..IT is this IMAGE from which mankind originally fell ..WE were created in GOD's IMAGE..NOT physically but in HIS CHARACTER image..Since the fall we must be restored to that IMAGE as this is neccessary for GOD to remain GOD..SATAN is trying his best to defeat GOD in this purpose in-order to discredit GOD in HIS eternal realm..YOU are either helping SATAN or helping GOD in this eternal struggle...Though GOD does not need your help, HE has appointed a purpose & portion for those who receive HIM & want to accept HIS IMAGE, "LOVE"..The anti-christ will force anyone else to worship his image,"SELF" in that day of decission..There will be NO escape from CHOICE that day & ALL fates will be sealed for eternity...IT is purposed that EVERY knee shall bow & EVERY tongue confess that CHRIST is LORD over ALL, through eternity..After all he created it all...
