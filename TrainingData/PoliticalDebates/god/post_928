 He is the light of the world.  / He is the king of kings.  /> He made everything.  /> He holds the world in his hand.  /> He is the hope when you have none.  /> He is the strength you never had.  /> He is the rock on which i stand.  /> He is the set of footprints beside me while i walk through life.  /> He is the set of footprints that are alone, because he carries me through the tough times.  /> He is the alpha and omega.  /> He is the beginning and the end.  /> He is the lord and savior.  /> He is your very best friend.  /> He will help you when times get hard.  /> He will be there when the tears start to fall.  /> He will help you back on your feet again.  /> He is the one true God.  /> He is my father.  /> He is your father.  />   /> Let him in.  /> Ask him into your heart.  /> Jesus died for you.  /> Excepting him is the way to start.  /> A new and holy life.  /> Amen.
