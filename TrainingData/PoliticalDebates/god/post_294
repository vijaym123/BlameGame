"I find it interesting your weak way of discrediting a reputable scientist, but say noting of Ruse who has said himself that Behe is a reputable scientist."Yet Michale Ruse himself is a philosopher, not a Scientist.  You also give no context for that statement."I suppose because you say it that it is true, then it is true."No, I say it 'is true' because the evidence strongly suggests that it is true.I find it rather interesting that you would name "Debating Design" then go on to talk about the flagellum... when one of the essays in Debating Design demonstrates how that flagellum is 'irreducibly complex'."Collins arguments are not philosophical they are mathematical and measurable. For example just one parameter: if gravity were stronger by only one part in a trillion trillion trillion the universe would have collapsed back on itself."Yes, but also not very accurate.  We do not know how variable gravity can be, it may be that there are only a few possible values for gravity to have.  Saying that because we exist gravity must have this value is not a reasonable statement... rather we exist because gravity has that value.
