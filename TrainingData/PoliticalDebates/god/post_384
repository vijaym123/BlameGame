If I was to say the invisible flying speghetti monster exists and created the god that you believe in - how would you prove that it doesn't.You might try finding the origination of that belief and discrediting it source, by finding inconsistencies within the beliefs, or inconsistencies with what they believed and our current knowledge.for example - if a religion believed:there was an earth with water and grass and trees and night and day - before there was a sun or moonGen 1:1-16that the sun and moon are in our atmosphereGen 1:8,14god created animals then man and woman in Gen 1:24-27 but also he created man first, then animals, then woman in Gen 2:18-22Sons of God (nephilim) had sex with the daughters of men and created giants Gen 6:2-4the omniscient, all powerful, all good creator god regretted creating everything and decided to kill all humans, plants, and air and land animals less than 1700 years after creation, but decides to let one 600 year old man build a football field sized boat and get all the animals and enough food for them to live more than a year at sea since there was enough water to cover the entire earth more than 22 ft higher than the tallest mountain Gen 6:6-7God told Noah to take a male and female of every animal Gen 6:19-20 and four verses later says to bring 7 pairs of every clean animal and 2 of animals that are not clean Gen 7:2all in the first seven (out of 50) chapters of Genesisif you were to read a book like this that was not called the bible - you would likely wonder what crazy stuff people were smoking in thise days
