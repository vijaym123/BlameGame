I think you will be hard-pressed to find a religion that is as tolerant and flexible as you say. Religions are built around infallible "gods", and therefore must stick to whatever they say at their conception in order to maintain validity. Religions cant change without contradicting their previous statements of infallibility. Look at how hard the Catholic Church fought to stop Galileo's ideas about celestial bodies, and how hard modern Christian organizations are fighting to teach creationism and dispute evolution. If they changed, the would go against everything they were told in their bibles.I didnt mean to offend you with my Hitler reference. I'm sure you're not a fascist or mass murderer, i just wanted to show where that argument can lead. My point is that change, and the ability to cope and embrace it, is almost always for the betterment of society. And since religion's nature is to claim infallibility, they deter change and consequent societal improvement by saying: "what I am saying now is the one and only truth in the world. It always has been and always will be because it is what God wants." This leaves no room for changes or improvements in ideology and leaves no room for those who believe in a separate code of infallibility. Religion is by nature rigid and stagnant in its policies, and it only helps breed intolerance and ignorance and therefore is far more detrimental to society than it is helpful.
