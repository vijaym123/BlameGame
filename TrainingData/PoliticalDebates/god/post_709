Your example is hard to answer as I do not know all the ins and outs. BUT if we're going to take the thou shalt not kill for it then yes, she shouldn't have an abortion. It may not be the right thing to do, but it is the right thing to do. It's like that Jehovah who died because she wouldn't take a blood transfusion.I think the basis of your argument is that God's word cannot be applied to modern day society and in a way you're right, because the world is moving so fast these days that every decade shows more change than it used to a few hundred years ago and that half the things today aren't even mentioned in the past i.e. abortion, cloning etc. However I would say that it's only people's mentality that is different to the past. We tend to think we know the answers, or questions and that we're a lot smarter than we used to be. In some ways we are, and in some ways we're not, some things are better and some things are worse but I think in MOST aspects these 'rules' are still as applicable as the past. Give me a few examples of todays problems which you think cannot be solved through religion and I'll try and explain as best I can as to how religion can be applied to it.
