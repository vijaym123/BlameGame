When Laplace published his theory of the formation of the Solar System, Napoleon Bonaparte asked him where God fit into his theory. Laplace replied, "Sir, I have no need of that hypothesis."The answer to your objection should be obvious to logicians: no, it is not absolutely clear that there is no god. Nor is it absolutely clear that there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster or celestial teapot.The answer to "Is there a God?" cannot be answered definitively, period. Therefore the atheist position is and must be "[with the same likeliness that there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster] there is no god."
