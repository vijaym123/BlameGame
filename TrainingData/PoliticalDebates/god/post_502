#originalTopic=Does_God_really_Exist
This is an impossible question to answer mainly because we really don't have the means of figuring shit like this out...Agnostics and Science: Who the fuck knows, anything is possible at this pointChristians: Yes, because the bible says so.Atheists: No, because i've never seen any evidence saying otherwise (and psychics and ghosts don't exist no matter how many people claim they do).Buddhists: It is what it is.Nihilists: No and who gives a fuck.Satanists: No, and live your life to the fullest.Philosophers: There are a million answers to the Universe, God happens to be most of them.Politicians: CHANGE!yep, everyone has a different answer. So far though, most people believe in God and say he does exist.So, according to about 90% of the people in the world, yes, he does.Does it mean it's true? no. But it does mean that's what most people will tell you.
