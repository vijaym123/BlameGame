Meaning that if you want to, it can mean anything you want to. There are no hidden meanings in the bible. If anything most people have no understanding of the bible because they don't understand the historical context when each of the books were written. Like how there is no record of Hebrew slaves in Egypt, but we know the old testament was first solidified in Babylon when they were slaves there. To say the bible is "written by God" immediately discredits you in any real discussion about the bible due to your own ignorance.
