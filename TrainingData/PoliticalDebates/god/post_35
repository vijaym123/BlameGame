Gravity is a theory.  Ask any scientist.  Then ask them to explain very slowly what a theory is to you.  You'll be a better person for it.  Also, please stop making appeals to ridicule.  It is a logical fallacy, and makes you look like a jerk.Your attempt to disprove Intelligent Design using big words is infantile.  It's also a logical fallacy, known as argumentum verbosium.  You didn't acually disprove anything, you just said basically the same thing I said, and then denied it.  You offered no evidence, you just used a lot of big technical terms and made it a lot longer than it needed to be in the hopes of confusing me.  You failed.  You have disproved nothing.Finally, in your persistance in stating that ID has no evidence, despite the fact that you have disproved nothing and not even attempted to disprove all of the evidence offered, you have shown yourselves to be just as close-minded as the 7-day Creationist who refuses to acknowledge   evolution  .  Do yourself a favor, and go down to your local Community College.  Enroll in two classes, one on the scientific method, and one on rhetoric.  You should come away with that experience with a firm grasp on both what a scientific theory is and why both evolution and gravity are scientific theories, and how to offer up a valid argument without appealing to logical fallacies.
