The Big Bang Theory is as much a "lazy excuse for how everything was made" as you say God is. Scientists can only theorize on how the universe was created. Their theories are no more credible than the age-old explanation of creation, and God.Many people reject the concept of Christian faith; however, one MUST have faith even to believe the scientific theories of the big bang, and evolution.
