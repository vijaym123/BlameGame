While I agree that the idea f the bible as a moral compass is far more palatable than as a specific description of real-life events, I think it should be noted that people can be good without the Bible, and people can also be terrible within Biblical law.I'm not a Christian, and I still know what is right and what is wrong. Do not hurt others- do not steal, violate, kill, etc. I don't need a Bible to guide my actions, and yet my actions are still those of a good person.
