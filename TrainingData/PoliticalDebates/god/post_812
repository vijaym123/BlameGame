Hm...You already said that.Does that mean you give up? You should pray for an answer to counter my arguements, instead of just quoting scripture.Or you could do some research, and come up with valid reasons I'm wrong.(by the way, your last two arguements are tagged as "no its not" god would not be too happy about that...)
