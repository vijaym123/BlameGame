Mass suicides is a completely modern and retarded thing for a VERY minor percentage of the population.. that REALLY shouldn't be used as an example specially when it's with the brainwashed... NO CULTS SHOULD!! GRR!!The followers of non-abrahimic religions cannot be expected to know everything scientifically just as we don't know everything scientifically. You're right, their rituals weren't 'scientifically' correct but not everything we do know is 'good' either. This whole global warming fiasco is something we're all contributing to everyday and don't you think that's a whole lot worse than a few 'stupid dances' to make it rain? Why is it that we continue to do all the things damaging the environment even when we KNOW it's damaging the environment? We're much more informed, yet we're doing bad right? If we are much better without God and are able to make better decisions why is it that we seem to disagree more and more?It's all about mentality. Back then, things were a lot more black and white and todays society has created more and more colours, not just because of more information, butit's peoples inabilities to make the right decisions. That is because there isn't really a basis to say whether or not what they want is right or wrong because as you said it's up to people to make the right choice and less and less people are making the right choices.You talked about how Egyptians could've spent their resources better... We're constantly wasting resources, not just on pointless research, but on things which will probably be harmful 20years down the line. Cigarettes, Alcohol, Fast Food, Petrol, CFC's, Waste etc. etc. All societies have their negatives, but I would prefer to dance for rain or bury people in tombs or pray for life than accept sodomy, sell my soul for money, have no respect for myself...
