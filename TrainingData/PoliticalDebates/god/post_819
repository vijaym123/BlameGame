I understand it's difficult to see who the true god is. It all involves faith. I have faith that I worship the right God. It's not as if ALL non-believers will go straight to hell. I feel, however, that God is a universal entity that causes us to want to do good. No matter what religion you practice, God (or gods) is there to make us all act moral. I believe that if somebody lives a good moral life, he can be rewarded in Heaven. However, I learned that Heaven has different levels, as does Hell. I would think that believing in God would enable passage into a level closer to God in Heaven.
