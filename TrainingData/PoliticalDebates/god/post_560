No. Many people believe that Gods do exist but till date, there is no definite answer to this question. This has been a myth for centuries. Be it Christians or Buddhists there bound to be some kind of God that these people believe in. Sadly, this has not been scientifically proved that Gods do exist.No offense but I feel that this is a propaganda to make people devoted to one's religion. See, you go to Churches or the temples and pray, study the bible, etc. But are they really true?Just like what many people say about Jesus-- he wanted to save his villagers so he sacrificed himself and got pinned(literally hammering his hands and feet) onto logs which make up the letter "t" and was left there to bleed to death. [Sorry if I got the wrong story but it should be something like that]How true is this? No one can reassure. Any one can just make up stories with no prove and evidence. It depends on how much or how far one believes in that so-called story.For me, I feel that Science explains almost everything. Without Science, one will not know why or how things work. We would all be a bunch of morons, obeying what others say or do. And because there is no explanation to this, I would rather choose not to believe in this(to a certain extent)Therefore, I do not go with the motion agreeing that God do exist.
