You've got it completely right, pvtNobody. Don't worry about it—most atheists (not all, some are very respectful), but a lot of them are condescending because of insecurity. The insecurity is related to clinging to a belief system that lacks any depth or true solidity. (How many times have we heard that "turns out science was wrong" and the "facts" they held so dear turned out to be wrong and have changed over time. Unlike Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.) If one is feeling insecure, one popular strategy is to project their frustration. Of course its results are hurtful and shallow and not based on facts, (which is ironic since they like to throw "facts" around a lot) Anyways, thus the sarcasm and name-calling. Let's pray for them. God won't condemn scientists who wanted to know how things work (He created and loves them!)—only those that still reject Him in the end.
