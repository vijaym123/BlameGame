The very exsistence of matter invalidates the law of physics. There should be nothing because matter cannot be made or destroyed, only changed if I am to understand your argument correctly. It's amazing how well the Bible is formed, there are no incostencies in it. You just displayed why man made religion is easy to spot, because it will have glaring incosistancies in it.
