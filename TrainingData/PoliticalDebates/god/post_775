I think so. It is always good to have someone we call God in our life. 'Refrains you from all those stupid things, that in the end you know, it wont bring any good in your life. It is also better to live the life He leads. We all are entitled to have our own beliefs and nasty things, that's one of his gifts for us Free will and I have also tried all those things that are considered evil and useless. But eventually I get tired of it. It is not worth it really. So I bring back my faith and start believing in God again. Believing in Him makes me a better person. Or that is just I want to believe. But really, I never have experience before this contentment I'm feeling now and I want to believe that it is because of my faith and belief of Him.
