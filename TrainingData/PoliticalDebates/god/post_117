"Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source for the Universe are as ancient as humanity itself Ð at least." A moot point, but humanity evolved the necessary cognitive function to imagine greater powers far later than the actual first creature that could be called homo sapien."They constitute the longest standing range of explanations for the source of our world." And subsequently the least informed."they cannot explain without significant problems on the one hand" There are many things wrong with your assertion. One is that, since science doesn't understand, it must be a some wizard in the sky who just did it all randomly. Second, is that there are several theories that postulate on the occurrence of max entropy and it's succession into the condensation of the universe into a single point. At which, entropy can finally reverse, and in one explosion, create matter and energy. The universe would then be a sinusoidal wave of contractions and expansion.
