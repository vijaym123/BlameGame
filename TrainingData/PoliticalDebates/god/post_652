I think I see the problem here.You live on a different planet.1. again, there's 0 proof Christians give any more to charity than anyone else. Where are your statistics? There's no reason to think that Christians give more than a Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, or Atheist. There's no proof. It's your opinion, and your opinion is not based on anything at all.2. If tomorrow god came and took all the Christians I'd be super glad because you guys are annoying. That aside though, there's no such thing so unfortunately it's not going to happen. If it did though, everyone would get along just fine. I mean, you people didn't even start showing up on this planet until 300 years after that guy Jesus (who may have never even existed) died, and everything was just peachy without you.3. Yeah, god is a private thing, and you have the right to believe in god or the easter bunny or big foot or whatever the hell you want. Problem is, Christians don't want religious freedom you nuts want everyone to believe your own insanity. But nope, sorry, the constitution is clear. Church and State are separate, and god should not be in public schools in any form whatsoever. Start your own school if you don't like it, but don't try to put it on everyone else.3. So when something bad happens like 9/11 we all of a sudden ask God why did he remove his protection. Total HypocrisyYou dumbass. 9/11 had nothing to do with "god's protection"it was terrorists.God has never stopped a single tragedy in the history of the world, and he's not about to start just because you force your silly beliefs on other people.And your insinuation that somehow people die because of what they believe is not only incredibly stupid. But offensive, evil, and frankly why so many bright people like myself have gone from indifferent about your silly cult, to downright hating it.
