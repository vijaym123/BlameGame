Aren't you creating trouble for yourself, inupiaqswagger?  If "Joshua" is correct, then the other books of the Old Testament are also correct, and the Earth is 6,000 years old.  The way scientists would date soil is by the age of organic matter in it by means of carbon-14 dating, and for this dating to correspond with the biblical chronology it would have to be reliable.  Which would mean that other dates given by C14 dating would also be correct including the ones of 40,000 years (which is at least 6 times the biblical age of the Earth).  I don't know how reliable the science is (I did a Google search, and the only links were back to your comment).  I'd be interested if you could provide a link to the report.Hezekiah's tunnel was rediscovered in 1838. So there wouldn't have been many scientists (not even Darwin) who would have been able to use its non-existence as evidence of the falsity of the bible.  It would hardly be surprising that Jerusalem would have had a secure source of water, in case of a siege, and the bible mentioning a real structure hardly makes the rest of the book correct (you might as well argue that since "Harry Potter" mentions King's Cross Station, then the books must be true, because the station also exists; come to think of it, I have been to King's Cross and seen a wall between platforms 9 and 10 marked platform 9 3/4, with a trolley embedded in the wall-so they must be true!).
