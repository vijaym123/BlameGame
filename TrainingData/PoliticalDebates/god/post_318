Your argument is logically inconsistent and bordering on incoherent. Benching 300 is NOT impossible.  You just do not have the power to do it.  There is a very clear and obvious difference.You are able to say things that are contradictory, ergo you are greater than a being who cannot.  That is similar to saying that because you will die you are greater than an immortal being.God and human are so ontologically different that each would logically have attributes that the other does not by virtue of being opposite, i.e. immortal God and mortal man, omniscient God vs a man who can be ignorant. The nature of your argument that you are superior by virtue of your ignorance is quite silly and potentially dangerous. I'm not here to attack your beliefs, you have the freedom to believe whatever you like.  I'm just clarifying incorrect arguments attacking mine and showing that belief in God is a rational belief and not logically inconsistent like some people try to say.
