look i for 1 believe that there is a god but i think that all the gods are the same 1 depicted in different ways.1.now lets say god is not real ok? and some 1 goes around preaching his name and helping people and giving people hope he is still a good person and will go were every 1 else goes in the end, 2.if god is real and he dose the man / woman dose the same they go to a nice place and get rewarded.and in point "1" if that man did not believe in god he would probably not of done those lovely things and helped the world for the better and the only bad thing he would pf done would be talking to himself a few times a day.also lets face it the Cristian view of death is much nicer than the atheist, and it helps people move on when there family dies, so i think beveling in god any god is better than not beveling at all.
