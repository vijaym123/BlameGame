"But I call that biased science. You don't really think we know it all, do you?"Of course not. I believe we know very, very, little. I believe our pathetic mammalian brains give us the power to think we're special, the power to create little gods for us to worship, but fail to give us any semblance of the ability to fathom the truths of this universe."Why would you assume that a simple understanding of some of the forces of nature disproves God's existance? "Again, you are looking at it all wrong. I don't want to disprove your sky wizard. We've created thousands of your yahwehs. Thors. Odins. Amen-Rah's and Imoteps. Literally thousands. Keep your little dude in the sky. In fifty years they'll be fifty more of them. I don't have the time or desire to disprove every single god that every single culture decided to make.Instead, I realize quite easily that we're all born atheist, and we're taught religion by our family/society. I realize there is no proof for religion. I realize that religion exists outside of the realm of proof. It cannot be proved or disproved.I realize it is a statistical possibility for a god, whether it be your precious Judeo-Christian god, or Odin, to exist. But I realize that in the case of your god, if he would send me to hell simply because I do not 'believe' in him, than I would never want to worship so petty and vain a creature.
