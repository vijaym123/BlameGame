Science is an hypothesis as well. It is based on the perception that the universe is limited to what we can sense with our 5 senses and instrumentation designed to augment those five senses.Right now there are thousands of radio and tv and wireless signals going past my head but I cant see or hear or even feel them because i dont have the receiver turned on or tuned to the proper frequency. But regardless of that those signals are there. WHat else is there that I simply do not have  a receiver for or am not tuned into. Is there a "spirit of truth and righteousness" that requires a mind that can receive it and a mind that is tuned into the frequency it broadcasts on? Many people have a "gut feeling" about what is right and wrong, where does it come from. Last nights Spaghetti :-)Or is there a "spirit of truth and righteousness" is there a concious or subconcious concience that is more than just what we have reasoned from our life experience to be the correct thing to do. We are really good at justifying what we some how know is wrong. IMHO
