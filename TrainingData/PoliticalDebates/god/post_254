Your argument fails to disprove at all the existence of a God who rules BY those laws. Also- whereas science itself claims itself incomplete, you can never absolutely claim that all laws are ever violated, because many laws lay undiscovered. Also, you fail claim to the petitio principi fallacy. You are only disproving a God that breaks natural laws, not the God that created natural laws, or the God that rules by them. Also- your definition inherently contradicts this argument, because you allow for a God that has been "created," therefore allowing for a God that did not creat the matter of the universe. You're basically falling prey to giant straw-man fallacy. You build a God, and then disprove that God. If I defined atheism as "belief that nothing exists outside of the self," then, depending on your metaphysics, I could easily disprove that. But I do not. As long as the theist must disprove the atheist's definition of atheism, so also must the atheist disprove the theist's God.
