Since there are an enormous number of God concepts floating around, one could hardly disprove them all. For that matter, some people define God as having a positive attitude towards lile. Can't disagree with that! However, If by God, you refer to a being greater than which one cannot conceive, I argue that such a being does not exist.Nothing is ever as good as you think it will be. It follows that the being greater than which one cannot conceive cannot actually exist because it would therefore be less than another being that was like the first but non existent. Therefore there is no God.
