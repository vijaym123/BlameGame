"I have a scientific bachelor's degree and I know that scientists do "make stuff up" = "postulate". It's the first step in the process."They only make anything up because of observations in reality that need explanation. Then they test the explanation via scientific observations or experiments. Religion does not do this next step. Within religion, they say, "This suits me to believe, therefore I will follow it." Science does not allow for such wishful thinking.
