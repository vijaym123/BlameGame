If you really are searching for some answers to this question then I can provide great books that break down the philosophical side of free will. One of the most well known on this issue is C.S. Lewis, "The problem of pain." He also wrote mere "Christianity" and "Miracles." You are right in saying that there is no absolute proof of how life came about. However keep in mind, "Science doesn't provide us with truth. The practice of scientific investigation involves tools that help us explain how the physical world might work. The explanation doesn't have to be true to be useful, just consistent with most of the evidence." (Spencer). The evidence when studied just facts points towards a designer. Chance is ruled out through mathematical probability. For more on this read Robert Collins, Jay W. Richards, or Guillermo Gonzalez. For scientific evidence in molecular biology read Michael Behe, and Johnathan Wells. I would encourage reading opposing view from   evolution   scientist such a Ruse. It is good to know why you choose you evidences.         The   energy   mass you speak of is called the singularity. Both sciences believe in the "big bang" It is a measurable event. The argument is evolution believes that nothing came from nothing to create something over billions of years. There can be no infinity. "Everything that begins the exist has a cause, The earth began to exist, therefore it has a cause." If you heard a bang in the next room and asked me what was that and i said nothing, you would not except that. The bang has a cause. The idea that something comes into existence un-caused is absurd.
