You're right. Some of the time. Demagoguery is use for ones own benefit. However do you agree that if it was for the benefit of mankind then it is for the greater good? Forget history, religious sects etc. If demagoguery DID benefit mankind, then it would be for the greater good? Your argument is that it is used for the benefit of the demagogue. Fairplay, this can go on forever but again you're basing it, not on God, but on people. If people did it for mankinds good.... then you would say its for the greater good, but if people did it for mankinds bad, then its not for the greater good. Amirite?...
