That while there are a few thoughtful, interesting atheists, the majority are either rabid anti-  religious   zealots or people too ashamed to take responsibility for their actions in a supernatural sense?A) Theorizing on the motivations of peoples you don't understand is, at best, pointless and at worst offensively stereotypical, andB) The   existence   of any sort of divine or supernatural being cannot be based, at all, on the existence or behaviors of their adherents.Fascists tend to be horrible people. It does not follow that fascism does not exist.
