I think we have different understandings of what a religious society leads to. I don't blame you but that's simply because you're basing your thoughts on history, but moreover history of certain religions as Christianity, Islam and (not so sure) Judaism. However what would you say to a Buddhist society? Or a Hindu society? Certain religions have been detrimental, but imo other religions, some extinct, some not, did not have the problems you've described. egyptians? Ancient chinese and indian? ancient greeks etc. etc. They were all deeply religious societies (correct me if I'm wrong) which did not have the same borders as you're describing (again correct me if I'm wrong).
