It's called the argument for the best of both possible worlds. Either (a), we can have a world with no free will, but at the same time no violence, war, crime, sins, etc. OR (b) we can have a world where we have free will to do what we want, which leads to some people whom abuse their free will to do bad. Which would you rather live in?
