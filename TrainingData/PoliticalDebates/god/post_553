hahaha why do people still ask this question?? I honestly dont think god exists, has he done anything for us? if there is I mean you look at it the bible is a rip off of like a million different religions and there is no credible evidence pointing to the existance of this oh so benevolent being. I mean if god exists i guess zues and buddah do to. Oh and another thing ethiopia is the oldest christian religion yet where is this god when there dying like it's going out of fashion? so no god doesnt exist and if you want to argue the point come out with some evidence that doesnt come from a book of lies.
