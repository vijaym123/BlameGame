 I seriously believe there is a god. Now for evidence ill go ahead and disprove the whole big bang theory. At once there was nothing and then out of nowhere a giant explosion created the universe in random chemical reactions and accidental mutations that led to earth and life on earth us evolving from some sort of fish frog and a freaking monkey. I just disproved the theory of evolution as well. The reason God is "absent" is because society has told him to be. Society has said stay out of politics and schools and so he has. Whether or not you believe in a god you should have enough sense in the brain he blessed you with to know that there has to be some sort of greater power.
