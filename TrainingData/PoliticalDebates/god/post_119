The Rabbi is laboring under the mistaken impression that there is a coherent concept of God that would make sense of his/her/its role in creation; and also seems to think that the universe began at some point in time, even though that is actually a misunderstanding of the Big Bang hypothesis, which most physicists do not believe was an absolute beginning, though it may have occurred as far back as we can look. For all we know, the universe is infinite in time and space. One can define an infinite number of explanations for the world and how it came to be (assuming again that it did come to be). For example, maybe the world was created by a single bunny rabbit. On the other hand, maybe it was created by two bunny rabbits. Or three bunny rabbits... Since there are an infinite number of possible explanations, one needs to be able to cut the field down to some manageable number of options. God is not one such options at present because the philosophical contexts in which "God" is a valid concept are no longer acceptable. God made sense in terms of Plato or Aristotle's metaphysics. I doubt if the Rabbi is up to specifying a context which would make sense of the God notion.
