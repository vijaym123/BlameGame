Beginning in the 19th century historians began to investigate whether there was any actual historical evidence of Jesus. James Frazer was the first to really study Christianity dispassionately. He found that Christmas comes from a pagan tradition, and early Christians piggybacked their holiday on it. He also discovered that the idea of a reborn god (like the story of Jesus) exists in many primitive religions and cultures. He discovered it comes from crops dying and growing again. Eventually he came to the conclusion that there is no evidence for Jesus having ever existed.After hearing this, the Catholic church took the position that their beliefs were not based on evidence but faith alone.
