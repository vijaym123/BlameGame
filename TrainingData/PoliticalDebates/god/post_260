Really, the wager isn't a 50/50 bet.  What if you pick the wrong god, and the true god is a jealous spiteful one, and you have to face Zeus, for example, in the afterlife?  Might you be better off not believing in any god, rather than insulting god by believing in someone else?  It would be good if you could actually prove your god's existence, instead of relying on blind faith.  Or better still, if he could give a sign that no one would be able to dismiss.
