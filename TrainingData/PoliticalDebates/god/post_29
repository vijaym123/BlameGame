Yes, natural selection is a (scientific) theory about a mechanism of evolution (a fact), for which there is overwhelming evidence, and intelligent design is just an invented explanation, for which there is no evidence.  Don't waste my time by (poorly) quoting the bible as evidence.  First of all you'd need to prove that god exists and that the bible is more than a poorly edited collection of inconsistent works of fiction.  Once you have done that, then you can come back and we can discuss whether god works through evolution or whether god is a deceiver (as Philip Henry Gosse in his book "Omphalos" published in 1857 2 years before the Origin seemed to believe) and created an earth 6000 years old to look 4.5 billion years old.  The bible is wildly inaccurate with regard to science, besides stating that pi equals exactly 3, and that the earth's rotation can be just stopped for a day so Joshua can just commit another of his acts of divine sanctioned genocide.  I won't even try to correct your use of the word "accident"; it's obvious you don't have the slightest understanding of evolution.
