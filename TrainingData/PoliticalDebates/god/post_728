Well seeing as their cults I wouldn't really look into them too much. I did some research into them and they do seem completely different to Abrahimic faiths. I would certainly say that Eastern religions are based on philosophy with them being more interested into the understanding of one self in correspondance to the universe. Mythology, history, culture and philosophy I would say are basis of eastern religions also with the founder having lesser significance than abrahimic faiths.
