I do not think believing in god is worth it. I have spent many hours of my life contemplating the question of god. For me, a god that is so distant is not worth it. Why worry and stress about the afterlife instead of the life you got now? There is no point. For me, its much more worth it to put my energy into my life and worry about whats going on while I am living, not what will happen after I die. Who knows? What if there is no afterlife? What then? Point being that people should enjoy the time they got instead of preparing for something they lack knowledge of.
