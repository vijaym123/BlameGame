Well, first, to answer your question: Yes, believing in God is worth it. But you must know, that faith in God does not mean that you are perfect, or that you will be considered "good" by people (in fact, many will despise you and call you intolerant out of their intolerance), or that your life will somehow be void of suffering or the traps of sin and temptations of life. It's not easy sometimes, but is most definitely worth it.So basically the only difference is in your head...The benefits are: You are adopted into the family of God and our now considered His child. How awesome is that?!It's not, at all, seems kinda lame actually. Do you have any solid examples of actual things that make it "awsome?"Secondly, by accepting His son as our Savior we are instilled with the Holy Spirit, which then guides us when we don't know what to do, convicts us when we're wrong so we will know truth from lies, and transforms us to be the kind of person we all really want to be but could never seem to do or be on our own, like His son, Jesus.Hm, interesting, this holy spirit you are instilled with, is there some way to measure this? Or is it just in your head again? And "like His son, Jesus," so what, I get nailed to a cross, tortured, killed, and millions after me will die in my name, and people will kill people who don't believe in me? SWEET! Where do I sign up. (that's sarcasm)Oh and I forgot a biggie: we get to live eternally with Him and Jesus and all the other saints in Heaven after we pass!Yeah? Pretending for a second that this wacky fairy tale is true, what the hell is so cool about living for eternity with a bunch of people that never did anything fun ever? Like, what do you do all day? Sounds retarded to me. No thanks.
