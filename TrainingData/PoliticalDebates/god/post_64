The only God you disprove with your arguments is the one that you have created within your own mind. In order to disprove any framework of belief, you must adopt that framework and disprove it within itself; therefore, you cannot define God. Because you have failed to disprove God in every sense of the term, your arguments cannot be valid. For example: you have failed to disprove one of philosophy's most famous examples of God- Plato's God of the forms. Plato believed that this God ruled by transcendent laws that existed already, and transcended even God himself. This definition meets your argument, and therefore your argument inherently fails to provide any offense, and disproves nothing.
