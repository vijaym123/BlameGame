You take things really extreme. I'm one of those that is not trying to force schools to pray not at all. I just get upset when it's completely away from it and someone tells. It reminds me of the movie 1984. As far as the Texas thing I familiar with that being a part of the bible belt no one objected it was only one person who complained and affected the rights of hundreds that preferred to pray. Overwhelmingly the community was upset what happened to democracy even in religion where the wants and needs of the many out ways the needs of the few. Right now it's going the other way where the few are outweighing the many I guess that's what makes great news. Media loves feuds.
