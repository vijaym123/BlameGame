 Holy whips and chains! A God argument that I have not yet commented on?! Blasphemy!  /   /> I'm going to have to say no because you said that there is "irrefutable proof" and "evidence" that God does exist, and you attribute existence itself to proof that God exists. That, to me, is not proof; that's merely a belief. If you want to be technical about it, there are two theories as to why we exist. The first theory is that we were destined to exist, which could include God in that theory. The other theory is that we were simply the result of random situations which created life.  />   /> You can't really prove either one of those theories with cold, hard facts; not yet at least. And furthermore, saying that things exist and that's God's doing is not proof, but rather belief. You can't just say "Hey look, existence. God exists." and expect that to be proof enough. I'm not saying that God does not exist, but your proof is somewhat weak.
