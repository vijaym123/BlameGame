I almost forgot the best one. What were Jesus' last words? You would think that might be important to get right, but out of the 4 gospels - Jesus has 3 different last words.Matthew 27:46 -About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" - which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Mark 15:34 -And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" - which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Luke 23:46 -Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last. John 19:30 -When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
