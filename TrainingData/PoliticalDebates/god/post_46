Ironically, I'm seeing some of the same people who make the argument that we need to cut down on CO2 emmissions "just in case" it is causing global warming making the argument that God doens't exist.  Why not read the Bible, "just in case" God exists?  Then after reading it and reflecting on it, make your own decision.
