"1. You do not have instrumentation that can detect them and and relay that information in a manner that our 5 senses can sense them."yes, that is true... however considering that we know that there are radio broadcasts going on near by (even though I do not have my cell phone on me I know that it gets a signal where I am sitting) I don't think that it is unreasonable to assume that there are radio waves passing through me right now."2. If you do not have that instrumentation tuned into the frequency those   energy   signals are transmitting on."That is a strange way to put it... but again, yes."3. There may be many other energy waves than radio tv infra red ultra violet light rays."getting stranger now, but also true... there are sound waves to consider for one."Thought waves for example, we cannot even read thought waves"Que?  It depends on what you mean by 'Thought Waves'... if you are talking about the frequency of electrical signals traveling through the brain you are correct in that we cannot 'read' them.  We can detect them but we cannot interpret them."who knows what other energy signals are out there that we simply cannot detect withn our current detection facilities."Also true, however that reasoning allows for an infinite number of possibilities...  We 'could' be organic robots controlled by tachyon signals being projected from Saturn."Just because you don't know its there does not mean it doesn't exist."Can't the same thing be said for Unicorns and underwear gnomes?
