The Romans persecuted Christians the Romans weren't Christians or even Catholic yet. Where are you making this stuff up the sixth commandment never said that you could kill Canaanites and Babylonians et. As far as the putting people to death I don't associate Catholics as Christians. True Christian's never asked to put people to death. One of the main reasons why pilgrims left England was because of there freedom of religion to not be persecuted by Catholics. If you look up the history of Catholicism about 300 A.D. Constantin fused together pagan and Christianity there you have the whack Catholics. I cut and pasted from Wiki below. Look I know the argument is not about a specific religion like the one I believe in. Yes if you encompass all religions that call themselves Christian than yes your death statement is correct. A lot of cults out there call themselves Christian but they are a wolf in sheep's clothing just like the Catholics are making up there own rules and laws.Ancient Roman religion encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Rome in the form of cult practices. It is therefore the practical counterpart of Roman mythology. Within the Roman world, religious practice varied enough so that one might speak of Roman religions. The cult practices of Rome extended across Italy with the rise of the Roman Empire. These religions were polytheistic, and as such are sometimes referred to as "pagan".
