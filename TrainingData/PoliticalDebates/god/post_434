been there done that - it is an entertaining read to see what people are willing to believe with sufficient unknowns.for those who haven't gone back and read again with fresh eyes - here's a good example of of the fun you can have:The serpent told the truth!!re-read the garden of eden fable and you will see that: God told Adam that the day he eats the fruit of that tree he will die the serpent (who at that time had feet) said No you won't die, you will learn the difference between good and evil eve and adam ate the apple THEY DID NOT DIE! Adam lived 930 more years* they learned the difference between good and evil - just like the serpent said (and like the name of the tree would suggest)Moral of the story: God lied! the serpent told the truth!to cut it of at the pass for those who say that after eating the apple they became destined to die, keep reading - there was also a tree of life in the garden (the reason they were kicked out) which would not be necessary if they were going to live forever from the beginning.
