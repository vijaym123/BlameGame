The fundamental failure of this argument is that it is not an argument at all. The theist can accept that there are natural laws by which God functions that transcend him without being self-contradictory; it all depends on your definition. Atheism cannot be proved until every view of God is disproved, whereas the theist only has to disprove only one atheistic view- that no higher power exists.
