Why do people continue to bring up Pascal's Wager?Firstly, it completely ignores the fact that there is an infinite set of possibile gods, and therefore the chance of you believing in the right one is infinitesimally small.Secondly, it doesn't explore the possibility that the god that does exist either doesn't want you to believe in him, or punishes people who believed in the wrong god more than he does people who simply didn't believe in any god.Thirdly, it assumes that god is an idiot and can't tell the difference between people who actually believe, and people who are believing just incase.Living by Pascal's Wager is a foolish way to live.
