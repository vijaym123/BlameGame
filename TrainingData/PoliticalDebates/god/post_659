I just get upset when it's completely away from it and someone tells.That's funny, I'd think it was in general a good idea to encourage kids to "tell" when an adult in an authority position forces them to do something illegal and in violation of their rights.As far as the Texas thing I familiar with that being a part of the bible belt no one objectedOh, OK, since nobody objected to them breaking the law it's OK. But when somebody DOES object to the school breaking the law in Florida, then it's the objection that is not OK, whereas breaking the law should still be OK. That makes no sense whatsoever at all.it was only one person who complainedWell, that's not "no one," then, is it? That's someone whose civil rights were violated. Whereas those "hundreds" DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO FORCE PUBLIC PRAYER AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Their "rights" weren't violated one bit because the law explicitly says that they have no right to do that, whereas the complaining student does have a right to insist that they don't.where the wants and needs of the many out ways the needs of the fewThat's actually a principle of Star Trek, not government. The wants of the many do NOT in any case outweigh the rights of the few. That would be antithetical to our Constitution, and it's not what Spock meant either.
