When Moses encountered God he had the good sense to ask him his name.The burning bush replied, "I am who am."   God was sending a message through the ages to us today.  Today, we are searching for the underlying power that ties everything together, the string theory, the quantum matrix, dark energy, and the "god" particle.The "dark energy" that we now theorize is the matrix that holds the universe in place is the essence of God's concienceness.  God is the matrix.  His son is the human embodiment of his power and has existed before creation, though he was born of a young woman 2000 years ago.A mystery, not so much, quantum theory now tells us that time is not as real as we percieve.  We know that matter can exist in many places at once.  So then it follows that man and God can do it as well.  Therefor God can be born in 3 AD, but have existed at creation.  In fact, creation, the birth and death of Christ, and the Revelation can occur simultaneously.What physcisist are trying to find is the ultimate cause, but the burning bush gave us that answer thousands of years ago in the desert.It is possible CERN may solve the riddle and yield the "God" particle and in doing so it may also open the door to heaven, ------it may be that in this time, God wants us to find him ------ again!
