I doubt seriously that my dog thinks that I am God.  He might be slightly impressed when the front door light comes on automatically, because of the motion detector, when we return at night after a walk, although I think I lose considerable numbers of points, when I fumble around in the dark for the keys, because I forgot to turn on the light in the first place (he has perfect night vision), or even worse, I have to get the garbage bin to climb over the security gate because I forgot its key.
