"That makes a lot of foolish people in the world billions of foolish people."Yes, yes it does.It's true that a blind man believes the sky is blue because he was raised that way. Also it's true that he would probably believe in God if he was raised that way. However, there's an important difference: the man can verify that the sky is blue by consulting scientific textbooks. He can't do that with God.Why is it that I trust a science book and not the Bible? Because science is based on evidence. Not just what you can see, but anything that can somehow be shown to exist. This belief based on evidence is the foundation on which we can build an understanding of the world. Without a foundation like this, you're just making shit up.
