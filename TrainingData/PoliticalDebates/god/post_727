That's a valid point about the Abrahamic faiths, and again perhaps Confucianism, being comparitively "aggressive." I'd have to take a closer look at other monotheistic religions in antiquity (the cults of Mithras and Akhennaton were both big ones) to make a determination about whether moral absolutism seems to be a facet of monotheism generally or just of Judaism-Christianity-Islam.I am not certain if I am saying that Eastern and other faiths are based more on "philosophy," just that their ethical structures are not necessarily a black-and-white list of "thou shalt not"s. They are frequently presented more as broad precepts to be applied situationally rather than as hard-as-fast rules about certain proscribed behaviors.
