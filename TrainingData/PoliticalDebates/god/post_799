There are so many things that we know exist that are immaterial. Take, for example, love, which almost all of us have experienced. We know that this exists, and it is not a material substance, so it would have a similar explanation as the existence of God would. And in the time of Jefferson, there was air, but nobody could explain it. They couldn't see it or capture it and they felt it was not a material. Of course, by now we know the details to what air is made of, but back then, this would have been just as mysterious as the existence of God or love.
