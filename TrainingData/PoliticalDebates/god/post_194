Since when is science the absolute definitive? Science has, indeed, proved itself wrong time and time again. Is omniscience part of the human condition? Science is a human-created and pursued enterprise and scientists that we trust will be the first to tell you that they are NOT omniscient. We are limited by our own humanity. Scientists will also tell you that their art is lacking in final proofs and that their best endeavors are based upon theories that are suspect. Why investigate anything that is absolutely proven? We are limited to the observations of our five senses and the tools that we use to enhance those senses. Who makes the tools that enhance? Is the tool any better than the toolmaker? Please do NOT depend upon science to provide a TRUE answer to your questions. The practitioners of science are as likely as not to give you a different answer tomorrow as they have given you today. That is the root of their quest and the ever-appealing and ever-elusive goal of their profession.
