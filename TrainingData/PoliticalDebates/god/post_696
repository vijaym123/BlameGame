So if people are good in general, then they should probably make good choices. If they're not making good choices, then they're not really good in general, now are they? If you give a man a knowledge of good and evil, regardless of his beliefs, he'll know what good and evil are. Whether or not his concept of good and evil are the same is up to him, isn't it? Society however, has the power to control the outliers and people who just don't get it.Well as far as murder and other really dumb shit to pull, it's usually considered bad if you're ending up hurting people and/or the community in general by doing it. I don't need a god to tell me that shooting someone is a bad idea, or that it's going to hurt somebody. And yeah, sometimes it is justified. There are some people in this world that need to die because they're a cancer.Adultery? Well, that's a personal choice thing now isn't it. Whether or not someone chooses to care who their mate has sex with is up to them. Most of the time people get really pissed off at that thing. If you enter a relationship where your mate would care, it's probably a bad idea to go fooling around.I honestly do understand everything you are saying, you're being thick headed.
