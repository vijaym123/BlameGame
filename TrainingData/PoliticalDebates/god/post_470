No. Partly because I wasn't raised to. Partly because I see no reason to. And partly because I don't want to. I don't like the way religious people act, whatsoever. I don't like churches. They idea of worship is obnoxious. The belief that Jesus is suppose to be my role model, sounds like bullshit.Therefore, if there is a God, he's not worth my time, mind, or energy. I'm a perfectly decent person without religion and God. And best of all, I'm not a hypocrite! Woot!
