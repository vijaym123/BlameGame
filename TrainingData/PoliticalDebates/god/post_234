  That law, the conservation of mass-energy exhibits itself in two ways: one, therefore their cannot be absolute contingency- no Esistence -as the contingency argument so requires;two, it exhibits itself in quantum energy, whence comes matter-energy. So here, science indeed does exhibit no reason to posit a dvine creator   Science finds no cosmic teleology- no preordained plans for events in Existence. Thus arises the atelic argument that therefore one cannot posit God as behind events.    To posit God as somehow involved would be the new Omphalos argument that God hides Himself as the epistemic distance argument would endorse in effect. John  L. Schellenberg observes that that distance reflects His hiddenness so much that He probably doesn't exist!
