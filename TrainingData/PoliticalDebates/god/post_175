 I agree with you. Have you ever considered that the delusion of Revelations is referring to the homosexual movement?   Have you ever considered that we are in the end times? I love God. Its obvious you do too. Peace to you. My story at WWW.HOPE7.HIGHPOWERSITES.COMEverything in life is progressing just as it should. I have peace and trust in God, no matter. The bottom line question is not do you believe there is a God, God says all men/woman know it whether they wish to acknowledge is it another matter, but the real question is DO YOU LOVE HIM? I think you do!
