er, I realize that I've been down voted to nearly oblivion in this debate, but it's certainly is not for a lack of a good arguememt.The point is not that a blind man must rely on others to tell him the sky is blue. Or that the analogy of the blind mind is innaccurate, because it's a matter of everyone being blind, not just the one man.The point is, that if one even excepts that Jesus was ever alive, then there is nothing illogical about this person having been "great" but not the son of God. Messenger is assuming so much it boggles the mind, but one of the things specific to this arguement that he/she is assuming, is that Jesus at some time said he was the son of god. Ignoring that there's no evidence this person ever existed. Ignoring that there's no evidence that he is the son of god.There is no evidence he ever claimed to be the son of god.So, you have a statement, "Jesus was a great man, but not the son of god."This statement is assuming he existed. Which is debatable. And then assuming that he never claimed to be the son of god. Which is debatable. And then it assumes he was great, which of course giving the debatable nature of the subject, is debatable.Now, Messenger, by his/her near retarded statement - skips over every step of logic a third grader would accidently use, and goes straight to "Jesus did say he was the son of god, (ignoring whether he ever lived, and whether he ever said that) and therefore, he either must be the son of god, or he was crazy for saying it (even though he may or may not have said it, and may or may not have existed) therefore, he could not have said it and not been the son of god and be a great man."So, according to Messenger's infintile logic, Jesus is either the son of god, or a crazy person.Nothing in between.Which like so much of Messenger's insane rantings, is completely insane.Given that there is 0 evidence of anything, every option is just as "logical" as the next.I was making fun of him/her, attempting to use logic to support an inherently and obviously illogical arguement.
