Human being just want strong reason for everything. Why I stumbled over that rock? Bad karma, God punished you (or you were too inattentive).Why You got sick? You did not wash your hands day before.Why it rains today? Cyclons and atmosphere levels did that.Why Universe expands? Big bang happend very long time ago.Why this particle appears in so many places at once? Erm.. wait, we still sorting it out.Yes indeed, we do search for meaning all the time. But in most cases it is not needed for everyday life. You'll find meaning eventually when You'll be very passionate about something and/or when you will have strong relationships with someone (friends, family, even with  your cat or dog). They say that death brings meaning of life. Not realy. Death might play some role in valuation. But meaning comes from passions and desires not from cheating death (unless it is not your very special passion).
