If the end justifies the means, then the "greater good" is violated through the way , then I don't think we are talking about a greater good anymore. If the greater good is to tell the truth, and in order to do things you need to tell people a lie, then there is no more greater good present. Maybe historically it has been erratically believed that we need some sort of mythical creature in order to be "good". But I do not think that this "greater good" has brought much greatness to humanity in the long run, as it has given way to horrible things through fanatism and it has perpetuated lack of education in many areas related to science. It has also allowed governments to control populations through the use of those beliefs. It has also fostered artificial divisions between different cultures, eventualy leading to wars. Are these means justifiable ? and are the followers really giving our world a greater good? I don't think we need God anymore to know what is good or bad. I think people are capable to figure things out on their own.
