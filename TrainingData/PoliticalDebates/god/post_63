I categorically disagree with the definition of God provided here because while trying to provide a definition that will encompass all religions, it denies multiple beliefs. Many religions believe, as did Plato about his "God of the forms," that God does not make the laws that rule the universe, but rules by the transcendent laws that are already in place. This being said, a multiplicity of religions believe that God did not create the universe's matter and energy, and nor does he have the power to do so. Also the argument of providing a definition of God to disprove denies one of the fundamental basics of argumentation- in order to disprove anything, you must disprove it within its own framework. For example, to disprove zuess you cannot make up your own definition. It is the same with God. The ontological argument would therefore assert that God must exist universally, because in order for the atheist to disprove God, they have to first accept the definition- which is that he exists
