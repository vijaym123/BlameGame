Exactly! This is a fabulous OBSERVATION. But that's all it is. Many people look at the sun everyday, and many people see it differently, but does that mean it doesn't exist? No. In fact, the very existence of so many views seems to make it more likely, more probable, and more believable that God exists. There are many different points of view on what government ought to be, but this observation does not mean that government doesn't exist. I agree completely with the observation, but that's all it is. It fails to function as an argument, and therefore cannot be valued as such in evaluatin the existence of God. In fact, this argument is much more easily turned into a theistic argument.
