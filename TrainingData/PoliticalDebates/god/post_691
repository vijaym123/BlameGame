You sir, are sick in the head and should be isolated from the rest of society for the greater good. What you're saying is that god is the ultimate punishment and the only way people can have a sense of direction is through him. That is utter bullshit.I honestly don't know how else I can say that.People don't need a god. People need other people to guide them.
