"You are just substituting the existence of Universe with existence of (a) god(s). The current scientific view of the beginning of the current Universe is a 'big bang'. This is a "singularity", ie we do not yet know anything on the "other side" of the big bang.""Substituting with (a) god(s) only points us to question what is the beginning of god. If god is without beginning and without end, why can't we also think of the current without beginning and end - BTW, to all practical purposes, the beginning of the Universe has no implication to our current living."Could not the converse of that statement be true in regards to you (that you are substituting God with the universe).  Invoking God isn't the slightest bit circular, and it doesn't mean that God must require a cause.  The law of casualty states that every effect (contingent being) has a cause.  God is not an effect, nor is God a contingent being.  The universe, on the other hand, is composed of matter, and the chief characteristic of matter is mutability (it can be changed).  So therefore, the universe is contingent and requires a cause.  God on the other hand, is an immaterial being who is comprised of no parts.  As such, He is irreducibly simple, and thus does not require a cause.  You can't just simply plug in the "Who made X" objection to everything there is. Your capitalization of the word "universe" strikes me as odd.  It's ironic in the sense that you're essentially deifying the universe, which is nothing but an impersonal, arational, and amoral reality.So in summary, God does not require a cause because God is not comprised of physical parts (divine simplicity), while the universe does because it manifests contingency (being made out of matter, which is mutable).
