Oh, yes, religious rights OTHER THAN YOURS are just bullcrap, yeah.NO, you CAN'T interject religion into a school function -- but people do it all the time. U of TX regularly prays before football games and has a school motto invoking "Gabriel's horn." At a state school. This too is just "one case of many." And their actions are FAT illegal, but have they been "persecuted" for it? NOOOO. If the church wants to hold a charity drive, great - pray away. If the public school wants to do it, then public prayer is inappropriate, because we have that whole disestablishmentarianism thing. Would you have been cool with it if it had been your kids at that function, and the teacher had said "Let's make an offering to Ellegua" or "Here kids, ring these bells in honor of the generosity of Ishtar"? Or how about if the teachers stopped the activity so everybody could face Mecca and bow down and chant "Allahu Akbar" a few times?You want religion in your kids' school, then send your kids to a parochial school. That's what parochial schools are flippin' for. But our public schools are not places for you to indoctrinate other people's children.Making Christians follow the law is not "persecution." You guys just want "special rights", e.g., the right to inflict your religious beliefs and practices on the rest of us. And that, my friend, is persecution behavior.
