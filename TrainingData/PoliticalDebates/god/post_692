Lol. No I think you're sick in the head. If you think the world works without police, army, governments, courts, laws, teachers, doctors etc. then you need to be locked up.Let me repeat - GOD IS NOT JUST THE ULTIMATE 'PUNISHMENT'. HE IS ALL. HE LOVES YOU THE MOST, HE GUIDES YOU THE BEST, HE DOES EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN REAL LIFE CAN. THAT IS WHY HE IS GOD. If you have an IQ above 50 you would understand what I'm saying. So far you haven't.Please explain to me what the definition of God is? Then tell me whether or not that definition means He is better than any human alive. It does right?... hmmmm..... So doesn't that mean by following somebody who knows all is the right way in life?... I don't know about you, but to me I would follow somebody who knew everything and would do the best for me rather than to follow somebody who knew quite a bit and would do the best for me. ANYday.Ofcourse People need other people to guide them. THAT IS WHY GOD SENDS DOWN PROPHETS. They are there to tell people God's word.
