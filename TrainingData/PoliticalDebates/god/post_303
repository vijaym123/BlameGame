Get it in to your head Jesus was not a christ he was just an ordinary man going around with a lot of men, making magic which at that time people would believe all they were told and thought it was true. God is supposed to be invisible knows everything, let him stop wars then, stop   poverty  ,stop priests abusing   children  ,   islam     women   burning themselves to death for fear of what their husbands will do to them. People are still trying to get on the band wagon and make themselves important. Even some will confess to a   murder   they have'nt done to get notarity. Why does your   god   hate me so, i dont hate him. No answer to that I suppose. If a priest told you that he had seen Elvis Presley lat week would you believe him. Well maybe you would after all he only speaks gods word.
