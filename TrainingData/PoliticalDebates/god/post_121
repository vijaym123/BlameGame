I am a bit disappointed in the human race. The human race as a whole has tried for centuries to X out God and any religious ideas and characteristics. I am rather embarrased of the ignorance of men. Anyways, this has to be the most silly question in history-if you're educated and have any sense of moral sense you would agree. If the world wasn't created by the Supreme Being (GOD), than how else would it have gotten here. If any one person (or organization) expect me to ever believe that Earth one day just decided to appear in space and isolate the water from land and create it's own self a moon and set the sun impeccably in it's place and everything revolve and correlate in it's proper manner every morning-day-season-year etc.,, Than they are the most foolish, silly alive. There is but one explaination of the being of Earth and that's through Jesus Chridst himself. I am not typing this to reprimand, discourage or convert but simply to make a "common sensed" point to any and all readers that come across this comment. As the literary C.S. Lewis once said, "You either believe in God or don't... " He himself gave numerous reasons as to the reason that God does exist and how He is the creator of all things living and non living; dead and alive. Just a simple point to leave you with: If God didn't create the world and everything in it, then who did? Are we seriously, as "educated" men and women suggesting that we all derive from monkeys??!! I would hope that we 'educated' people no better than this. God is, was, and is to come. God Bless every reader. :) I'm still disappointed at our ignorance though :(
