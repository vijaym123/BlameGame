Stop down voting me i like having a debate but if everytime I leave a comment you down vote I'm just going to stop. i have stopped down voting you. It's almost an unfair format in here being one of the few and only conservative Christians in this entire CreateDebate it's like being fed to the Lions. That's why any conservative in here gets jumped all over, there's nothing to argue agianst when all of you our on the same belief. You guys need someone like me to make it interesting.
