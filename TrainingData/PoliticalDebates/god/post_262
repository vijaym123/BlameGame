Of course not.  There's no evidence for any kind of entity that somehow stands outside of existence and "creates" it.One should recognize that matter cannot be created or destroyed.  It is. It always was and always will be.  Matter changes its form but it does not cease to exist.  The notion of God goes back to pre-historic times when men sought an explanation for the universe and its contents. It was an understandable thing to do.  But now thanks to many geniuses---philosophers such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand and scientists such as Galileo and Newton---we've come to understand much about the universe and about the nature of man and how he learns and the legitimate forms of knowledge.  There is still much to learn.  To learn it, we certainly should put aside ancient myths.  Mysticism always leads to brutality. Faith and force go together.  Those not dedicated to reason seek to force others to believe as they do. Religion is an immoral institution and it starts with the notion that some omnipotent, infallible god in on somebody's side and others must be forced to believe it.  Consider the Crusades, the Inquisition, the witch hunts and today's latest "fad" suicide bombers.  All these kill themselves and others in the name of their god. No, Virginia, there is no God. Human beings are responsible for their actions.  Nature is a wonderful benevolent place.  But as Lord Bacon said, "To command nature, we must obey it."  So one should put all one's intellectual effort into understanding it and leave off with the wishful thinking and fantasies of religions.
