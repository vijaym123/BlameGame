In the first place there has to be a first cause. We have to start somewhere. In   science   this is called the Unified Force. Since   energy   can neither be created nor destroyed it is infinite. Science also teaches that it is beyond direct observation so it is unknowable. So the Unified Force splits into the Strong Force, the Weak Force and Electromagnetism, creating the Universe.There are then two questions. First, what is the difference between the Unified Force and God? In both cases we have an infinite, unknowable force creating the Universe. Second, what caused the Unified Force to break itself apart?
