What a pile of ridiculousness. The bible was not created all at once, and it's many authors definitely didn't have just one intention. All that God is perfect love talk is just utter white noise. I doubt you even understand what you said. You certainly didn't make a point.People do not need God or religion to do good things for others. And NO, it is not that hard to do good things for others. Your admission of that proves you need to coaxed by religion to do those good things.
