Your point being? You are making a claim an illogical   god   exists without any evidence to support your claim. It's called burden of proof--you can't simply claim there is a god and follow up with "You can't prove me wrong! So I must be right!"By the way, I only vote "no" because there is very likely not one. Few atheists really believe there is no god, we simply don't believe there is one. There's a difference.
