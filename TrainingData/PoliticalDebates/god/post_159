 Thanks pbeaird for affirming this tested presumption. Antony Garrard Newton Flew calls it the presumption of agnosticism [before his dotage]. It is  a procdedure, a heuristic device.Those non-observations affirm the ignostic-Ockham challenges that either God is fatuous or unartfully redundant,contrary to Alister McGrath. Yes, that extra action means resorting to convoluted ad hoc assumptions, greater than what one was to explain! Yes, there can be no presumption of supernaturalism- Alvin Platinga's warrant for God as a basic belief. That presumption is the pareidolia- like seeing Yeshua in a tortilla-  of seeing a caring,Super Mind behind Existence. That pareidolia is then a mere feeling without substance. Presumption is what one starts with, so one perforce has to start with the naturalist one! One has to employ those observations, accept other minds and the external world and trust in ones mind from trial and error, contrary to C.Lewis and Alvin Platinga argument from reason [ a teleological argument] as basic.  pbeaird, again thanks.  Please come over to Amazon religious discussions!
