The foundation of this debate is the false premise that God and   science   are mutually exclusive. They are not. Top scientists such as Einstein, F. Collins, Joel Primack, and others all, at least, believe in A supreme being, creator, etc. Many would argue that science is the ongoing discovery of God Himself.The statement "There is no God" is scientifically reckless. It is a position which can not be supported by process and experiment. However, the inverse is also true. Logically speaking, it is also unsound. If a human on earth can guarantee that there is no   god   anywhere in the universe, then they are claiming to be the very definition of god through their argument... an all-knowing being larger than life itself could only make such a claim.As a scientist, I can not rightfully deny the equal possibility that God exists.As a human, I choose to believe God exists.
