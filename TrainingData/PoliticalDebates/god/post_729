A "cult" in the ancient world was simply a religion devoted to the worship of one deity or deities from a broader pantheon -- a religious practice or "veneration". "Cults" in the ancient world were more like the ordinary, run-of-the-mill religions of today; referring to an ancient cult doesn't really correspond to the modern-day usage of "cult" at all. I wouldn't dismiss the religions of antiquity so lightly.
