I was born christian and brought up in catholic school. Later on i realised the rubbish that religion is. Most religions are a group of people coming together to nod at a wall for an hour. All the main religions grow for one reason; Child indoctrination. Christianity did it throughout the 1700's, stealing children from their families "baptising them" and bringing them up as fanatics. All religions grab the attention of young children with false promises and teach them to ignore and hate all other points of view. Religion is just indoctrination, hitler did it exactly the same way religion did it and it must be stopped. There is no need for a god. Evolution says there isn't and thanks to the missing link being proved yesterday ir is proven and there is no argument against it apart from the usual religious argument of shouting No repeatedly until you go away. God has no place in this universe the only evidence of his existence are old books written by men. probably insane men.
