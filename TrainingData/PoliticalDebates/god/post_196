..the fact that yourargument states that the universe didn't exist in the potency of a former state to become this one. Nice that you think that, but it's seems presumptuous. makes me wonder, do you possess and t-shirts with a large capital A on it? A the scene of an accident, you can rush forward rip off your buttoned up shirt and proclaim.. 'if he/she dies, that's the end of the road..'back to the point, (i really think an accompanied video with you blowing bubbles could have added some ground to your argument.) I think the most direct and clear paradox of life is.. the lack of entropy. The perpetual state of dynamics, of life. in the very universe itself. I don't think you've ever considered that. I think it's the most blatantly profound truth in   existence  . With our limited understanding of physical   science  , this is an impossibility. So this big mysterious factor even fits with your terms, so one must conclude the likely hood that your conclusion is absolutely wrong. Our sceince says something had to do it. brain waves, the fabric of time,... we have a lot we don't understand.. but evidently there is a something. ever dream of something that didn't happen yet? happens to people everyday. apparently, the physical world is just scratching the surface to reality. now consider the reality of metaphysical ideas. These ideas, being substantial.. now do things make more sense?
