I apologise.  I thought you were sensible and were going to give me some good references.  The Discovery Institute is NOT creditable.  I am well aware of the site.  Many of the "peer reviewed" material are just books, which are not peer reviewed.  I notice that the article that Richard Sternberg sneaked into a niche journal on classification and which was later repudiated as being sub-standard makes the list.  Obviously, whatever science education you have had at university hasn't taught you critical thinking, and I would like to know what courses you have actually had?
