"the burden of disproof of the theory of the existence of God is placed squarely upon my opposition in this debate."Absolutely ridiculous. How about some more quotes? "Every claim requires evidence, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".Science does not busy itself with disproving *anything*. There's no point in disproving what does not exist.  Rather, the burden is on Christian's to provide evidence for their extraordinary claims. Science is simple, and you seem to have the whole process backwards.The burden of proof is on those who make the claim, not on those who remain skeptical of outrageous claims.The null position is atheism. We are ALL atheists when we are born. We are then taught a religion. The null position is atheism and any deviance from null requires evidence, oh which you have none.
