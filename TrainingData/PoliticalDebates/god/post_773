I agree with your rebuttal JB. It makes so much sense. Even though I am a believer in God and my life has been worth living, I don't often think that God has His eye on me personally. If, at my end, I find there is or isn't a God, my life will have had the structure of a Christian belief system and the benefit of living for life itself with no particular end.
