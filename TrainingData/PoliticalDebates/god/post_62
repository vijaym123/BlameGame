User cmseth wrote, "You make the assumption that God created matter and therefore created the universe. Have you ever considered the idea that God simply organized existing matter to form (not create) the universe?"I thought the whole point of a god was being the creator. Supposing that there was matter around before a god came into existence undermines the very definition of a god. Your argument means that god arose from matter, and that matter is the ultimate creator of the universe and not a god. This makes zero sense at all.
