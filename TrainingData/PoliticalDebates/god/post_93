If people understood what they were reading in the book called, "The Bible", we wouldn't be asking the question "Is there a   god  "? The Bible says God is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Well let's find some truth here. Ever outlines a sentence before? God IS--is what? A Spirit. Now what is a Spirit and why is that word capitolized? The book is putting emphasis on the word "Spirit". Does that say God is a man? No. It says God is a Spirit. What is the definition of the word spirit? It is the thinking, feeling, motivating part of man. Spirits or feelings motivate us to do certain things. Again, the Bible says that "God IS love". God IS--is what? LOVE. Is Love a man or a feeling? In another verse it reads, GOOD IS GOD. Are we pronouncing that word God correctly? Is it really pronounced G-odd or is that word really GOOD? The Bible is a spiritual book. It's soul purpose to is convict man of his or her wrong doing in life. The Bible also says it IS the Book of LIFE. That is exactly what it is. It is about life itself. Why do people want to prove that there is NO GOD? Whether you atheists believe it or not--I bet you all have the Spirit of Love and Good living inside of you too. And I also bet that everyone of you can find your very own life hidden within the pages of that book called, "The Bible". Just keep reading until you see yourself in the mirror. One day you will be able to relate one of the stories to your life.
