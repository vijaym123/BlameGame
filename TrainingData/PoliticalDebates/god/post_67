"Is there a God?" is a metaphysical question that asks about the nature of reality.  To paraphrase: "Does a God exist as part of reality?" This is the WRONG question to be asking.  We should be asking "Is there any reason to believe in God?".  This is an epistemological question that relates to MAN'S KNOWLEDGE concerning the nature of reality.  I am open to the existence of a God, but only if I am presented with objective evidence that one exists; evidence that cannot be explained more plausibly by another hypothesis.  This view is common sense.  Arbitrary assertions are not true until proven false, they are false until proven true.  This is as true about the assertion "God exists" as it about the assertion "invisible elephants live on Mars".  The burden lies with those making the positive claim to prove it.  Hence, theists must prove God exists, and until they do, I have no reason to believe in one.  Of course, since faith is belief WITHOUT evidence, I'm not even sure why theists WANT to prove that God exists.  Proof would destroy faith.  Evidence would turn faith into science, and would reduce God to an analyzable PART of the natural world, demoting him from his position as the  supernatural Creator.
