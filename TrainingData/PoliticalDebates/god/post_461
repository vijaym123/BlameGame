First, let me say thank you for leaving a response instead of simply voting me down like the rest of these jerks :)Now then..."How do you suppose the Big Bang came to be?"I don't know. And neither do you. It is impossible to answer this question. It could have been God. It could have been space aliens. It could have been ten dimensional space rocks crashing together. The universe could simply have always existed. There are an infinite number of possible explanations."And what about miracles?"A "miracle" is just something we haven't found the cause of yet. Do you have any particular examples?See also: confirmation bias."look at the intricacy of the trees, etc."This is the Argument from Design. I respond with the Argument from Poor Design. One example of poor design: In human females, the birth canal passes through the pelvis. If an infant's head is too big they will not fit and before c-sections death for the mother was the usual result.There are many, many other examples of poor design. To me the evidence points not to an all-powerful, benevolent designer, but rather a universe ruled by non-intelligent patterns emerging from chaos.
