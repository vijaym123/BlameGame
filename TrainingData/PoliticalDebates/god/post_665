I haven't downvoted you in days, man."Fed to the lions"? Because people disagree with you? Oh please.You sound a wee bit paranoid, mate. I'm not downvoting you, and nobody is "persecuting" you either. You've been quite free to express your opinions. If you don't like the fact that people can respond to your opinions by voting them up or down or by posting their own counter-arguments, you are in the wrong forum.
