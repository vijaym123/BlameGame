why are people so skeptic, just because there isnt much evidence, doesnt mean that God doesnt exist!Im only a teenager, but i believe that there has to be something out there watching over us all, otherwise nothing really makes u cant sense.We have to have faith...I agree, what happens when you die? it's hardly like a tv going blank. Your soul cant just die.
