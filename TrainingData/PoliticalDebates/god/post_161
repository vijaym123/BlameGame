The absence of proof is not proof of absence, but I must admit at the end of the day, I have no reason to believe that god exists. So as Richard Dawkins points out in his book, The God Delusion, we should be as skeptical of God's existence as we are of the existence of a teapot that orbits the earth and can't be be observed by any of our human senses. So, we can't say with certainty that God or the teapot doesn't exist but there is still a lack of evidence as a whole for God's existence.
