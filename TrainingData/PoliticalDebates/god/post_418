I usually want to stay out of these types of debates, but I'm voting just to get the YES!! side off of 666 votes (that's just sick irony). Yes, I believe in God. I am a Christian, and I hate it when God and science are compared. I don't see why God couldn't have just set evolution in motion. Genisis says that God made Adam from the dirt and dust. That is exactly where the small mammals that we supposedly evolved from came from. :-o It makes you think doesn't it.Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
