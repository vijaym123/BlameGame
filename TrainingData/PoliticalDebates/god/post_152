Actually, God described a round earth in the Old Testiment, but man later put upon religion (not truth), that the earth was flat.  Why would you assume that a simple understanding of some of the forces of nature disproves God's existance?  We still don't know much.  We discover new vitamins each year, we argue global warming (now safely named "climate change" because of the cooler past 10 years), we struggle over dark matter theories and time/space challenges... what makes us think we can rule out God when we don't understand.  You claim that science has always found evidence.  I politely disagree.  I believe there is much more we don't know than what we assume we know.  The latest theory of the universe is that our section of universe exists in a time-space bubble, different from the rest of all that exists.  This would explain the behavior of forces we can't understand, as though we are seeing through a "glass, dimly".  Apparently, the scientists biggest problem with this otherwise plauable explaination is that it would mean that the earth, and our portion of the universe are truly special, unique.  I guess that this scientific theory would come close to saying that it may be as God said after all.  (not that any understanding of the universe is contrary to an understanding of God).  But I call that biased science.  You don't really think we know it all, do you?
