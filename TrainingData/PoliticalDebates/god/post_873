 What do you mean He doesn't exist?! He is all around us. It apparent that God created everything, for how did everything turn out so perfect? And if you insult us Christians with that "big bang theory," you are wrong! How could an accident make the very creation around us perfect in almost every way? There must and there is a greater plan behind creation.
