I find it interesting your weak way of discrediting a reputable scientist, but say noting of Ruse who has said himself that Behe is a reputable scientist. They have even contributed in a book together called "Debating Design." I suppose because you say it that it is true, then it is true. Are you familiar with Lenin, " ÒA lie told often enough becomes truth. You obviously do not know much about the scientific community, nor the scientist and their work. Perhaps if you have read Behe instead of goggling weak arguments you would know that he has demonstrated such support, and well known reputable arguments. Behe has demonstrated several examples in micro-biology including the flagellum, and Bacillus subtilis. Your best bet would to pick a topic and debate it, instead of using a strawman attack on a scientist. As for Collins, you obviously have not read his material either. Collins arguments are not philosophical they are mathematical and measurable. For example just one parameter: if gravity were stronger by only one part in a trillion trillion trillion the universe would have collapsed back on itself. My   advice   is to not argue vaguely, but to use logical cogent reason free from ideology and fallacious reasoning. Know the facts, submit the facts, interpret the data, and remember. "Science doesn't provide us with truth. The practice of scientific investigation involves tools that help us explain how the physical world might work. The explanation doesn't have to be true to be useful, just consistent with most of the evidence." (Spencer)  Thank you for you time I hope you put more thought into your next argument.Other scientist to read... Guillermo Gonzalez, Jay W Richards
