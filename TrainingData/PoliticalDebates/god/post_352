What evidence is there that everything didnt happen by chance? Dont things happen to people by chance every day, or is everything that happens, good or bad, God's plan? Though i do realize that it "feels" good to think that there is a creator than that everything happened by chance, whether or not the former is true is always up for debate. I am currently in a battle within myself, especially after reading Thomas Paine's Age of Reason, even though it is a totally deistic view of religion. The FACT is, God didnt give us a book called the Bible, the Catholic church found the Books in the Bible and decided which books would be called the Word of God, with no chance of debating the actual existence of such a thing.
