Ive tried to talk to "god," and he fails to make himself real to me in much the same way he fails to make himself real to the 4000 Africans who starve to death every day. When "god" shows to me that he can feed those starving people, or fix the economy, or do something that has a real impact besides making me feel better for a little bit, I'll start believing. Until then "god" can't do anymore for me than heroin can. I can feel euphoria for half an hour, but at the end of the day nothing has changed.
