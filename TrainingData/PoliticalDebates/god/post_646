"With out an author, everything then becomes a matter of personal preference and interpretation"everything is still personal preference and interpretation - which god to believe in, which texts get canonized, and their applicability and meaning given current circumstancesperfect justice, meaning, etc. are only perceived implications - they do not provide evidence for a god, nor specify what god to believe. it is just as likely that we invented and hold on to religion because we want to believe those things exist
