Concerning the blind guy and the color blue thread,You missed another very important aspect of that analogy (not that you're not already getting beat up enough over it.)But the most important difference of all is that,you are not blind.It's not a matter of a bunch of people who do see, then telling one who does not about a color.It's a matter of a bunch of people, all of which can see, telling eachother that a color none of these visually able individuals have ever seen, exists.You see?Why would it be do you think, that you, who obviously believe in god, has not witnessed this god?Wouldn't god want everyone who believed in him to know they weren't just wasting their time with all that praying and church?I mean, there's examples all over the bible of him making himself known in some observable way.Why not to you? If you believe.Hm, maybe you're not good enough.Maybe he's testing you,or just doesn't like you.Whatever the reason, no one has seen much of anything from him for a couple thousand years at least.It doesn't make sense to me that there even would be a god.But if there were, he just seems like kind of an asshole at this point,and I wouldn't want much to do with him either way.
