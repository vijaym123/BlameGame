Rabbi, I am not sure whether you're aware of the purpose of debate. Let me clue you in: to present arguments which make a case for your side. Aside from your rather strange attempt at claiming that popular belief in some kind of   god   gives the idea credibility, I've seen no such attempt by you. Most theists at least try to come up with a logical argument to make their pre-existing beliefs seem viable, but you seem to have given up before you've even started!Instead, you've apparently come to the debate with the arrogant conclusion that you don't need to make any serious attempt at rationalizing belief in god. Why?Your claims about faith seem a little odd as well, less of an argument and more of an excuse. Why, if you are so willing to believe and base your life off of faith in a god without any evidence, why not believe in anything without evidence? Don't believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Why not? Where is the difference?I'm almost ashamed the atheist side (which, by the way, atheists generally do not believe there is no god, but instead simply have a lack of belief--shame on the way this debate was set up, as well) didn't have a remotely serious opponent.
