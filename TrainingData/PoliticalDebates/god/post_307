Those examples you gave are things that we can demonstrate to others. The sun feels warm, produces light, we can measure all of it's attributes. If you are going to claim that because literally every person could have a completely different way of conceiving   god   that that would mean that God is everything to everyone. He can be anything you want him/her/it to be! So which is more likely: an amorphous being that is beyond description and consistently contradictory... or a figment of our imaginations?Ponder that one.
