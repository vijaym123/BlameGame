 So here is the way i look at it, for what its worth, and i am not sure which side i should be on.  There is no proof of the existence of God, but for many there is evidence that points in that direction:  It's like we are part of a painting, and we are trying to figure out the nature of the artist or if there is an artist at all.  All we have to go on is the painting.  The scientist looks at the molecular composition of the paint and the canvas and says there is only what we see.  You have no evidence to claim the artist exists.  Then there are some who say that yes there is a painting therefore there is an artist, he lives and he is beautiful.  Then there are those who look at the composition of the painting and says there is evidence pointing toward an artist, and we can pretty much figure his meaning.  Some people look at the purpose and meaning of life and existence and see the direction of humanity with its struggles and triumphs and the very evolution of the individual as evidence of  "a God as we understand him".  It is in this connecting of the dots that some of us find evidence, but no proof.  />   /> There are some who have had profound religious experiences that further enforce that belief.  Those experiences are just as real to the individual as any scientific proof that can be produced.  It may not hold up as factual data, but it does not diminish the experience and its meaning to the individual.  For these people their faith is as real as music is real, but also just as invisible.
