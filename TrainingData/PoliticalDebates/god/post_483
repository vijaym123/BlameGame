#originalTopic=Does_God_really_Exist
This is a poorly asked debate question. That is like me asking someone from Ireland if they even know who Vishnu or Rama is ( God of India ). I believe that God and Jesus Christ do exist. I believe that according to my religion that what is said is true. Without a doubt I do not want to believe that when I die the screen goes black like my TV when the power goes out. That I refuse to believe, I want to think that I stand in front of the golden gates of heaven and that the doors open to me. We can look back into history and we can find flaws in the Bible. The flood that betook the Earth the flood that Noah had built an Arc for. Their are many religions that have their own excuses for the cause of that event! Back into many ancient religions a flood was caused by the Gods! All in all I lean like a mime into something YES i am unable to see BUT do I believe? Yes without a doubt! Think of a blind man, and ask him the question does the color blue really exist?
