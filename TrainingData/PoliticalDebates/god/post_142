" Assuming that we are correct that we humans are the most complex life-forms created, it is reasonable to assume that the world’s Source is capable of at least as much complexity as we reflect."If you really believed in god that's the by far the most insulting thing ever said.We're a tiny spec in our own galaxy and we're the most complex life-form?  We're formed on the ghost of Sagittarius, life probably started from the ashes of the previous galaxy. Where that came from I don't know.  The only language that will be able to tell us this will math, of that much I'm entirely sure.
