I can say from experience that as a former soldier, I had government run health care, and all of my expenses were paid for. I had free medical care, free medicine, free surgeries, free dental, free vision, even breast implants if I wanted. The government run health care that I had was great. They did not do unnecessary tests, they found the cause of the illness and treated it. I did not go to the doctor every time I had a runny nose, and if I did have to have a surgery or other major medical procedure, yes I would need to be scheduled in, but after now being in the civilian world, I find that I still have to schedule to have major medical procedures done, but at a much larger cost to me (with private insurance). Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money. I wonder if anyone has thought about their post retirement age, when medicare (if it is still around) will be something you need to utilize? Isn't that government run? After you retire, unless you are one of the lucky that has for your entire life budgeted your money to save enough to live on after you are unable to work, and still afford private health care, how do you propose to manage? It will be government run.
