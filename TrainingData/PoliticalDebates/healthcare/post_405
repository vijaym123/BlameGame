First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense. But in any case, your argument only makes sense -- national-healthcare systems spend less because they choose to spend less -- if the results were worse...if the choice led to worse healthcare. But this clearly isn't the case. The US spends more -- vastly more -- on healthcare per capita than the Western national systems, and yet...* Tens of millions of people are not directly covered by the system * Most of these people do not receive good healthcare, because they simply can't afford it themselves* Citizens under the national-healthcare systems live longer* Babies born in the national-healthcare systems are more likely to survive* Citizens under the national-healthcare systems are healthier than Americans* There's no evidence that the enormous extra cost of the American system provides any real benefits over the service received by citizens of countries with national-healthcare systems!
