"Let's think about this one. Under the system that we currently have, the people decide what is best. Collectively. Apparently, 56% of voters here desire universal health care. This is a huge issue nationwide."If a majority believes in an unfounded idea, it's still an unfounded idea. "The state that we elect exists to serve the needs and desires of the people... not to promote capitalism."Hence why many want to minimize it altogether. "And, if capitalism didn't interfere with government as much as government does capitalism, it would have happened long ago."How the hell does capitalism interfere with government more than vise-versa?
