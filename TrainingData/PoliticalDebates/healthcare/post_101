Following majority support for public option is tyranny of majority. Appeal to the majority is nothing more than tyranny of the majority and means absolutely nothing to whether a public insurance option is worth it or will even help. Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?
