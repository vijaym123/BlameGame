 There is no such thing as "free" healthcare.  Someone will have to pay for it.  If you mean, somebody else should pay for my healthcare because I can't or don't want to, then that's a different debate.  Certainly, healthcare isn't an equal right if some are paying for themselves and others, and others are contributing nothing.
