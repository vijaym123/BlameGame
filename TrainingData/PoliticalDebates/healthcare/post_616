Universal healthcare isn't perfect nor is individual healthcare. I support universal healthcare because I believe that if we can develop a system in America that will grant all citizens the medical care they need we can make it better than our current system. And if we face the issues of waiting-lists for surgery we must find a way to make sure that all of our citizens receive quality round the clock healthcare.
