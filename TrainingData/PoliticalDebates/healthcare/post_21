 Public option monopoly squeezes health care suppliers, doctors Gregory Mankiw. "The pitfalls of the public option". New York Times. June 27, 2009: "Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad? [...] A dominant government insurer [...] could potentially keep costs down by squeezing the suppliers of health care. This cost control works not by fostering honest competition but by thwarting it. [...] If the government has a dominant role in buying the services of doctors and other health care providers, it can force prices down. Once the government is virtually the only game in town, health care providers will have little choice but to take whatever they can get. It is no wonder that the American Medical Association opposes the public option."
