 Expensive public insurance option would worsen national debt Karl Rove. "How to Stop Socialized Health Care" Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2009: "the public option is far too expensive. The cost of Medicare -- the purest form of a government-run 'public choice' for seniors -- will start exceeding its payroll-tax 'trust fund' in 2017. The Obama administration estimates its health reforms will cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. It is no coincidence the Obama budget nearly triples the national debt over that same period. [...] Medicare and Medicaid cost much more than estimated when they were adopted. One reason is there's no competition for these government-run insurance programs. In the same way, Americans can expect a public option to cost far more than the Obama administration's rosy estimates."
