....thanks, but that's not communism.  It's a distortion.  How many people died under the distortion of capitalism?  I don't know... but quite a lot.   People still do because "capitalism" supports "communism".  Or, maybe you haven't noticed that production has all but ceased here and has been moved to places where profit is maximized but at a human cost?Now...  it's a common idea that there's no such thing as altruism.  It's an argument. That's all..... and it's a very easy argument to make and a hard one to argue against. But what about Mother Theresa?... but what about some regular person? Greater reward....  that's why.  Mother Theresa did all those things because of the ultimate, and purely selfish act of getting into heaven.   It doesn't mean you don't appreciate human life.... but acting in self-interest is the reason behind most actions.   I made my new neighbors vegan brownies because I want them to like me... that way they'll call 911 if my house is on fire.   Purely selfish.... but I do think they're nice people and I hope they enjoy the brownies (which were Not goopy, amazingly).
