I am not disputing that productive people lead to success however, making them pay it back will set them back even further in the long run, therefore, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. It is possible to have strict regulation to prevent people from taking advantage without making them pay it back. Such as, a required amount of resumes handed out and interviews a week, weekly or monthly checkups on people who are unsuccessful at finding jobs and you could even provide access to job placement agencies.
