Individual health care is better for all involved:First why individual is better:--Free market system allows for innovation on the part of the healthcare industries, creating new and better, and more than likely cheaper, medicines and procedures. A socialized system will put a cease to competition, and will thus end almost all source of motivation for innovation.--Allows for more areas of the economy for the government to have tax income from.Now, why socialized is worse:--Very high tax hikes, the government needs to pay for the health care of an entire nation, which will inevitably come from tax payers pockets. Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets. Since all of this will be paid for in taxes, which will be spread out evenly throughout the social classes, thus each person will, on average, be paying just as much, if not more, for health care. Since everyone will be using different amounts of this health care, some people will be paying for more than they are using, and others using more than what they are paying for. This goes against every tenet of a free market system.--Will inevitably reduce the quality of the doctors, procedures, and medicines. Since all governments want to have the lowest budget possible. Any government will look to the cheapest options, which will most likely be the lowest in quality. --Further more, the amount of bureaucracy necessary to regulate and record these new industries will be incredible, adding to the tax increase, but also creating a waiting period for people who need all sorts of medicines and procedures.As you can see a free market, individual, health care is the better system for all involved.
