You said: "Again, I only see people on the (cough) deep left misreading statements and statistics."I'm sure that's all you see. Now let's look at some of the things that you said."I was directed that label at YOU, not Canada or any of the other countries" Here you admit to making an ad hominem attack. "[A]ny of the other countries you cite as having a 2 year life expectancy difference."An obvious misreading. I didn't say this. I pointed out the difference in life expectancy between the United States, Australia and Canada. The gap in life expectancy is different. If you are going to preach misreading, please read carefully yourself.The difference between spending and costing. The GDP includes both private and Government expenditure, so I think this answers your objection. Please see   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product  #The_components_of_GDP"Wow, 80.4 (Canada) vs. 78.06 (US). I feel such a small difference would have more to do with the nature of fast food America and almost nothing to do with healthcare."Where is your evidence that America is more addicted (or less) to fast food than Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom? This is a guess on your part. Please present your evidence." that tiny minute 2-year difference " This is a curious value judgment. I presume that you pay for private health insurance. If so, I suggest you feel that way because you feel the difference doesn't apply to you."You have yet to take those factors into account and prove it's just the UHC that gives that tiny difference." As I see it, the difference in life expectancy is certain, and one of the possible differences is the absence of a universal health scheme in the United States. It is for you to show credible evidence that the lack of health care does NOT have a part to play.
