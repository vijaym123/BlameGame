US government will favor public insurance; no level playing-field. Stuart Butler. "The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage". Heritage Foundation. July 28, 2009: "It's simply impossible to believe the claims by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and others that Congress really will do nothing to disrupt the level playing field by favoring the public plan. With Congress as both umpire and a team manager, one thing is clear: it will favor its own team. The result is the public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage."
