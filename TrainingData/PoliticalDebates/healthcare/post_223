 Free, universal health care would devastate the insurance industry "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?" Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.  A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary. All companies in that area would have to go out of business, meaning all people employed in the industry would be out of work. A number of hospital record clerks that dealt with insurance would also be out of work. A number of these unemployed would be able to get jobs in the new government bureaucracy, but it would still be a long, painful transition. We'd also have to once again go through a whole new round of patient record creation and database construction, which would cost huge amounts of both time and money."
