I am a former soldier, but let's just say for a second that I wasn't. Let's say I have been working for a company for the past 12 years and got laid off because of this recession we are in. Now I'm not working, but should I get the "free money" you refer to or should I go without because of the turn our economy has taken? I'm sure you are aware of the current unemployment rates. There are thousands of people who are not working from no fault of their own. Or should it just be the homeless that are denied. Exactly who are you referring to that you don't want to have healthcare sir?
