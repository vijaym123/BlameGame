 Pursuit of bipartisan reform should not hold up public option Paul Waldman. "The 10 dumbest arguments against health-care reform." The American Prospect. July 28, 2009: "What we really need is a 'bipartisan' health-reform bill -- and if Democrats act properly, they could get one. The myth that "bipartisan" legislation works better than partisan legislation is widespread, but virtually no real evidence supports it. [...] More important, Republicans are not going to vote for this health-care reform, no matter what the final bill looks like. Chances are it will get zero Republican votes in the House and maybe two Republican votes in the Senate, tops. Anyone who thinks more optimistically has been partaking of too many free samples from pharmaceutical lobbyists."
