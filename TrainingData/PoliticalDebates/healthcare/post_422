First, this entire argument is nothing but assertion -- you claim that profits positively affect cost and quality of health care in the title, but provide no actual evidence in your article for this claim.  The only support given is a single article, no citation given, which claims nonprofit hospitals charge more, which is not in itself evidence that profits are good for the system.  (Since it's impossible to know what article you're referring to, there is no way to check the data the reporters used to make sure they're making the right comparisons and drawing the correct inferences; it's not even possible to verify that the WSJ article actually backs your position.)But let's accept the unsupported statement that profits have a positive effect for a moment.  Even granting that, this article undercuts its relevance to the larger discussion with this statement:"Thus, there are a lot of profits still being made in the single-payer systems, and there are a lot of nonprofits in the U.S. system."As near as I can tell (since this article does a poor job of relating to the broader discussion), the point being made is that our system of health care is good because it allows profits, so it positively affects health care.  In the quote above, we see that a single-payer system also allows profits, so we should conclude that it also positively affects health care.  In what way is this article supposed to support the 'no' side of the universal health care argument?  If we accept everything written here unquestioningly, we still end up with no reason to come down on one side of the debate or the other.
