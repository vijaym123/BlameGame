I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes. But, altogether, it is not my responsibility to "make up" for anyone elses well being. I don't have insurance, and you know what, when I DO have to go the doctor, I get in quicker than someone with insurance. Also, the majority of doctors' offices will set you up on a monthly billed cycle. If I become terminally sick, that's my problem, nobody elses. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
