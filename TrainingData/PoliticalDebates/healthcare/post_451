And to answer Kuk's debate exactly,1. It is fairly socialistic, so is the military, fire departments, police, and education, and those are all good things. It maintains the good properties of capitalism as there would still be the exact same incentives to come up with new cures and the free market is still free to compete. Anyone with funding could still start a health insurance company if they think they can do it better, the ones that exist aren't being shut down. The only difference would be they have rules... which obviously they don't want.2. Support for healthcare reform is actually overwhelming. More people are for it than are for Obama,it's anywhere from 70-77% approval. linkThe health insurance industry is spending millions every day to fight it, and as is sometimes the case with money, it's louder than people.I think though that once people become more aware of the actual facts, and as the proposed bills become more available to the public like that link I provided in the arguement above, that 70-77% will start being more vocal about their support.
