#originalTopic=Universal_Healthcare
It is time for Universal health care for several reasons.1. It will grow the economy, by letting consumers and business keep more of their money that goes to pay health care premiums which amounts to a hidden tax.2. Americans shouldn't have to be forced to lose everything they worked their entire life for just because they got sick, and cannot afford to pay their hospital bill.3. Every other industrialized nation has it, which puts our business at a disadvantage.4. In the current system, those of us who have health care insurance end up paying for those who don't because hospitals pass the cost onto the insurance companies in higher costs to recover for those who don't pay. So it is already socialism.5. We spend more than any other country in the world on health care and yet we have 49 million Americans who aren't covered and we rank 33rd in the world in care. France spends about half of what we do and are ranked 1st.6. if it is done right it will be a system that offers Americans another choice in care, and provide competition for the private sector which should drive down the cost overall. More choice equals more freedom. And Freedom is what this country is all about baby!
