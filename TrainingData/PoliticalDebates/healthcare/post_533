In Japan, everyone gets equal treatment because everyone gets national health care. In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair. In Massachusetts, there is Masshealth for poor people, but it's only Medicare which covers nothing. so if you get into an accident, you will end up paying thousands of money. There are so many people living in this country. I don't understand why we don't have national health care. What annoys me is that medicare and a dental plan are two separate things. I've visiting a dentist because I have to get rid of my wisdom teeth which is a lot of money with no dental insurance. one tooth costs you about 350 dollars. Since I have 4 wisdom teeth, it will cost me about 1500 bucks in total. Do people expect a college student to have that much money? I have 2 jobs, but I don't even get more than $1000 every month. I am really frustrated with American health insurance.
