If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we? Oh, the answer is GREEDY insurance companies that buy your Rep & Senator. When the Clinton proposal was made they paid $125,000,000 to defeat the measure. Next time it will be a BILLION DOLLARS if they feel the need to spend that much. FIRE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND VOTE OUT ANYONE THAT STANDS IN THE WAYjust my opinion...
