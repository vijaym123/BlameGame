The flaw in your logic is that you think that health insurance is the best and cheapest way to provide health care. Health care insurance means that you are paying for (not only the doctors, the hospital's overhead, etc. but you are also paying for) everyone else that works for the insurance company. A company that's in business to make money. Money that could go towards actual health care instead of the insurance's pockets.But lets follow your logic and see where it leads. Most people don't require health care every day. But the do require food every day. Now, since it is inhumane to let people go hungry, we should have nationalized meals for every citizen (a roast in every pot). But we need people in place to collect the money and distribute the money, etc. We'll call them the Nutrition Insurance Group (NIG). now, they need to get paid for their services but where is that money coming from? Oh yeah, the people. But it now cost more money to feed the same amount of people because we now have to pay for the NIG. No problem, we cut back on their rations (they're too fat anyway) and on the quality of the food. Now once people get used to the idea of NIG, we can raise the price of food because, "Don't worry about it. The insurance will take care of it." (I was literally told this by a doctor who wanted to perform what I considered to be a questionable procedure. He was adamant that it was necessary until I mentioned that I did not have insurance.)Or we can leave it (conserve it) as it is (which is why we call ourselves conservatives). A pan handler can get at least $15 a day and get 3 happy meals at Mickey D's ;)And no, I don't hate the poor. I just hate the fact that I am forced to provide for them. Poor people should either provide for themselves or force the Liberals to provide for them (without any help from conservatives ;).
