Here's the thing.  I'm a Viet Nam vet currently on my wife's insurance, so I'm happy with the system as long as my wife keeps her job.  So the only reason I want universal   health care   is to make sure that everyone else remains healthy and won't contaminate me.  That's my right, to not be infected by some untreated disease carried around by one of the uninsured.  Of course if my wife gets laid off like a few dozen of her co-workers did last week, then I'm totally screwed.  Oh, I'll get health care somehow, but you will pay for it with higher insurance premiums etc.  So thanks for that. Looking to the Declaration of Independence for   legal   precedence sets a dangerous precedent.  It was not ratified by "the people", just the signers.  Would Tom Jefferson walk by a pour soul having a grand mal seizure?  Or John Hancock ignore some wretch bleeding to death on the sidewalk from a knife attack?  These were honorable men, and I'll betcha they would all be horrified that a country with so much wealth, and so much medical knowledge and   technology   would withhold it from anyone who needed it.Universal health care doesn't have to mean single payer, or rationed care, or loss of control over your choices of providers.  There's plenty of smart folks in this country and we'll figure it out for you.  Just get out of the way so compassion and common sense can prevail.And having been drafted, I was an enslaved soldier for almost two years.  You're welcome.
