Your comment regarding the government controlling health care, "if only to keep costs down." Which is precisely the issue. My familys health care premiums have risen from $700 a month to $2000 a month in 3 short years with no major illnesses taxing the system, not including copays and deductibles.My friends in Canada say that if you have a serious health issue, such as a lump in your breast, there is no waiting period. The waiting period so often referred to by people opposed to universal health care would be for voluntary surgery and minor medical issues that aren't time sensitive. And even then, as I understand it, it's not much different than a normal wait for a U.S. doctors appointment. In fact, my son just missed an appointment with his allergist due to a family emergency. How soon were we able to reschedule it? 32 days later... somehow I think we probably would have gotten rescheduled sooner in Canada.
