The worst part of this bill is that congress is trying to ram it through without explaining what is in the bill. Obama could not explain it. If you are going to pass a bill that is as important ass this one you need to slow down. It is obvious that many Americans oppose the bill, the polls show it and Obama's popularity is tanking because he and his friends on the hill are either mocking or even ignoring the people who have sincere concerns about what this bill will do.
