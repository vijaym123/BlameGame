I think we should all have the same rights as did our founding fathers.  I also think we should be entitled to the same things as were our founding fathers.This country was founded on the principles that stated "You have the right to work hard, and you are entitled to exactly those things which you earn.  Plymouth colony "If you don't work, you don't eat"  Guess what folks, everyone worked.  No one said, "Oh, I got a bad back and workmans' compensation or social security won't allow me to work".   there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".  Be careful what you wish for!
