 Public health insurance is more reliable and less stressful 2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "What is lacking in our current health care system, driven by for-profit, private insurance companies, is the reliability and predictability of accessible, affordable care. Many people have encountered the unpleasant reality that they can be denied care when they need it most, or lose coverage when they can least afford it.Private insurers can discriminate based on preexisting conditions, health status, gender, age, claims history, or other factors. In addition, in this unstable employment market, the loss of a job often leads to loss of health coverage, as insurance becomes less affordable."[6]
