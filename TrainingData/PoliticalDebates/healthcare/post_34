#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
US has existing examples of public insurance, public-private hybrids.Tom Daschle. "A public plan will reduce costs and improve access". Newsweek. May 2, 2009: "A growing number of Americans already get their health care from a public plan, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Plan (the Department of Veterans Affairs, of course, also provides benefits). There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management. The use of a public plan as it is currently proposed is simply an extension of what we have already done in public policy during the last 50 years. We just have to circle the bases." This should dampen concerns that a public plan is somehow "foreign", and a dramatic attempt to socialize medicine.
