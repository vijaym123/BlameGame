#originalTopic=Universal_Health_Care_We_Should_Have_It
 I am generally for private market healthcare.  Private enterprise is better at supplying goods and services than "government business."  There is no doubt there are great problems with our healthcare system, but it is hardly representative of the free market.  Free market went away along time ago when the government initially got in the game of directing huge monies and regulation into the system.    /> I think the most sensible approach would be to go backwards a bit and better analyze the "whys" we ended up with some of the problems we currently have.  I know many of the whys are indeed due to government causation.  The problem with this approach is that the government will never do it.  It would be self incrimination.  So, we will probably end up with universal healthcare and twenty years from now we will all lament, what happened to the good old days of great healthcare like there was in 2009.
