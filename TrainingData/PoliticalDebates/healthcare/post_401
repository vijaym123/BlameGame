The article tries to draw a distinction between the cost of healthcare and how much is spent on healthcare. That is playing with words. What it is actually getting at is the difference between the cost of healthcare and its efficiency.As the article points out, most single-payer systems cost between 8 and 12% of GDP whereas the US system is 16% of GPD. Remember that the US GDP per person is typically significantly higher than other industrialised countries. So we are talking about a higher percantage of a higher number. The cost/expense of healthcare per person is MUCH higher in the USA than other industrialised countries.Is this money being spent efficiently? Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens? It is important to look at the figures - not just quote newspaper headlines (especially the Daily Mail!).  The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.
