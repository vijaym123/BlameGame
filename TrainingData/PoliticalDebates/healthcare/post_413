Where is this free market you are talking about?People are not allowed to buy insurance from companies in other states.  Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.  The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.  Insurance itself has become a non-market by removing the need for patients to consider the costs of the doctor's services. The government already pays for 50% of all health care related expenses.What aspect of any of that is even remotely similar to a free market?  The fact that profits and money are involved?  That's a shallow argument.  What we need to is to free the health care market by removing government interference that limits choices and encourages higher costs by making them hidden from the consumer.  People also gain profits from food, in fact, if it was not for that profit you can be certain that food would not be so easily available.Also, no one is denying people health care by refusing to provide it.  You aren't denying your brother the services of a doctor if you refuse to pay because you aren't stopping me from paying for him
