Not only do you fail to make any arguments at all but you appeal purely to emotion.  Since when is making a big decision that affects everyone better to do by instinct/feelings?Let's review."Let the uninsured die"  You are saying this with sarcasm so you think the uninsured shouldn't die? Newsflash: everybody dies.  Also, people who die because they can't afford   health insurance   actually die from natural causes because if it was an accident, they go to the emergency room where they receive care no matter what."Then only the insured will populate the country"  Again, everybody dies. And this is just a ridiculous statement to appeal to emotion.The only other point I think needs a response is your tactless criticism of capitalism.  However, contrary to the point I think you were trying to make, you are correct. Drugs are available to almost everyone and the prices are low because it truly is a free market.  Isn't it silly that we allow these things to be available and cheap while we regulate everything else?  Like the fact that the new (potential) sugar tax would increase prices for the cheapest foods thus making it even more difficult for the lower class to afford   food  ?  I agree the free market is not the answer to everything but with a little regulation (far less than we currently have today), the free market does make products and services available to everyone and keep prices down better than price caps (those have side affects).
