There's no such thing as altruism.  Everyone is selfish.  It doesn't matter if they're doing things supposedly for someone else...  it's always done out of self-interest.  Always.Anything done that is "altruistic" is done for the individual doing the act because it will benefit that person. But you wouldn't know that because you're so up Ayn Rand's ass....  she's a second rate philosopher anyway.  Excellent writer, though.
