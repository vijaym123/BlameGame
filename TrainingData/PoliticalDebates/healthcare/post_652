 I agree with you in principle.  In reality, however, doctors do need to get paid, equipment and supplies cost money, and the few nations who experimented with socialized medicine have had a mix of results.  I just don't see free for all health care happening anytime soon.  />   /> On a side note, if we consider medical care a free for all right then shouldn't food and housing also be free for all rights?  It doesn't do you any good to get your broken arm set if you're about to starve or freeze to death.
