 No. Obamas health care plan is dumb to say the least. We borrowed 7 billion dollars for what? To try to fix the economy? Has it worked yet? NO! It hasnt! Obama is full of ideas but he has no idea how to execute. Health care will put the economy in even more of a crisis. When willl americans learn. Obama is a mad man if he thinks he can pull this health care system out of his anus and make it work. We are in more and more debt everyday. Why make it worse and worse?
