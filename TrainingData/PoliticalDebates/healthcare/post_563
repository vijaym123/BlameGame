One, government (especially in a country like ours) sucks at taking care of the people. Do you really want the Doctor's office to be like the DMV? Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should. Hmm, you're gonna have to get a prescription for this because you have this. yes, the side effects suck, but if you get too sick we'll have to pay a lot more. Deal with it.Not only will it be ineffective, it'll be taking away our rights as a whole. We already have medicaid for the poor, do we really have to create Universal Health Care when the numbers don't even add up?
