I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.  Most European universal health care systems allow public choice in institutions and doctors and even allow privatized specialists for those that want, and are able, to spend out of their own pocket.  Universal doesn't have to mean single option.  Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.  A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.  When a citizen's only "health care" is emergency aid, there is no care at all.
