Yes, my posts all turned up backward because I replied in the order I read.Props for all the research you did.  I still wholeheartedly disagree.Here's one article I came across that summarizes my entire point of view.  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html  In the end, perhaps we agree to disagree.  But that is why you are in Canada and I am still in the US where   taxes   are lower and   health care     technology   is better.  I believe I have more opportunities for a better quality of life and I believe someday I will be able to afford the best health care in the world (if the moochers don't hold me back too much).
