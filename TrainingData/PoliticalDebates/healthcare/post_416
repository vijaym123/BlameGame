I had to endure 5 years in the military healthcare system and it was AWFUL. I had NO choice in who I could see because I was required to use the on-base clinic unless they put in for an exemption to refer me to a civilian (which took MONTHS of chasing down to get the one time they actually permitted it). The providers ranged from at best inexperienced to at worst completely incompetent. Procedures that are considered routine in the civilian world such as a 2nd trimester ultrasound were simply not done (I had to go off-base and pay 100% of the costs out of my own pocket). I may not be thrilled with the expense of my current PPO plan, but it's a MILLION times better than what I experienced in the military system.
