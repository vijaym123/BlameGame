Blackbird, I note your reply. I am disappointed that you replied with rancour rather than politeness and rhetoric rather than evidence. I therefore challenge you to provide some evidence. Where is the evidence that medical care in the United States is superior to medical care in other countries? Where is the evidence that infant deaths are worked out differently in the United States?I have shown that the infant death rate in the United States (6.26) is greater than the infant death rate in Australia (4.75). Life expectancy is also greater in Australia (81.63 years) than the United States (78.11 years).The CIA says: "Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages."   https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html  The problem is not with sick babies. The United States has a higher death rate than other countries overall. That's the way it is.
