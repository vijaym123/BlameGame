Public insurance is less agile and innovative than private insurers. Michael J. Critelli, who served as the chief executive at Pitney Bowes for 11 years, where he was an innovator in employer-based health care: "I cannot imagine that any public health plan operated under the same rules as a private insurance plan could be competitive. The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments. It would not be allowed to operate as flexibly with respect to labor work rules or to invest in much technology innovation as a private insurance carrier."[7]
