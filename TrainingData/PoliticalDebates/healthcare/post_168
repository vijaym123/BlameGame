 Government-mandated procedures would reduce doctor flexibility/quality "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?" Balanced Politics.org - "Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care.  When government controls things, politics always seep into the decision-making. Steps will have to be taken to keep costs under control. Rules will be put in place as to when doctors can perform certain expensive tests or when drugs can be given. Insurance companies are already tying the hands of doctors somewhat. Government influence will only make things worse, leading to decreased doctor flexibility and poor patient care."
