#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
 Progress with public plan is more important than "competition" Insuring that over 40 million Americans have health insurance is much more important than the ideological notion of "fair competition". This is not to concede that a public plan is unfair, but rather to say that the whole debate over a "level playing field" misses the point that this is primarily an issue about insuring millions of uninsured individuals, by whatever means possible. These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.
