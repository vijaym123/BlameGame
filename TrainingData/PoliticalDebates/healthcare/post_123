It is impossible to answer whether universal health care fosters greater equality. Since the word equality necessitates a value judgment as to what is "equal" when it comes to health care and class status, a universal definition is not possible.  For instance - would it be equal if no one had access to MRI's? If only 80% of those requiring an MRI could get it - what would determine how to define those individuals "equally"?
