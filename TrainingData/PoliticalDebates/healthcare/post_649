 Although I fully back the concept of universal health coverage and I do acknowledge something has to be done to fix the current structure in light of demographic changes, I'm AGAINST his plan because I do not believe we can afford this right now.  We just borrowed gargantuan levels of money just to stop the economy from collapsing (and it's still not clear whether it worked yet), plus we're still in two wars, we simply cannot afford another huge price tag right now.  You don't borrow to buy a house well beyond your current financial means and then immediately turn around and borrow to buy a second house too.
