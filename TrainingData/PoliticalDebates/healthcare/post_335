Why would republicans like this?There are two reasons I think that Republicans could be sold on this idea.Reason one is, if people are covered without being tied to an employer, they'll feel less tied to a particular company. No fear of quitting for fear of losing the   health   coverage. This means more people can quit, start their own businesses, and be entrepreneurial. Go Capitalism!The second reason is that as long as corporations are paying for   health care  , they're at a competitive disadvantage with foreign corps who don't. Let's level the playing field.Insurance is a middleman. It drains resources, skims profits, and slows things down. market-based insurance is what got us here in the first place.I like bipartisanship. But when all bipartisanship does is take the teeth out of a program,   water   it down so that it's doomed for failure, then there's really no need for it.Here's a quote from FDR."We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace--business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized   money   is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me--and I welcome their hatred."On this site, and in a bunch of forums, I get the hatred. Well, I'm welcoming it. Bring it on. 120 House democrats pledged to oppose any insurance reform plan that doesn't include a   public option  . I want to try and put some wind in their sales.In conclusion, whether you agree with me or disagree with me---feel free to recommend this because I think it's probably the longest comment on this site and took a lot of research.
