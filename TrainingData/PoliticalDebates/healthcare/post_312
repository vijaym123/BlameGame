This is not a taboo word. It is what it is and the scary thing is - it is arriving in America. Universal healthcare is socialist in nature. Rather than go into it, I will say one thing. Look to examples in other countries, read your history books. Socialism does not work. Healthcare in Europe does not work. Sure, everyone has it but the quality is poor and they cannot get prompt care when they are really sick. You want to dole out 'free' healthcare to all? Then quality care for the major illnesses is what you will compromise. You can't have it all. Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?
