Because I'm just going to go to town and summarize my position. Just going to town. Hoo-ha. Okay.Health Care is really, really important. It's important to determine whether   health care   is actually in need of serious overhaul, or just a bit of trimming around the edges. I'm going to try and prove to you, with sources and everything, why we need the   public option   that's currently on the table in   congress  .First of all, I'll say that US Health-care is indeed the most technologically advanced health care in the world. I firmly believe that. Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year. Living in a country with a high-tech machine that can save your life is meaningless if you can't afford it.So here are the facts.47 Million Americans don't have   health insurance  .  http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/03/04/uninsured.epidemic  .  obama  /Millions more are under-insured.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/business/17health.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper  That's why most bankruptcies in the US are about medical bills.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31103572  /And a third of people responding to surveys say that they aren't complying with perscriptions because of the cost, up from a fourth about three years ago.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/04pharmacy.html?ref=todayspaper  Yes, you can go to an emergency room no matter what. Unfortunately, an ER visit doesn't give you any preventative   medicine  . I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/opinion/03thu3.html?scp=1&sq=case  +for+providingIf you want the statistical cost of our current health care system, there are three numbers you need to remember. 12,000, 18,000, and 100,000. Feel free to repeat those.12,000 is the number of   children   that would live, not die, each year if the US's infant mortality rate were as low as Japans, Sweden's, France's, Germany's or Italy's. An American mother is three times more likely to lose a child before the age of 5 as a mother in the Czech Republic.  http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21kristof.html?scp=5&sq=kristof  +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage. They don't get preventative care, timely diagnoses, or specialist treatments.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/healthcare/2002-05-22-insurance-deaths.htm  And lastly, the big number--100,000 Americans would survive every year if our health care system did as well on prevantable   deaths   due to treatable   conditions   as health care in Japan, France, and Australia. The US has the worst ranking throughout industrialized nations in this area.  http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0765165020080108?rpc=28  So that's just death, that just refers to who dies. Who knows who survives the subpar treatment, who lives with chronic injury and crippling pain, a lowered quality of life?So how does that measure up to how much we spend on it?Not well...  http://www.nytimes.com/packages/other/business/20061018health.xls  We spend twice as much as a lot of countries that are outperforming us.So we're at the big problem stage, I hope you/d agree. This isn't something that needs trimming around the edges. Next up? Explaining what Obama is talking about.
