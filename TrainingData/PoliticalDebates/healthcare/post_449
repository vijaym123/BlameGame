Pretty ugly in my opinion. What has happened behind closed doors and the deal making in order to convince some Senators to vote whom normally wouldn't have is borderline criminal. How some of the Senators received huge government money to get their votes and other states left out, is that even fair or even been heard of on a bill of this magnitude? What happened to the transparency that was promised by Obama in case you have forgot here is a clip of him talking about how he would reform health care, and then ask yourself is this what you expected? This is the change we all hoped for.
