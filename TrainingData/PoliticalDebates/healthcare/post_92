#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
Public insurance will give doctors/hospitals millions of new patients. It is surprising that the American Medical Association would complain about over forty million Americans suddenly having insurance so that they can pay doctors and hospitals for health care services. This is certainly a good thing for the health care industry overall (doctors in particular), despite possibly being a less than advantageous opportunity for the private health insurance industry. So what's the problem?
