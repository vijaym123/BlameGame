 Public option is needed because regulating insurers is insufficient Paul Krugman. "The public option as a signal". New York Times. August 17, 2009: "to have a workable system without the public option, you need to have effective regulation of the insurers. Given the realities of our money-dominated politics, you really have to worry whether that can be done Ñ which is a reason to have a more or less automatic mechanism [public insurance] for disciplining the industry."
