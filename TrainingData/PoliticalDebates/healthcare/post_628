#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 Health is the biggest asset a person can have in life. Unless we get a good health we lack the efficiency to work properly. Thus it is required to have a proper health free from diseases. Health care issues are very much important in an economy and the Government should play a major role in that. Diseases and health problems do not come by knocking us and thus any one can be affected with any kind of disease, may it be big or small. Government though maintains its hospitals and tries to give proper medication but at times that does not remain to be sufficient enough in terms of the cost factor. Government should make healthcare absolutely free so that no patient dies out of financial problems. It is a basic requirement in any society and in any economy.
