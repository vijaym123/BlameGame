We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well. The poor get   health care  , but who pays for it? When a hospital writes off a bill who pays? Most of the people who go bankrupt because of hospital bills had   health insurance  . The question isn't do we need   health   reform. But how do we fix the problems?
