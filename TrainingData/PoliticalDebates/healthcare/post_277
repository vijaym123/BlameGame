"According to this source   http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tot_exp_as_of_gdp-health-total-expenditure-gdp   the United States spends 13.9% of its GDP on health care whereas Canada spends 9.6%, Australia spends 9.1% and the United Kingdom spends just 7.5% of its GDP."I don't know if this is by chance or design, but I only see people who associate themselves with the deep left making this error. If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more? And don't forget to compensate for different GDP's with respect to what nation you're referring to. "I said, "the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.""Right, but comparing nations by their GDP (which varies of course depending on the country), isn't the way to prove this. "According to this source   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy   the life expectancy in these four countries is Australia 80.62 years, Canada, 80.34 years, United Kingdom 78.7 years and the United States, 78.06 years."Which I already pointed out in the comment you're replying to, and also pointed out that the 2-year difference probably has nothing to do with healthcare. Way to present something we don't already know. "With its present arrangements, the United States spends a greater proportion of its GDP on health care and has a lower life expectancy than other English-speaking countries."I'll just repeat the above points, since this sentence is just a recap of the first two paragraphs you typed:1. You can't compare nations strictly by GDP (they vary by nation, and there are population differences to take into account).2. Distinction between COST and SPENDING needs to be made.3. If we are already throwing large amounts of money at the problem, then there's no reason to think we should switch to a system which would cost/spend even more.4. That small 2-year difference is almost guaranteed to be the result of poor health choices in the US and probably have nothing whatsoever to do with health care. "US citizens on average live 2.56 years or 935 days less than Australians, 2.28 years or 832 days less than Canadians and 0.64 years or 233 days less than the British."See the above point (#4). "If living 7 to 30 months longer is a small difference, then I'd like that difference to be in my favour. If living 7 to 30 months longer is a warning for what's to come, well, we might just live long enough to see it!"See the above point (again).
