You have no solution?  Why?  If you are the expert, you should have a solution?  Further, why do those who want universal insurance, because calling it care is intellectually dishonest, analyse those who are not insured.  Could some of them simply not want to spend, in their view, money that would be wasted?  How many of your guesstimated 47 mil would fall in to that category?  I never seem to get an answer to these questions.
