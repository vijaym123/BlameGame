I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.  I am firmly, and absolutely, against the draft on moral grounds.Do you ever wonder why everyone gets their   health insurance   through their job?  What brought that about?  Why don't we buy health insurance on our own?  What stops us?  Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.  http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-winter/moral-vs-universal-health-care.asp  Please don't let the government draft me into a universal   health care   system against my own will for the sake of someone else's need.  It was wrong in Viet Nam -- It is wrong here.  It is not compassionate, and it is not moral.
