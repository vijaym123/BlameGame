Where is your argument that healthcare is a right? This is just an assertion. A right is the freedom to act not entitlement to the work of others. You have the right to speak without interference, the right to own property, etc.; you do not have the right to a house, a job, plastic surgery or a filling. Such values are created by others and are to be obtained only by voluntary trade. Entitlement "rights" such the "right" to healthcare make slaves of those who are forced to provide the entitlements. A "right to enslave" is nonsensical and immoral. Not only is a hideous perversion of the concept of rights but it's guaranteed to fail. Socialized medicine is a complete disaster all around the world, the more thorough the implementation the more disastarous the results. I've lived in England's socialized system and you'd get better care at a veterinarian in the US. If you think the partially socialized medicine in the US is bad now, wait until the "universal" socialists get their hands on it.
