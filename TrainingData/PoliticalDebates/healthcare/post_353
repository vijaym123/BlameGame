You're absolutely correct.  You exist solely on your own and in no way do you owe anything - not one single thing - to any other human being.  You are an island.  You have your own mind, your own goals, and your own life that exists in a bubble.   In no way is it ever possible that man survived by being a social animal... and in no way is society derived out of being social towards one another.   That would have been mass enslavement, and no one would have ever done it... because no one man ever needs another to survive.  There's no such thing as society and *if there was* it would only exist as a slave market.  The essence of morality is to be purely selfish - which means that no one else on the entire earth matters except yourself; that is exactly what it means to always act in self-interest.    The values that man requires is not contingent upon another human being in any way, shape, or form.  Society is evil, as is socialism, as is anything that forces any one man to have to interact with others.  Because you are correct, Nigel - you're an island with your own mind, your own goals, and your own life.  And might I point out that one of the arguments that is used against Universal Health is that there are currently waiting lines, rationing, and monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy (glad you spelled that correctly, first).
