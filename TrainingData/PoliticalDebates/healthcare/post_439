The United Nations states under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has a right to, among other things, medical care. It is absurd to say that impoverished people who are doing all they can to feed themselves and their family should be denied   health care  . It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work." Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.         Take this scenario for example: A poor Vietnamese immigrant develops a cough. He doesn't visit his doctor because he does not believe his condition is serious, and cannot afford a regular visit to the doctor. He waits and waits until he eventually coughs up blood. He finally visits his doctor and finds out he has a serious case of TB that has severely damaged his body. He has to pay more for extensive treatment and becomes more impoverished.With a government funded insurance program this scenario would not exist. The man would visit his doctor free of charge. He would be diagnosed early and would receive free preventative   medicine  . And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care. We need to wake up and realize a government run insurance program is the only way to solve our current health care disaster. We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right. If you disagree with that you disagree with the United Nations' and the United States' definition of Universal Human Rights.
