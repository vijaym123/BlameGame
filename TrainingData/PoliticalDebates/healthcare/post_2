 Nobody will be forced into public insurance; it's an option "Keeping Them Honest". New York Times. June 5, 2009: "Now nobody is proposing that Americans be forced to get their insurance from the government. The 'public option,' if it materializes, will be just that — an option Americans can choose. And the reason for providing this option was clearly laid out in Mr. Obama’s letter: It will give Americans 'a better range of choices, make the health care market more competitive, and keep the insurance companies honest.'"
