 Public insurance leads to socialized medicine, rationing, long-lines "The End of Private Health Insurance". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: "Once government takes over the majority of U.S. health-care liabilities [with a public option], it can either provide every service at huge and growing cost, or it can ration services. People who need an MRI or hip replacement or whatever will face waiting lines. Medical innovation will be at the mercy of the price controls hashed out in Washington."
