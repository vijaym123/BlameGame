I've always been in favor of some type of Socialized medicine in the country but I think with all the fighting going on at town halls and such it's hard to know what the bill's attributes are at this point. No one seems to be clear on what should go or what should stay in this reform. I'm confused as heck about it and don't know which side has the better point (s). What is the fuss really all about here?
