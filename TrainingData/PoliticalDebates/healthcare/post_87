#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
There are not enough votes to pass a public insurance plan. Independent US senator Joseph Lieberman from Connecticut: "the votes are not there for a public health plan, government-run option. And this can stand in the way of a historic achievement for President Obama and Congress and the American people, which is really to establish a universal access to quality, affordable health care plan in America."[13]
