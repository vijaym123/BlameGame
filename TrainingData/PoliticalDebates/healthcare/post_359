"Are you freaking kidding me?" Did I sound like I was? I'm sorry if that was the case. ""Hey, let me just buy a politician." is a thought that never occurred and never happened to extremely rich and powerful men (and surely, by now, women) in privately owned industries who wanted to pass or block legislation that benefitted them, but not within the constructs of government."Oh yes, that most definitely is a prospect for many business people. Insist the govt. needs to enforce certain regulations which just so happen to be regulatory measures that kill off their competitors. I'm more that willing to believe in that.  "Half the crap that government did or does is because of influence from business! or the banks!"So you also hold the view that the most powerful weapon corrupt corporations have is government regulation, bailouts, etc. At least we can agree on something. "Christ on a stick, government was SOLD a very long time ago."Think maybe we should reduce the size and scope of government to minimize that problem?
