 Private insurers limit choice of doctors as much as public insurance Signe Wilkinson. "Unhealthy arguments against public option" Philadelphia Daily News. July 14, 2009: "Opponents of a public option say it will deny Americans the right to choose their own doctors. It's true that some doctors and dentists will choose not to participate in a government-run plan. But many private insurance plans already restrict your choice of doctors by refusing to pay for treatment provided 'out of network.'"
