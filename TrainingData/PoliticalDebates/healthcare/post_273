I was not trying to imply America had inferior genetics... the United States is too diverse to even begin looking in that direction.  What is important is that there are many other factors that have a much more significant impact on an individual's life span.  Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it.... Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.  People seem to forget that non-profits and the government still have a bottom line to look out for.
