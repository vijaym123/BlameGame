Are you freaking kidding me?  "Hey, let me just buy a politician." is a thought that never occurred and never happened to extremely rich and powerful men (and surely, by now, women) in privately owned industries who wanted to pass or block legislation that benefitted them, but not within the constructs of government.Half the crap that government did or does is because of influence from business! or the banks!  Christ on a stick, government was SOLD a very long time ago.
