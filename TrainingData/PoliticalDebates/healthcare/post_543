So if you hate universal health care you must hate the idea of taxes then too right? But before you make a judgment, think about the people who've been dealt a bad hand, have a small house and debt up to their eyeballs. If that wasn't bad enough, now their kid just got his arm broken in seven places doing something stupid. They can't pay for the surgery, so they're screwed. Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right? Because everyone wants to get an education.Why shouldn't they get a medical security?
