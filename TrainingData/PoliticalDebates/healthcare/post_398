"You work in the insurance business, would you support universal health care knowing it would result in you losing your job?"You work for the government, would you support Universal Health Care knowing it would get you a job and allow you to deliver menial service and STILL get tax money as compensation? "People are becoming more aware and actually doing some work to find out what is going on."Like this man:   http://www.sickandsickermovie.com  /"I am retired and will gain nothing regardless of how this issue goes."I am healthy, don't do anything risky and also gain nothing from this issue."I have insurance from the company I retired from."I personally don't need insurance, at least not yet."But unlike some I have compassion for the many that need help and are unable to get it."Same here. I only disagree with how this can be best achieved. "I think my fellow Americans should be helped like the Canadian system it does not see a difference between the poor or any other sector they all get the same quality care."They don't get the same quality of care though:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXFUbSbg1I    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpsEAVbCkMM&feature=related    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=refrYKq9tZQ&feature=related    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzhiG0dcwN8&feature=related    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsp_Jh5EIT0&feature=related    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_KCLm9cekU&feature=related  "Our system is all about making money not giving care."If they don't give care, then they don't get money. Plain and simple."I even have a plan to cover the entire cost without tax money!"I would like to know more about it."The poor and powerless need help in this country you should get out more!!"Maybe I should. I could be DEAD wrong on this issue, I would like to know more about the plan you're elaborating on.
