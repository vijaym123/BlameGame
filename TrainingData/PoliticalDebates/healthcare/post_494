Under the system I envision, the amount of tax paid by the employer is decreased because it gets replenished by the employee.I see what you mean, but I do not agree with the employer's taxes being decreased. It seems that all your proposals simply help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Any money the laid off employee gets is free money. Once again, it is not free money as they pay income taxes.
