The flawed premise behind "universal health care" is regarding health care as a "right". Health care is a need, but not a "right", and that's a critical difference. A right is a freedom of action, such as the right to free speech or right to contract. It is not an unearned automatic claim on the goods or services produced by another person -- that's just state-sanctioned theft or slavery. Just because my neighbor is hungry, it doesn't give him the right to take a can of soup from my pantry.Rights only impose negative obligations on others -- for instance, my right to free speech only means that someone else (my neighbor or the government) can't stop me. If someone chooses to leave me alone, then he hasn't violated my rights.Any alleged "right" to health care can only be implemented by violating the actual rights of doctors and other health care providers. This is why "universal health care" is such a grossly immoral policy, and should be opposed as such.
