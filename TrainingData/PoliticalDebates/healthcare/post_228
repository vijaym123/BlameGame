 Millions don't have health insurance in US; universal health care would address this "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?". Balanced Politics.Org - "The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.  Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees. Employees facing higher costs themselves are often choosing to go without health coverage. No health insurance doesn't necessarily mean no health care since there are many clinics and services that are free to indigent individuals. However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."
