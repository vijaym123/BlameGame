Redistribution of wealth is something that Democrats made up. It's called "taking from the rich and giving to the poor".And yes, that's bad. It's the equivalent of stealing. I have no problem with Progressive taxing, but I do have a problem with redistributing it to poor people.As for the Constitution, it is still important to follow it. It never said in the Constitution that blacks must remain slaves. So your argument on changing the Constitution is moot. We later added amendments in order to assure blacks rights, but that is not DELETING things, such as "illegal search and SEIZURE".
