Through the VA system the president of the US and the Congress and thier families recieve the finest health care in the world at Walter Reed medical in DC. The same campus was found to have mold growing on the walls in the rooms that our returning soldiers were being assigned to while they recoup from battle injuries.The government cannot be trusted with something this important. They are totally ineffecient. The red tape ties the hands of the employees that do care and gives cover to the ones that don't.Name one program the government runs without massive waste and corruption, and I will consider your argument for government run healthcare.
