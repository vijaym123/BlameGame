I have to be more careful before I have my morning coffee...The extent of our Universal Health Care is the requirement that hospitals treat anyone in need of emergency care.  This is expensive, as a problem has to be very severe before it 'needs' emergency care.Expanding coverage will help reduce these costs by treating problems before they become emergencies... and keeping the population healthier.
