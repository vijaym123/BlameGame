Sorry Michael GlassYou are wrong about the benefit of Socialized heathcare. Socialism doesn't work in any form for any reason. Free market capitalism will provide the best healthcare.  You and your silly facts you spout out are based on mixed markets - semi-socialized heathcare that already exists in USA compared to some fully socialized heathcare in the more socialized countries.  If USA needs change, it is for free market heathcare...eliminate the government interfere we already have and we'll see change for the better.
