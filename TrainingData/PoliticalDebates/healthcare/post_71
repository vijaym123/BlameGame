 Medicare out-performs private insurance, is a model for public insurance Jacob Hacker. "The case for public plan". The Institute for America's Future: "The case made in this brief is that this menu of health plans must include a good public plan modeled after Medicare if the broad goals of reform—universal insurance and improved value—are to be achieved. [...] First, public insurance has a better track record than private insurance when it comes to reining in costs while preserving access. By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance. At the same time, Medicare has maintained high levels of provider participation and patient access to care. [...] Medicare has proven superior at cost control not just to health plans in the private sector, but also to private plans that contract with the federal government, such as those offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)—suggesting that public insurance can outperform private plans even in the context of insurance reforms."
