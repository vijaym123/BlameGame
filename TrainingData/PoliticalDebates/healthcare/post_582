I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money. They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc. For example, to pay insurance by yourself costs around $300 a month. Now that's for one person. The reason no one is rolling over dead is because most higher level jobs include insurance and they cover a little more than half of that cost. Let's say you don't have the best job and aren't getting insurance. Add in rent, food, transportation, bills, etc....How long do you think it would take you to pay a surgery if this were to happen? How would you ever get ahead? I struggled with underprivileged students for over a year and this was something I would hear. It would always baffle me as to how they couldn't get out of the situation but it really is cyclical. It's very said. I would speak with teens and over 50% already had kids at 17 and 18. (they were already 1 to 2 years old) Say what you will but when you're in the front lines it's a different story. I'm sure many on this create debate website haven't lived without the pleasantries of life. Huge assumption but you can tell by the way people present their cases. I've been on both sides, lived with luxury and had to be forced to live without it. I'm no authority but I've seen enough to say universal is the way this country will go and should go. I've also lived over in Spain and their health care is very good. (universal) I'd also be curious to hear the opinions from people that live on their own or pay for all their lifestyle and see their background.
