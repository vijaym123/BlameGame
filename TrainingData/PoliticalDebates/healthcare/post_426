You are currently granted the right to police protection against crime. Does that mean you are "enslaving" policemen, or the taxpayers who must provide the money to fund the police? Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense? Are you "enslaving" judges, who provide your right to a fair trial? Judges and courtrooms are not natural resources any more than doctors and hospitals. If there were no people who had a passion for law and justice, a passion to invest the time in learning this tremendous knowledge and skill, where would your "right" to a fair trial be?The fact is, of course, that EVERY right requires "forcing" someone to provide something to you. The right to a fair trial requires judges and courtrooms, and taxes to pay for them. The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them. How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs. A "right" is simply a basic need that society has decided to satisfy for everyone. We NEED security from crime, so we've decided to give ourselves a RIGHT to it. We should do the same for health care. It is just as basic.
