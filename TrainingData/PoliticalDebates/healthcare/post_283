The two year life expectancy is a statistic.  It may in fact have more to do with   gun control   and our propensity to send young people off to war to get killed and maimed.  Or maybe it's because we have more cars per capita and drive them longer distances because we have cheap gasoline.  It's probably not due to superior   health care   at all.  More likely a result of some other lefty policy you detest.
