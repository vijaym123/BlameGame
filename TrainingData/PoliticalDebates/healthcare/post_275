And you think this spending should increase?"Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less...." Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?"....and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA."   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy  Wow, 80.4 (Canada) vs. 78.06 (US). I feel such a small difference would have more to do with the nature of fast food America and almost nothing to do with healthcare. "The cry, "Socialised medicine" is a bogey man..."It's a warning for what's to come.   http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9679    http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8686  "...pushed by those who benefit from the present arrangements."Which would be government officials and members of the AMA:  http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/06/15/time-to-boycott-ama-members  /
