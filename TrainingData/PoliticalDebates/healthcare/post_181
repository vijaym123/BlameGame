 Universal health care creates a universal standard of care Nathan Newman. "Medical Malpractice and Universal Health Care". Progressive Populist. October 01, 2002 - "The other advantage of universal health care is that it creates a clear standard of care. What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."
