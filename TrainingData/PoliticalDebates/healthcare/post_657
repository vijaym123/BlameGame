#originalTopic=Universal_Health_Care_We_Should_Have_It
 I agree...Americans should have Universal Health Care.  Health Care is a public service...not a private enterprise.  I live in Canada and the hoopla I hear from naive Americans whenever I talk about this is that we have to wait and wait and wait before we get to see a doctor.  />   /> That is BS.  I spoke with a co-worker from Florida and he was explaining how he had to declare personal bankruptcy because his son got in a motorcycle accident and needed emergency surgery.  He had shattered one of the bones in his leg.  It wound up costing more than $500,000.00 after he underwent all the surgeries and physical therapy.  />   /> "Holy Cr@p!" I said, "You wouldn't have paid a dime for that in Canada!"  />   /> He said, "You don't get it...it was EMERGENCY surgery..."  />   /> "No sh!t, " I replied.  "When wouldn't that be?"  />   /> He thought that because health care is free in Canada, that it sucks and you have to wait a long time which in a lot of cases...is too late.  /> The only people that have to wait a long time at a medi-clinic are the people that shouldn't BE THERE in the FIRST PLACE!  />   /> You have the sniffles...too bad.  /> You have a headache...too bad.  />   /> Everything else is priority based.  And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).  You need chemo...you aren't going to be refused.  />   /> Insurance works different for health care here as well.  The biggest point being...THEY DON'T SAY NO.  They CAN'T say no.  The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).  It's not corrupt because the Government is the middleman ensuring compliance of the insurance companies.  />   /> The Doctors are well-paid, well-educated and generally fantastic.    />   /> Americans have just been brow-beaten to the point they think they are COMSUMERS of health care.  The only aspects of anything medical that would make them consumers is BOTOX, cosmetic surgery, and the like.  />   /> Hell, even Viagra is covered under most peoples drug plan.
