#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 Nothing is free.  What you really mean is that you think that the government should take more taxes from us to pay for healthcare.  This is a ridiculous idea.  I shouldn't have to pay for other people's health expenses, especially when I get sick very rarely.  You are advocating socialism.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  All this will cause is a slow up in medical care.  When we don't have socialized healthcare, doctors know that they will get paid more by being a better doctor, because there services will be more highly demanded.  In socialized medicine, all doctors know that they will be getting paid so much no matter how well a job they do, as long as they do a good enough job not to get fired.  People will die if from minor health problems if we socialize medicine.
