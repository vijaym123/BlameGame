it's your right to treat yourself to w/e you want. guns, healthiness or nonhealthiness. it's not like the government is preventing you from being healthy, just how it isn't preventing you from owning a gun.but, it doesn't force you to own a gun as well as not forcing you to be healthy. it doesn't provide the gun as well as not providing healthy diets or certain health insurances.so... guns rights are actually equal to healthcare rights.
