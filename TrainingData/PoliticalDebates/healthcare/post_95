Public insurance wrongly mandates physician participation. The American Medical Association wrote in a June 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee that the association, "cannot support any plan design that mandates physician participation... Federal programs traditionally have never required physician or other provider participation, but rather such participation has been on a voluntary basis [...] we absolutely oppose government control of health care decisions or mandatory physician participation in any insurance plan.Ó[15]
