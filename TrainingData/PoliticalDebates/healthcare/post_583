Who says altarion wont have insurance!? Who says I wont have insurance? Who says anyone can't have insurance!?!?!? This is America. "oh its hard to make a living in America" That is a very discouraging(and old) argument. We need to do more to make sure everyone has the opportunity to make allot of money before we move to universal health care as our very very last resort.
