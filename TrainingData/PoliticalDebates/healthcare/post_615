Universal without a doubt in my mind. more than 40 million Americans go in fear of getting hurt or becoming sick due to not being able to afford to. If you lose a finger and want that finger put back on its more than 50 thousand dollars to replace it, that is ridiculous when surgery is free in England. 50 Gs is enough to put middle or lower class person into debt with ease. The question becomes " should I just lose my finger or should I file for bankruptcy "
