#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 Health care should be free. Doctors and nurses shouldn't work for free, the government should pay them, we should not have to. Health insurance is so expensive. For a family in the workplace it costs about 1/4 of each of your checks to insure them. Plus, there are copays for the doctor and prescription. Many people go without and end up very sick because they aren't taking care of themselves properly. On top of that, children aren't getting the coverage they need. Lots of workplaces don't offer dental, so therefore cavities are not getting filled and kids teeth are rotting. We would altogether be more healthy if the government would pick up the tab.
