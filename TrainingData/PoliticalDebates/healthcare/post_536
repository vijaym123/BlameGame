Okay then lets make a list of countries closest in population to the United States and to be fair let's only use the 27 high-income OECD countries. (All the following data comes from The World Health Report 2000)Country | % of World | US/% of World------------------------------------------------- United States 4.52 1Japan 1.90 2.4Germany 1.22 3.7France 0.97 4.7United Kingdom 0.92 4.9Now let's sort by overall healthcare performanceCountry | Performance | Cost Per Capita----------------------------------------------- France 1 4Japan 10 13United Kingdom 18 26Germany 25 3United States 37 1Since you were interested in cost let's sort by Performance / Cost Per Capita. It's just a better metric.Country | P/C--------------------France 0.25United Kingdom 0.69Japan 0.76Germany 8.33United States 37.0And now let's scale this to the population. ((P/C)  (US/% of World)) and let's also reveal what system of healthcare each country uses.Country | (P/C)  (US/% of World) | System of Healthcare-------------------------------------------------------------------- France 0.6 Single-payerJapan 1.8 Single-payerUnited Kingdom 3.4 Single-payerGermany 30.8 Compulsory National InsuranceUnited States 37.0 Voluntary Private InsuranceSo as we can see single-payer is clearly more affordable and has better performance than either CNI or VPI systems of healthcare. And I have a hunch that if this sample had included even more countries that there would be a trend that Compulsory Private Insurance (like we have where I live in Mass.) would be better than VPI but still not as good as CNI.
