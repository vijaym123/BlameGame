#originalTopic=Debate:_Single-payer_universal_health_care
A mixed private-public system would preserve existing industries. Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry. This is a highly disruptive act that would involve massive job loss. The advantage of a mixed private-public universal health care system is that it is not as destructive and damaging in this way. It acknowledges the existence of a private health care industry and the need to preserve at least some of the interests of such a massive, and important, industry.
