I don't need a math lesson, you need a comprehension lesson. There is a "point" (and I admit I'm not sure what that is, and I don't have time to check now) after which when a baby dies it is deemed a mortality, before that point, it is not, it is (for actuarial purposes) not even in the pool. We have the superior medical expertise to get more marginal babies to that point, so they count against us, whereas the less developed countries can't get their babies to that "point". Let's suppose for the sake of the discussion, that "point" is 24 hours. In other countries who do not have our medical capabilities or expertise, a "sick" baby dies in the first 6 hours. That does not count against their mortality table. In the US, that baby might be kept alive for a week or two, only to experience complications and then die. That impacts our mortality.
