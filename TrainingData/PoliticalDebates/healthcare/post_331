I think when it comes to   health care  , pragmatism is more important than ideology. What works, we go with. Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has. I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor. You pick your hospital. Government picks up the bill.We actually already have this in the US. It's called Medicare. Medicaid is SIMILAR, but because I'm a stickler for terminology I have to refer to it as "dual payer", in that both the federal and the state government pays for it.I think having a system like this that covers everyone would be...just fantastic. However, it doesn't seem too likely.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies. It's just more regulation being discussed, in an attempt to make insurance from private companies provide affordable insurance to everyone.What progressives would like--what I'd like--is to   add   a '  public option  ' to the insurance exchange system, allowing people to buy into a medicare-type system administered by the government.Why is this a good idea? A public plan would have lower administrative expenses, they wouldn't have profits as their bottom line, and they'd be in a stronger bargaining position to obtain discounts. This would enable them to charge lower premiums. Win win.For example, a public plan could haggle with drug companies to get drugs at bulk discount prices. Medicare is currently forbidden from doing this. Thanks, Republicans!   http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/opinion/26krugman.html?_r=1  Private insurance companies have a lot of--well, I'm going to charitably call them expenses--like CEO salaries, marketing and ad creation, dividends, etc. I'll summarize a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine."After analyzing the costs of insurers, employers,   doctors  , hospitals,   nursing   homes and home-care agencies in both the U.S. and Canada, they found that administration consumes 31.0 percent of U.S.   health   spending, double the proportion of Canada…Streamlined to Canadian levels, enough administrative waste could be saved to provide comprehensive   health insurance   to all Americans."  http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/administrative_waste_consumes_31_percent_of_health_spending.php  How is this a bad thing?It's really not, and I'll tell you why it's really not after these important messages from our sponsors.
