  It is by individual rights that capitalism is the best. People have the freedom of life, liberty and happiness.  All other forms give gov the 'right' to interfere or physically force individuals according to what 'it' sees as proper.  So its about freedom - and free market capitalism provide the most freedom, and requires that people have individual rights - to function.  Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).
