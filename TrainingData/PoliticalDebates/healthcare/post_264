We already give healthcare to anyone that needs it if they show up to the emergency room. I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education? I believe that investing in certain aspects of our society (education and healthcare are in that group) pay dividends to us all!
