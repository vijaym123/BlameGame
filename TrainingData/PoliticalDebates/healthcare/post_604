i think you missed the point completely.he was referring to what can be considered a right and what isn't.obviously we need to take care of people with critical conditions (such as car accidents), but why the fuck is a check up considered a "right"?America's Constitution considers our rights to be our God given rights "by our creator". Not created rights, such as health care.
