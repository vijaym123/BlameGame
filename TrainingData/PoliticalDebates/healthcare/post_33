#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
Private insurers ration as-much or more than public insurance. Critics frequently argue that government-run health care involves the government "rationing" health care. Yet, private insurance companies "ration" to an even greater extent by denying claims and developing methods for maximize profits, and minimize outlays to those they are insuring. "Rationing" in this sense is the core businesses model of insurance companies. How can a government-run insurance option be any worse than this, particularly when it does not have the for-profit motive, so will offer as much health care to as many people as possible?
