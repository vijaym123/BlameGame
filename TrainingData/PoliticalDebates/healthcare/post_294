Do you really doubt that medical care is NOT superior in the US than in other countries? Which country has the highest penetration of technical developments (MRIs etc)? Which country is responsible for developing virtually all new drugs?Personally, I feel life expectancy is driven more by   society   than by   medicine  . Australia has no where near the level of   crime   that we do.If you're ok with a single payor, government run   healthcare   system, go for it. But please show me just one thing the government does better than the private sector.
