i think that we should have   universal health care  . look at it this way, alot of people are dying because they cant afford medical insurance or that they have another helth issue going on. thoes who dont agree need to try to see things from thoes who dont have point of view. what if that was you who might need an liver or heart transplant and you were told that you couldnt get it done because you didnt have enough or ANY funds at all and was left for dead.
