Yes for UHC for it benefits majority of people. In this case, there is a single buyer (the government); hence stiff competition from the seller. All sellers will do their best to improve their product in order to sell. Pharmaceuticals companies will develop drugs that benefit the most people, with less side effects. More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies. People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive. Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive. Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy
