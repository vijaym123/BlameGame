i went straight to their website and the first thing that appears is the budget deficit. For one fiscal year. Bush was bad really bad at 3.1 billion in 2008 but look at Obama 9.9 billion more than 3 times. The website is pretty cool you have to understand charts and some basic accounting. One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions. It a pretty heavy website. Some other things showind us adding more than 425 billion more to the already high deficit there is just no balancing in sight.
