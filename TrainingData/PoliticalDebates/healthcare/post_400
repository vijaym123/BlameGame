Do spellin bother thee Universal health care it the only way to go in my mind. Otherwise is will continue to spiral out of control and more and more will be excluded for the idea of care. Like I said stop the War on US (drugs) take that 100 billion and pay for universal health care we should have about 30 billion left over. We could party??Give me liberty or give me Death! Is that spelled right?
