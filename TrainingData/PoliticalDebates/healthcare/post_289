The John Stossel show reveals many of the problems of insurance and lack of insurance in the USA together with the problems of the national health schemes in Canada and Great Britain. There are serious flaws with both systems. In fact, it seems we would have to choose between a system that rations medical care on a waiting list (Canadian and British systems) or rations it by price (user pays systems).Australia has a national health scheme as well as fee for service medicine and a tax system that strongly encourages private health insurance. This is far from perfect, either, but Australia does have a higher life expectancy than the USA, Great Britain and Canada. Of course, there is no proof that this is wholly due to the health care arrangements, but with a life expectancy of over 2.5 years greater than the USA it must be doing some things better.
