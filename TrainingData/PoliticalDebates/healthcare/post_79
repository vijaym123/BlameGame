Continuing status quo under insurance company control is unacceptable. Barack Obama. "Why We Need Health Care Reform". New York Times. August 15, 2009: "In the coming weeks, the cynics and the naysayers will continue to exploit fear and concerns for political gain. But for all the scare tactics out there, what’s truly scary — truly risky — is the prospect of doing nothing. If we maintain the status quo [of health care dominated by health insurance companies under government regulations], we will continue to see 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every day. Premiums will continue to skyrocket. Our deficit will continue to grow. And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against sick people."
