Being a poor student sucks. I agree, I know the pain, my   student loans   speak for themselves. But you ask a valid question. Why should we pay for something we don't ourselves use? This, unfortunately for us as individuals, is just sort of the way things work out.The higher   taxes   thing is debatable. It's not so much about country charges the highest percentage of   income   on average per citizen, you also have to take what's provided into account. France is often cited as high tax hell. So take your taxes, but   add   this stuff to them. The cost of   health care  . The cost of university--whatever one you can get into, even Yale or Princeton. Maternity leave for a year. Two weeks paid vacation a year. So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me. The first is practical, or "This plan won't work!". The second is ideological, be that "This is immoral" or "This is Unamerican" or what have you. I think you're trying to take the latter side. So my question is, how is this different than, say, the fire department or the army? I've never needed to call either of those in to rescue\invade something. I spend much, much more on those than I do on health care. How is that fair?
