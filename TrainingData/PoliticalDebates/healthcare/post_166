Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems. The single most destructive issue regarding health care in America is the lack of preventative care. Patients wait until their disease progresses to a dangerous level before they seek care because otherwise they can not afford medical cost. Universal health care offers them access, thus increasing the patient's incentive to seek care when the health threat is minimal, and in the long run reducing the burden to the state.
