CBO estimates that the combination of provisions included in the amendment would reduce average private health insurance premiums per enrollee in the United States relative to what they would be under current law. The average reductions would be larger in the markets for small group and individually purchased policies, Where did you pull this from? Because that is not what they said i just heard there report and it was the complete apposite. I want to ask because I don't know but did they leave in the plan that if business keeps their private health insurance that they will have to pay an 8% penalty for not going to the government plan. I know that is was in the beginning?
