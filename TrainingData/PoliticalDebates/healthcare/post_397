You work in the insurance business, would you support universal health care knowing it would result in you losing your job? People are becoming more aware and actually doing some work to find out what is going on. I am retired and will gain nothing regardless of how this issue goes. I have insurance from the company I retired from. But unlike some I have compassion for the many that need help and are unable to get it. I think my fellow Americans should be helped like the Canadian system it does not see a difference between the poor or any other sector they all get the same quality care. Our system is all about making money not giving care. I even have a plan to cover the entire cost without tax money! The poor and powerless need help in this country you should get out more!!
