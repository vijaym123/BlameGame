Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics. There is no evidence that Americans are genetically inferior to other countries. Part of people's life experience is whether they have access to health care. Now some advanced counties have problems with lack of hospital beds and waiting lists for treatment. But the reason for this is that the poor are on the waiting lists and are filling up the hospital beds. In America, large numbers of people can't afford medicine. They don't clog up the medicine for profit machine, they die. universal healthcare means that the poorest and sickest segment of the population can get medical treatment
