Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people. If (a), then your rights only exist as long as you can defend yourself from violent attackers - so might makes right. There is no other choice. Either might makes right, or you must force other people to pay money for the protection of your rights.Of course the military and those in the justice system are not "forced" to act on your behalf - just like doctors would not be "forced" to act on your behalf in a universal health care system. I was merely using an analogy to point out that your original argument was absurd. The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like. I suggest you read David Hume, who explains why you cannot derive an "ought" from an "is," (which is what Rand tries to do), as well as Jeremy Bentham, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. They all have different conceptions of rights and provide different arguments to support those views. The point is that the issue of "rights," and the question of which rights are legitimate, is an extremely long philosophical discussion that has occupied hundreds of books. It is unbelievably arrogant to claim that you have the final word on the matter.
