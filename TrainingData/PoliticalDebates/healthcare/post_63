Public insurance protects uninsured from economic calamity. 2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage."[8] Indeed, health care is a leading cause of bankruptcy, which severely damages an individuals ability to engage productively in the economy. A public plan will nearly eliminate bankruptcies resulting from being uninsured, subsequently freeing individuals to productively add value in the economy.
