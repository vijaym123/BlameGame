1. It will do the opposite of growing the economy. When the government puts price controls on anything (which they have done in the past) you get several negative effects. The first is an artificial rise in demand. In the case of UHC, that means the government will have to ration care through means other than money. The second is you lose production when people that had made a profit off of the product leave because they can't earn a living any more. Finally, UHC would end health insurance. That means the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nearly doubling our current unemployment. 2. They aren't. Check my post on the opposite side of this page. 3. No it does not. It puts our businesses at an advantage. We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4. If you think that is socialism, than you are either being very disingenuous or you are incredibly ignorant. Do some reading on socialism. 5. Don't buy into those rankings. In France (and other countries) you only get health care if you are deemed worthy. The older you get, the less they will treat you. A 70 year old woman cannot get treatment for Cancer in France, but anyone can get treatment in the US. Does it cost more? Yes, but that has nothing to do with being socialized. It has to do with this mentality that someone else should pay our bills. 6. It can't be done right. The very idea is immoral.
