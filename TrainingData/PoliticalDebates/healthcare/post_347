I would be glad to have socialized   medicine   if it meant I could get medicine for 5 dollars what would cost 1000 now. And my senior elderly mom could afford her   diabetes   and   cancer   medicine without beeing stuck in a giant donut hole of greed. I would be glad to have socialized universal   healthcare   if it meant I could go to any doctor or specialist I want without hassling with an HMO. And that other US citizens would not be discriminated against if they had pre existing   conditions  . And that the emergency rooms might not be as crowded if everyone had access to normal basic care.  And that people on welfare did not feel like they had to stay on welfare or loose their medical benefits. However I would not call it Socialized or try to stigmatize it since it would be a giant improvement. Some countries already have this and they dont know why we are stuck in the stone age.
