I think you might not know enough about how universal health plans work. Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy. What about all the countries that have universal health care now? (more than half of the world!) Please refer to this as a list. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care Here is an interesting argument:"About 60% of the U.S. health care system is already publicly financed with federal and state taxes, property taxes, and tax subsidies - a universal health care system would merely replace private/employer spending with taxes. Total spending would go down for individuals and employers"This is a type of universal plan called single payer plan. http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_resources.php The link is from Physicians for a National Health Plan organization.
