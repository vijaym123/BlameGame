actually, America's Health Care never was the envy of the world, because big corrparations and banks always look for a way to get more for themselfs, and here more than any other part of the world. I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff. Even Mexico has a better health care system than us (if you live in a city with a hospital instead of out in a area with like 2 people per mile)
