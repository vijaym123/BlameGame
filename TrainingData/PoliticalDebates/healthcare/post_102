#originalTopic=Debate:_Single-payer_universal_health_care
 The government funds fire-stations, why not universal health care? The government taxes citizens to fund and provide numerous services universally, including policemen and firemen. These services are comparable to physician services in many ways, particularly in the sense that they help protect the life, safety, or health of citizens. Why shouldn't health care also be provided universally through the same means - taxes?
