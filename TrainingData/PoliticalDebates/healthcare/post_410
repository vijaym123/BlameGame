The typical metrics used all fall short of being reliable when discussing the quality of a health care system.Life expectancy and infant mortality, for example, have more to do with genetics, lifestyle, and crime then they do with the health care system.  Infant mortality also has a strong correlation with the age of the mother and birth weight.Why we don't we compare life expectancy of places like China, Cuba, N. Korea, etc. to the US?  Would those be fair comparisons?
