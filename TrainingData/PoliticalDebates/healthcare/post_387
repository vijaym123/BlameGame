You've got to be kidding. This is America, you can be a socialist if you want to be, but don't pretend it's patriotic. American is founded on individual rights, the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It's your life and your responsibility to support it and to pursue your own values that make you happy. You do not have the right to force others to pay to support your life. As a participant in an HSA, all I can say is thank goodness for them! Not as good as a free market system would be but a lot better than the HMOs and other quasi-socialized health schemes I've been forced to participate in. People should note, that under a free market system many types of healthcare arrangements would evolve to cater for various needs, including those on low income who cannot afford expensive healthcare. But as this argument shows, the socialists have nothing but hostility to any vestige of freedom in their system, they even want to shut down even the mild HSAs that allow the individual a modicum of control over their healthcare! (This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too). But don't take my word for it, you can be a victim of socialized medicine in any of the many places that practice it around the globe. I have. Let's be patriotic and keep it out of the United States, and reverse the creeping socialism that is already infecting our healthcare.
