OK, it would get rid of some problems with the current health care system, but it would create a whole new set of problems.Look at the other countries that have Universal Health Care. Let's take your example, Sweden. Sweden has a reasonably manageable population of around nine million. That's about as much as one of the many large metropolitan areas in the United States. The Sweden government does not need nearly as much money as the American government would to supply its population with health care. The American government can't even afford the services it offers now. If this were passed, taxes would be outrageous. The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt.
