#originalTopic=Universal_Healthcare
Universal Health Care is not an evil institution. I scanned over the opponent's arguments and saw things like, "Universal Health Care is robbery". Is cumpolsory public education also robbery? What about fire protection and police protection for all? There are some things to which all people are entitled, such as education and healthcare, and we live in a nation and time where that is possible. The private insurers have had ample opportunity to update their business model to actually care for all insured, but have chosen not to. They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible. They deny people admission into plans based on "pre-existing conditions" and the like. We need insurance that actually covers us and covers us all. Since private insurance companies apparently can't step up to the plate to fill this need, I see no issue with the government doing so.
