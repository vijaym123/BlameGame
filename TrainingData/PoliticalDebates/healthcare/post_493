You make a very good point but that is ot what I meant. In the scenario that I envision that would change too. Right now the employer pays the employment tax (not the employee). If they fire someone, the money is used to pay for that person until they get another job. The employer's tax goes up for some period of time with each person they fire. Any money the laid off employee gets is free money. Under the system I envision, the amount of tax paid by the employer is decreased because it gets replenished by the employee.
