A nation is only as good as its worst-off citizens. We all have the right to health. A government that refuses to provide any assistance to it is an aberration.Know the best health system in the US? Highest rated, best treatment, lowest retention, etc? The Veteran's Health Administration. The only completely socialized health system in the country.The problems with HMO's and private health care are too numerous to list. Coverage is a gamble against your own health. Private health treats symptoms rather than causes, because it's profitable. Doctors push pills when treatment would do, because pharmaceutical companies have incredible sway.
