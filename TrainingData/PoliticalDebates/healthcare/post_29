 Public insurance bureaucracies are better than private ones Paul Waldman. "The Public Option and the Hope of Health Care Reform". American Prospect. December 23, 2008: "There is no doubt that the insurance companies and their Republican allies in Congress will fight the inclusion of a public option with every bit of power they can muster. They'll call it 'socialized medicine' -- but by now we should all have realized that Republicans will call any health care reform Democrats propose 'socialized medicine' (that's what they said about Clinton's 1993 health plan, whose chief cost containment measure was enhancing the role of HMOs). They'll scream about 'government bureaucrats getting between you and your doctor.' But anyone who has tried to get reimbursement for a medical service from an insurance company that didn't want to provide it knows that government bureaucrats are pussycats compared to insurance company bureaucrats."
