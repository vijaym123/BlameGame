The costs of medical treatment should be enough to scare everyone able to do so into getting   health insurance  . And for those who have a hard time getting insurance into taking better care of themselves with regular checkups. In many cases I'm in agreement with some other comments that we are responsible for our own well being or if we're underage then our parents are.But I think if we could get costs under control we'd be in a better position to consider the economic burden the individual would have to carry vs. what the government would have to tax us for. My professor's husband had to have surgery on his large or small intestine, I can't remember which, the thing that stuck with me about the story is that there was a $3,500 charge for a sterilized tray. Granted it was the sterilized tray the surgery took place on but how much of that cost is profit? At present I'm not in favor of what a tax for universal   health care   would do to my income or the lack of responsibility for self that it would promote. (Not everyone would be irresponsible about their   health   mind you. Most people are smarter than that.)
