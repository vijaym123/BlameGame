#originalTopic=Universal_Health_Care_We_Should_Have_It
 I did a study in my social sciences. Apparently people with more money are happier and people with less money aren't happy and die much younger. And all the Sociologists are saying, "spread the wealth." They can get out of my face because we have the best health care, not the most flexible. We already charge too much for certain procedures and tools. A factor that is ludicrous when factoring in the cost of things.  />   /> Capitalism is good because it drives individuals.  />   /> A simple proverb, you don't work you don't eat. But don't steal one's food for another. Let that be his charity, not God's or a Government's enforcement.  />   /> I say, let there be more opportunities in poverty stricken places, for scholarships etc. I don't want to let poor people live off of me. I want to give them shots at being blessed just like me. I am no body's life support system. I am a friend and a person too.
