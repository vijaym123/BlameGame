#originalTopic=Should_America_have_Universal_Healthcare
As a christain i feel i have to help my fellow persons. Also America has the worst healthcare system in the world out of all the countrys that are good (Europe, north america, asia) Mexico has a better health care system! We need to chatch up with the world and help people who wern't born in to nice, middle class or rich familys like we were.
