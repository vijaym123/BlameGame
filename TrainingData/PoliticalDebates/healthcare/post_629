#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 When it come to how much money we spend of all things health care should be free!! People below the poverty line should also have the same rights as the 'higher class'. I say this because the people in the poverty line can not afford health care. So they get sick. And in turns get more sick because they don't get any help! The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.   /> Health care has become increasingly unaffordable for businesses and individuals.   /> We can eliminate wasteful inefficiencies such as duplicate paper work, claim approval, insurance submission, etc.   /> We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors.   /> Medical professionals can concentrate on healing the patient rather than on insurance procedures, malpractice liability, etc.   /> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs
