The thing about universal health care, is that it's definitely not free. The money for it has to come from somewhere, and that of course is from taxes... and as Government involvement in the health care industry has only made things worse overall and not better, I don't see how it's possible that 1) giving them even more power will make anything better, and 2) that it's justified to implement this policy at the expense of both the sick and the healthy. If someone chooses to eat sugar-frosted sugar lumps for breakfast and drink bladder-busting bottles of cola, every day until they get severe diabetes, why should everyone else have to pay for their treatment? Takes away an incentive to choose a healthy lifestyle. The system as it stands now is no good at all, largely because of Government involvement. It seems to me that the Insurance/Pharmaceutical industries have penetrated Congress with their lobbyists to such an extent as to get regulatory laws passed that stifle fair competition, giving them the advantage of a cartel. They don't need to lower prices like they would in a true free market, thanks to Uncle Sam's help... that's the system we should be fighting against, not trusting those who caused the problem to have universal control over 'fixing' it.
