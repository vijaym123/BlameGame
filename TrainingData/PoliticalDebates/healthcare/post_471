"I am NOT enjoying the socialised and paid-through-taxes luxury of a highway because it is more of a parkway during rush hour traffic."Then stay at home and don't use it. After all, you don't agree with taxes. Maybe you should spend a week not using any services that are paid for through taxation? That would be fun."Nor am I enjoying the socialised and paid-through-taxes police that take more than an hour to respond to anything."That because they're dealing with all the gun crime. ;-)
