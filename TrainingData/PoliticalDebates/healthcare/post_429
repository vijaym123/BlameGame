The right to life should come with the government dealing with the funding of a state-supported health care system.There is nothing saying that anyone has to be 'enslaved'. Police officers are a requirement, Ambulance drivers are a necessity, Fire Departments are an essential service all funded by public money. They do it because the pay is good and because they like to help people for the most part.I mean Doctors take oaths and such like 'Do no harm' and as a profession they have ethics that dont permit them to walk by a person bleeding on the street with stab wounds without trying to save their life. Just like a police officer isnt supposed to sit by and watch some convenience store get robbed.
