 Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices "Single-Payer FAQ". Physicians for a National Health Program. Retrieved May 30th, 2008 - "When all patients are under one system, the payer wields a lot of clout. The VA gets a 40% discount on drugs because of its buying power. This “monopsony” buying power is the main reason why other countries’ drug prices are lower than ours. This also explains the drug industry’s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."
