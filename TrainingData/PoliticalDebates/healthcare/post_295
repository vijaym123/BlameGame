Blackbird, the US certainly is a trailblazer in medical research. However, medical care is another thing. I agree that societal   conditions   do contribute to longevity but I believe that medical care also has an impact. As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view. Our post offices used to be part of a great bureaucracy; now the local post office appears to be run as franchised businesses. On the other hand, public schools were introduced because the private schools simply could not and would not provide a universal service. But that is off topic. Whatever the causes for the higher death rates in the United States it would at least suggest that Americans should be looking at other countries to find out how they could improve their game.
