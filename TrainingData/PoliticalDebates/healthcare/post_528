Placing the cost of healthcare upon the shoulders of all of the working class both now and perpetually will not reduce the cost of healthcare. The expense of healthcare is why people can’t currently afford healthcare apart from insurance or medicare. The costs associated with healthcare are not a reflection of the actual costs to provide healthcare, but more accurately are a reflection of the greed for profit that exists within healthcare, pharmaceutical, and insurance companies. We need healthcare that provides reasonable services and products at reasonable prices, not healthcare that compels exorbitant fees at devalued wages. And lastly, the very fact that insurance companies and government, not the patients, are paying for the majority of the cost of healthcare enables the greed of the healthcare industry. Healthcare that only insurance companies and government can afford enriches only the healthcare providers at the expense of the working class. And quite simply is the reason we are in the predicament we find ourselves. Universal healthcare in the U.S. will accomplish nothing but additional problems, for the greed of the healthcare providers can never be satiated and will always seek to maximize profits at higher prices.
