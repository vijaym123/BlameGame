So I've been here for a while now. I'll happily tell you about exactly what socialized   medicine   is like. First of all, you get a card. It's got a number on it, and you have to give that number to them for everything.So I've had to go to the ER a couple of times. There was indeed a wait. It was very long when it was very late at night (about an hour) and quite quickly during the day (10 minutes). I had a CAT scan that I had to schedule a few weeks in advance. I had an MRI that I could get done within 3 days. Medicine is very, very cheap.There are free clinics in the large towns that I spend time in. I go in with any problem, and I can get in to see a doctor within an hour. If I want to go see my doctor, I schedule an appointment just like normal.Now it comes to the costs. 57 Canadian dollars a month, or roughly what my bus pass costs me.Feel free to move. The   citizenship   test is pretty easy.
