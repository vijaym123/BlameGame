Based on our previous conversations, I am entirely convinced that you do not appreciate my sense of humor.But that's OK because that's your role as a woman.In other words, in order to be funny, you need to be able to see the humor in things. For example, if men are practicing with their bows and arrows and one of them gets shot in the ass, the other men will spill their beer laughing while a woman runs up screaming, "Oh my God! Call 911, get me a band-aid quick!" which only makes the men laugh even more. This is an evolutionary advantage because if women didn't take things seriously, we would become extinct. I mean, women are pretty much responsible for nurturing and preserving the species. Someone has to be the responsible adult. ;)
