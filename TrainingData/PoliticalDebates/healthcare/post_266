I just had the "aha" moment while reading your response.  Yes, we should turn away all non-emergencies from the emergency rooms.  Let the uninsured die.  Then only the insured will populate the country, eliminating the whole   health care   problem thing.  Freakin' brilliant.  Compassion is a religious value and therefor a violation of that Church and State thingee.  Let Darwin be Darwin and soon we'll only have the lower middle class to worry about.  Hell, they don't even vote, so they won't be much of a problem.  And that comment about something that benefits   society   not necessarily being mandated, and the argument for it not holding water.  Oh, hell yeah.  Dams hold water to prevent flooding and provide drinking water, but why the hell should we pay for them?  If the free market can't provide economical and safe water to the people, then let them drink beer.  And traffic lights.  What's up with that?  The military - if we all had   guns   and were willing to use them, and willing to buy tickets to Iraq and Afghanistan we wouldn't waste all that   money   on stealth bombers and stuff.  I've been reading up on the free market and it seems it is the answer to everything.  Actually black markets are the best because they are the purest form of free enterprise.  So it follows that the pot and meth dealers are the paragons of free market economics.  Adam Smith rocks.
