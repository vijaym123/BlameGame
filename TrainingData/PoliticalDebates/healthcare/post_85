 Public option jeopardizes passing healthcare reform legislation Stuart Butler. "The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage". Heritage Foundation. July 28, 2009: "I've spent the last 30 years trying to achieve affordable health coverage for all Americans, so it's frustrating to see the obsession with a 'public plan' making it impossible for reasonable people from both parties to come together. 'The fixation on a public plan is bizarre and counterproductive,' The Washington Post put it recently in an editorial. 'It would be a huge mistake for the left to torpedo reform over this question.' [...] Why does such a seemingly benign idea pose such a dire threat? Because supporters are disingenuous about their real goals and about how it would really work. The arguments for a public option as the only way to achieve certain objectives just don't stack up."
