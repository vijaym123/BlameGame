 "It's worth what you pay for it" - hick proverb.  Somehow people get the idea that we can have quality health care without paying doctors or that it's cheaper to pay for it with taxes than to pay for specific visits.  If we were to tax everybody and give health care to people who were not paying taxes (poor people) we would be robbing healthy people and throwing their money away on people who don't benefit society.
