I'm interested to hear how you define "corrupted" in reference to government. If it's the search for personal gain in a public field, I agree that it is semi-corrupted. However, corporations--that's their raison d'etre. They're profit driven. Fully corrupted as opposed to semi corrupted. Why do you believe a company out to make a buck is more likely to take better care of you than the government? Same thing with efficiency--Insurance companies have marketing departments, CEO salaries, etc. to cover with the   money   you put in. UHC would have none of that.
