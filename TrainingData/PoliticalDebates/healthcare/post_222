 No universal health care causes "job lock" "The Case for Universal Health Care". American Medical Student Association (AMSA). 2005-2006 - "“Job lock”: Job lock refers to the idea that people stay with their jobs when they would rather work elsewhere because their current job offers health insurance. For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."
