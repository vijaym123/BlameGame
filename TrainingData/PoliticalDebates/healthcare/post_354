That was easy. I'm glad you agree Betty. Maybe you should think about changing your username? ;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected. My position is simply that all individuals should be free from coercion, that all social interactions should be voluntary not coerced. (A society that is coercive, e.g. socialist, islamofascist, etc., is evil.) So of course there are enormous benefits to living in a society, but only if it is essentially free. That's why people selfishly flee Cuba and come to the United States. Tellingly, under a fully capitalist system you could have your own micro socialist system, e.g. a collectivized farm (kibbutz) or a socialist healthcare system; but under a fully socialist system a micro free market system would never be tolerated. The reason is that under capitalism the individual is sovereign, and so can be a capitalist or a communist or whatever, the state is only there to protect his freedom. Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.
