I didn't miss the point. I just chose to ignore it. Obviously not the best move but let me present you with the following: Have you ever not had insurance? Have you ever been poor? Have you ever needed to have a doctors visit but weren't able to pay it? And to what extent are be willing to bastardize "for Justice and Liberty for all"? Where is the justice in the healthcare industry? You have pharma companies charging an arm and a leg for products that aren't worth the price. About 15 to 20 years ago we noticed a change in the pharma industires. They stopped using educated sales reps and went more to the good looking women approach. (ps they didn't have to know shit about the pharma industry, marketing skills were OK- this information came directly from various Doctors I worked alongside in a medical school) Have you ever lived in a country with universal healthcare? I have, it's fantastic. And if you want a specialist and have the money, then feel free to go and pay for it. That's your right! There used to be a time in this country when everyone would help out their fellow neighbor in bad times. Now it's everyone fend for themselves and fuck you if you can't help yourself. (pardon my french)Not my typical type of proof source but this backs up my side: http://healthcommentary.org/public/item/                                       206699?model=blogsite/HealthCommentary/moderated&style;=blogsite/HealthCommentary/hc God given rights is ridiculously an open topic. They never said our God given rights as said in this book, etc... They just said our God given rights. That's why we find ourselves in a constant struggle.
