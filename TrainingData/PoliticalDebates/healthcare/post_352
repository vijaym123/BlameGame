As usual you socialists dodge the need to justify that healthcare is a right, or prove that it's the moral thing to do. Let's hear it. Here, I'll get you started... "You are your brother's keeper...."That's the only justification ever offered for socialism, and it's still not an argument. Why am I my brother's keeper? For one that's insulting to my brother; for another it means my enslavement. We are not born in to servitude, we are born as unique individuals, each with our own lives, our own minds, and our own goals. The essence of morality is for us to use our minds to support our lives, to make our own judgments, to produce the values that our lives require. It is not to force others to serve our needs. A moral government is one that leaves people free to use their minds and act on their own judgment. This is still America, not the Soviet Union. "Universal healthcare" really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else. It's mass enslavement and as far from moral as you can get. And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown. If you want to concretize what socialized medicine would be like imagine the intellectually demanding, and technologically advanced field of medicine run by the geniuses that run the post office, or the Dept. of Motor Vehicles, or our dismal school system. There will be waiting lines, there will be rationing, there will be monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy. Do you want to put your life in their hands? Well you have the right to subject yourself to that, but leave the rest of us responsible adults out of it.
