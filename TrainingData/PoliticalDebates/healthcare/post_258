It is foolish to think that all aspects of society are best served by the open market.  We have surrendered our prisons and health care systems to for profit organizations.  We are currently working harder than most people realize to privatize our law enforcement and military.Just stop thinking about money for a minute and think about what we are doing!  Deregulation and opening up every problem to be solved by people seeking profit is not the answer to our most important problems.  I would rather take my cancer or other life threatening health issue to a SHAMAN than to someone whose primary interest is personal profit or the survival of a corporation.We can control a Democratic Republic somewhat through the democratic process.  We cannot control a corporation without regulation and then we cannot force it to provide for our needs.  And we once had a right to health care via the Public Health Service however bad it was.  Now we are told that it is a privilege of those with money.
