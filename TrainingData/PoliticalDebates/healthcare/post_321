but I have read the bill.  No need to try to interpret it for me.You seem to have no idea how a free market works.  I don't want to waste time giving you a lesson in economics because you are not going to trust me as a viable source anyway.  Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever. Unless everyone should get a physical trainer for free or healthy   food   for free or   plastic   surgery for free.  Even services concerning the human body cost   money   because they are SERVICES.  20 years ago, if someone was diagnosed with   cancer  , it was accepted that they would die. Now, not only is it expected that they'll live, but it must be free????  A doctor says, "I can save your life but it will cost $1,000 for the equipment and the time and the   education   required to save your life" and people are upset???????  Are they upset that people have developed the   technology   to save them?????  The technology is not free and neither is life.  It costs money to live because money is a symbol that a person has contributed something to   society  .  It is simply a symbol that says "I have done $20 worth of something for someone else, so here's $20 to you for what you're going to do for me." What money represents means that it should not be redistributed "equally" because by nature, it is already distributed truly equally.  As complex as our society is, the nature and origin of money is really very simple.  Trade.
