If I am granted a right to health care then I am granted the right to enslave those who must provide it.  I have been given control of the life of the health care provider.If there were no people who had a passion for medicine a passion to invest the time in learning the tremendous knowledge and skill, where would this "right" to health care be?  Who could you force to provide this right? Doctors and hospitals are not natural resources that appear in our environment like stones and mud puddles.  Arguing over your right to the life of another is not only wrong it is pure evil.
