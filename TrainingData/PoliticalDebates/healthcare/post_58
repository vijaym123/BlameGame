 Public option cuts obscene profits of insurance establishment Dave Johnson. "Health Care: Public Option Is A Must". The Huffington Post. June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are. [...] This is about providing what is best for the people, not about watching out for corporate interests and the profits that get funneled up to a few people at the top."
