Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen. You also would be aloud to KEEP the health care system you already have, this is for the 40 million people in America who need help. Some people can't pay taxes because they spent so much on medical bills they can not keep a job or house, if it were free that person could keep there job and money and pay taxes and by American made goods.
