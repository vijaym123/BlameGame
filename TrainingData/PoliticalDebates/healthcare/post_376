moisturize.... but with olive   oil   not with handcreme.i don't.  know if my new neighbors will call 911, that is.   but i act nicely out of self-interest and hope it works.nothing is ever just one system and one system alone.  none of them work separately.   nothing may ever work except more than temporarily, for that matter.because she also wanted attention. as do the people who risk death for no obvious rewards. the act may be "good" but the intentions are still motivated by selfish reasons. not really, because all those people are under the thumb of those who make OTHERS work harder while they receive more compensation.  remember...   china   is your version of "communism".  they don't have a choice.  or else it wouldn't be communist china.how does the u.s. Not support china? who in turn support "ethnic cleansing" and killing buddhists?like i said.. it was a distortion of capitalism.  the corruption of capitalism by the will-to-  power   (i've been nietzsche-ized... i can't help it. i've read 4 of his books in the past 5 weeks).  and that revolution of the worker only led to exactly what they revolutionaried it up for in the first place.   communism isn't supposed to be totalitarianistic.   it's lack... absolute lack... of any state. frikking durh. you can't have communism if you've a state. you only have a distortion of communism.   so therefore.... you're probably more of a communist than you think if you don't want a state.
