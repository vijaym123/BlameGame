I ask, where does this "right" derive from? If health care is a right, why not food, or housing too? I mean, if a right is something that the Government grants us, then what stops them from revoking that right when they don't feel like granting it any longer? For example, even the Soviet Union had a Constitution, wherein the Government granted its citizens, for the betterment of the Socialist state, the freedoms of speech, press, assembly and protest. However if their Government felt your speech, etc. wasn't "for the betterment of the Socialist state", then those rights didn't apply to you. The United States Constitution credits rights as being "endowed by our Creator", such that no argument can be openly made that the Government can revoke them. To re-define the meaning of what a right is, just because we think it'll help give us something that we want, puts us in a dangerous position where we'll be at the Government's mercy to grant those rights. The Government doesn't own us, so therefore it shouldn't have to take care of us like our mother did.
