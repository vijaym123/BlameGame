You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system. An insurance plan is all about spreading the risk.  Private companies reduce their risk by disqualifying people that exhibit risk.  The people who need health care most are the least able to afford or even get private insurance.Yet, we all pay for the consequences of a decrepit health care system. We all pay for those emergency room visits by uninsured people.Or, we can just let people die.  We CAN be that uncaring.  We do have that capacity.Michelle
