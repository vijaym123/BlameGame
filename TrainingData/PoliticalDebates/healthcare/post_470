You just proved my point. I am NOT enjoying the socialised and paid-through-taxes luxury of a highway because it is more of a parkway during rush hour traffic ;)Nor am I enjoying the socialised and paid-through-taxes police that take more than an hour to respond to anything.If it's socialised and paid-through-taxes it is more than likely sh*t.Have a nice day ;)
