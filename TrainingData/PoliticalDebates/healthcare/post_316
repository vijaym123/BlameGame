Socialism is never the solution.  Stealing   money   from some people (while calling it "taxation") to pay for the medical expenses of others in still wrong.  Does it matter if a mugger promises he will only use the money he is taking from you at gun-point to pay for a doctor visit for his kids?  A "right" can never include violating someone else's rights.  Socialized   medicine   violates the rights of every person at some point, from the doctor to the healthy person who is careful about maintaining his/her own   health  .  It is wrong.
