#originalTopic=should-the-us-have-universal-healthcare
Use the correct words for what people are asking for and maybe the argument will simmer down.  "Universal Healthcare" is simply a politically correct term for letting the ruling political party decide who dies during the current fiscal year.  When the cost of cancer drugs is more than the economic return on the people who need them, the government will stop paying for the drugs and let the people die. Don't get too sick to pay taxes or you will be dead within 1 election cycle.   Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.  The government decides who lives and who dies.  Today, the British and the Canadians with enough money, can go to America or India and get what they need by paying for it with what little money they have left after taxes.  Most can't because the tax burden is very high to pay for this "free" care.
