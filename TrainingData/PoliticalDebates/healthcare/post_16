 Insurers/conservatives oppose public insurance because it works Robert Reich. "Why critics of a public option for healthcare are wrong". Salon. June 24, 2009: "[A public option] does crack the door open for expanding the number of Americans who get their health insurance through the government. And this is what terrifies the insurance companies and conservatives. Their fear is that it will actually work. If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."
