 Private insurance puts profit first; public insurance puts health first Richard Kirsch, National Campaign Manager for Health Care for America Now! "Three Reasons for the Choice of a Public Health Insurance Plan". May 15, 2009: "Putting you first. [...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health. That’s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care. [...] The mission of a public health insurance company will be your health, not the financial health of stockholders. A public health insurance company won’t have multi-million dollar executives with corporate jets. It won’t have to please Wall Street financial analysts. It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses. And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."
