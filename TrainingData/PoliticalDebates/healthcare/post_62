Greater prevention and health through public insurance saves money. A public insurance option will guarantee universal coverage, and will ensure that people receive good preventive care, instead of waiting to see if they can ride out their health issues on their own. This saves money in long-term health care costs. And, by ensuring that individuals do not fall ill or victim to being uninsured, a public insurance option will ensure that individuals stay economically productive.
