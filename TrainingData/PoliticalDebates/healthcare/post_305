You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare. The major problem with the system that is used in those countries is that it raises their taxes and also access to healthcare is extremely slow. I ma probably one of the lucky ones, I healthcare from where I work. One week when I was sick, I called my DR's office and had an appointment that week. Where with the system that is used in Canada(personaly know friends in Calgary) this would probably take a few months before I am seen. I work in the Emergency Room of a Veterans Hospital, this is a prime example of how Universal Healthcare would work int the US. Our veterans wait for at least 3 months to see their pirmary care provider, consiquently, the Emergency Room is over run with patients that would normaly be taken care of by their primary care provider. This is all not even considering how well the federal government runs thing. For example look at the wonderful job they do with FEMA. Personaly I think we would be better off if we presure the Health Insurance Campanies e.g. Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care. Also presure on the pharmacutical companies to level their prices for perscription medications.I think that if they were actualy spending all the money that they are saying they are on research, we should have cures for cancer and the comon cold by now.
