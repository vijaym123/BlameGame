Well actually I can because my tax dollars went towards it, whoops. ;)Had my tax dollars not gone towards it I would have paid for the service, just like I'm doing now, whoops. ;)And if the service cost more than what I currently pay, I would still pay it because the number of people that could afford it would be reduced and I wouldn't get so many e-mails about how to make my dick bigger and stay up longer, whoops. ;)
