The actual polls just last week Rasmussen polls show only 45% versus 52% appose. I just got that of the Rasmussen which is considered by most the most accurate. I don't know what poll you got 72% from? I think that the one may be skewed. Someone needs to actually go the the CBO or CBC and pull what they said and what numbers they are giving back. that will add some smoke to the gun if what above is true.
