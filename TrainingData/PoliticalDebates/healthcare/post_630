#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 Healthcare should not be free.  If you can't afford healthcare, that's tough, then you should get a job that means you can afford it. Well, what about the poor, the unemployed I hear you whine, well they should get a job, shouldn't they, then they can get health care too.  />   /> Free health care drives down standards and drains the government's resources and therefore the country's resources.  What about old people? Well, if they had paid into a private health care scheme all their lives, then they should be allowed health care when they retire.  I don't understand why we don't have affordable life long health care schemes as standard.  />   /> Where would you rather be treated? Quickly by expert doctors who are paid really well and don't work all the hours that God sends, or would you prefer to be left on a trolley in a corridor for hours waiting until someone remembers where you are and comes to see if you haven't died yet.  />   /> Private health care means REAL care.  It means short waiting times for essential treatment and it mean being made to feel cared for when you are there.  Why should people expect something for nothing.  Well what about National Insurance? Surely you pay that.  Yes, that's your pension and your health care all in one.  But the pittance that most people pay is ridiculously low.  If employers offered health care as a benefit, people would really care about keeping their jobs and we wouldn't have a nation of  disaffected people, working in miles and miles of factory-call centres across the globe.  />   /> No, I do not agree, I do not think that health care should be free, I think we should pay for it, to require a high standard and we can get treatment when we need it, not when someone can be squeezed into an already bursting schedule to be seen by tired doctors who are looking forward to private practice and six figure salaries at some point in the future as a GP.
