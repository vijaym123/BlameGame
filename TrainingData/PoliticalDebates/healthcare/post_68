Public insurance option will increase taxes and drag-down the economy. Karl Rove. "How to Stop Socialized Health Care" Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2009: "Who covers the rest? Government passes the bill for the outstanding balance to providers and families not covered by government programs. This cost-shifting amounts to a forced subsidy. Families pay about $1,800 more a year for someone else's health care as a result, according to a recent study by Milliman Inc. It's also why many doctors limit how many Medicare patients they take: They can afford only so much charity care."
