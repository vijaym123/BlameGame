 Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance. Yet, they then argue that a private insurance company cannot compete with a government program. This is contradictory. If private insurers believe their product is superior, they should not be worried about a public option.
