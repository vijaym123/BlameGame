 Public insurance leads to socialized medicine, rationing, long-lines Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a leading surgeon and former president of the AMA who heads the physicians group Coalition to Protect Patients' Rights: "The government takeover of the practice of medicine [starting with a public insurance program] will destroy the private health insurance companies, and will result in rationing, long lines, and loss of access to physicians in the patient hour of need."[5]
