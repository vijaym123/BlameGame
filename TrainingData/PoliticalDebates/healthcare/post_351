For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business. I want my doctor to decide what treatment I should have not the for profit health care insurance we presently have. The Health care insurance profit more by denying we the people coverage, Universal Healthcare is practiced in most of the other nations I know England, Canada, France, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries have it why not here.  I was born in England where they have Universal   healthcare   and it works perfectly there. My Dad who passed away was able to stay at home through his illness as his Doctor came and visited him even on a Sunday and it did not cost my Mother a penny.  My Mother who lives in England is now 85 and she does not pay a penny for her doctor or   medication  . Old people should be taken care of, they work hard and pay their   taxes  .  I have worked hard all my life and paid my taxes I want to be assured  I will be taken care of when I get old. I   exercise   and try and eat right. UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE is what we need in this country
