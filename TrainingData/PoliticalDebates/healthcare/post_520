I support you because you answer your own question about why it is I don't bother to back up my position. I can back up my position all day long and I will never get you to see my point of view. You will always think that your views are right, moral, and justifiable.Yes, there was a time when I used to fight and got absolutely nowhere. Lets take the gay marriage issue for example. I have repeatedly stated that I am for gay marriage but that I did not believe that the current approach the gay community was taking was going to succeed. I suggested instead for them to get the government to drop the use of the word marriage and substitute civil union in its place. People bashed me and I was not able to change anyone's mind. Now, here we are and gay marriage proponents have been handed a hard blow in maine.But OK, I'll give it one shot for old times sake. What you want is to be able to force people to do what you think is right. If you think that Nationalized Health Care is right, then you want to force people into it. What I want is the freedom for people to chose. If someone can't chose what they want because they can't afford it, they have no right to force me to pay for it. I don't care about the benefits I will be able to reap down the road. I don't ever want to be forced into something, period. Even if it's good for me.
