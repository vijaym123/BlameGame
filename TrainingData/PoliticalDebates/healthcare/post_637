#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 Not all healthcare should be free. First of all, its not a practical idea. The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars. Government could go bankrupt. I personally think that it should be cheap rather than freely available. In your case, people will be putting responsibilities of their health on doctors and medicines, rather than taking care personally by refraining from alcohol, smoking, and other harmful substances. Nothing should be free!
