Public insurance makes workers healthier and more productive. A public insurance option will guarantee universal coverage, and will ensure that people with medical conditions receive the preventive care they need, which saves money in long-term health care costs. And, by ensuring that individuals do not fall ill or victim to being uninsured, a public insurance option will ensure that individuals stay economically productive.
