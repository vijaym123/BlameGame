Universal healthcare would eliminate the problems that are posed by privatized healthcare. With it being universal, everyone gets treatment at an equal rate. Taxes would be higher, but the benefits would be better. Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier? How much does your plan cover?" etc. Besides, most countries already have universal healthcare.
