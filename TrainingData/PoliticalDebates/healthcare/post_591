Universal health care has a lot of issues. I live in Canada and I know these issues. Pill pushing doctors that don't work hard, a lot of administrative work that push up costs on governments, long lines and extremely long wait times for surgeries and specialty medical attention. I read the first post, that people should be equally entitled for good affordable health care. The fact is that a free market, capitalist, profit driven health care system ends up costing less per person and offers a higher quality of service. Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years. There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries. High taxes create less jobs and innovations. In Canada we pay more taxes than California but we have the same GDP/GSP and same population. Canada actually pays 40% more taxes.
