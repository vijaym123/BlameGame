everyone deserves the right to healthcare. Not because our forefathers said so because we said so..... It's our country now and we get to make those decisions. When I can't afford health insurance, I can't afford a doctor, and I can't just drive to another country to get some "REAL" care. WTF do I do. Well move to Canada and wait 3 weeks no thanks. Move to Cuba haaaaa....How about this, If America is the greatest country they should have the best Health care. if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA. Just like making your own self better you must look inside not outside. Quit spending money on other countries Iraq, Afghanistan etc. and spend it on ourselves. We have poor. we have people in need. When we make it a right it will be one it's as easy as that. Think before America there was no freedom of religion. We are the leaders and everyone is looking to us to fix the problem lets get off our high horses and actually do something.
