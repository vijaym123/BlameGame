22,000 people die a year?  Really?  Is the goal for this figure supposed to be 0?If he can't afford it then too bad. (I don't have   health care   because I can't afford it. You cannot use that "but you're rich" argument.)Forcing someone else to pay someone else to take care of you is not a right. I suppose I disagree "with one of the most basic declarations of human rights."  Does that mean you are going to steal my   money   through   taxes  ? In case you were unaware, the definition of to steal is "To take (the property of another) without right or permission."  (  http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/steal  )I do not give permission nor do you have a right to my property as is stated in the Constitution.  And yet, if I have a gun to defend my right to property from the government that is supposed to protect it, I will be arrested.  They will steal my freedom as well as my rights."PS With a public option, the rich population of America could still get their pampered, expensive health care while the rest of the population who is not so fortunate could receive a free option." Nothing costs nothing. The rich population of America will be paying for the rest of the population. If I were rich, I would move out of the country. Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes. These cannot be compared.
