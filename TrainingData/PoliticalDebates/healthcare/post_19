 Public insurance is unfair competition for private insurers "The End of Private Health Insurance". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: "A public program won't compete in a way that any normal business would recognize. As an entitlement, Congress's creation will enjoy potentially unlimited access to the Treasury, without incurring the risks or hedging against losses that private carriers do."
