I wouldn't necessarily label changing over to Universal Health care a quick fix. In fact, switching over to Universal Health care could possibly be quite the process. We would change the nature of the system, which differs from your example of one large stimulus check. Rather, I would compare Massachusetts's mandated health insurance to your stimulus check, where the action taken is simply a bandage on the overall problem. The stimulus check doesn't help a business that just can't stay afloat, in the same way that mandated private health insurance doesn't help people who can't afford health insurance to begin with. Also, according to the Connecticut Coalition for Universal Health Care, "The United States spends at least 40% more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country with universal health care." I think that Universal Health care "will alter the actual social condition--to mediate, to relieve, and to solve the growing poverty rates (and to make America as economically equal as it is idealistically equal)". Plus, I think we'll all be a lot healthier and more healthy people equals more people who can go to work and contribute to the overall economy.
