 Government will not favor public insurer over private insurers John Holahan and Linda Blumberg. "Is the Public Plan Option a Necessary Part of Health Reform?" Urban Institute: "[one argument against the public option] is that the public plan will always be favored—that there is no way that Congress would let the public plan fail and would find ways to tilt the playing field in its favor, providing it with advantages not afforded private plans. However, experience with the Medicare program does not support this concern. Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan. For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."
