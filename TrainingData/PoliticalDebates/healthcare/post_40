#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance. Those that decide to keep their private insurance will gain nothing from the public insurance option, and will actually have to subsidize the public insurance option by paying higher taxes. This violate the liberty of the majority of taxpayers in order to insure individuals that are often simply too irresponsible to seek and obtain their own private insurance. Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust.
