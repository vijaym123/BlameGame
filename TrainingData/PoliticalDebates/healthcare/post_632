 Free health care isn't "free".  No you don't have to pay when you go to the doctor's office but somebody does.  If doctor's worked for free eventually there would be no doctors, especially with the drastic inflation.  So technically the government would be paying for it and the money that pays for it is taken out of taxes.  Basically everyone is paying for everyone else.  Why would you want to have your money taken out if you very rarely need to go to the doctor and have it pay for someone who goes to the doctor every time they sneeze?    />     Free healthcare is the beginning of communism and communism doesn't work.  You people who believe healthcare should be free are fooling yourselves.  Nothing is free except the air you breath.  The money to pay the doctors for their services must come from somewhere, otherwise the doctors couldn't support themselves.  They would be working at a loss to help you but what would you be doing to help them?    />    Rather than having "free" healthcare I believe doctors should be restricted on their fees.  They shouldn't be allowed to charge $200 (give or take) for them to come in and say "I don't know what's wrong."
