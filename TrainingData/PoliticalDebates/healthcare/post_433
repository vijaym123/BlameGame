Okay, I read the article you linked.  Many good points, and many bogus to my thinking.  I think this is the central issue of the decade, and the most important conversation we can have.As the baby boomer demographic bulge moves into the medicare - end of life medical issues era,   health care   represents the biggest opportunity and challenge of our generation.  Just as transportation and computers dominated the economies of the last century, health care will be the economic engine of this one.  Fortunes will be made, governance will be adjusted and at the end of the day our national vision will be to live forever.  And we will be the first generation to achieve that goal.I urge all those opposed to the current what they believe to be the proposed new paradigm to flip their thought process to the contrarian point of view.  Bring new, outrageous ideas to the table.  This is going to happen, that's a given.  Make your insights an important influence on the final (or at least the first iteration) of the solution.So, can we count on your no changing to a yes?
