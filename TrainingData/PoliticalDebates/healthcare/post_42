 US private insurance is inferior to foreign public-private hybrids Paul Waldman. "The Public Option and the Hope of Health Care Reform". American Prospect. December 23, 2008: "If we're smart and lucky, we might end up with a system resembling the one they have in France (rated by the World Health Organization as the world's best), where basic health insurance is provided by the government, but most people have supplemental private insurance to fill in the gaps in coverage. [...] That kind of hybrid system would still allow 'choice,', yet cover everyone and hold down costs."
