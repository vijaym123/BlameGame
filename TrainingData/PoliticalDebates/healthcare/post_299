Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".  Seems like the whole "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness" would cover that.  If we've got a right to life then we have to have a right to care for that life and keep it going.   It's also hard to Pursue Happiness if you're sick due to a lack of medical treatment.2) Other countries aren't doing it well so we shouldn't do it at all.If we use this as a criteria we should disband the military too.  Many other countries have a bad military.  Clearly that means we shouldn't have one.  Lots of countries have bad water treatment too so let's stop doing that.  Are you really telling me that you don't think that we can learn from other countries mistakes and improve on their system.  Are you trying to tell me you don't think we can do something better than the Canadians and the French?  3) It's "Socialized Medicine".We've got socialized medicine now.  Anyone who's sick can go to the emergency room and the hospital has to treat them whether they can pay or not.  In the end we all pay for it either through government payments to the hospital, insurance or higher medical costs.  If everyone had healthcare they could get it treated early when it's more cost effective.  Why are we only paying for the poor's healthcare when it's the most expensive?
