Efforts to create a public-private insurance hybrid are in good faith. There is no reason to believe that the intentions of those that are advocating for a public option are bent on destroying the insurance industry and creating a single-payer system. It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system. Those that propose such a hybrid - through a public option - should be taken on their word, instead of called liars with a hidden agenda.
