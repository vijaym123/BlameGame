I'm only going to answer the question in the title. The national health care reform isn't the answer to our medical problems. The biggest problem is food safety and the american diet. Preventative measures need to be taught to the masses so that we can eliminate the need for much of the reasons we frequent the hospitals. What they are trying to push is system where everyone has the right and can afford health care when they DO need it. I am all for that. The biggest step is not only to address the Health Care reform talk, but to integrate measures that will take some stress off it and put the responsibility of individual health in individuals. Again, this is an answer to your question.
