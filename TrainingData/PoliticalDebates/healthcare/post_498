No system is fail safe. The system you suggest will not really help them at all. It should be enough if they don't have to pay it back with interest. That is just outrageous, they got laid off or are starving so they should be thankful they are drowning in debt just because its not with interest? A government is not truly doing its job if it is not taking care of its people.
