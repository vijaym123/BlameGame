According to this source   http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tot_exp_as_of_gdp-health-total-expenditure-gdp   the United States spends 13.9% of its GDP on health care whereas Canada spends 9.6%, Australia spends 9.1% and the United Kingdom spends just 7.5% of its GDP. I said, "the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA." According to this source   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy   the life expectancy in these four countries is Australia 80.62 years, Canada, 80.34 years, United Kingdom 78.7 years and the United States, 78.06 years. With its present arrangements, the United States spends a greater proportion of its GDP on health care and has a lower life expectancy than other English-speaking countries. US citizens on average live 2.56 years or 935 days less than Australians, 2.28 years or 832 days less than Canadians and 0.64 years or 233 days less than the British. If living 7 to 30 months longer is a small difference, then I'd like that difference to be in my favour. If living 7 to 30 months longer is a warning for what's to come, well, we might just live long enough to see it!
