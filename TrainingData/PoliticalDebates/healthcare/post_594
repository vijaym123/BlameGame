Look at us."The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system." ( Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14 ; The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States )"Current estimates put U.S. health care spending at approximately 15% of GDP, the highest in the world. A study of international health care spending levels in the year 2000, published in the health policy journal Health Affairs, found that while the U.S. spends more on health care than other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources. The number of uninsured, at 45.7 million in 2007, decreased slightly from 2006, because government programs covered nearly 3 million more people."
