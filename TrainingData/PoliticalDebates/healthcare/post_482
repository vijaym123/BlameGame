Link to H.R. 3962: http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/House%20Bill.pdf Regardless, the OP is wrong and merely perpetuating fear-mongering. For example, section 59B simply says people without acceptable healthcare (who are eligible for acceptable healthcare) will be taxed ~3%, of the excess of their taxable, gross adjusted income. Basically, you'd be taxed nothing. But acceptable healthcare is described in sub-section (D) as basically any healthcare, including government provided healthcare (veterans affairs, medicare, medicaid etc.). Moreover, the whole illegal immigrant thing is just a disingenuous play on words. The bill would exempt non-resident aliens, which just means that people who are on Visas (as opposed to people with greencards, like me) don't have to have acceptable healthcare to not be taxed.
