Massachusetts health reform is a sham.The middle income cannot afford the insurance and the state is fining them.I am a 58 year old homemaker and cannot afford the insurance $600.00 a month with a $2000.00 dedutable.Americans are brainwashed by the insurance industry.Beware of "nonprofits"who's bottom line are "profits."The media in Massachusetts will not report the truth on this law because they do not want to lose advertising dollars,The lawmakers are bought by the insurance lobbyist.The state of Massachusetts has made being uninsured a crime.If a resident does not pay the fines that is considered an "unpaid tax" which is a jailable offense.So will they jail the uninsured?
