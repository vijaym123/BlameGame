I debated about this with 2 family members who live in Australia.  They admitted that their system would fail miserably if faced with the U.S. immigration situation.  Australia tightly controls its immigration and thus there are fewer non-contributors (back into the system used by all) because there aren't as many as 30 million people who are either here illegally or related to an illegal worker and draining the system intended to assist legal residents and citizens.
