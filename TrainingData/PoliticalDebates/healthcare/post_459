To our right? If were healthy our right will be taken away? "Oh no, bob just got a heart implant an now he has no freedom of speech! Say it isn't so!" Redistribution of wealth is just something rich people made up so every one would give them more money and support things they like. "Steve is the most rich person in our city, so he must the most smart, handsome, best person in the whole city, if we give him money, it would be safer and better spent on himself!" Canada is very conservative and it has free healthcare and it is not a socialist nation. The Constitution was writen 200 years ago, so much has changed. (Also, black people now count a whole person, not 1/5 of a person anymore, and there are no slaves)
