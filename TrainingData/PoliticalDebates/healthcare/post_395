Get the Roger Moore film SICKO open your eyes read. Our country (sadly) is run by corporations they do not want you to have universal health care because they are greedy. The Canadians love their system you can go to any doctor at no cost and they get quality care. Our greedy corporations will lie and tell you the system is bad and you don't want it THEY LIE!!! Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have. We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy.
