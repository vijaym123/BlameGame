 Public insurance option has lower administrative costs Robert Reich. "Why critics of a public option for healthcare are wrong". Salon. June 24, 2009: "[the critics say] the public plan starts off with an unfair advantage because it's likely to have lower administrative costs. That may be true -- Medicare's administrative costs per enrollee are a small fraction of typical private insurance costs -- but here again, why exactly is this unfair? Isn't one of the goals of healthcare cost containment to lower administrative costs? If the public option pushes private plans to trim their bureaucracies and become more efficient, that's fine."
