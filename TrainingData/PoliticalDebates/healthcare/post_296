The nations with the best numbers (look it up at the World Health organization) all have universal healthcare. The flaws of UH can't be that bad if maternal mortality rates, for example, are 1 in 4800 in Ireland and 1 in 48,000. As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education. Isn't more important to make sure they get to live? Wouldn't preventative medicine save the nation in lost work days and school days? And for that matter, is money really the most important consideration? Here kid, learn some math, but good luck taking care of that asthma problem you have. If you make it to 18, we might have some jobs for you, thanks to your high school diploma.Cuba has better infant and maternal mortality rates than us, for Pete's sake. "Entitlements" aren't just lazy people trying to rip you off. Since you are already against increasing the minimum wage and all for eliminating benefits and moving jobs across seas, you've pretty much gone out of your way to maintain an American caste system where the unfortunate have to stay that way. Be careful what you wish for, or you may kill us all off and have no one to run your cash registers and maintain your road medians.
