I think you have it backwards. Healthcare in this country costs so much because of the profit motive of the capitalist system it operates within, not because of universal healthcare. You can't use existing prices as an argument against universal healthcare when the existing prices were caused by the private system and not a universal one. And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all. The working class is the group most likely not to have health insurance and the most likely to lose everything were they to get sick. The working class would stand to benefit most from universal healthcare, not the other way around.Finally, the greed of the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies can be brought under control pretty easily through UH. In such a system the government would be able to bargain drug prices and lower them with impugnity, as it is by far the largest customer on the market. There is a reason drug prices are so high in the U.S. and so low in other countries with Universal Healthcare.
