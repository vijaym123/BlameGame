Rights confer only a negative requirement on others.  They can in no way force them to act a certain way.  My right to life in no way infringes or conflicts with any other "real" right held by any other person.  Under no possible moral social system did any other have the right to murder me, so I cannot be forcing them by requiring that they not murder me.  I am imposing nothing on a crook by "forcing" them not to steal my property.  Just like the military and those in the justice system are not "forced" to act on my behalf.  Using their own free will and their own right to their own life they decided to work in that line.  If they had all decided otherwise I would have no "right" to compel them otherwise, I would simply have the decision to defend myself or not.  Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.  I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.  And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.  That is use physical force against me, they not steal my property, imprison or kill me.Much more on this line can be understood reading Ayn Rand's article "Man's Rights," available for free here:  http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights
