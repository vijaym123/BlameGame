"Get the Roger Moore film SICKO open your eyes read." #1: It's MICHAEL Moore. He's been well known for twisting facts around in some of his previous works:  http://www.moorewatch.com  /  http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm    http://www.ithaca.edu/looksharp/911lesson.pdf    http://www.workingpsychology.com/download_folder/Propaganda_And_Fahrenheit.pdf   (a personal favorite)"Our country (sadly) is run by corporations they do not want you to have universal health care because they are greedy."Our country (unfortunately) is being overrun by a government that does not want you to have a choice in the healthcare industry because they know they will have the right to tax the living hell out of you if they ran the whole system. Corporations are so greedy, they choose to provide faster, better, and more accessible care because they know it will satisfy customers and bring in money; nothing wrong with that.  "The Canadians love their system you can go to any doctor at no cost and they get quality care."..........................................................If you have the patience though.  http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/10/15/waittimes-fraser.html    http://www.cbcn.ca/en/index.php?section=1&category=186&regionid=&page=10015    http://sigmundcarlandalfred.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/the-waiting-game-er-wait-times-in-canada-vs-us  /And if you pay taxes in Canada, then it's not free.   http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html  "Our greedy corporations will lie and tell you the system is bad and you don't want it THEY LIE!!!"It's been tried and tested, and it's failed. Ok, so maybe it never "failed," it's simply been shown to be far less efficient.  "Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have."Part of why they are getting rich is because they want more government intervention. With insurance programs like SCHIP, Medicare, and Medicaid, people don't have any incentive to negotiate prices. They also try and prevent you from using services that would allow you to do so:  http://blog.mises.org/archives/004710.asp  "We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy."Funny thing is, most of the 50 million or so people without health insurance in America are generally rich f#$@s who don't NEED insurance anyway....   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbpmSIa6hQQ  ....so no need to switch to a system which we know is bound to fail...  http://mises.org/story/2424
