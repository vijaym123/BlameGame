 Health care is not a right.  It is already largely controlled by government influences, and has been for a couple of decades.  Many of the problems are the result of government intrusion into healthcare.  More government intrusion will lead to further problems; there is no reason it would be better.  Besides, the majority of folks don't want the major changes Obama and Congress are promoting.  Is this a Democracy or what?
