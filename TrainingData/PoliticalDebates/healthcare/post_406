Public spending is already 50% of health care related costs.  That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.  http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_hea_car_fun_pub_per_cap-care-funding-public-per-capita  So even if we assume the metrics you provided are actually related to health care, as opposed something else like lifestyle and crime, it simply doesn't follow that more government funding will fix the problem.
