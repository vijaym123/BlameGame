By the way...    in striving to be better than your neighbors... what does that actually mean?That you can buy more things?   That you work harder to buy more stuff? Do you need a plasma flat screen whatever?  Does it make you better to have it?  Do you need a 12 man hottub?  Does THIS make you better?  What about a bigger boat?  Does That make you better?  A bigger car?  A more expensive bike?Are you confusing material possessions with what makes a person better?     I didn't buy a new car this year.  Guess what I did?   I actually spent time with my family.  Wow.  On vacation.  Where we ate at restaurants, bought crappy t-shirts, over-paid for silly drawings from local artists, and tipped generously.   I didn't buy a flat screen from Best-Buy where the guy who might've sold it to me is barely making it (but hey...  those rich guys pay the highest salaries... or... don't they?), but I bought season tickets.  And everytime I go I'll be spending   money   where it stays local and more people benefit from it.   Does This make Me a better person?  No.  It just means the money I spend is a bit more spread out and more people benefit from it.   You're not a better person because you can buy more things than another person...
