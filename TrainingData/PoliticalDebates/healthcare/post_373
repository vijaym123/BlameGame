"There's no such thing as altruism. Everyone is selfish."So how exactly would public ownership of the means of production address this?"It doesn't matter if they're doing things supposedly for someone else... it's always done out of self-interest."So all those who died on 9/11 trying to save others where saving them out of self-interest. Good to know. "Anything done that is "altruistic" is done for the individual doing the act because it will benefit that person."Can you explain the following under that assumption:  http://www.doubleazone.com/2009/01/depauw_softball_megan_soultz_us_airways_airplane_crash_hudson_river_flight_1549.php  "But you wouldn't know that because you're so up Ayn Rand's ass.... she's a second rate philosopher anyway. Excellent writer, though."Sure as hell better than Marx. At least her ideas didn't result in the deaths of over 100 million people.  http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/usa/news/article_1316649.php  /BACKGROUND_100_million_deaths_under_communismI would highly recommend "The Black book of Communism." My only criticism is that it makes the holocaust look like a Disney movie (somewhat).
