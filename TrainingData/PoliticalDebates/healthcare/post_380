Don’t confuse access to ideal   health care   to access to ideal medical insurance.  All Americans have access to ideal medical care. The problem is affordability.  The rich can afford it, the middle class may go bankrupt, and the poor is subsidized.First we ask ourselves why we pay the most for health care as compared to other rich nations on earth. The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyers’, courts’ and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc. These added cost,  other  than private insurance cost, will still exist whether we have government run   universal health care   or not.Let’s ask ourselves what services private medical insurance providers do for us in return for profits the National Physician Alliance (NPA)   might consider to be hefty? They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims. Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees? Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?  If we like quality service from privately run medical care provider are we going to pay for both the public and the private plan? Will it be like families who chose to send their   kids   to efficient private school and ended up paying for both?
