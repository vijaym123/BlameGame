#originalTopic=All_Health_Care_Should_Be_Free
 I think healthcare should be free. People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better. A doctor or health care person should not go to school to make sure he makes a lot of money but if it is their will to be a doctor then be the doctor for the very reason of helping a sick person.
