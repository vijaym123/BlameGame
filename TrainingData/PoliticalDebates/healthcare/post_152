#originalTopic=Debate:_Single-payer_universal_health_care
"Is it wrong to call single-payer systems socialized medicine?" is another inconsequential question.  It's answer is meaningless to which system provides the most benefits to the most people.  It's a semantic argument which will hang more on specific definitions or words that anything resembling rational health care debate.  Having said that - the answer is "yes".  Socializing anything involves taking individual decisions and "socializing" any negative effects to the community instead of limiting it to the individual.
