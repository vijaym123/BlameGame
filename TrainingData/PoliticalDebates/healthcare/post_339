"What   single payer   means is, you pick your doctor. You pick your hospital. Government picks up the bill."government = everyoneIf we could "buy into" the   public option  , I'd be all for it.  But we can't.  We all pay no matter what.  I just checked my old paycheck stubs... I paid 245 for medicare in 2008. I have no   health insurance  , I am struggling to pay rent, and I can't afford   textbooks  .  I live off of ramen and pasta because they're the cheapest I can get.  How is this fair?  I'm paying for some old person to live a little bit longer when I could be buying textbooks and saving for a car.  Even worse is   social security   which I paid 1043 in 2008 and which I expect to see none of when I retire because the country is bankrupt.  Total in   taxes  , I paid 3382 in 2008.  I am a model citizen in graduate school, planning on being a   college   professor, never broken   the law  , working as a full time TA to get through it, and I am in serious debt right now because I can't afford living expenses.  This is all easy for you to say up there in Canada but you don't know what it's like for college   kids   and grads right now who can't get   jobs   and whose parents are losing jobs.  Taxing everyone more is not going to help.  I'd rather have the cash to spend where I choose than to have public   health care  .  Again, If we could "buy into" the public option, I'd be all for it.
