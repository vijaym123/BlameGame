 Mandates wrongly give insurers millions of new customers Robert Creamer. "Three Reasons Why a Strong Public Option is Likely to be Part of Health Insurance Reform" Huffington Post. August 18, 2009: "Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines. You can see why, from an insurance company perspective, this would be a great deal. But from the point of view of the taxpayers - and the insurance ratepayers - it would be a disaster. It would be like giving the insurance companies a license to take your money - with no regulation - all enforced by government edict."
