"1 The "deep left" fallacy. The three countries that you smear with this tag happen to be the closest allies of the USA and the countries that are closest in culture to your country. If such countries are 'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right."Again, I only see people on the (cough) deep left misreading statements and statistics. In this case you completely ignored who/what I directed that comment towards. Since you didn't notice it the first time, I will make it more clear: I was directed that label at YOU, not Canada or any of the other countries you cite as having a 2 year life expectancy difference. If I were directing that label at Canada or those other countries, then you would be right. But I wasn't. "It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA. I have presented evidence that suggests that universal health schemes work out cheaper. You dispute the evidence but that's no reason to assume that the opposite is true."Doesn't take much thinking to realize that for Universal Healthcare to become a reality government spending would have to go up. In the comments you have directed at me (from what I can see here:  http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/us-pays-more-for-medicine-and-is-worse-off  ) you have not presented such evidence. What you have presented so far indicates that countries like Canada SPEND less, none that suggest that they COST less, which is what I disputed in this comment:  http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/reality-and-life-expectancy   "3 The GDP is a standard measure. See   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product  " The GDP is not something to be relied upon......  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product  #Limitations_of_GDP_to_judge_the_health_of_an_economy....mainly because it is a GROSS measurement, not a net one. Look up the differences between GROSS profit and NET profit and you'll see what I mean."4 "[T]he 2-year difference [in life expectancy] probably has nothing to do with healthcare."This is a guess. You don't know. You don't present evidence. This assertion is baseless."I presented plenty of evidence which I will repost since you missed it the first time:"Wow, 80.4 (Canada) vs. 78.06 (US). I feel such a small difference would have more to do with the nature of fast food America and almost nothing to do with healthcare.""4. That small 2-year difference is almost guaranteed to be the result of poor health choices in the US and probably have nothing whatsoever to do with health care."In both of those quotes I contended that the nature of how people make unhealthy choices in America is probably the reason why that tiny minute 2-year difference is even there. You have yet to take those factors into account and prove it's just the UHC that gives that tiny difference.
