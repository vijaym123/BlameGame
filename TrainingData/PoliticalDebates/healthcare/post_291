According to the CIA, Australia has an infant death rate of 4.75 per thousand, in the United Kingdom it's 4.85, in Canada it's 5.04 and in the United States it's 6.26.  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html  Let's put that into figures that are easier to understand. In 2007, there were 4,217.000 births in the United States. At a death rate of 6.26 per thousand, that would mean that 26,398 of those babies would die. At a death rate of 4.75 per thousand, only 20,031 babies would have died. In other words, if America had the infant death rate that Australia has, more than 6,000 US babies would live. So whatever the reasons there are for the lower life expectancy in the United States, superior medical care of infants does not appear to be one of them.
