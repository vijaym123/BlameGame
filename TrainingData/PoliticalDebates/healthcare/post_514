Yeah..., I noticed. What cracks me up is that you took the time to contribute content to my debate which means that it was entertaining enough for you to participate lol I mean, think about it. I was able to engage an English man, living in England, to search the Internet for data sources that back up his argument that the U.S. should have Nationalized Heath Care. It reminds me of this:http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005424.html both the cartoon and the discussion about the cartoon ;)Why would an Englishman care enough (one way or another) about U.S. politics to spend any time on it? It is all very interesting, no? Maybe he's thinking about moving to the U.S. but doesn't want to give up his nationalized health care or maybe it's because misery loves company and he wants Americans to be in the same boat as the Brits or maybe he's pissed off at the fact that the Americans kicked the English out of the U.S. during the revolution because we just don't like their form of government and he's still trying to force it down our throats. I have no idea, but that's what I call entertainment ;)
