1 The "deep left" fallacy. The three countries that you smear with this tag happen to be the closest allies of the USA and the countries that are closest in culture to your country. If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?" It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA. I have presented evidence that suggests that universal health schemes work out cheaper. You dispute the evidence but that's no reason to assume that the opposite is true.3 The GDP is a standard measure. See   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product  4 "[T]he 2-year difference [in life expectancy] probably has nothing to do with healthcare." This is a guess. You don't know. You don't present evidence. This assertion is baseless.5 We both know and agree that Australia, Canada and the UK have greater life expectancies than the USA. 6 We both know and agree that Australia, Canada and the UK have universal health schemes and the USA does not.7 We also know that the proportion of GDP spent on health care in these three countries is lower than the United States. However, we disagree about whether this is a reliable comparison.8 You assert that the differences in life expectancy have "probably" nothing to do with health care. However, you have not provided one shred of evidence for this claim.I have presented evidence for my opinion. You have presented no evidence for yours.
