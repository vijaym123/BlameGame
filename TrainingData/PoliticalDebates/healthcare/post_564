On a personal note, I'd trust the government to take care of me more than a private insurance company. Also, the most I've ever waited at the DMV is an hour. I had to wait months and months in order to see a specialist my doctor referred me to (of course, one my insurance would cover), and then when I finally got to see the specialist, he had so many appointments that he only saw me for about 5 minutes. I think Universal Health care would be better for everyone, for the reasons I've already outlined. I'm not focusing solely on the poor. What numbers are you referencing?
