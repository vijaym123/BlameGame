I hadn't seen this data...very interesting. It just buttresses my point. To say "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" is clearly not true! They clearly do cost far less than the US system, as the numbers you so clearly provided prove!The US system is dysfunctional in many ways. One reason that public-funding of healthcare in the US is so high is that the US has to treat people who are very sick, who didn't get the healthcare they needed in the first place...they arrive at a publicly funded institution once they are really in trouble. Private hospitals dump very sick people without insurance on the public system. Also, the entire healthcare market has become distorted, corrupted, in the US, with medical procedures and services costing far more in the US than in other countries. This affects both private and public healthcare. I certainly wouldn't say that "more government funding will fix the problem." The system needs fixing, not more funding. One thing that has to be done is to remove the insurance companies from the equation, which will lead to immense savings.
