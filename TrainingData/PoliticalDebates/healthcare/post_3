#originalTopic=Debate:_Public_insurance_option_in_US_health_care
 Choosing between complicated health insurance plans is difficult John Holahan and Linda Blumberg. "Is the Public Plan Option a Necessary Part of Health Reform?" Urban Institute: "there is considerable variation in health insurance products sold, and consumers have great difficulty in making price and quality comparisons. This is especially true in the private nongroup insurance market, but is increasingly true in commercial group insurance as well. [...] The products offered by sellers in insurance and hospital markets are complex and difficult to understand and evaluate. It is almost impossible to compare prices of either insurance products or services provided by hospitals and other health providers." [The status quo, therefore, offers little "reasoned choice". Simple public insurance would make it easier on consumers.]
