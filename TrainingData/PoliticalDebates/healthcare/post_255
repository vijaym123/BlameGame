You seem to feel that civil and political rights are the only ones that are worth being protected a la the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. What about the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which includes the right to   healthcare  ? As long as healthcare providers are being compensated for their time in one way or another, how are their rights being violated? Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point. How about this...If you don't want to help people who need medical care, then don't become a doctor. You have the "right" to decide to do something else instead.
