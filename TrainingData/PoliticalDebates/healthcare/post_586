My assumptions are exactly that but here comes the time where your argument will be torn apart again. Ok this is to both of your points: simply put you are not responsible for all of your own survival. Answer me this, do you pay for everything or pitch in your part? Do you pay your own utilities or at least pay your part? Do you pay for your insurance? (that's more relevant to this topic) I'll stop there because I'm seriously tired of debating you on issues that are just ridiculous. I know my assumptions are going to be 90% right. (hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point. Let me say this. Almost the entire world is under some sort of universal health plan. That says enough. And since i always back up my points here are some for you:here is a list of 454 educated people, organizations, governments, etc..http://www.pnhp.org/action/organizations_and_government_bodies_endorsing_hr_676.php If you're not convinced than take a shot at a few of these links. And if you're still not convinced then we need to have a chat.http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1925024 http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=2833 http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/kfiles/b1372037.html http://www.hungeractionnys.org/commissmemo.htm http://www.massnurses.org/single_payer/whois.htm http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19159736?ordinalpos=5&itool;=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum I don't even need to read any more with this one: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10129514?dopt=Abstract
