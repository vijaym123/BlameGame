I think healthcare for all is a worthwhile goal.  As we worked hard to put the first man on the moon, we could work hard to help those in need of medicine, surgery, etc.  Unfortunately, I cannot think of many programs that the government runs well.  A healthcare system run by the government may end up as a disaster. I want Universal healthcare, but I think it needs to be private.
