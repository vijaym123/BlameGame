Health is often out of an individual's control; like fires. You will see that the other side of this argument makes a distinction between things that an individual can control and those he/she cannot.  Their argument is that fire and police protection are things beyond the control of individuals.  But that healthcare is not.  This argument is seriously flawed.  Even a young child can see why. Many healthcare issues are very much out of the control of individuals.  What if you're in a bus accident?  Many accidents are out of the control of individuals. I agree that many accidents are a result of an individual being stupid or not being careful....but aren't many fires caused by this as well? There is no real distinction here.  Either you should be opposed to fire/police protection and universal healthcare, or should support both.  Picking one is a logical inconsistency
