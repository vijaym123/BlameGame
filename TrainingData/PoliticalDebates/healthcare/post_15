 Public and private insurers can learn from each other Jacob Hacker. "The case for public plan". The Institute for America's Future: "public and private plans can learn from each other as they exploit their strengths and remedy their weaknesses. Expanded coverage of prescription drugs by Medicare HMOs, for example, demonstrated the feasibility of drug coverage for the elderly and helped to increase political pressure for drug coverage for all people with Medicare. The development of performance measures for Medicare private plans provided a template for projects testing comparable measures under the public Medicare plan. Similarly, innovations in coordinating care for elders with chronic illness in private plans have provided a useful foundation for care-coordination demonstrations in the public Medicare plan."
