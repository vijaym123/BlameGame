SkipTN,You have the right idea that UHC would increase wait time and pressure on emergency rooms, etc.The solution to this problem is not to pressure insurance companies to cover everyone.  They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.  It's true that not everyone would have coverage. Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people. Wouldn't this encourage people to take care of themselves? I would rather encourage people to do what's right for them than to force it with   taxes   on unhealthy   food  ,   cigarettes  , etc. while still paying for their continued (more expensive) unhealthy habits.  I also strongly disagree with the idea of a few people making a decision that will affect everybody.  If everyone was unanimous in this decision, it would have much higher chance of success.  The simple fact that people are divided means live and let live.  That is the basis of this country isn't it?
