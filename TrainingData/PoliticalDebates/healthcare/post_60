 Public insurance would not waste money on lobbying Signe Wilkinson. "Unhealthy arguments against public option" Philadelphia Daily News. July 14, 2009: "government-paid insurance surely wouldn't be forking over the estimated $1.4 million per day that the health insurance industry is spending to lobby members of Congress to block competition from a government plan - and, with it, more choices for Americans. The army of lobbyists includes 350 former government staff members who - before they took the revolving door for a spin - worked for the very same committees that are writing the legislation."
