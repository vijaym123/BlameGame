 Public insurance option is less costly than private insurance "Why The Public Health Insurance Option Is Worth Fighting For". Think Progress. August 19th, 2009: "Real health care reform that includes a new public health insurance option could adopt the kind of payment reforms that would start to “hold down long-term growth in health spending' and encourage providers to deliver care more efficiently. We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicare’s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."
