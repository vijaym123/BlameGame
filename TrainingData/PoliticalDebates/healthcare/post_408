I agree with your point, but I think you missed the original point... the distinction between costs and spending.The original author suggested that Single-Payer systems spend less, not by more efficiency or lack of medical necessity but by political decree.  They cut corners and spend less by denying patients who need services and by reducing payments to doctors.  This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it.
