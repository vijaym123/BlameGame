I am Fred my main fight is to end the War on US (drugs) and stop putting good people in jail for thinking they have freedom of choice. It is a little off subject for me but it is part of my plan. If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan. To believe in my plan you should first watch the documentary SICKO by Roger Moore. You will see how the Canadians love their system they can go to any doctor and pay nothing it is high quality universal health care. DO NOT believe the lies our leaders will tell you. Big money is paying our leaders house/senate through PACs to not have universal health care and it is the same reason as in the War on Drugs. Greed is the main motivator for both actions so do not listen to the lies see the movie and listen to the real people that have nothing to gain by lying about the system. They love it! My plan is to end the War on US (drugs) and save the money (estimated to be 100 billion a year) and the estimated 50 billion lost in tax income from sales of just Marijuana and pay for universal health care for all Americans. The estimated cost of universal health care is 70 billion so we would have 80 billion left over. So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leader house/senate. We will not conform to a War conceived of racism perpetuated by greed and supported by lies. The War on US (drugs) must end and get free health care for all at no extra cost. LEGALIZE*REGULATE*TAX  quit putting our children, mothers, fathers, yes even grandparents in jail for exercising a constitutional right that was stolen 70 years ago!
