My goal is not to "help the rich" nor do I understand the "They can aford it, make them pay" argument either.My goal is to improve this country. As long as a person can go on unemployment and not have to pay that money back, there will be people taking advantage of that situation. If you make it so that they have to pay it back, you give people the incentive to get back to work. Productive individuals are what makes a country great.
