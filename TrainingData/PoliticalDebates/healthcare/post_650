 It is not my obligation to pay for the healthcare of others. As a Christian, I am all for charity and think the church needs to step up to that far better than it has done so, but forced payment on my part removes that possibility. Not to mention, government programs are always a mess and our constitution is designed to limit governmental power for that reason.
