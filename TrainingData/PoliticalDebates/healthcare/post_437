Check out the VA hospital system if you want a "shining" example of government-run healthcare. It is the most expensive hospital bed in the country, oftem have unlicensed, poorly trained physicians and tend to deliver very poor medical care. I am a physician and volunteered in a VA clinic and it was pathetic. The medication formulary was so limited that I often would go back to my office and FedEx sample meds to the patients who needed tham but the VA refused to stock the meds in order to "save costs". This limited view of medical practice resulted in many surgeries that may have been prevented. Many of the VA hospital patients are used as teaching tools for medical students - not a bad practice but as the quality of the staff is sometimes poor the teaching is poor as well.If we go to universal healthcare with the Federal Government as the purveyer of care - we will get just what we deserve - poor care and extravegant costs.
