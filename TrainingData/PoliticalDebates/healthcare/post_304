What happens when a large company gives you healthcare?  It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.  And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.  What kind of rules/laws will be placed on every citizen because everyone is paying for everyone else.  Why should I pay for Joe Smith who is 200 pounds overweight, smokes, and doesn't take care of himself when I jog every morning, don't smoke and am in good health?I could go on, but I think you get the idea...
