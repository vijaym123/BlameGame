Do large numbers of uninsured give cause to universal health care? No, as it does nothing to answer how many would be without in a hypothetical universal system.  For instance, what if we knew that instead of 50 million uninsured, we would end up with 60 million uninsured due to additional inefficiencies and failure to predict actual cost?
