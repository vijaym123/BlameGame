Costs of Medicare/Medicaid show wastefulness of public insurance. Gregory Mankiw. "The pitfalls of the public option" New York Times. June 27, 2009: "The largest existing public health programs — Medicare and Medicaid — are the main reason that the government’s long-term finances are in shambles. True, Medicare’s administrative costs are low, but it is easy to keep those costs contained when a system merely writes checks without expending the resources to control wasteful medical spending."
