Universal healthcare makes business sense. 1) Ensuring the health of all citizens benefits a nation economically. Sick and injured people are less productive.2) When you have multiple competing insurance companies, each company has to repeat the same work. Each company needs it's own secretaries, computer people, lawyers, etc. These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States. Thus universal health care would actually mean less government spending and lower taxes. (source)
