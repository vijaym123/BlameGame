Like you, I wish all Americans to be covered with quality health coverage- I, for one, do not only want "illness" coverage, but access for myself and my patients for preventative and wellness care; I believe the more we can prevent illness, the less expensive our health care will be in the long run. I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.
