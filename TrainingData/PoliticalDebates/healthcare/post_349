Before you call me unpatriotic, or whatever you can think of as an insult, listen to my argument.Universal HealthCare, like communism, works out great on paper, but never in practice.Quite honestly, you just can't expect a semi-corrupted, inefficent government with another branch.Especially if that branch is Healthcare. We are better off with privatized   healthcare   and medicaid.
