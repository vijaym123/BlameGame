So why do people dislike this plan so much?The New York Times recently wrote:"The prospect of competing with a government plan terrifies the private insurers. But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing. Innovative private plans that already deliver better services at lower costs would survive. Inefficient private plans would wither."So if we've got a   public option  , private insurance companies would wither and die.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/us/politics/08daschle.html?ref=todayspaper  Is this a real thing?Some analysts say no, and point to the fact that over half of the states offer state employees the option to buy into a public plan, as opposed to private   health insurance   company products. The PHI companies in these states are still doing fine.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/health/policy/07health.html?ref=todayspaper  Some maintain that the state coverage model above isn't an applicable comparison to the nationwide coverage option.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/health/policy/07plan.html?ref=todayspaper  Some, like me, hope they're right and that the public option is a slam-dunk that beats out the corporations. Better coverage at lower costs? That's a win. Not because I'm a leftist (I am) but because less people will die and more of us keep our   money  .And what I'm describing, what's on the table, is actually pretty popular. 63% of Americans like it.  http://mediamatters.org/columns/200906190026  Sorry, make that 72%. Including half of Republicans  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/health/policy/21poll.html?ref=todayspaper  Good for us.OK, some messages now to certain people. To the people in   congress   promoting the trigger idea: Public option wouldn't be instituted unless at some point down the road, private health insurance companies haven't met certain standards. Knock it off. The standards aren't being met now.To the people who are selling others into local insurance buying co-ops. Knock it off. Your little thing doesn't have the market power to have the benefits of the national plan.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  Tot he people to the left of me (there are some) who are saying that the public option isn't good enough. Knock it off. We can't get a single-payer system, at least this term. This is an excellent start.To Bobby Jindal, who said"Republicans believe in a simple principle:  no Americans should have to worry about losing their   health care   coverage.  Period.  We stand for universal access to affordable health care coverage. What we oppose is universal government-run health care.  Health care decisions should be made by   doctors   and patients, not by government bureaucrats. We believe Americans can do anything.   And if we put aside partisan   politics   and work together, we can make our system of private   medicine   affordable and accessible for every one of our citizens."Knock it off. You guys have been opposing health care for all americans since FDR and Truman proposed it.  http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/04/30-0  You guys give us...not good plans. I mean, the big republican plan would have only helped 10% of Americans without health insurance.  http://www.therationalradical.com/transcripts/152transcript-publicoption.htm  and why not   http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/opinion/26fri1.html  There's another line that I hear a lot: Do I want some government bureaucrat between me and my doctor?Yes. Compare it to what I have now, which is a corporate bureaucrat between me and my doctor. They make money when they figure out how to deny my claim. That's their purpose, that's how they profit. It's called recission. They're very good at it.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/opinion/29mon1.html?ref=todayspaper  and why not  http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/16/health.care  .hearing/I also hear how the AMA is against the public option.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/us/politics/11health.html?_r=2  That's just what the AMA seems to do. The AMA opposed Medicare. Which is more than I can say for house republicans, who after an amendment was proposed by Rep. Wiener from New York to end Medicare, didn't get any votes.I'm still going with this, so keep watching.
