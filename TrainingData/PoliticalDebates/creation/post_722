Today (July 22nd 2009) the 'best' solar eclipse of the century took place from India to Japan.  Reading about this I have again read over the mechanics of what exactly a solar eclipse is... and that it causes eclipses is in no way indicative of intent behind it's size and position.  During a solar eclipse only a tiny fraction of the earth is actually fully covered...  http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur.php
