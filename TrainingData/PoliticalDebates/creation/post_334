Jay Richards says "There’s especially intriguing evidence of design in cosmology, physics, and astronomy."This is the twentieth-century version of geocentrism.  It is no different than the medieval priest telling his credulous flock that God had blessed their fair city by putting the river and the harbor and the seaport right next to it.Intelligent design creationists are unable to fairly contemplate the reality of evolution, the adaptation of life forms to the natural environment, with the laws of physics and chemistry selecting successful traits.  The traits of the organisms did not - could not - select the laws of chemistry and physics - or astrophysics or cosmology.It is sheerest hubris to assert that galaxies billions of light years away were formed by forces that were “fine-tuned for life...if the gravitational force had even a slightly different value, life would not have been possible."  Gravity and other universal cosmological constants were not intelligently designed for the convenience of life on earth.  Get over it.Intelligent design creationists have even proposed that life is on earth because earth is not too hot or too cold, but, like Goldilocks' porridge, just right.  Riiight...
