The first problem with the debate question is that neither time nor space exists per se.  Then comes the definition of units of time, such as “a day.”  Neither of these points was apparent in earlier times when the myths date from.  But even though it is also still true that science most probably does not have clear or even close answers in cosmology today (the big bang theory works pretty good, but the big splat theory has not been eliminated, and then there is understanding dark matter and dark energy and there possible implications) it does not mean that any theory or myth is as valid as any other.Using biblical myths as anything other than analogies is disrespectful of religion and reduces its potential value to society.  At the vary lest it make religion unnecessarily subject to discrediting and rejection when science proves here to fore believed “facts” unlikely, improbable or just plain wrong.
