#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Can we get one thing straight. Evolution is fact. A theory in science, is an explanation for observations, and you cannot deny that evolution has taken place over the last millions of years. One thing no-one can say for sure is the driving force behind evolution, it could be down to a supreme deity, but evolution is fact, and it is in no way wrong.
