Hasn't anybody here read a molecular cell biology textbook? The machinery of the cell is a Rube Goldberg apparatus. If it was designed, the designer went to a lot of trouble to make it look undesigned.One can  compare what designed and undesigned systems look like. For example, some complex electronic circuits are designed by engineers and others are created through the use of adaptive programs that amount to artificial versions of natural selection. Both kinds of circuits work, but they have distinctly different characteristics. The designed circuits tend to be less tolerant of malfunctions than the evolved circuits and it's much harder to figure out how the undesigned circuits work. In other words, when nature is examined, it appears to be undesigned. This is a positive finding, not a inference. None of this will convince the ID folks, of course, because they are irrational religionists.
