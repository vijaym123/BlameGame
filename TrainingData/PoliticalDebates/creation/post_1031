We do seem to be arguing past each other, and I will apologize for some of that.As for Caroline Crocker, I mentioned her in my previous argument, of people who were not fired for merely mentioning ID. If you would like to hear the real story of what happened with her please look here. As the article shows, she actually taught creationism, and made flawed arguments against evolution. The students were the ones that complained, and she later lied about being blacklisted.As for your post of non-religious scientists, I must point out that that is a blog and not a scientific peer reviewed journal. Because I am not a scientist myself I cannot accurately peer review them, however I can say that I can see what appear to be flaws in their arguments. They talk about "specified complexity." What this means is that a system, is too complex to have evolved. Another term that is often used by ID proponents is "irreducible complexity." This argument has already been debunked by numerous scientists including Ken Miller. Here is a video of him proving the argument to be invalid. What this leads me to believe is that there are other flaws, and that they are merely giving specious reasons for ID.
