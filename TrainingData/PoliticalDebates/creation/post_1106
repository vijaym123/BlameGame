#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 There are lots of proofs that show evolution is not at all a proper scientific law which can give a perfect explanation to human appearance. It is not at all hundred percent correct and thus it is not considered as a law. This theory of evolution fails to elucidate many things which are expected to be revealed by this theory. Apart from this evolution theory is not fully truthful. Thus after so many days it is still said to be a theory in lieu of law. The theory of natural selection, theory from Darwin did not succeed to give the proper enlightenment to this evolution theory. Those theories were sounding good but not 100% scientifically correct. This evolution theory can easily make a student to ask the logical base of this theory to his or her teacher. Only the teacher can avoid and nothing else.
