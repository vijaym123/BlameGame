The argument he is giving is that the day age theory works better then the 6-day creation. "A day is a thousand years" is no more literal then when Jesus said you have to forgive a person 7 times 7. The advantage to the day age creation is not only that it agrees with   science   but that there is no way to explain how the writer of Genesis knew that the plants were created before the sun appeared in the sky.
