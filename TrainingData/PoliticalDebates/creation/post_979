1st: Evolution does not require dramatic mutation. Most evolution occurs through small incremental mutations over many many generations. (If it helps, imagine how people age. From day to day there are no obvious differences, but over long periods of time, people can look completely different then they did when they were younger.)2nd: We have seen significant mutations occur that do not affect the viability of the organisms offspring.3rd: We have actually seen evolution occur, even to the point of speciation.4th: You're dumb to think that you know more than every biologist on earth.In short, you're wrong because you are distinguishing between micro and macro evolution. Macro evolution is the same thing as micro evolution, just on a larger time scale.
