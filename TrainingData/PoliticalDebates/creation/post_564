"The theory of   evolution   is flawed in that it is incapable of explaining how life on Earth began."-LivvyExcept that the theory of Evolution has no bearing on the actual start of life.  It only takes effect once life begins, describing how that life adapts to changing physical   conditions  "The accepted theory is that lightning struck primordial soup somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.6 billion years ago and a self-replicating cell just popped up."-LivvyThat in no way describes the current theories about how life began."The world's most brilliant scientists can't even figure out how to create a cell in a laboratory, so the chances of one just accidentally being created 5 billion years ago are incredibly slim."-LivvySo intelligent agents cannot create life under strict lab conditions?  Seems more like an argument against ID, rather then for it... unless you are willing / able to demonstrate how an intelligent agent would be better at creating life then we are."The reason we shun the idea of something creating us is because we believe that the beginning of life started on this planet. Not only is that theory egocentric, it's not backed by the evidence. The more physicists understand the relativity of time, the more elusive the "beginning" and "end" of time become."-LivvyWhat does the the nature of time and string theory (which is in itself quite suspect) have to do with evolution vs. ID?"So something that was alive before us that came here to create the first life on Earth is absolutely not out of the question. Call it an alien invasion or whatever you like, but even Francis Crick (discoverer of DNA and the double helix) wrote that this theory has more merit than the "lightning striking primordial soup" idea of the Darwinists."-LivvyWhich only pushes the question of the origin of life somewhere else... while adding the burden of how did that life get to Terra in the first place.What predictions does life being created elsewhere the being brought to Terra make, how could we test that theory and how could it be proven?
