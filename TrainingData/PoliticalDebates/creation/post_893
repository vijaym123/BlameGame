I do believe the world was created in 6 days. I believe EVERY Christian must believe this because without Genesis being a "fact," the bible would be useless. Let me explain why. If God hadn't created Adam and Eve and given them dominion over everything on the earth, under his authority, the bible would not make any sense. Adam and Eve were created within those days, and were also given the chance to either choose to obey God or to choose to disobey and learn of the knowledge of good and evil. This is where SIN became part of this world: through Adam eating from the tree. If Genesis is just a "myth" and the rest of scripture is to be taken as "fact," the bible just does not make any sense. We would have no idea what sin is, where it came from, why we need our relationship with God restored, why we are above animals, and how this world came to be.
