#originalTopic=There_Is_No_Evidence_For_Evolution
 If you wanted to start an actual debate you should have said there is no ‘convincing’ evidence. Because the simple fact of the matter is that there is more evidence than you could examine in several lifetimes of study. The question is whether you agree in the interpretation of the evidence. It is your privilege if you wish to disagree with those that know and understand vast amounts more than you do on the subject.
