Please take no offence to my response. I refute arguments not people.I do not believe, as implicated in your rhetorical question, that evolution is the consequence of a controlled experiment. For your rhetorical question expresses that the evolutionary natural process is a consequence of a controlled experiment. A controlled experiment evidences only a consequence of a controlled experiment. In a laboratory we can conclude as a consequence of an experiment that plastic is derived from petroleum. We can not say that petroleum will become plastic one day. We must always be vigilantly mindful of that which we think evidences one thing when we are controlling only some of the variables in any given experiment.
