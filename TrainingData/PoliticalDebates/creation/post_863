Mike, my apologies to you, but I am surprised at the numbers of people here who appear to be somewhat hostile towards the existence of a Supreme Being, namely God, Yahweh, Yahwah, YHWH, The I Am That I Am, and so forth.  This is not a question, but if we are dealing with a Highly Intelligent Being who created everything that we hear, taste, see and feel, then why must we question the possibility that He may have precisely created the present Universe in six days, Hebrew etymology aside?  I believe that there are some things that we were not meant to completely understand, and this happens to be one of them.  Why can't we just be content in knowing that God created our present Universe and world in a series of 1-2-3-4-5-6 and rested on 7.  It doesn't matter if the Creation happened in 6 days or 6 millennia, but I always choose the former.  There are many passages in the Bible that are quite literal, so it could be a fact that the Universe as we know it was indeed created in six days.  Again, this is what I call the hair-splitting approach: Like the disciple Thomas, we demand to justify everything, including the supernatural, unless we can see it ourselves.  If you believe in God as I do, then some things we must accept because of our faith, any presence of doubt will show our absence of faith.   There are simply some things that we will never be able to explain because they are far beyond the frailty of the human mind.   No matter how hard people try, there will always be things that human beings will never be able to explain.
