#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 There's no rational reason to accept creationism, it's simply empty claims with no evidence, it has no predictive powers, it cannot explain what we see in nature and it introduces a level of complexity with no explanation, requiring mindless faith. How anyone with half a brain can accept creationism is beyond me.
