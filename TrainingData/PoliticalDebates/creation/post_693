If it is, then only a malicious God would tell it out of order, use terms we cannot understand, or have other 'traps' while holding us to its words. I believe the term many use is 'inerrant'. They believe every word was overseen by God. That view is inconsistent with two accounts where clearly things are happening in a different order. 'Inspired by God' is a good phrasing. Clearly much of both stories was 'borrowed' from earlier creation myths. The question is not whether it is literally true, but what did those early Jews change that enabled them to find a faith that has lasted 1,000s of years? Two things seem to stand out - God as outside nature, and man as His highest creation.If you can get past the historical accuracy problem, you find the stories both telling the same tale. God is separate - inhabiting a another sphere. And that God created man, has cared for him, and has given him a special place in His order.
