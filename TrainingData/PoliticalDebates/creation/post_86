The the myths and stories of the Bible were never meant to be taken as history in our sense of the word, and certainly not   science  . The physical record is overwhelming for   evolution  . Besides, I would HATE to think that there was divine being to blame for things like cancers, birth defects, and the poor design of human teeth. There are questions for which   religion  /philosophy/spirituality has no answers just as there are questions which are irrelevant to science. But both are important in terms of coming to terms with ourselves.
