Yes, everyone evolves, as everyone endures mutations. What you are saying implies that there is a set path planned for the evolution of certain species, which there is not. Mutations are accidents. They can sometimes benefit.Also Neanderthals died out on their own because it was an injurious variation. and what bothers me is that you said "that is just your opinion," because that usually infers that you are saying that person is wrong and you are factual. You are not factual. Saying "that is just your opinion" does not make it wrong!
