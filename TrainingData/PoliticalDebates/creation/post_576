"instead of a 'bolt of lightning hitting a pool of   chemicals   and making a cell pop out'"Where did I say that???"it was most likely a slow process taking place along the ancient shores." Or convection currents, or towards the earth's core, or.... shoot, seems like anything is tried these days. I for one would like to know how such hypothesis could be falsified."The surf stirring the chemicals providing the   energy   that fueled the early RNA / DNA reactions... over time these reactions became more complex, leading to proto-cellular structures."I think even the most uneducated person in this debate can look up the following:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman_Monster  From the above link:"In 1997, Eigen and Oehlenschlager showed that the Spiegelman monster eventually becomes even shorter, containing only 48 or 54 nucleotides, which are simply the binding sites for the reproducing enzyme RNA replicase[2]."Doesn't sound hopeful to me, especially when the most ideal   conditions   require some "help:"  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/origin_of_life_researchers_int.html  And since you cannot synthesis all the necessary chemicals in the same place or get a replicating cycle started:  www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/rnaworld171.htm    www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/ribo171.htm  Looks like you have some explaining to do, especially when the most causally adequate explanation to date is intelligent intervention.
