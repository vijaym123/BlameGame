I believe that the 6-day Creation of the Universe as we know it today has to be taken literally, even though Scripture does say that one day in the eyes of the Heavenly Father is like a thousand years.  The first verse in Gensis says that "God created the heavens and the earth," which means that yes, the Earth has been around for millions of years, a verification of rock samples and other geological data that concludes the Earth has been around for millions of years.  At some point within those millions of years, God decided to transform a lifeless Earth into a life-giving planet while at the same time He was creating time, outer space, the galaxies, stars, our Milky Way and Solar System, the Earth's moon, the presence of evening, day, and night on Earth, and all of the living things to grow and roam on the planet.  As the previous poster had mentioned, the significance of the 7-day week would be useless if we decided not to  interpret literally the Genesis Creation story.  If he did not take 7 literal days to create the Universe as we know it today, then He would have no reason to bless the seventh day and set it apart.   Everything else in Scripture, I believe that we are free to interpret it as we wish.  But if we are dealing with a highly-intelligent Being who can separate the waters of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans at will, then why would we question or doubt that He could create our mortal Universe in six days flat?
