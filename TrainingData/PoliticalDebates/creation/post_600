--Or that evolution is a process involving randomness and natural selection. Has that been tested?--Yes, in fact it has. First of all we need to understand the meaning of the term 'random' which just means that mutations do not arise in response to environmental needs. More on this later. This has been tested and so far no evidence has been found that seems to contradict this, although some data suggested that mutations did arise in response to needs. However, on closer scrutiny, science discovered the 'SOS response' where organisms enter a stage of hypermutations which combined with the new environmental pressures allows mutations which confer a benefit to quickly spread. As to natural selection, science has tested that natural selection is a real process and has measured many instances of it. This brings us to the final issue, is natural selection and variation the only mechanism of evolution? The answer is no, just like Darwin suggested, there are other processes, most notably 'random drift'.
