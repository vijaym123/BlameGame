You still have yet to provide any passages within Panda's which state that God is directly implicated; saying that the FTE is religious, therefore so is Pandas. If you can find passages in which god or the supernatural is directly implicated, I would change my mind. What you're presenting is a fallacy of division, assuming that what is true of the whole is thus true of the parts. The content of Pandas does not change if a religious organization is what published it.
