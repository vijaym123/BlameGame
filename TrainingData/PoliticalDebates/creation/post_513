Here is Irons' response to the so called 'rebuttal'--Reply to RebuttalBy Peter IronsThe pages of a respected law review are rarely filled with such pejorative terms as "smear and innuendo," "poisoning the well," and "personal attacks." These are charges the DI authors have leveled at me in their Rebuttal to my article, in which I documented their ad hominem attacks on Judge Jones for his allegedly "sloppy" and "biased" Kitzmiller opinion. Although this reply to the Rebuttal is not part of the exchange in the Montana Law Review, it seems fair that readers of those articles might benefit from a brief rejoinder to the Rebuttal, which I will not burden with footnotes. I have numbered the points below simply for convenience.1. The DI authors fault me for not "engaging th[e] scholarship" they cite as providing "empirical evidence supporting [intelligent] design." My article was not directed at a detailed critique of this alleged scholarship, which lies outside both my fields of expertise and those of the DI authors. I did, however, note in my article the concession of Michael Behe at the Kitzmiller trial that he could not cite any "pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred." I thus had no ID scholarship to engage.===It only gets better    http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/06/irons_responds_to_west_luskin.php    The most relevant to this discussion is--Peter Irons--7. Moving to the legal issues in the Kitzmiller opinion, which the DI authors accuse me of slighting in my article, let me comment on their claim that both Judge Jones and I have "misapplie[d] the Lemon test." First, they concede that the "proffered secular purpose" of the Dover school board's ID policy was a "sham" and that Judge Jones properly held it unconstitutional as an endorsement of religion. Second, they argue that this finding "negat[ed] any need to address whether ID is science." On this point, the DI authors note that "even anti-ID legal scholar Jay Wexler [a professor at Boston University Law School] agrees Judge Jones was mistaken to rule on ID's scientific status," citing Wexler's recent article in the First Amendment Law Review (Vol. 5, 2006). Without rehashing the discussion of this issue in my article, let me simply note that Professor Wexler and I disagree. Readers of this exchange are encouraged to consult the lengthy, and--in my view--persuasive reply to Wexler by Richard Katskee in that same issue of the First Amendment Law Review.--Richard Katskee, "Why It Mattered to Dover that Intelligent Design Isn't Science" First Amendment Law Review, Vol. 5, Winter 2006
