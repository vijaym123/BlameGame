It is a fact that design can be determined in the absence of a designer.As a matter of fact reality dictates that the ONLY way to make ANY deyermination about the designer(s) or the specific process(es) used, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT OBSERVATION OR DESIGNER INPUT, isto study the design in question.If we knew the designer then we wouldn't have a design inference as design would be a given. And then we certain;y wouldn't need science to aid us in that design inference.BTW you people continue to ignore the fact that natural processes cannot account for the origins of nature because natural processes only exist IN nature.
