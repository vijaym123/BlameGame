#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 Creationism is not out of the picture. God is still VERY much alive. And ya know what? The latest science, (that's right SCIENCE), is proving that. The Theory of Evolution is the linchpin for society and Science... Of course they're not going to want to abandon it. But... It will have to be abandoned. It's inevitable. There are too many holes in this THEORY. From the depths of space, down to the tiny, irreducibly complex machines within the cell, 'the glory of His work' can be seen. :]
