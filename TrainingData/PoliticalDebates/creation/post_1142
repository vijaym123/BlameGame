 The simplest way to prove it is this.  The next time  you get an infection and the doctor gives you 10 days of antibiotics, take them for 5 days, then stop.  The only remaining bacteria will be the strongest ones that could survive 5 days of pounding from the antibiotics.  These 'superbugs' will then multiply, and instead of a mediocre infection, you now have a antibiotic resistant microbial community which you cannot get rid of.  Evolution in a week.  PS: DON'T do this.
