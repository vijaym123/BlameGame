PvM- the quote-"We don't know but we do know a designer wasn't involved."is YOUR position. And thank you for telling us that is not how science works.BTW ID is scientifically relevant because experience demonstrates that it matters a great deal to any investigation whether or not that which is being investigated arose via agency involvement or nature, operating freely.I take it you have never investigated anything in your life.Also only ID will lead us to understand that DNA and RNA are similar to a computer's harddrive. That is they are data carrying mediums. That is the data is NOT the sequence but it rides on the sequence- just like a computer disk isn't the data but the data rides on the disk.
