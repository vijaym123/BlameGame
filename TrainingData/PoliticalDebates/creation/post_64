Joe argues that the 'design inference is disallowed" and we agree to the extent that it fails to be scientifically relevant a posteriori but of course, it is never disallowed a priori.--JoeWe look at the options. And the anti-ID option is "it just happened".--On the contrary, that's what ID's 'explanation' is "poof"All textbooks teach that a designer was not "required" which is not the same as "not involved".So let's accept the vacuity of ID and move to real science.
