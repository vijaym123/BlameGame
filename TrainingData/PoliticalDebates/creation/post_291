--I think Behe has made the case for obviousdesign within the cell and I don't think you will findanyone who could put it any more clear.--Actually, Behe did not offer a case for intelligent design in his argument, posted on this website.  (Let me make PERFECTLY clear, this is all I am discussing.)  He simply offered his conclusion; because cellular machinery is complex, it is designed.  He offers no evidence, no data, and no sembelence of a coherent argument.--The evidence is everywhere its just a matter of where you want to put your faith. --Science != faith.  Faith !=scienceThe evidence is NOT everywhere.  The DATA is everywhere.  Evidence is data that is used to support your hypothesis, which makes predictions of future experimental results, or data that will be discovered at a later date.Behe offers no DATA to support his hypothesis; which make no predictions.  ID does not meet the criteria to be a theory, it barely meets the criteria to be an unfinished hypothesis.
