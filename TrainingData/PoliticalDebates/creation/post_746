You haven't made a point at all..As I've already said.. I believe.  And I understand that God knows every future event before it ever occurs.  Is it some sort of limitation that the Bible has been translated? He knows the end product for one... and secondly - I've compared many versions.. in most cases the difference is negligible.. it's usually nothing but nit-picking over a word and several possible synonyms.  The message remains the same. Some of the translations I wouldn't recommend.. they are in my opinion clearly inferior versions.. but still the point remains that the message is the same..  Are you familiar with the commandment 'Thou Shalt not Kill?'... is there some question about it's proper translation?  How about 'turn the other cheek'... or 'spare the rod, spoil the child'... 'judge not lest ye be judged' or even 'let there be light'.  Is there some controversy over the translation??  No, there isn't... instead it's just a straw man by atheists.Even those words which people bicker over, an example being the word 'day' in genesis, are truly not very relevant.  In Hebrew from what I understand the word translates loosely to 'a time'... so sure, we could argue he made the earth in a day.. or a billion years - but is that important?  For a Christian definitely not..You also have a problem with 'let there be light' coming before the creation of the sun and stars.So you feel that a God which can create the universe somehow can't create light without the Sun?  I'm pretty sure YOU can even create light without the Sun - in many ways even.The problems people have with the Bible are problems with their understanding...
