 You have to consider the alternative explanations for our existence and the evidence for and against each - oh, by the way, 2000 year long consensus doesn't count as evidence!  />   /> I don't think there's any need to go too deeply into the evidence for evolution by natural selection, but as most people will know, there is some (although controversially scarce) evidence in the fossil records for common ancestry, as well as similarities of existing species physiological and genetic makeup.    />   /> Geographical distribution of species is also worth consideration (this is also evidently apparent in human racial distinction throughout the world - I can't quite understand a Gods reasoning in creating a peaceful world by segregating us through racial differences!).    />   /> Evolutionary psychology is also worth investigating, as it suggests that our behaviour can be explained through our need to survive and reproduce in our evolutionary past, and it is surprisingly convincing (depending on what book you read!).  But as Richard Dawkins says; if you can't understand how a physiological or psychological trait could have been created through natural selection, it means you're not trying hard enough!'.  />   /> For those who say that there is no evidence that evolution exists in our own lifetime, the fact is that evolution by natural selection in such complex organisms as ourselves can take tens of thousands of generations for its effects to become obviously apparent to us.    />   /> However, for micro-organisms (such as viruses that can reproduce relatively quickly) we are all witness to the effects of evolution by natural selection.  As particular species of a virus evolves in various host cells, they are battling with an organisms immune system for survival.  This is survival of the fittest at the microscopic level!  And I can't see any reason why this would not occur at the macroscopic level.  As I explained before, other evidence also points in this direction.
