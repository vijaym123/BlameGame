"Intelligent design works off positive predictions about where experience tells us that   intelligent design   is the cause at work."Meaningless nonsense, of course.  Name a "prediction"."complex (i.e. irreducibly complex) biological structures are unexplained, but rather that they are in principle unexplainable"And that statement has been refuted.  You can't "prove" that evolution can't explain "this".  Mainly because it can."If at least some pseudogenes have unsuspected functions,"Of course Behe ignored the original point and changed the subject to something irrelevant."And if science can't explain it?"If science can't explain it yet, then science will continue to explore alternatives.  ID is merely a useless "dead end" to try to allow creationists to claim that evolution might be wrong.
