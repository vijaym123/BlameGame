#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 To me, there is no proof of a greater hand other than from the word of believers, whose faith is based in belief and not in any form of evidence at all.  Modern faiths may need to adapt themselves to take in the view of the world defined by science and not spiritual magic.  I believe creationism develops a story to teach children how to understand the world.  In earlier times, it was enough to keep adults entertained and bedazzled.  />   /> I think Cancer11 is blinded by their obviously strong beliefs.  There is no proof that any greater being created any aspect of the universe from the tiniest atom to the elephant to the solar system and beyond.   />   /> I don't believe it is 'sense' that some people cannot believe in the all powerful invisible creative source.  Examining the process of creation leads one to a rudimentary understanding of anatomy (a science)and biology (a science).  There is no explanation of how God fits into the mix there, it is simply natural functions that create birth through biology.  />   /> Cancer11's rhetoric is fluffy and without any proof or evidence, it is plainly to me utter faith.  Cancer11 believes that A is A because the Almighty says so.  Whereas science has constantly attempted to explore, examine and answer the questions of the universe by aiming to find proof, systems, patterns and was to name the world.   />   /> It is simply not possible for creationism is to be true. It has more holes than a leaky bucket.
