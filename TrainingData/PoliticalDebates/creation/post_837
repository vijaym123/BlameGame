What proof can you offer that right now we have reached the maximum limit of human knowledge?  Why is it at this moment that nothing more should be known, why not 100 years ago, or 100 years from now?"I am not here to argue Scripture on God because the Bible tells us that the man who lacks wisdom says that there is no God (Psalm 14, Verse 1)"You do realize that quoting from the Bible only works when you are talking with Christians... and I've met more then a few people that I would count as wise who were not Christians."The unbelievers don't believe in God until they find themselves in a disaster and at the brink of death."The old 'no   atheists   in foxholes' bit?  I think that the Military Association of Atheists and Free Thinkers would disagree with you on that bit.
