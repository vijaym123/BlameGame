#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 As a general common sense rule you really shouldn't get into a debate against Evolution unless you have some basic understanding of the process of Evolution. Otherwise, you make false statements and use worn out phrases that creationist have used for years to run-down evolution. For the most part creationist deny evolution because it contradicts what they believe, so they choose not to even begin to understand evolution.
