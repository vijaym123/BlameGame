How does the anti-ID position explain the bacterial flagellum? "It just evolved". If you think there is a different explanation then please post it.BTW ID explains the BF the same way an archaeologist would set out to explain any artifact. However by your "logic" archaeology is a useless endeavor akin to giving up. Why couldn't nature, operating freely build Stonehenge?PvM:So ID is about complexity and function but that merely describes what I outlined already. Something has function and science does not understand how said function arose so we call it 'design'. Still an argument that adds nothing to 'we don't know' and in fact, as formulated is inherently unreliable.----However you don't say we don't know. You say we don't know but a designer wasn't required.And again the design inference relies on observations, data, and experience. And as with all scientific inferences future research can either confirm or refute that inference.That is how science operates.
