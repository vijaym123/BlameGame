 Two Darwinists spent hours standing at a flag pole trying to find the height of it. Along comes a creationist asks what they’re doing .The evolutionist reply we’re trying to find the height of the pole. The creationist pulls the pin at the bottom of the flag pole brings it to a horizontal position measures it then raise it back to vertical It’s  28 feet 6.5 inches he tell them then walk off .One evolutionist looks at the other, how stupid can these creationist be we want to know the height not the length.
