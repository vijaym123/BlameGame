PvM, those are merely my opinions. I KNOW that the existence of God cannot be proven, then again, it can't be disproven. I never said the universe WAS created, that is just something I WANT to believe. I think it makes me a better person, and adds a certain amount of purpose to my life. That's all it is, opinion.
