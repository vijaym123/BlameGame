In Genesis, we have no reason to believe that "one day" meant any more than "one day" today. Remember God rested on the 7th day, not for himself (because he didn't need it), but for us to rest. If that "day" was longer than a "day" in this present time, why would he have rested for us, so that we would have a day of rest.I have no prediction on the age of the earth, a mystery that will always be unsolved. I do believe that God had the power, if he is the creator, to create thw world we live in called "earth" in 6 days. He is all-powerful, so why could he not just bring into existence - the Earth?Don't use a straw-man argument to say we shouldn't believe God was being literal. Many atheists, professors, and people of high authority have been criminals. Does that mean we should not listen to anything they have said based on choices they made prior. Not always, no. So not a good point there.
