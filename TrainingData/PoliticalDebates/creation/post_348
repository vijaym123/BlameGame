Remember this is about Island's claim and Carter's arguments. I will leave it to the interested reader as to whether or not Island's description was correct. That Island reads into Carter's points as a 'cure for the disease' it was to avoid exactly the special pleadings to new models and rely on the existing models to explain what Carter described as the anthropic principle. It does help to read the actual paper, which is btw available to anyone interested.You seem to call this a 'prejudice' but that is understandable since you seem to rely on a yet to be defined 'hypothetical model' which you believe explains the observations better, although lacking the details such a claim has to be dismissed as lacking in specifics.The reason to formulate the 'anthropic principles' was well described by Carter--... that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang) physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation.--As long as one uses the anthropic principles which I described in more detail.Others have come to the similar, reasonable conclusion--The modern era of anthropic reasoning dawned quite recently, with a series of papers by Brandon Carter, another cosmologist. Carter coined the term “anthropic principle” in 1974, clearly intending it to convey some useful guidance about how to reason under observation selection effects. We shall later look at some examples of how he applied his methodological ideas to both physics and biology. While Carter himself evidently knew how to apply his principle to get interesting results, he unfortunately did not manage to explain it well enough to enable all his followers to do the same.--Source:  Nick Bostrom    http://www.anthropic-principle.com/primer.html
