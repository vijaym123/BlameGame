I am curious about one thing - Luskin states:"ID investigations thus begin with observations about how intelligent agents operate and then proceed to convert those observations into positive predictions of what scientists should find in nature if intelligent design was involved in the origin of a given natural object."He justifies this assertion with this:"Specifically, the theory predicts that we will find large amounts of specified complexity in natural objects [after an exposition on an analogy employed by theologian/philosopher Meyer)...As Meyer explains, Òby invoking design to explain the origin of new biological information, contemporary design theorists are not positing an arbitrary explanatory element unmotivated by a consideration of the evidence. Instead, they are positing an entity possessing precisely the attributes and causal powers that the phenomenon in question requires as a condition of its production and explanation.Ó(18) "In other words - Meyer is making an argument via analogy - made with lots of buzzwords and unnecessarily verbose prose.If that is why ID is scientific, and if that is an example of a "prediction" that has been "tested", then I am afraid that ID is utterly worthless, for it consists of:1. Construct an analogyDNA is sort of like languiage, it is a code - why, we even call it th egenetic code2. Make a syllogism employing the sketchy analogy -Humans are complex.  Humans make language/codes.  DNA is like a language/code. Therefore, DNA was made by a complex being like a human3. Manipulate syllogism so as to appear to be an hypothesis -DNA, being coded information, must have been made by complex intelligent agents, since we know that other complex intelligent agents, us, make codes/languages4. Conclude what was assumed in step 1 and call it a tested and confirmed prediction - ID predicted that DNA would be the product of an intelligent agent because it contains coded informaiton.We know that coded inforaiton comes from intelligent agents.Therefore, DNA was made by an intelligent agent.Therefore, DNA was designed.Brilliant.
