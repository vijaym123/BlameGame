You said 'tentacles could become legs'..here's the problem - a good design for tentacles does not at the same time mean a good design for legs.... consider what I'm saying here -- look at a starfish.. or even a regular fish - the placement of fins have a different orientation than 'future legs'... good placement for fins does not make a good placement for legs... the two are entirely different designs.. one is not appropriate for the other.. only in rare occasions - thus it's ridiculous to assume one could morph to the other..  if you had to rely on previous developments.. future developments would be improperly placed - poorly situated.
