"The "informational signatures?"Only conscious beings produce signatures. And saying that a consciousness exists necessarily presupposes that existence exists. You can't have consciousness without first having existence."So what? If consciousness and existence are the same thing what difference does it make?"Discovery's objection here reveals that he's claiming the primacy of consciousness over existence - a contradiction."Could've sworn that "existence" as used by the DI refers to everything (Life, Physics, Universe itself, etc) except the intellect behind them, nothing contradictory there. "Paraphrasing Ayn Rand's statement on the primacy of existence: existence exists, and consciousness is the faculty of perceiving (not creating) existence."If all this is just wordplay on the criteria for "existence" then I'm afraid I've missed your point. Are you trying to argue over which came first, existence or consciousness? "To look for signatures is to look for a consciousness that came before/was apart from/was outside of/etc. -- existence."OR came at the same time as existence, which would be perfectly consistent with the search for signatures. "Jargon like "informational signatures" does not a valid concept make."Wordplay on consciousness vs. existence does not a valid argument make.
