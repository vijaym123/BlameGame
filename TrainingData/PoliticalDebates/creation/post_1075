#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 As an archaeologist I have to say that creationism is wrong.  / Scientific dating , geology, paleontology and other sciences have proved beyond doubt that the evolution of the earth and life forms has taken place over billions of years.  /> Creationists might argue that this is all made up to discredit their theories but this isn't a credible argument.  /> What ever one's belief in a God or there is just no way that the earth was made in 7 days and came into being in 6006BC or whenever.  /> Humans or sub -human species have been around and evolving for over a million years. The human presence on earth is just a blip on the evolutionary time scale.  /> Take for example geological layers and fossils. They are a prime example of the earths age and evolutionary processes that Creationists won't except ( excuse me if I'm wrong here).  />  I have known intelligent people argue for creationism even in the face of all evidence contrary to their views.   /> I do think it would be helpful for religions to be more receptive to scientific theory and other disciplines. However religion is often used as a control and through fear so this attitude will take some time to dispel in world religions.
