It is indeed spiritually immature to equate death and decay with evil. Without death, reproduction would not be necessary, and without reproduction, natural selection could not improve a species over time. And without decay, nutrients in once living things could not be returned to the soil to replenish it and enable plants to grow. That's why the depiction of life prior to the Fall of Man, with no animals dying and all of them being vegetarian, is ludicrous. Within a few years, the cycle of life would grind to a halt because the animals would have eaten all the plants and the world would have been in a static state forever. God told the animals and people, even before the Fall, to "be fruitful and multiply". That would quickly end once all the plants were eaten.If the gospel message is dependent on the Genesis myths, we are better off without it. Fortunately, no one has to be that narrow minded or irrational. The problem of sin among human beings would remain even if Genesis had never been written.BTW, the Jews, whose ancestors wrote the Bible, do not beleive in Original Sin. So why should we?
