The following is a quote from your points: Quote "The more parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose, and the more precisely they fit each other to achieve that purpose, the more and more confident we can be in our conclusion of design. For example, if you came across a broken stick on the ground in the woods that pointed toward a campsite, it may be a signal to campers, or it may just be a stick that happened to fall that way. If there were four broken sticks, arranged into an arrow shape pointing at the camp, you’d be fairly confident that that was no accident." end QuoteSticks to the campsite:1. The current Calendar that makind has been using for 2008 years is based from the time of Christ's death, known as A.D. (After Death).2. The timeline used prior to Christ's death is B.C. (Before Christ).3. The Holy Bible is the most read text in the world and reprinted millions of times. There were plenty of scholars of the time that could have refuted and stopped this text from spreading. So you ask yourself why would such a text continue to this day? Is all that read it delusioned? Are the over a billion people on this planet mistaken about the existence of Intelligent Design? 4. Why do most people want to close their ears and even become defensive on the words printed in this text (Holy Bible)? When they don't even know what is in it. Why is mankind quick to embrace a different approach, but not the Bible which is an instruction manual from the chief I.D.?These are signs left behind for those who continue to question ID.
