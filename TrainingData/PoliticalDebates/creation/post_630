Fundamental points:"There are well-credentialed scientists who support intelligent design (ID)"So what?  There are many, many more well-credentialed scientists who say "intelligent design" is nonsense.  Either way, this is irrelevant."... and are conducting scientific research into ID"Riiiight.  And the results are????"and publishing it in mainstream scientific venues."I don't believe it.  The "intelligent design" proponents have 12 different? discussions and one of them says "promises to open up new avenues of research".  Well, they've been promising for a decade or two and never delivered - enough is enough.  Whenever they have really "published" their nonsense, it has been instantly ripped to shreds by knowledgeable scientists.The rest of this "objection" seems to be directed towards the political processes used by the DI and their opponents.  So it is irrelevant to the question "Does intelligent design have scientific merit".
