How was Catastrophism closer then the original Darwinian theory?  Catastrophism offered no mechanism for the changes that we see, was completely wrong as to what catastrophes occurred,  how severe they were, and when they took place.Darwin's original theory, as put forth in "Origin of Species", has long since been supplanted by modern theories of Evolution... it was wrong with regards to many things, but Catastrophism was wrong to a greater extent then Evolution ever was.It should also be noted that once the evidence had accumulated showing that earlier theories had been wrong the Scientists changed their theories and agreed that the new interpretation was correct... when have the fundamentalists ever done so?
