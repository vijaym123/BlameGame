--Island states--You pretend like the "appearance" doesn't beg a real scientific question, because you are over-reacting to your perceived motivation of IDists, but not because you are thinking like an honest scientist would.--I am not sure what your argument is but given the ad hominem, I doubt that it is very relevant. Appearance of design does beg a real scientific question, however science has so far shown how honest scientists resolve this issue. After all, we know that us humans are very easily deceived in seeing design where there is none. This is very likely an evolutionary adaptation.As to ID, what do they do to resolve the issue of appearance of design? Nothing really because they refuse to go beyond the design inference approach. Ask yourself, what have ID proponents done in this area?Pray tell.
