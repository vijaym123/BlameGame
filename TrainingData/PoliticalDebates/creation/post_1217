 Wrong - evolution is probably the most supported theory in biology - it's withstood considerable scrutiny for the past 150 years and is as strong as ever.  />   /> Anyone who doesn't agree is one of two things - a liar or plain ignorant (willfully or otherwise). The evidence is readily available to all but the problem is that people will only read stuff that backs up their pre-concieved beliefs, which only reinforces their ignorant beliefs.   />   /> It's incredible how many people will use arguments against evolution that have been thoroughly refuted over, and over again.
