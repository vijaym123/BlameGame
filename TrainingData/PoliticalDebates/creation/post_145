Your argument is compelling until we expand the question of "How did we get here?" to encompass the divine. I understand the Christian god had no beginning. I'm not asking, "Who created god?" but rather, "Why should there be a god at all?" What are the mathematical odds that your god would be the way he is? In light of that question, suddenly the big bang doesn't seem like such an outlandish problem in comparison.We know the big bang happened, for whatever reason. The existence of a divine creator (conveniently) makes no difference in the observable predictions of the big bang, so why does it require faith to eliminate the assumption of a god?I've found purpose and happiness too. Meaning doesn't need to be handed down from above; it comes from within too. That isn't faith; it's the courage to face reality.
