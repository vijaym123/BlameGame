Teaching darwinism is comparable to teaching flying spaghetti monsterism.We've observed the ability of rapidly moving water to carve out canyons resembling the grand canyon (see: little grand canyon, mt st helens);  we haven't observed gradualistic processes accomplish the same feat.  Intelligent scientists have manipulated genetic information to create novel new functions (see: glow-in-the-dark pigs, cats); we haven't observed the ability of nature to generate the same sort of novelty via the natural selection of random mutations, the alleged engine of evolution.
