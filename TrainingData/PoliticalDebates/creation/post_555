--TJ10--Open debate is all we are asking for. Even the Discovery Insititute does not want mandated teaching of ID in the classroom. ----They seem to have changed their minds on this issue, and now, rather than calling it teaching ID, they are using equal time, teaching the controversy and academic freedom as excuses to get ID introduced into classrooms. If it were an open debate that ID were interested in then the issue has long since been settled.No, it's is certainly not an open debate which would expose the fallacies of ID to a larger audience, which seems to be of interest to ID. In fact, have you noticed how few ID proponents seem to engage some significant critiques presented here by for instance Nick Matzke? And your reply also does not suggest that you are interested in a open discussion. Your rhetoric betrays you.
