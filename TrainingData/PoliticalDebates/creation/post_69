--JoeGBTW PvM the scientific answer to UCD is "we don't know". So why is it OK for YOU to make an inference- UCD- when we don't know, but it is wrong for IDists to make an infer3ence when it is based on observations, data and experience?---Nope, the scientific fact shows UcD, the mechanisms through which UcD can be explained ,again are not 'we don't know' but rather observed sources of variation as well as processes such as drift and selection.ID makes no inference based on obsevations, data and experience, it merely lifts its hands when seeing the data and argues, that because we do not know how it happened, it should be 'designed'.We all know how that led Newton astray, ID is not much better than that.What positive evidence for ID exists to explain UcD? Poof? For science we can actually point to countless evidences that show not only the fact of UcD, a fact even some better informed ID proponents like Behe have to accept, but also science can point to actual observed mechanisms to explain.All ID can do is say 'but but but'....Thanks for your contribution as it demonstrates the vacuity of ID combined with the ignorance needed to reach such a conclusion.PS: We do know that things evolved, the question is merely how. ID fails to propose any explanations beyond 'well it must have been designed' while science shows how natural processes of variation and chance serve as the 'designer'.That my friend is why ID has no cotent.
