By the "logic" of the anti-IDists, the current theory of evolution is an atheistic theory because Richard Dawkins once stated it allows for one to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.Just because some or even most IDists are religious does NOT mean that ID is religious. The ONLY way to label Intelligent Design "religious" is to change the definition of religion.And BTW, Albert Einstein once said "Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind."Why do the anti-IDists insist on lame science?As for scientific evidence for ID start with the genetic code. The day we observe nature, operating freely, putting together a code is the day that MicroSoft will lay off all their programmers because they are unecessary.And the bottom line is if the anti-ID side actually had some scientific evidence for their position ID would go away.
