 People who believe that god created the earth keep saying that they got this from the bible. History says that the bible was written by a few profits that claimed to hear the voice of god. All the bible is, is a book written by some guys who heard some voices in their heads, and people today are making judgments by that writing without any evidence to support those judgements. Evolution however does have evidence.
