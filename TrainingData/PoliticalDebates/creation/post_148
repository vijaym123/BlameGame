The name Intelligent Design is itself a hoax. It's meant to sound scientific to obscure the belief that the universe was created by a bodiless consciousness. Further, to argue that the universe was created by some consciousness outside of the universe avoids the untidy question: Where would that consciousness be? If nowhere, then it can't have existed to begin with.  If somewhere, then existence was already there before the bodiless consciousness came on the scene. Hence it could not have created existence. Intelligent Design has no merit because it rests on the very concepts it denies. For instance, it rests on the view that an "intelligence" created the universe---yet states  that that thing is unknowable. If it's unknowable, then no one can declare it's intelligent---or that it exists.It's odd to attribute an orgin to the universe outside itself simply because it's complex.   Given the naure of the universe, were it not complex, THAT would require an explanation.
