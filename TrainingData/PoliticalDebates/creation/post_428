"In case you didnt see it their was an atheist or two in those foxholes, but not for very long! Hahaha"Sounds like a collection of anecdotal stories made by a biased source... The 'no   atheists   in foxholes' is an aphorism and not a valid argument, as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers will attest.  In 2005 the MAAF held a march in Washington DC... in which one atheist from WWII was quoted as saying ‘No atheists in foxholes[?], I wasn’t in [just] one, I was in thirty.’
