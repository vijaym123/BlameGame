"I am an experimental scientist. The notion of   intelligent design   directly impacts my areas of study." Seriously? Details please. Besides....  http://redwing.hutman.net  /~mreed/warriorshtm/blowhard.htm"However, unlike scientific theories, ID does not make any predictions that I can attempt to test. There are no working hypotheses that might enrich my thinking on the subject. No specific information that can help me predict the interaction energies of the molecules I study. I can either believe it, or not - either way nothing much changes."For a good example of the research and predictions made by ID, I suggest you visit this site...  http://biologicinstitute.org  /"Evolution raises questions and makes many predictions, some of them I can test and others are longer term, which I hope to see tested during my life. If ID offered me anything I could actually evaluate experimentally, just hinted at some new interesting avenue of research, I would be immediately interested."Evolution affects your study of energies within molecules??? Love to hear how that methodology works.Speaking of research avenues and ID...  http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2007-02-26T10_59_13-08_00    http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2007-01-31T13_18_26-08_00  "Scientists tend to pragmatic about big ideas - does it help me explore what I am most interested in? ID is useless to me as a scientist, so I don't bother with it in the lab."That would pretty much apply to anything else outside of molecular physics. Including...."Cosmology isn't much help to me either, but I can see that they are clearly making hypotheses and working to disprove them. They might uncover something more that I can use - I am certainly grateful for quantum mechanics."I guess ID fits just fine with cosmology in that case.   http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2007-03-21T16_04_16-07_00  "ID is an interesting subject for late-night discussions after a party - like philosophy, comparative religion, politics, and sports history."So it can be a good discussion topic. At least we agree on something. "All good stuff! Not science."Well, you're half right.
