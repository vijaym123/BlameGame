The Bible is no more self authenticating then any other irrational fantasy.The whole idea of a creator, and a moment if creation is flawed:"Some foolish men declare that a Creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before creation?... How could God have made the world without any raw material? If you say He made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression... Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning and end. And it is based on principles."Mahapurana by JinasenaEden as a paradise.  Sounds like a maximum security prison with all pervasive surveillance.And, obscenity of obscenities, original sin.  Were Adam & Eve zombies ? since without free will they were not human:"To hold man's nature as his sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committed before he was born is a mockery of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, justice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched." (Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged)"There must be some way that the human race can rid itself of the scourge of religion.
