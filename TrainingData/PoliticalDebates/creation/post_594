-- It seems to me that Luskin is being "more scientific" in that he talks about a method for testing ID--That's ironic because Luskin presents no testable ID. Although I understand your confusion where ID claims that showing that a gap in our ignorance, which has been defined to be 'design', should count as a way to test 'ID'. But then ID is merely the negative argument that science cannot explain 'x' and has no relevance to what one commonly perceives ID to be, in other words, ID fails to place 'design' at risk.Perhaps you can tell me how you believe ID can be tested. Does this mean that since ID's flagellum has been shown to be plausibly evolved that somehow design and the designer have been falsified? Does the fact that regularity and chance processes, contrary to claims by ID proponents, can in fact increase information and complexity mean that ID has been falsified and that the 'designer is dead'? Of course not. At best it means that ID proponents were wrong in making their claims about science and since they never placed the concept of design at risk, ID remains scientifically without content.If you feel that I have missed other points worth addressing, please let me know. Realize that ID is very good at bait and switch, and that one need to carefully study its claims and arguments to be able to get to the core and come to realize that there is not much there.I am assuming you know how ID has defined the concepts of 'design' and 'information' and that they are at odds with how science typically defines such terms or how the layperson may interpret such terms?
