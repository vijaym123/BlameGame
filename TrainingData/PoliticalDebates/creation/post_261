"Why not? What qualities does the designers have that make them beyond study?"Not being able to directly observe it. Thus conclusions are only drawn based on natural features in question."I don't see it that way."Like it or not, that's the way ID works. It studies what we can observe and draws inferences from there. "A theory quantifying the designers, which could be used to make accurate predictions about their next action, would solidify ID as a working theory."Define a "working theory." And your basic point is that unless we can see the telic force in action then we cannot determine if something was the product of one correct?"Without that then the argument that random mutation can only go so far, but not further (even when given an arbitrarily long period of time), is still a better discription."So would you say then that sticking with the notion that mutations+selections has its limits is a better theory than saying a guidance of some kind brought some features in question to existence?"I would think that it would be beyond maybe. Knowing the nature of the designers would give a huge amount of insight into why they were designing life on this planet."I think we both agree that such knowledge would in fact give us huge insight, but are you also saying it's NECESSARY to know the nature of the intellect in order to identify systems and features as designed?"Knowing the methods would allow us to replicate them in the laboratory."Would you then say that ID is not   science   or is insufficient because it cannot be replicated or repeated?"We could also go and meet them, I know I've several complaints on this body they designed for me that I'd like to have cleared up."Yeah same here, much like how I would like to complain to GM for giving their Hummers a MPG of only 10 miles a gallon.
