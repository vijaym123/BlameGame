--JoeWe look at the options. And the anti-ID option is "it just happened". We do have direct observatiuons of agencies designing rotary motors. We have NEVER observed nature, operating freely, even come close.--No the scientific position is 'we don't know'. Surely you should realize that misrepresenting the scientific position does little for your argument. And there are more than just two options. Chance, regularity, already provide two possibilities, not to mention the countless variations on this theme. Remind me again how ID 'explains' the bacterial flagellum? After all, was it not claimed to be an inference to the best explanation. Are you saying that there is no explanation?Weird, why would they then call it an inference to best explanation?...What do you think?--So when it comes to teaching the theory of evolution the only real answer is "we don't know"- as in we don't know whether or not the transformations required by universal common descent are even possible via any amount of accumulated mutations.--Again missing the point, the 'we don't know' explanation is countered by real positive scientific hypotheses and these hypotheses have rendered the 'we don't know' hypothesis much less relevant. Of course minor questions still remain but the idea that there must be limits to evolution that would make common descent impossible are at best wishful thinking.It's sad how you continue to misunderstand science.
