 Nope, just the opposite.   /   /> I'll talk about both Quantum Physics and DNA research. Quantum physics is a complicated subject, I've studied it for years and still don't completely understand it. One thing I do know is that Quantum physics has absolutely nothing to do with Evolution, Evolution has to do with Biology. In physics, Quantum mechanics is a physical science dealing with the behavior of matter and energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.   />   /> Everything that has been found in the fossil record and in DNA seems to confirm that evolution has happened in the past, it is happening now and will continue to happen in the future.
