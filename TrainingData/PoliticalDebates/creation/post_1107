#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I do agree that evolution is wrong in the sense that it does not explain or support our existence.  There are some great studies done to show that evolution is happening and that we have adapted to our surroundings.  But to me, that does not support evolution.  Evolution is a broad topic.  I have done quite a bit of research and have found that people who are looking for answers will find things to support their belief.  There is nothing that proves evolution 100%.  Sure there are some great scientists and some very smart people that have made claims based on their research that evolution is real.  But this is like someone wanting something so bad that they will go to any length to find evidence to support their belief.  Nobody wants to prove themselves wrong, so i think that the majority of evolutionists will search for things to back themselves up.  That is too easy and comfortable.  Until I see some absolute evidence that supports evolution, rather than one's theory, then i have to conclude that it is wrong and that we are part of something more powerful than we could ever fathom.  Besides, has evolution ever turned someones life around?  Has evolution ever impacted someone so much that they make steps in their life to improve and influence people in a positive and loving way?  Evidence to support something and faith in something are two different things.  If you have faith in something, you don't need an explanation of it's existence.  It's like the whole airplane thing.  I don't know how a big hunk of metal flies through the air to get me somewhere, i don't even think that should be possible.  But apparently it is, and I have experienced it.  And every time I get on a plane, i have faith, blind faith.
