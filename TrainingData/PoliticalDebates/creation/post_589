Creationism has more solid evidence than   evolution   does. I hope I am not being offensive or rude with my statements, I just wish to state what I believe is the truth. Anyway, evolution is the only theory being taught in our schools and the evidence backing it up either has a probailty that is beyond scientific verification or it has already been proven wrong and is stilling being taught. It does require faith to believe in God becuase He is greater than anything conceived on the earth. Nevertheless, there is evidence for creation such as the grand canyon, or the utter complexity of the universe which all scientists are well aware of. If we're choosing what is taught in our schools based on the evidence that bakcs it up, than maybe we should also be reconsidering evolution since it is not scientifically valid.
