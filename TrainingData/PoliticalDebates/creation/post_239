It is also possible to "detect design" by reading what other experts say about so-called "experts."  For instance, while it is true to say that Michael Behe is a professor in the Biology Department at Lehigh University, it is also true that: "The (Lehigh University Biology) department faculty, then, are unequivocal in their support of evolutionary theory, which has its roots in the seminal work of Charles Darwin and has been supported by findings accumulated over 140 years. The sole dissenter from this position, Prof. Michael Behe, is a well-known proponent of "intelligent design." -     http://www.lehigh.edu/bio/news/evolution.htm     Lehigh's entire Biology Department (with one exception) agrees with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Science, and essentially every other actual science organization in the country that intelligent design creationism is not science.Intelligent design creationism's claim to be "science" remains unsupported in the world of actual science.  Intelligent design creationism's continued visible support from fundamentalist Christians provides an illustration of what its actual design really is.
