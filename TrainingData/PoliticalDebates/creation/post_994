Yes, you are right, it is impossible to call it a certainity, but for this reason:All evidence for evolution is proven. The EVIDENCE is fact. The problem is it is impossible to say "This evidence means X, X exactly, and X only." It bothers me when people say "it is only a theory" to disprove it, for they are confusing the word "theory" with "idea."Here's a tip: don't use the Big Bang Theory as an example as another theory, for it is widely disputed. Use the Theory of Plate Tectonics. Anyone to not believe in that is a lunatic.
