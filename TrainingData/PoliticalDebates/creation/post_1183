 Granted creationism is not provable through the use of the scientific method.  This does not mean it is false.  Evolution (life arising from nonlife or nothingness) is also not provable through the scientific method.  Both are speculation on the part of the person that believes them to be true.    />   /> And haters, don't bother commenting on how science has proven evolution through the fossil record or the fact that species change through natural selection because neither of those contradict creationism.
