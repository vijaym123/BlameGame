--The U.S. Supreme Court held a Kentucky law requiring posting a copy of the TenCommandments on the walls of public classrooms a violation of the EstablishmentClause, because it allegedly included a sham secular purpose in violation of the firstprong of the Lemon test.--Seems that the sham secular purpose determination was in fact relevant after all.--Lemon v Kurtzman--The Court's decision in this case established the "Lemon test", which details the requirements for legislation concerning religion. It consists of three prongs:   1. The government's action must have a secular legislative purpose;   2. The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion;   3. The government's action must not result in an "excessive government entanglement" with religion.--Now I understand the article bombing on Crowther's part.
