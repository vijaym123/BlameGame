There are two, and they are fundamentally different. They both seem to be Hebrew adaptions of earlier creation myths. The value of them is not their historical accuracy, but the way they redefine the nature of God. Before, God (gods) were caught in the web of circumstance as surely as man. By taking God as an outside force creating all, the Hebrews set a new tone.The authors of the Bible never imagined themselves to be writing history in the modern sense. They were trying for a more fundamental truth. They wished to illuminate the human condition and its relationship to God. They were artists, not photographers.
