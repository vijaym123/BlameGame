"If the Bible is the inspired Word of the infinite Creator God, then it must be self-authenticating and self-attesting—and it is."Exactly how is the Bible self-authenticating? Cetainly there are archaeologists hard at work in the lands of the Near East trying to find concrete objects - cities - that match with names and events mentioned in the Bible. But how does the Bible self authenticate the verses about four rivers coming out of Eden? It doesn't.What, in general, does self authenticate mean? Does it mean "make predictions"? What verifiable predictions does the Bible make? How does Genesis help oil companies find oil? It doesn't. Scientific geology helps oil companies find oil. Evolution helps oil companies find oil.
