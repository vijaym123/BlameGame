I actively attend the origins conferences hosted by a variety of different organizations, including Christian universities, Reasons to Believe, and most recently the Skeptic Society. I even saw a particularly dumbfounding live presentation by Kent Hovind when he was still a free man. After all that, I have yet to encounter one shred of convincing scientific evidence for a young earth or special creation.Are there any specific examples that you had in mind? How do these creation scientists show that   evolution   is false? If they truly have found convincing evidence, they should be household names. Scientists love to overturn established theroies. Such discoveries bring lots of grant money.
