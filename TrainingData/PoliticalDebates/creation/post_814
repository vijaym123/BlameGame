The author seems to thing there is no extra-biblical evidence of a young earth. Couldn't be further from the truth. Here's 14, for starters   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4005.asp   What I haven't seen mentioned is the fact that billions of years contradicts the Bible in many different places. It contradicts the concept that creation was Good when Adam and Eve were created. Were they standing on a good earth, or on top of billions of fossils that died violently, or from cancer. We even have fossilized thorns that the Bible is clear did not exist before sin. "The only assuption (sic) we make in science is that the nature of the universe is consistant (sic) and rational"Which BY DEFINITION excludes supernatural intervention. Which makes science not the search for truth, but the search for how things could have happened on their own without God.
