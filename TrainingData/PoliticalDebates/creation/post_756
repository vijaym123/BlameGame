I don't care how many times you say it. You can't prove anything using that same thing, you have to use evidences outside of that. Just like in my field...you can't prove a mathematical theorem by saying it's self-authenticating. You have to use other known facts and proven theorems to prove it. Any mathematician (such as myself) just has to laugh at such an excuse.
