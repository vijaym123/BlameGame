Try reading Chaucer out loud in his language. Biblical Hebrew is considerably different from any language spoken today. But more important are the recent discoveries in Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Phoenician literatures.Some fairly accessable books I can recommend are;Cross, Frank Moore1973 Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel.  Boston: Harvard University PressDalley, Stephanie2000 Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, The Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others. Revised Oxford: Oxford University PressSmith, Mark S.2002 “The Early History of God" 2nd ed. Grand Rapids: Wm B Eerdmans Publishing___________2003 “The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts”  Oxford University Press.The work by F. M. Cross is probably the most frequently cited text in the field.The use of the work "yom" in Genesis 1, as well as in Exodus 16, 20 or 31, certainly does refer to a single day.
