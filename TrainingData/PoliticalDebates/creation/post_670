The National Center for Science Education has a good reason to be concerned about 'Intelligent Design'. The reason for this concern is to be found in a leaked document which outlines the motivations behind the 'Intelligent Design' movement, called the "Wedge".    http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html    __Governing Goals__    * To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies.    * To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and hurnan beings are created by God.After having failed to gain intellectual traction, the ID approach changed to 'teach the controversy' and when that failed, to "academic freedom". Of course, while this is, as several people have so well explained, is NOT an issue of academic freedom, the 'bait and switch' strategies of ID continue under the motto of "the end justifies the means".Ask yourself, would you want your kids taught unscientific concepts in their schools' science classes? If your answer is "of course not", then why are you undermining "academic freedom"?The answer is simple, it is not really an issue of "academic freedom".So ask yourself, "What has ID done to positively contribute to science?"Tricky isn't it.
