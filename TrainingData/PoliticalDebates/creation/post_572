"Some kind of entity capable of guiding ends to means and pre-planning events or features before they happen or come into   existence   ."A non living entity?  Because life is to complex to come about without a designer then by definition that designer cannot be alive.  How does this designer guide 'ends to means' and how does it pre-plan events before they come into existence? "What does this have to do with ID (which DETECTS existing design instead of determining how it got there)?"But if there is a designer then that designer has to be using some method to create these changes?  For a theory that explicitly states that there is a designer ID is remarkably quiet on the nature and methods of that designer."It is no more a "   god   -of-the-gaps" theory than coming across a book and concluding it had an author is an "author-of-the-gaps" fallacy."The difference is that a book is demonstratively an artificial construct.  I can got a printer and watch one being made, I can go to an author and ask why he wrote the book.  Can I do the same thing with a bird or a lizard?"A complexity threshold of 500 bits of information is the typically used standard. Derived from the universe's event-generating resources (time, matter, and the speed that matter can change)."So something can, through a process of random mutation, accumulate 499 bits of information... but not more?  What 500 bits of information are we talking about here?  The complexity of dunes in the Sahara desert would have to be coded in more the 500 bits of information by any standard... is it designed by an intelligence?
