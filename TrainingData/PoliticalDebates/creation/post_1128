#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I remember bumping into a jehovah's witness and he was blabbing on about some bullshit that the earth is in a stage called its 'Last Days.' I seriously had to stifle a laugh. Then he went on to say how Darwin's theory of evolution is wrong because "up until a certain era, there was no recorded forms of life and no fossil evidence, and afterwards, there was a sudden explosion of life. So God must exist to cause this" (his words). I talked to my biology teacher and he says the reason for that was because they "Before the period stated, all life had no form of rigid skeletal structure, because everything EVOLVED from ameobas."
