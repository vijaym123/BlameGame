You skewed whatever argument you were wishing to present by quoting from the Cathoic Catechism.   Any sincere New Testament bible studdent knows that there is only one one reliable and true book, the bible, and any other man written book, such as the Catechism, is not God-inspired, thus false.Going a bit further, Catholicism itself is pretty much proven to be a false religion, and that statement is made based upon sound New Testament exegesis of Revelation 13 and Paul's second letter to the church at Thessalonica, in particular the second chapter where he talks about the "man of sin".  Sound, competent biblical scholars have identified both the "man of sin" and the two beasts in Revelation 13 as the Roman Catholic church and the papal dynasty.  Go back and study the history of the papal dynasty.  Then read what God has to say about a "falling away", forbidding to marry, abstention from eating certain meat, etc,. This refers to none other than the catholic church.  The pope (notice I did not capitalize the P) regards himself as God on earth, and equal to God, and says he has power to forgive sins.  No one but God can forgive sins. We're also told to call no one on earth "Father", but do the catholics abide by that?  No.With regard to the age of the earth, let the bible be its own best interpreter.  You either believe what it say in its entirety, or you don't.
