"but I certainly do believe that nature exhibits intelligence and design, not to mention beauty and love."But the question is: does intelligent design have scientific merit?If "nature exhibits intelligence", what does that mean for science?  Nature picks living things to fill ecological niches?  Survival of the fittest?  90% of all species are now extinct?If "nature exhibits design", it is "apparent design" or "real design".  How can you tell?  If it is "real design", what does that mean for science?  Science should not look for natural explanations when there might actually be a supernatural explanation?I don't think "beauty and love" have much meaning for science."Any one of these 4 alone lends credence to a Creator"Now science has certainly left the building.  And I'm not much interested in philosophy as long as you don't try to teach it in science class.
