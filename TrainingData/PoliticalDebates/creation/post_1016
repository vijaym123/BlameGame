You say the bible is the only proof of creationism. Um, biblical archaeology?? Archaeology is science too. Isn't evolution's bible Darwin's "On the Origin of Species..."? It has been proved by other branches of science. And also, you think all things just appeared and began to evolve? Was life created out of thin air? And, if so, how was the air created? I beleive evolution could be, but as a stage after creation, that would progress life. Both could be one in the same. Just, I beleive, for evolution to exsist, that creation must have preceeded it. "The origin of life is a necessary precursor for biological evolution, but understanding that evolution occurred once organisms appeared..." How did they appear? What? "... and investigating how this happens does not depend on understanding exactly how life began. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions, but it is unclear how this occurred..."Unclear? Hmmm?"Not much is certain about the earliest developments in life, the structure of the first living things, or the identity and nature of any last universal common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Consequently, there is no scientific consensus on how life began, but proposals include self-replicating molecules such as RNA, and the assembly of simple cells."How did RNA first become? I do not believe this debate is fair, because evolution has so many gaps in its reasoning. How can it be compared to creationism? They are two different things. I would say I agree with both, but the blatantly ignoring theology in scientific theory makes a rift between the two. So, creationism.
