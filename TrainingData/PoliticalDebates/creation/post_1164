 I really do not know where to start with this one, at the time of writing this response apparently evolution is incorrect. I quote "There is no scientist can give strong evidence to support evolution."  every recognized scientist in existence could give you evidence of evolution by looking at any living thing. The evidence for evolution is all around us, it does however require you to think in different dimensions of time which can be hard to imagine.   />   /> FoxFire makes a great argument for evolution and natural selection. I am an agnostic, but there is no reason you cannot believe in god and evolution, the two are compatible. Its really only the people who take everything in the bible literally, the fundamentalists who cannot find a place for god and evolution.
