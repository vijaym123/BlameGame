Yes, when one sees a flower garden or Mount Rushmore for the first time, one assumes the object was created by an intelligent being.  However, this is not at all like looking at a biological mechanism and coming to a similar conclusion.  We are familiar with the capabilities of humans and know, when we see the flower garden or Mount Rushmore, that humans are all over the place in this world and completely capable of creating such things.  So it is not an unreasonable assumption that people made those things: we know they are capable and have created many similar things.However, people do not do such things as design eyes or flagelli.  A much better analogy would be if we saw an object that clearly looked designed (say, a carving of a human face) on another planet, where we know with great certainty that humans could not have created the object.  That some intelligent being created the object is one theory, but how would we go about vetting that theory?  We would look for evidence of that being or others like it.  If none could be found whatsoever, and plausible alternate explanations for how the shape, or similar shapes, can arise naturally are developed, the natural conclusion would be that while there was an *appearance* of design, there is no evidence to support the theory.This is the case for biological mechanisms.  No evidence of a designer has been given beyond that the mechanisms seem to be designed.  And evolution is very well established and explains well a great many biological mechanisms, including many that may look designed at first.  So we have our plausible alternative, and we have no evidence of the designer.  The way in which Intelligent Design shows its religious underpinnings so clearly is in the way it doesn't even attempt to discuss the designer, as if the designer is unknowable and unprovable from the start.
