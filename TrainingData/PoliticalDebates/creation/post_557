You are confusing MN, with is a methodology with a worldview again... Tsk tsk.Funny how you are repeating the ID talking points without really understanding its flaws. ID is not being censored, but since ID has failed to be scientifically relevant, it still has to earn itself to be heard in the sciences and since our schools have a duty to teach good science, ID would be rejected based on that logic alone, lest you want any and all kind of doubtful science be taught in schools. Worse, in the case of ID is its strong foundation in Christian faith which combined with its failure to be scientifically relevant, has doomed it to remain constitutionally suspect.This is not about honest debates, or brainwashing. But I understand that these form much of the foundation for ID proponent's fear of that which they do not understand. And the confusion created by ID proponents like Johnson, who argued somewhat 'foolishly' that science uses philosophical naturalism, have spread a level of fear that seems to have clouded ID proponents into actually believing not only that science is atheistic, but worse, that ID provides a solution. Perhaps as a theology yes, although it raises some significant questions here too. But as a science ID simply provides no solution.If ID wants to play in the 'sciences' then should it not be held to a standard of scientific relevance? Or is this an 'anything goes' and we will soon be teaching astrology (per Behe) in schools as well, or the other side of the story of the Holocaust? Where does it end?
