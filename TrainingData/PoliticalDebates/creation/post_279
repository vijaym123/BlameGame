...all design is intelligent. It takes thought to construct any type of design. When you see things take place in science they happen because of all the laws that were put into place by an intelligent designer.Going back to the idea of a storm and engines. When you get in a car and turn the key you have a spontaneous violent storm erupt inside the engine. It all takes place because of all the elements of the design working in concert to produce the effect. This and all design requireintelligent thought.
