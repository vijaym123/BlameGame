""Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe."Not a very good choice of words, by the way... atheists believe that God IS Nothing (in other words... something that is non-existent)."If my statement(Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe) was correct, then why did you feel the need to correct me?Merry Christmas
