AiG decries scientists for making "unproven assumptions" while making many of their own. The most significant are the following claims.1. The Bible is infallible2. AiG correctly understands the BibleBoth of these have not been demonstrated by AiG and are, in fact, not provable. The Bible is rife with vague messages and contradictory passages. Only by the special pleading of organizations like AiG do these passages form a coherent whole, yet the truths AiG found in the Bible are wholly inconsistent with the reality of the world around us. What reason do we have then to trust AiG's interpretations of Biblical passages?Scientists has proven beyond any reasonable scientific doubt that our planet is billions of years old. If scientists were making bad assumptions, we would expect independent dating methods to give us wildly conflicting results, yet independent dating methods all agree. There is currently no scientific dissent whatsoever in favor of a significantly younger earth.I highly suggest the following article for any Christian with concerns over the reliability of radiometric dating methods.   http://www.asa3.org/ASA/RESOURCES/WIENS.html
