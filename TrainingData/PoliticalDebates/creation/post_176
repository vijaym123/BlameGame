- Features that appear vestigial and functionless actually serve a function (eg., appendix, coccyx)- "Junk" DNA does, in fact, have a function.- The alteration of an organism will not always be slow and gradual, or step-by-step.- That which determines the fundamental features of an organism will be logical and ordered (eg. DNA), as opposed to random.- There is no explanation invoking randomness or chance that can explain specified complexity.ID would be falsifiable by testing its predictions.  Some scientists have already claimed that ID has been falsified and adequately refuted, such as Ken Miller.  Some non-scientist evolutionists believe that the ability to produce a mousetrap with fewer parts falsifies   intelligent design  .  Seemingly every evolutionist believes that imperfection falsifies intelligent design.  There is also a paper published in Science (1) that claims that a study by Bridgham and a study by Lenski “solidly refute all parts of the intelligent design argument”.  Unsurprisingly the very next sentence is contradictory: “Those ‘alternate’ ideas, unlike the hypotheses investigated in these papers, remain thoroughly untested." (1) Adami, C. (2006).
