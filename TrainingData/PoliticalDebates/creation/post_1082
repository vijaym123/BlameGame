 I do believe in creationism. God has created this universe and every living thing in it. Canâ€™t you see the signs of God in each and everything; if not then I am sorry to say that you have no sense. A human being is created from a sperm. If he examines the process of his creation then he would definitely say that there is someone who is Almighty. Can you make the sun shine on your own? Do you have power to extend your life? Do you think you are unique and one of your own kind then you got the answer of this question. God is unique and He who to be worshiped only.
