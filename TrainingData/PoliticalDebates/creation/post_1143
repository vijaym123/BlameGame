#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I am a Christian, and I do believe in evolution because there are quite an amount of amazing proofs for it. Evolution does not contradict the idea of God's creation, since the Bible employs metaphorical descriptions and it is very possible that the "days" are not actually days, but million of years.
