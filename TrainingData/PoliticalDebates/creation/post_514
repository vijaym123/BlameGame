"You lost the case -- get over it."- So does this mean gay rights groups should just accept Proposition 8?"So who is this "Designer"? (Don't say space aliens or time travelers -- you only make yourself look foolish with such claims.)"- I think anti-IDists have done themselves a disservice by stating that God is a better explanation for design than aliens or time travelers.  If ID is ever adopted by the majority of scientists, history will make anti-IDists eat their own feet.  Further, Richard Dawkins stated that it is more probable that aliens created life on Earth than God.  I guess the AUSCS thinks Dawkins is a fool.
