I read the entire article.. and of course not being a member of the various fields of genetic research - it was not simple reading, nor did I understand even half of the references they made to various receptors and such.  That considered... it appears to not actually prove the point and also does not answer Behe's original question.also the comments show mixed reactions - and many of the readers reacted as I did... the original question was disregarded. First and foremost - how does an animal without an immune system survive to acquire one.  You would need to live to do so.... a dead animal does not good genetics make.This is what Behe asked... instead what we have is a list of genetic comparisons of immune systems.. showing some as simple and some as complex... well, duh.   This is the same technique as lining up skeletons and saying 'see.... a progression!'.... or not a progression - depending on whether you want to commit to a   crime   of assumption.and besides... the article is about an ID trial... and Behe was presented with this pile of information... how could the judge (who is a judge by trade.. not a geneticist) decide whether or not these technical papers had proven anything?in the articles words ''Judge Jones ruled that “Dr. Miller presented peer-reviewed studies refuting Professor Behe’s claim that the immune system was irreducibly complex.''how would the judge know that... ?  He could have handed the judge a pile of recipes for sponge cake and called it a refutation.
