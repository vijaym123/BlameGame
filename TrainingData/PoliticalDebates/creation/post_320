From a review of "Explore Evolution":"Counterclaims follow that seek to undermine the earlier conclusions, including the circular reasoning of the molecular clock, the potential fabrications of Haeckel's "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny," how differing family trees are created via anatomical and molecular patterns of relationships and the meaning of gaps in fossil evidence."Hilarious nonsense from the "institute" that will never "discover" anything.Of course this has nothing to do with "  intelligent design  " or "  creationism  " - it just a stupid attempt to try to discredit evolution."So what would you call a "reasonable compromise?""There can never be a "reasonable compromise" with creationist idiots.
