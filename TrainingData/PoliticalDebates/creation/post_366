That figures.Geez PvM your position that everything comes down to sheer dumb luck is totally vacuous. It cannot be tested. It relies solely on circumstantial evidence which is guided by your predisposition to reject design a priori.BTW everything in your position is beyond observation. Universal common descent- never observed, not even in the fossil record. Mutations accumulating to give rise to novel structures with novel functions- never observed.IOW there isn't a shred of science in your position.
