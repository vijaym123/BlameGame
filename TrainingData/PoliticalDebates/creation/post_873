First and foremost . . . Dr. Hurd, I'm glad to see you still being such a gadfly [sic].But, not without purpose.  I write this because purpose seems to be the argumentative qualifier--quantuvis.  There is no proof that can be substantiated by any human senses to show, undeniably, that a sentient being or force created the earth, life or the universe.  Not to say that experiential moments are disqualified from contemplation.  Contemplation, but not hard data.  The imagination is a petulant child that can force a person to forget rationality by means of frustration, adversity or just plain "it is what it is."  There could be, at some point, a convergence of   science   and faith.  Faith, or belief . . . odd conundrum.  Six days to create a universe where if one were studying the redshift of the light from distant stars shows a sea of space that is expanding at a rate that could only be proven by billions of years of expansion?  I don't think so.  And, SPACE isn't empty (just because you can't SEE it).  That takes a lot of explanation that religious texts can't, and don't, provide.  Also, the amount of times all religious texts have been rewritten should speak to the obfuscation of their messages--pars pro toto.Six DAYS?  No.  Six billion YEARS would be closer, but only about half.  Then how to explain the closest star, in light years.  No mention of that in any religious text.  Also, I find it difficult to believe, as the LDS do (not to pick a fight with a single faith), that heaven is a planet next to the sun.  Sounds like hell--no pun intended.Dr. Hurd, Gary, please email me sometime.  I would very much like to speak with you.Cordially,  Christopher Torri
