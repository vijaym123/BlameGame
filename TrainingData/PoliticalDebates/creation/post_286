I'm not a cell expert either, and understanding what Behe wrote in his argument doesn't require it, because he didn't say anything except "Cellular machinery is complex, therefore it must be designed."This isn't an argument, it's a statement.  To make it an argument, he would have to say, "Cellular machinery is complex, and these examples of complexity make me think it is designed."  Then he would speak to each of those examples in detail, explaining why their complexity indicates design, and is not better explained through some other mechanism.  That would be an argument.  ICDESIGN, I have had these discussions, representing both sides, too many times to be derailed by your question.  Discuss Behe's argument with me, but don't try to lead me astray with questions outside the purview of the topic at hand.
