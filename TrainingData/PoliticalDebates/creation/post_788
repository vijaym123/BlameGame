"Obviously you haven't done much reading on the AiG website."Of course not.  That would be a terrible waste of time.  But some people with a little time on their hands have looked at their nonsense and shown it for the nonsense that it is.  For instance - AIG specifically warns you not to read "talk origins".  They are afraid that you might realize that "talk origins" clearly demonstrates that what AIG tells you is nonsense.  http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc  /
