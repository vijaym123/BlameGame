And I was just the reverse... I believed in nothing for 25 years.. and now I believe wholeheartedly in God.You should never judge a   religion   by it's followers for one -- people are sinful, perverse, bigoted beings and are not the ruler to go by.  No matter what denomination.  Though I do think I find much more animosity spouted by the atheist... and for balance I do usually find more ignorance from christians...not all - just on the average. Yet, that is my point - you should never use them as a guide to what is true.
