Theism is a belief in god/s. Atheism is a *lack* of belief in god/s. Atheists do not claim to have proof that there is no God, but rather are confident to work on the assumption that none exists. The person who makes an outlandish claim has to provide the proof; it doesn't work the other way around. Saying, "I'm waiting for evidence that God exists, and if that happens I'll reconsider my position, but until then I won't believe" -- that's atheism, and there's no faith involved there.
