We also investigate “Axis of Evil” (AoE) type anomalies, which detect phase correlations between different multipoles in harmonic space. These phase correlations are not expected in a statistically isotropic map (Land & Magueijo 2005a). We do not observe an AoE type of structure in the 2MASS catalogue. As non-Gaussian features are expected in the LSS we feel this result raises issues about the use of the AoE statistic as a general test for statistic anisotropy. We do not observe correlations between the CMB fractional power distribution as measured in its AoE frame and that of 2MASS, constraining the possible explanations of  the low ? anomalies in the CMB.
