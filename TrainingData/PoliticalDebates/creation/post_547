--Casey--As evidence that teaching ID promotes religion, AUSCS claims that “Phillip Johnson, the so-called ‘father of Intelligent Design,’ once told a religious audience that his goal is to use ID to instill doubt about evolution in people's minds and then introduce them to ‘the truth’ of Jesus Christ.”AUSCS, an organization that often gets involved with litigation, should know that this argument would never pass muster in a court of law: This is a mere anecdotal assertion that someone “once told a religious audience” about alleged religious motivations, and no quotes or documentation are provided by AUSCS to verify the quote.--This is hilarious since Barbara Forrest and Paul R Gross have carefully examined and documented the various claims by Phillip Johnson and the Wedge document. The AUSCS's quote seems well in line with the established facts, facts which were extensively quoted in the Kitzmiller rulingA good article on Johnson can be found here     http://www.talkreason.org/articles/honesty.cfm     other good resources are Denis Lamoureux's thorough rebuttal of Johnson.As to the source of the quote, I may have traced it back to--Johnson calls his movement "The Wedge." The objective, he said, is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the non-existence of God. From there people are introduced to "the truth" of the Bible and then "the question of sin" and finally "introduced to Jesus."--    http://web.archive.org/web/20010508032051/http    ://    www.au.org/churchstate/cs4995.htm    As to the statement that--But as I argued in my first and fifth opening statements, ID is not a religious argument, and therefore teaching ID does not unconstitutionally advance religion.--Yes, this was also argued in court and rejected by the court for good reasons. ID by itself may not be a religious argument, after all that was the point of calling it ID, to remove references to religion. However, the combined lack of any scientific relevance and the well established religious foundations of ID, have caused ID to be intricately linked to religion, by design.
