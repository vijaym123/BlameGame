You said "ID has failed to contribute in any meaningful manner?"Wrong!  Newton, Pascal, Einstein, and many others put stock in the ID theory.  This is why they figured out what they did.  With the assumption of ID you can bet that there is order to the natural world and that it its knowable.  Einstein believed as much as people like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and many others want to believe.  After all, he was on a quest to discover the "Theory of Everything" or "to read the mind of GOD".  When asked what was his objection to Quantum Mechanics he was quoted as saying, "I refuse to believe GOD would play chance with the Universe"The better question is:"What has evolutionary biology contributed in a meaningful matter?"I'll help you out.  Mr. Richard Dawkins said that using a computer program to map out piping to containers that over generations the program had calculated the perfect plumbing for this system.  Then, proceeded to say that we see the same type of ducting system in canine livers.Ha!That simply means that (1)there was an intelligence behind both, and (2) your program sucked because it took more than one try.If the bank took more than one try to deposit your check, you'd be pretty steamed.  You be mad to continue banking with them.So why then, do you trust a theory in which death & time are the heroes and is obviously lacking the same credentials that you claim apply to ID."Pull the beam out of your eye before trying to pull the splinter out of mine!"Jesus of Nazareth"Asking an atheist why he can't find GOD is like asking a thief why he can't find a police officer."Kent Hovind
