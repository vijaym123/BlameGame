The history of the Bible, including it's compilation by the early church, is quite well known.  Books were chosen to be added and others were chosen to be left out (Enoch, Mary, and Thomas all spring to mind).  You can then look at it's history of translation, from Aramaic and Hebrew to Greek... then to Latin... then to the various European languages.To say it is divinely inspired is a reasonable stance to take (it is how I view the Bible), but to say that it is a word for word transcription seems quite unreasonable given it's history.
