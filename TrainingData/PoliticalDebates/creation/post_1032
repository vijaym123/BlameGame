This is why i have my doubts about ID too, but the main premise of it (which is why i accept it as probable) is still very rational. People will try to make their reasoning for certain ideas, and I don't condone or condemn them (just how the Big Bang theory is still filled with a shit load of holes). It may be because I think more philosophically and mathematically then i do by senses and the scientific method... it's not that i ignore science (as i've said, i embrace it and continue to study it), I just see how science, when taken to an extreme, can lead people to think too linear.I see how we are debating on a sort of different path. We both accept Evolution as a valid and most reasonable theory on the track of life. You think more on the what can be physically proven scale and on what you say, i agree. But concrete thinking was never enough for me. although ID is not acceptable to me just yet (so far, no theory on the Universe is acceptable to me yet), I believe that we can incorporate it (as i've said, the mass form of energy that creates a guidance) with what is rational to even atheists.Or maybe not, Philosophy is a pretty harsh subject now a days. How much I wish more people could become philosophers (seriously, we had three of the greatest in a row and now nothing).
