PvM:(1)  "Ask yourself this simple question: How does ID explain the bacterial flagella?(2)  "It doesn't, it merely calls it 'designed' which is a placeholder for our ignorance as to how to explain the flagella."(1)  Answer:  It's a machine with functional components.  The design and construct process is largely unknown, but researchable.(2)  The 'designed' designation IS in fact a placeholder, but for further study.  This brings up a common complaint that ID offers no testable hypotheses.  I submit that a hypothesis comes first; the testing later.  Since there's no funding, and there is stigma attached, there has been little confirming research done as yet.  I predict that that will change with the new crop of scientists, a few of whom may see its relevance, and pursue it.  A word to any out there who may fit that category.  That word is 'Nobel.'
