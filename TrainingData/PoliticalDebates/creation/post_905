"this is not a proof of   evolution   from chimps... it just means (guess what) the same virus is in both. Science is not   science   if it makes these kinds of assumptions."Lets start off with this... Humans did not evolve from chimps.. chimps and humans have a common ancestor.Moving onward... the fact that the same gene sequences can be found in both humans and chimps is evidence that we share a common ancestor, which when combined with other evidence gives strong credence to the theory that humans and chimps are related.  Science does not 'assume' that since chimps and humans are genetically similar that we have a common ancestor, it is seen as evidence supporting that theory."do you know we also have 78% of the genes of a BANANA!?does that lead you to believe we are related to a banana?"Yes, there is a common ancestor between humans and the banana... an exceptionally distant one to be sure."question everything - science included."That's the point of Science... Science is there to be questioned, tested, and re-evaluated.  That is why scientific theories are constantly being changed or discarded based on new observations.
