July, 1925 William Jennings Bryan, the leading fundamentalist in America, was questioned by Clarence Darrow on the accuracy of the Bible. Question after question he did not waver. But when Darrow ask him if the world was created in 6 days, Bryan said, no the Bible doesn't say that. You can believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible without believing in the 6 day creation.
