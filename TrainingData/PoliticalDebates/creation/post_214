Needless to say, even ID proponents have come to realize that ID is lacking scientifically speakingFor instance Young Earth Creationist, philosopher and ID proponent Paul Nelson is on the record as saying-- Easily the biggest challenge facing the ID community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don’t have such a theory right now, and that’s a problem. Without a theory, it’s very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we’ve got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions such as ‘irreducible complexity’ and ‘specified complexity’-but, as yet, no general theory of biological design.--Paul Nelson, Touchstone Magazine 7/8 (2004): pp 64 – 65.More recently, godfather of ID, lawyer Phil Johnson has stated--I also don’t think that there is really a theory of intelligent design at the present time to propose as a comparable alternative to the Darwinian theory, which is, whatever errors it might contain, a fully worked out scheme. There is no intelligent design theory that’s comparable. Working out a positive theory is the job of the scientific people that we have affiliated with the movement. Some of them are quite convinced that it’s doable, but that’s for them to prove…No product is ready for competition in the educational world.--Michelangelo D’Agostino "In the matter of Berkeley v. Berkeley", Berkeley Science Review, issue 10, spring 2006Now remember that Johnson has described quite accurately the goal of ID-- “Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.”--Source: American Family Radio, Jan 10, 2003 broadcast, in which Johnson “discusses his book The Right Questions, encouraging Christians to actively debate issues of eternal value.”Various other ID proponents have similarly come to this conclusion, not only arguing that the issue of ID is not really about science, since ID lacks much of any scientific foundation allowing it to be a scientific hypothesis, but also that it is all about religion.It's not the religious motivations which doom ID to irrelevance, it's the lack of scientific merit and content which makes ID at best a flawed religious argument, an argument which many Christians, including me, have come to reject.The ASA (American Scientific Affiliation) is an organization where scientists of Christian faith can share their faith and science and they have come to reject Intelligent Design because it is scientifically vacuous and theologically flawed.
