Joe, I do...--That's false. Thank you for demonstrating your dishonesty. BTW you don't have an explanation.--In fact, it is true. Let me show you: How does ID explain the bacterial flagella.As to UCD and mutations, the best explanation is that variations, selection as well as drift can indeed explain the observed data. After all, the mutation rates needed to explain the differences between species are well within the range of observed mutation rates.I understand though why you want to move the discussion from ID, which explains nothing, to UcD and mechanisms. Show us either how ID explains UcD or how mutation rates need to be too high for UcD.Surprise us with some real science.
