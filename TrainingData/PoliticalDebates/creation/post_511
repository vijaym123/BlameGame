Instead this appears to be an abuse of copyright without an argument on Crowther's part.Too bad.--This is wrong: the Supreme Court requires the proffered secular purpose “be sincere and not a sham” and “[i]f the law was enacted for the purpose of endorsing religion, no consideration of [Lemon’s] second or third criteria is necessary.--Showing a valid secular purpose would have invalidated the 'endorsing religion' part. Why else would the DI argue so strongly that ID has valid secular purpose?Otherwise, given the religious motivations of ID, ID would never stand a chance in court.
