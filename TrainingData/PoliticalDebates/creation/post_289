Hi PvM, they finally got things straightened out.As far as scientific findings go the numbers of evolutionbelieving scientist's is on a major decline. The more technology is able to understand the more everyone will have to abandon the primitive thinking of evolutionarytheory (theory being the key word). When scientists become brave enough to follow the evidence wherever it leads they will land on God's doorstep. 30 years from nowit will be embarrassing for anyone to admit to being anevolutionist.
