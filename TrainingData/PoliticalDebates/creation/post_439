So ID is about complexity and function but that merely describes what I outlined already. Something has function and science does not understand how said function arose so we call it 'design'. Still an argument that adds nothing to 'we don't know' and in fact, as formulated is inherently unreliable.--JoeOW it is very funny what PvM offers up as science and out of the other side of his mouth rejects ID without consideration.--It's not only funny but contradicted by what I have said on this forum. And note that I am not addressing the claim of it being science, after all that would allow the ID proponent to sidetrack the discussion by pointing out the 'demarcation problem'. What I am arguing is far harder for ID to respond to namely the fact that it is scientifically speaking without content.What to see an example? How does ID explain the bacterial flagella? How does it compare to scientific hypotheses?Good luck
