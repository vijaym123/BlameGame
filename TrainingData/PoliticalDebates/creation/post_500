--BowmanMore on the ACLU's rubber stamped ruling, by a practicing attorney--Nothing wrong with quoting from a well argued submission by the ACLU--BowmanThat said, none of this relates to the ID ruling, since the board members were not ID advocates, except perhaps superficially.--On the contrary, and the DI realized this when arguing in their Amicus Curiae brief that ID does have 'valid secular purposes'. Since if ID did indeed have a valid secular purpose, as the board indeed believed (it was after all claimed to be 'scientific' by ID proponents) then the ruling would have had to take into consideration the valid secular purpose aspect. Peter Irons explains it quite well in his paper.
