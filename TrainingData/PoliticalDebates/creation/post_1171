#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I definitely agree with evolution. So does the vast majority of the scientific community. And you know what? If one person wants to believe that god helped with evolution, that's fine. I don't care. As long as they can accept that evolution happened, and does not turn a blind to the blaring evidence.  />   /> On this website I've come across a couple people saying how there are flaws within Darwin's theory. Of course there were! It was the first time anything like that had been submitted! But then there was Wallace, lamark, then there was Eldredge and Gould (punctuated equilibrium) and hundreds of scientists since the 1860's who have taken Darwin's theory and tweaked and changed and improved bits of it. The idea to go into the nittygrittys of The Origin Of Species looking for places where things may be false is ridiculous. When John Dalton made his atomic theory it was brilliant at the time. Today we know only 3 of his 4 points were correct, but it doesn't matter. Darwin had the right idea and scientists after him have researched it further.
