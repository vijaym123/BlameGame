 -PvM- Why would materialists impose the supernatural? This just does not make sense.- I do not know why they always do. "I am glad to hear that Jumpstart admits that ID is all about the supernatural." But they are always assigning IDeas, too the supernatural?!-PvM-On the contrary, materialists do not ignore the "supernatural", they rather find scientific explanations for said "supernatural" which historically has included a lot of gaps in our knowledge.-   What they do is, try and find answers that stem from the material. So that nothing, that could be construed as an Intelligent Designer, can be identified by science! Therefore forcing the biggestgap of all.-PvM-Of course ID could only wish for it to be a "fact of science". Those darn Newtonians and their dogmatic position.- Very funny. Of course, ID has nothing to do with Newtonians. But thanks for admitting dogma.-PvM- It should be clear by now that science does not fill gaps with promissory notes but rather with hard work or a simple admission of "we don't know" and that ID proponents wish to assign 'design' to said ignorance as a placeholder while providing no guidance as to how ID will serve to strengthen the 'design inference'.- All that to say, "I don't believe in an Intelligent Designer" (Creator)and even if there is one, that fact wouldn't strengthen the 'design inference', nor would the design inference, strengthen the inference to the designer. Now thatis a materialist mindset. I reckon we'll have to take your word, on your Christianity.
