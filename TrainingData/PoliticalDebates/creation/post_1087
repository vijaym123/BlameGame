 First, this topic has been on the site at least 50 times, even as recently as a week or so ago, and you should run a search before relaunching the same tired junk.  I've written more on other debates.  />   /> Second, all animals are subject to evolution, the versions you see them at now are the result of millions of years of natural selection, and as the environment continues to change all life will change or die, but that takes millions of years to play out.  />   /> Third, if evolution is wrong then what do you offer to compete with it?  Creationism?  Far far far more laughable than the holes you say exist in evolution.  Or if not creationism then are you just peddaling ignorance?  Are you just going to say you don't know or care where everything came from?  Not knowing or caring would just about make you a monkey after all Pyrus.
