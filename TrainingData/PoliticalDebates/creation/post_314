"The theory of   intelligent design   holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause"Fine.  And that's why this "theory" is not science.  Your "intelligent cause" is completely undefined.  Its powers, limitations, method, time frame, etc. are completely undefined.  Are you going to make "predictions" (as to where Tiktaalik will be found)?  And, of course, the "features" you claim you are trying to explain can be easily explained by completely natural causes.  You are trying to prove a negative.  You wish to prove that evolution cannot explain this.  Fail.So, who is going to decide on the "best explanation"?  A scientist?  Or a theologian?  What criteria will be used?  I know it when I see it?  Some nonsense about "irreducible complexity" or "specified information"?  LOL.
