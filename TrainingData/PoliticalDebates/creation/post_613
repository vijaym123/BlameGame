Remember the question we are addressing is:  Does ID have merit?  I have explained why I think it does.  It is a part of science if science is a search for the truth.  If we are walking togehter and you pick up an object and declare it to be an arrow head, I may say it is a stone.  We argue about this.  If we are anthropologist on a dig, are we doing science?
