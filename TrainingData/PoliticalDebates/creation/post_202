I don't agree with the very first statement that "ID limits its claims to what can be scientifically inferred from the empirical domain." A force unaffected by time and physics that cannot be detected or measured and does not reliably or predictably act cannot be scientifically inferred. But, since ID supposes a supernatural source, isn't it obligated to investigate the supernatural and find said source? ID works from the presupposition that there is an intelligence out there that created our world and situation. So one would think it makes a big difference to humanity if Earth was formed from a goddess ripped apart by a pair of Aztec gods, or if we all happen to be living in the Dreamtime.
