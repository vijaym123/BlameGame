I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although I have never seen god, that makes more sense than evolution.What kind of an argument is that?!The evidence for evolution has primarily come from four sources:1. the fossil record of change in earlier species 2. the chemical and anatomical similarities of related life forms 3. the geographic distribution of related species 4. the recorded genetic changes in living organisms over many generations.http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm Had you taken the time to do a little RESEARCH you would have stumbled upon evidence that suggests evolution is more likely than a being that decided to create our Universe. By the Way, you have been misinformed: it's not apes, it's chimpanzees.
