--You can't offer anymore than theory for one or the other. I just believe that an open mind is far more important than only one view that can not be proven.--On the contrary, I could fill countless books to support the Darwinian and evolutionary theories while the ID 'theory' can be summarized as 'I do not understand: thus poof'--As for Darwin, have you read his books or are just brain washed into thinking that science is always right. Cattle follow the leader without questioning the direction.--I have read most of his books and even some of his unpublished manuscripts. Furthermore, Darwinism as it exists today is strengthened by a vast amount of additional knowledge not originally accessible to Darwin.--I don't know the answer. However, I keep an open mind.--No you don't. You have not studied evolutionary theory which you so foolishly describe as lacking evidence.-- And he was a racist. Read before you go up to call out the big boys. If you don't see the racist in his works than I feel sorry for you.--Note the lack of evidence and the name calling. All clear evidence of a lack of argument.Well done, purelabor but you surely can do better than this now can you? Or are you unable to support even your more outrageous claims?I do understand, that's the most commonly observed modus operandus of ID proponents.Don't feel sorry for me, present an argument, surprise us, enlighten us, thrill us with your arguments.
