In 1925 when questioned by Clarence Darrow, William Jennings Bryan stood by the Bible. But when ask, was the world created in six days, he said no, the Bible doesn't say that. There is a difference of opinion here. Bryan, who took almost the entire Bible, very literally, didn't in this case. The danger is that when the Bible is made to stand or fall on this one point against established   science   it often looses.
