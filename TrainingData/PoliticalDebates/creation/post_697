Actually I meant to say that if Adam and Eve's children had to practice incest in order to "go forth and multiply" then it meant that God ordained it.  And the same God condemn it centuries later.  Does this mean that incest is forbidden only for Jews, Christians, etc. who regard the Bible are their authority?B. Rainey
