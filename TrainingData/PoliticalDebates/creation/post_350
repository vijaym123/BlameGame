What's there left to do. Island complains, as I had expected, of misrepresentations, when I showed him that three out of his three statements/claims were, let's say, poorly informed. That is indeed to the tragic detriment of science. No wonder that all that is left is a tragic ad hominem argument and name calling.Nuff said.Thanks for the fun ride Island.
