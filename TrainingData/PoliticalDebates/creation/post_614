--JimRemember the question we are addressing is: Does ID have merit? I have explained why I think it does. It is a part of science if science is a search for the truth. If we are walking togehter and you pick up an object and declare it to be an arrow head, I may say it is a stone. We argue about this. If we are anthropologist on a dig, are we doing science?---Actually the question is 'does ID have scientific merit' since I am reluctant to address its much stronger theological claims. Again, the confusion of ID with archaeology is understandable but misleading as it suggests that is is how ID infers design. In fact, as I have shown, science's design inference are not based on "we don't understand' thus designed. So what kind of design are you interested in? The kind science already successfully detects or the kind that seems to be doomed to remain elusive to science, also known as 'rarefied design' [1][1]See Wilkins and Elsbery The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance. Biology and Philosophy 16 (November):711-724, 2001.We should be careful not to confuse ID's approach and definition of design with how the terminology is more commonly used in science and by laypeople as I believe that this has been cause for significant confusion.
