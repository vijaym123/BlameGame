Luskin says:"In the title of its first opening statement, the NCSE charges that ID should be rejected because it "is a Religiously Motivated Attack on Science.""The NCSE says that "intelligent design is a religiously motivated attack on science", but the NCSE does not claim that is WHY it should be REJECTED.  Luskin just made that part up so that he could beat up on a straw man.  Of course ID should be rejected because it's non-science nonsense."how can they maintain consistency when they argue that the allegedly religious motives of ID proponents make ID unscientific?"But this is crazy of course.  Religious motives of ID proponents help keep non-science nonsense out of the public high school classroom.  But ID is unscientific for entirely different reasons (as explored in the other articles on this site).So I assert that Luskin's erroneous rebuttal and claim of "hypocrisy" are irrelevant to the overall question - does intelligent design have merit?
