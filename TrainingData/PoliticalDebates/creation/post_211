“ this is really your argument? That's really unimpressive. Or is this just the same old 'who made God' argument' dressed up.”Well yes.  If God is a natural agent, and for a natural agent to be alive it must be designed, then God must have a designer… ergo if God is a natural agent then God must have a designer. If God is supernatural, and cannot be tested for using natural means, then there is no way to detect God… exists outside of Science, and thus is not part of a scientific argument.,"as a sidenote - a scientist creating life is not that impressive either.. it's the equivalent of burning a cd and saying 'look... I made music!'If creating life is not impressive then what in Science is?
