Ricardo, The Bible was definitely written as is.  All those horrible things you wrote were correct and they definitely happened.  I think it was put there on purpose because it was meant to show to the world/readers the cause and effects of   sin  , of rebellion against God, and that the reason God came to this earth (Jesus) was to save each one of us.  Had the Bible were written with only beautiful and perfect sceneries or stories, I wouldn't have believed it.  But millions throughout the centuries could then relate to the events written in it because they had been "there" as well.   Suppose you are reading an Owner's Manual for a car or vehicle, etc.  I copied and pasted the following from a Camry Owner Manual:[Seat belts must also be worn by expectant mothers: the risk of injury in the case of accident is much greater for them and their unborn child too if they do not have a seat belt on....][Placing a cradle child seat's in front during inflation could cause serious injury...]If all you focus is on the negatives and if you are not seeing the big picture, you probably will never be driving a car in your life.  The Bible was written as is, because otherwise it will be one-sided, no one believes a one-sided story.I suggest you to read the Bible in its entirety.  The bestselling book in the history of the world that brought changes into people's lives.  It is a love story that God came to this world to save us from the destructive sin.
