I know this sounds crazy, but in a weird way I'm honored to get a response from you. Is there any chance you could somehow send me the original drafts through email or something? I'm just curious to see the notorious "cdesignproponentists" (or however the hell they misspelled it) in the way it was originally used. Does the NCSE have photocopies or PDF files of the early drafts for download? I'll give you my email if needed.But seeing that you obtained the drafts do you also happen to have a personal set of early drafts from back when Pandas was under a wide variety of different titles (including "creation biology" or something to that effect)?
