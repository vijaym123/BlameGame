--After reading the points between the NCSE and the Discovery institute on that claim, I am still skeptical of this as well. I would like to know more about the "well established roots," as far as I know the best the NCSE has come up with are early book drafts taken out of context.--On the contrary, the NCSE has done far more than that and all the data are available to anyone interested.However, the NCSE did not take these early book drafts out of context but showed, in context, how creationism became intelligent design coinciding with the Edwards ruling.The smoking guns are well established.
