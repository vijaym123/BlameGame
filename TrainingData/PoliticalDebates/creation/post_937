Knowing something to be true and accepting a contradictory story that you know is untrue is even more stupid. Other people on this debate say that creationists are simply ignorant, not stupid. However, what you are advocating is that these people know the truth and still don't believe it. If that isn't stupidity, I don't know what is.
