--Island--No, as I said, they are "typically", by law, strictly prohibitive of ID creationism, which is a huge difference that you don't want to willingly acknowledge. Your attempt to downplay the significance and the teeth of these laws is highly telling.--ID creationism seems not dissimilar from other creationist attempts to introduce God into our science curriculum.
