#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Being an atheist in a catholic school i can tell you that Catholicism, or Christianity does not dispel the idea of evolution. It says that you are free to accept as long as you understand two things,  /> The Book of Genesis is not literal, and so the 7 days could represent hundreds of millions of years,  /> and that God is behind evolution in its stem of creation.
