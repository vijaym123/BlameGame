"Specifically, the theory predicts that we will find large amounts of specified complexity in natural objects."If that "prediction" really meant anything, then the "theory" might actually be a theory.  But since "specified complexity" can never be properly defined, the "prediction" is meaningless and there is no theory.  And since there is no theory, it's not science and all the other silly claims of the "intelligent design" propagandists are irrelevant."Scientists then perform experimental tests upon natural objects to determine if they contain complex and specified information.(20)"Then reference 20:20. For More on CSI Tests:These kinds of tests were reported by pro-ID molecular biologist Doug Axe in Douglas D. Axe, "Extreme Functional Sensitivity to Conservative Amino Acid Changes on Enzyme Exteriors," Journal of Molecular Biology, Vol 301:585-595 (2000); Douglas D. Axe, "Estimating the Prevalence of Protein Sequences Adopting Functional Enzyme Folds," Journal of Molecular Biology, 1-21 (2004). One reply to the 2004 paper ("Needless to say, the grand pronouncements being made by the ID camp are not warranted."):   http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/01/92-second-st-fa.html   The 2004 Axe paper presents a claim that random mutations of a particular enzyme are likely to produce an enzyme with much reduced activity.  In essence, it is a claim that evolution could not possibly work properly.  But, of course, the critics say that the study is flawed."Intelligent design has scientific merit because it is an empirically based argument that uses well-accepted scientific methods of historical sciences in order to detect in nature the types of complexity which we understand, from present-day observations, are derived from intelligent causes."Well, it would if it did, but since it doesn't, ...
