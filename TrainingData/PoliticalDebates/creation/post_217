"ID has legal and educational merit because it is a bona fide scientific theory ..."The problem is that the word "theory" has a scientific definition and "  intelligent design  " has never provided any definition that would qualify it as a "scientific theory"."Legally assessing whether ID science or religion is complicated by the fact that courts have not agreed upon a consensus definition of science or religion."Fortunately, the courts have let scientists decide what is science and theologists decide what is religion.  Since "intelligent design" is not actually science, whether or not it is religion is irrelevant.  But the words "intelligent design" are clearly used by creationists in their attempts to claim that evolution is wrong.  So if those words actually had any meaning, everyone would assume it was a religious meaning.
