You can't use the Bible to prove the Bible, thus that is an invalid argument. Proof of a deity would be by the scientific method, without the use of religious texts, without the use of "faith" and would have to be measured empirically. As it is, there is no way to do this, so the presence/absence of a deity will never be absolutely proven.
