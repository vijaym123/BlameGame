That if you look into all beliefs and theories, you will find a flawThis is very true for almost all theories. In fact even the fundamental theories of sciences still have a surprising number of holes. Molecular theory is a great example.I'm surprised you didn't mention Thoreau. I don't agree with everything he says, however he has been extremely influential. One of my favorite quotes by him is "simplify, simplify, simplify." He recognized that modern life, and materialism tend to complicate life, and draw us away from what makes us human. Looking at our culture, it's pretty easy to see how right he was.
