 I'm AGAINST IT!!!  / Ahh!! I love the arguments in everyone the "against it" section. It totally rings true to my heart. I do see God everywhere! His beauty. Creation is just too darn beautiful to believe that it all evolved and happened by chance. People (part of creation) are just too amazingly built: Reproductive system, ears, eyes, brain, mind, a conscience (the sense of right and wrong),etc. I just will NEVER allow myself to believe in anything different than a creator.
