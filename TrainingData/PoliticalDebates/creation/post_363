Yes Jim, we see objects on a daily basis that were not designed. Otherwise the word "artifact" wouldn't have any meaning.Also there wouldn't be any need for a special department for homicide- you do realize that we can tell the difference between a homicide, an accident and a natural death.BTW Christianity does not maintain that "God" Created everything AS IT IS TODAY.
