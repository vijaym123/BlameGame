If something can arise spontaneously, then a designer certainly isn't proven--what is proven is that a designer is unnecessary.I firmly believe that you should be able to believe whatever you want about god/religion, but on the other hand, once it's established that a designer is unnecessary, it does not serve anyone to say "because we don't know this, this, and this, therefore it must mean there was a supernatural force that set it in motion, and we should stop looking for the answer."Irreducible complexity was shattered a couple of decades ago. Since then, we've answered previously unknown questions about eyes, missing links, plant buds, and all the other gaps. If we had stopped looking, we wouldn't know--and that, I think, is the true danger of Intelligent Design. It not only halts knowledge, it canonizes ignorance.
