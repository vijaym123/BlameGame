#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 Creationism is absurd and wrong and so its fellow-traveller, intelligent design. For one thing, the creationists hold that the Earth is only 6000 years old. That is laughably and provably false. We can even observe evolution taking place in populations of microbes, for example. It is amazing that this sheer nonsense can be sustained in the midst of an advanced technological society.   />   /> Of course, as long as creationists do nothing other than hold their false beliefs privately, they don't do much harm. They're entitled to their opinions, even if they have no basis in fact. When creationism becomes unacceptable, though, is when they try and indoctrinate school children, warping young minds which are not yet well enough equipped to resist their false teachings.
