--ICDESIGNI think Behe has made the case for obvious design within the cell and I don't think you will findanyone who could put it any more clear.--I find Behe's 'arguments' while probably most relevant to design in nature, also to suffer from a significant flaw, an inability to deal with new scientific findings that undermine his claims.Note for instance Nick Matzke's contributions on this forum, and note the absence of much of any response. ID has consistently avoided dealing with the socalled 'controversy' in a scientific fashion and instead seems to insist on invading our public schools under the guise of academic freedom.
