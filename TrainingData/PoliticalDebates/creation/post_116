Jumpstart helps us understand the eliminative nature of ID--It is difficult, even improbable to imagine how such a process could happen; without being jump started. --In other words, his lack of imagination or familiarity with science causes him to propose the need for a designer.Ignorance is a powerful foundation for ID causing it to remain scientifically irrelevant.PS: Contrary to his musings, selection and variation are highly plausible, all that is needed is variation, inheritance and a fitness difference. And while science may not have all the answers to origin of life, it has done far more science in this area to resolve this than ID could even dream of.Ah the power of ignorance.
