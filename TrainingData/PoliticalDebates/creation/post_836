There are some things human beings were not meant to understand because the God who created this Universe is a Being who is greater than all of His Creation.  I am not here to argue Scripture on God because the Bible tells us that the man who lacks wisdom says that there is no God (Psalm 14, Verse 1).  I believe that it's a good thing to want to know more about our Universe, but the Universe we need to focus on is our personal Universe, Planet Earth.  We encounter galaxies of people every day, on the street, at work, in our neighborhoods, and on the streets and highways.  Some of them are homeless, poor, needy, lonely, or just plain everyday people who could benefit from a smile or kind word and deed.  The stars are thousands and millions of light years away, but many of the Earth's 7 billion people are only minutes away from us.  Yes, God did create the Universe and more.  He also allowed us the opportunity to live among other people, so that we could share ourselves with our fellow men and women, and make a difference in their lives.   I will not deny the existence of a supernatural Being greater than myself, because none of us made the choice to be born.  This was something that happened without our consent - I don't need to prove the existence of God because I am not here to split hairs with other people.  But until we can definitely prove that God does not exist, then I would consider it useless to debate on the subject.  As one preacher said: "The unbelievers don't believe in God until they find themselves in a disaster and at the brink of death."   Death is such a powerful thing, that it has motivated such people to get down on their knees and pray to the very same God that they say they don't believe in!   God is real - the proof is all over the Earth and around you, evening, morning, day and night.
