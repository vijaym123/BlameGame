 No no no , we are evolving constantly, we have evolve so much that now we have the power to create.  />   /> What do you think that the creation of the Internet comes from, you gonna say that god created the Internet.?  />    /> The Internet itself is an evolutionary proof of of the evolution of our intellect. And therefore of our evolution overall  />   /> And if you are referring solely to biological evolution, that has not stopped either. OKEY, proof, our appendix, we do not use it and it is just an atrophied  organ in our system, and little by little we will get rid of it completely.  />   /> If not why did your god created it, if it has no purpose and no use.   />   /> One last thing, to be for evolution does not mean that you do not believe in god , and in a higher force that is the almighty creator of the universe.  />   /> It just means that you believe in science; and that you don't read the bible like a news paper. READ THE BIBLE is a great book, but interpret it like poetry not like a news report, is not  a history book.
