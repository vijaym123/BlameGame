Once again we are attempting to split hairs over things that are beyond the frailty of the human brain. Creation as explained in the Scriptures is not a lie, true   science   has already confirmed what Scripture has explained.  I will not split hairs with people over issues that are not worthy of divisive debate, such as the validity of science and the accuracy of the Bible.  We are not God, God does not lie, and some things are better left alone, especially when people are seeking to disprove the existence of God.
