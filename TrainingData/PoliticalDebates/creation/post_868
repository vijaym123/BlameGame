Imagine you found a grain of rice and you wanted to measure its length. Of a caliper, meter stick, and odometer, which instrument would you use? If by some stretch of incompetence you opted to use the odometer, you might conclude that our length measurement techniques are wildly inaccurate. How else could a grain of rice have a length of 0.001 kilometers?This is the same technique that AiG's "PhD scientists" use to cast doubt on radiometric dating methods. The isotope potassium-40 decays with a half life of 1.25 billion years, so it isn't appropriate for measuring very young volcanic rocks. The margin of error with that technique is millions of years wide. Likewise, carbon-14 decays with a half-life of 5730 years, making it accurate only up to about 10 half-lives, or about 60,000 years. Past that point, the remaining carbon-14 is far too scarce to make any accurate age measurement. Yet AiG's professionals admit to using this approach to date diamonds? Incomprehensible.As for the salinity of the oceans, AiG fails to consider any process that removes salt from seawater, of which many have been examined and documented. A full analysis will show that the salinity of the ocean is in equilibrium. The amount of salt entering the sea is almost exactly equal to the amount being removed.
