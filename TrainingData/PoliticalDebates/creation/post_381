Like all theories Evolution has changed over the years because of new evidence was discovered.  The most current theory (modern synthesis) does not support long periods of no change then the sudden appearance of species, rather it describes long periods of slow change punctuated by occasion bursts revolving around sudden environmental shifts.Which is what   science   is about... changing theories when presented with new information that either reveals observations that the theory does not cover or is contradictory to that theory.  Contrast that to   religion   which, when presented with evidence contrary or outside of its beliefs, acts to suppress or ignore that evidence.
