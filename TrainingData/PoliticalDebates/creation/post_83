Good point, but as an evolutionary biologist I find that not entirely true. And as a matter of fact, several sciences from anthropology to zoology via psychiatry and neurology do tell us a lot about ourselves. But even more so does what we study, and the drive to study in itself. Besides, I have doubts about the "intents" of the authors of at least some myths being more sophisticated than representing fact as they believed it. That being said, I certainly agree that they do say a lot about our basic human nature.
