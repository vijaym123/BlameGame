Sharky has pointed out the problem with ID, namely the flawed concept that ordinary and rarefied design can be detected reliably based on the same approach. In fact, we know that in case of ordinary design, science relies on positive hypotheses based on means, motives, opportunities, physical and circumstantial evidence, eye witnesses and more. Rarefied design, by its nature, cannot be constrained and thus science lacks methodology to reliably detect it using the 'design inference' method proposed by ID.Simple really, if the design inference would lead to false positives (inferring design where there wasn't) it is useless per Dembski's own statements. Since we know of quite a few examples where design inferences led to false positives, the conclusion seems self evident.When will ID admit to this?
