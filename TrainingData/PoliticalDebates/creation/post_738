Why would God explain this only to "a semi-literate group of ancient nomads, with no understanding of the cosmos or the world outside of their little   society  "? Why not give an updated version to modern Jewish or Christian or Islamic scholars? Surely all three groups today include people who understand  geology, astronomy and biology on a rather more comprehensive level than the iron-age authors of Genesis?In fact, being all-powerful, why be limited to the understanding of the writers? At least, if you can create the world, surely you can inspire sentences like "And the quickness of light shall be found to be always the same relative to the one who looketh; And behold, the quickness of the light when multiplied by itself and the true weight of matter equals the amount of force that went into its making". Now, an iron-age scribe pondering over the true meaning of those words would have been an argument for divine inspiration.
