Very interesting summary. I always thought the light on the first day was the sun, but that is another argument. In school I was taught that in the beginning the atmosphere was fogy filled with heavy gases. When the plants formed they filtered the atmosphere. "So the Bible was right!" But the teacher says "how could they have known." "God" I answered.
