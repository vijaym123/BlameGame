--Couldn’t atheism be the main reason people have come to embrace a certain type of evolution and object to ID? The emotions so commonly seen in the rejection of ID support this.--Emotions do run high but opposition to ID comes from all sides, not just atheists. In fact, ID's status as lacking scientific content should be a concern to all, not just atheists.--Just the reverse is true. An atheist is stuck with no ID. If science leans in that direction, (as ID says it does) that is an interpretation they must reject. The rejection is based on philosophical assumptions, not science. Believers can go from a God who set the universe in motion (if that) and has done nothing since, to a God who involves himself in our daily lives.--That assumes that sciences leans in that direction and as I have pointed out such a position is ill supported at best. ID may assert but as  a science their contributions remain largely with content.Was it not you who argued that evolutionary science removes a caring God from consideration? So it seems that you have a similar problem. Of course, ID is not rejected based on its theology which is in the minds of many, quite flawed, but rather on the lack of content scientifically speaking. A God who set it all in motion is quite compatible with science as is the position of atheism. Seems that we can find common ground here. Of course, the concept of design as formulated by ID hardly seems suitable to reach such a scientific conclusion, at best this seems to be a theological interpretation. After all, design is not something that seems directly relevant to science.
