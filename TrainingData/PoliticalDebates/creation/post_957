Hey razza for i wanna say thanks for standing up for what u believe in, Most people want hard evidence that will prove Gods existence, when really we ourselves are evidence that God exists. Anyways i believe in change over time like how things are improved over time, like for say how cars have been improved to work on other things other than fuel. But i disagree with the whole monkey theory, God clearly said in the book of genesis that we were created in his image, We do not have a monkey god, its so sad to see how many people have fallen for this. God is God and he makes everything the way they are supposed to be. What good is faith with the presence of evidence, why do we rely on hard evidence, God says believe and you shall see my kingdom, of course people would come to jesus with evidence in their hands, but thats our main test here on earth, God is looking for those who will believe in him without seeing him, clinging to the promise of going to heaven one day and to conclude i just have to say that we are creation and nothing can change that.
