 Evolution is simply the genetic change in populations of organisms over successive generations. So are you saying that you are genetically identical to your parents, your grandparents, and your neighbors? Exactly how and why these changes take place is subject to debate I suppose, but to suggest it does not exist is just denying the evidence of genetic diversity you see, with your own eyes, all around you every day.
