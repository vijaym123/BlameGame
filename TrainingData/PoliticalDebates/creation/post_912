But I can see she didn't teach you much. You didn't respond to a word of my post, just went straight to the attacking me, not anything that I said.But I am indeed ruthlessly attacking faith. Not people. So, as a proud non-christian (proud of what, then, I wonder?) feel free to butt out.Unless you'd like to explain the logic of believing that a person is born into a debt of sin, redeemable only by the nailing up of some other person? A debt earned, by the way, by yet a third party, for eating an apple of all things. If you can explain that, then I nominate you to explain how believing some B.S. like that, gives anybody the moral high ground for all time.If you can't explain it, then you are at least halfway toward understanding why I hate Christianity, and any other dogma with such power to harden hearts, and enslave minds.
