F2XL insists that just because God is absent from the book that it therefor could not have been based on creationism, even though it defined creationism to be in line with its predecessors and later renamed the term to read design. The book defines creation/design in a manner totally consistent with how its predecessors defined it, but in those cases they were more upfront about the religious implications.As I have shown you, you avoid looking at the evidence by arbitrarily setting your requirements for what you would accept. It's the preponderance of evidence that shows the historical change of the book to coincide with the Edwards ruling in which it was found that the use of creationism was not valid as a scientific alternative and a more neutral descriptor was needed. ID matched this, and not the concept since it was just a global find and replace not a rewrite of the arguments. This thus linked ID to creation to its God filled predecessors. Surely you do understand the history behind creationism, which believed that by removing references to God, but still repeating the same old flawed arguments, that it would be constitutionally permissible to teach it in schools. Edwards showed them to be wrong, their response? Not rewriting the arguments but renaming the Creator to be a designer (wink wink) and still the same old misleading arguments.By making information immaterial, it all but admits that it is about the supernatural, by making Pandas to oppose the science of evolution which the FTE considers to be atheistic, Buell clearly admitted that the 'alternative' was what historically was presented as God the Designer.
