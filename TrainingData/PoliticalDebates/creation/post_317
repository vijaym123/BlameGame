"Non sequitur. The creationists of the Texas State Board of Education wish to claim that there are "weaknesses" in   evolution  ."I don't think anyone who feels limitations should be brought to light about a theory is a "creationist."""Intelligent design" attempts to provide support for such opinions. Therefore "intelligent design" should be properly smacked down as non-science nonsense. That's why it "matters"."Just for further clarification, your reasoning is as follows....."1. Texas school board consists of creationists2. They support critical analysis of evolution3. ID supports the second goal4. Thus ID is not science"...correct?
