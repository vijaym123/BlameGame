He was a judge.  Not a molecular biologist...  why is it we have to argue things that are completely unarguable?  Of course he didn't understand the intricacies of the case for ID--- HE WAS A JUDGE.  Anyone claiming that he DID understand the subject matter completely is being intellectually dishonest - since people in the field itself have varying levels of understanding when it comes to the subject matter -- and they actually do it for a living...And to make statements about how Forrest had to deal with insults and snide remarks from the other side.... cry me a river - I'm sure you guys were nothing but saints right?
