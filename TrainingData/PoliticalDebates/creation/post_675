You can't offer anymore than theory for one or the other. I just believe that an open mind is far more important than only one view that can not be proven. As for Darwin, have you read his books or are just brain washed into thinking that science is always right. Cattle follow the leader without questioning the direction. I don't know the answer. However, I keep an open mind. Remember that once upon a time, man knew that the world was flat, he knew the world was the center of the universe and he knew that the Earth sat on the shoulders of giant elephants. Science is sometimes wrong. Like it or not. But, I would like to see the missing link that can't seem to be found. I didn't say one way or the other. But I have read the works of Darwin, and anyone that bias I have a problem with. And he was a racist. Read before you go up to call out the big boys. If you don't see the racist in his works than I feel sorry for you.
