First, I believe that religion is man-made, as are Christ, Buddha, Mohammed, et al. Thus, they truly are the opiate of the masses, and inherently flawed. Religion can be used for good and evil. Nonetheless, that's all it can be used for: a tool. Most of the time, that tool is used for evil, the perpetualization of ignorance and results in misery. Intelligent design has merit, but it has no place in government, schools or courthouses. It is and should remain personal.However, I think that SOMETHING set all this into motion. I truly believe their is a God, though in what sense, I can't say. I think "God" is best defined as a Great Architect, for my purposes. As an agnostic, I think knowing God is inherently impossible, at least until my life ends, or rather, when and if my spirit dies.I used to be a practicing christian, but as I evolved and saw how that religion and its worshippers lead through fear and are hypocrites like the rest of us, I moved on. Fear and growth are incompatible, as are ignorance and tolerance.When I began studying physics and astronomy, though, that knowledge left me believing that there IS a reason for all of this. I guess I could sum it up by saying whatever Architect there is, he, she or it set evolution into motion. Ask yourself this: "if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?" My answer is that it can't be random. If there is an end to our universe, what lies on the other side? For now, that is unknowable. But it won't stop me wondering.
