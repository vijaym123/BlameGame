--ID explains the genetic code the same way we explain a computer code.--Poof?... And thus, lacking a real response, Joe moves the goalposts back to science to show how it explains the genetic code. Let's thus explore why ID once again remains scientifically vacuous. All it can do is 'it looks designed', 'science cannot explain it'But science has indeed explanations for how the genetic code arose, and although there are still many gaps, science has uncovered many new features to support its hypotheses. Let me know when you have located the compiler. ID once again has been shown to remain unable to propose any competing hypothesis which explains the data better than science.As to ID not being invented to get God into anything, I guess you are calling your own ID proponents to be dishonest? Wow...Sure, appeal to the supernatural is areligious.ROTFL, next time you defend ID in court... Behe and Fuller already were to honest to admit that it is really all about the supernatural.
