You are an intellectual and people like you have the hardest time believing anything, let alone trying to intellectualize the bible or God or anything like it.The truth is in order to understand the creator God you will need to have the Born Again experience.  After that than it is easier to understand because then you have a true relationship with Him.  I admit it is difficult to wrap your mind around, I had the same problem.It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle then it is a rich man to get into heaven.The same applies to intellectuals. When things are as simple as True Christianity is, it will be hard for a person like you to understand.  One day I hope you will.Flip
