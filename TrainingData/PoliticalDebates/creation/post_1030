Once again generalizing on an unfair term. Most people who believe in ID (i've already said that i don't accept it as fact) also believe in Evolution. They do not conflict with each other. Creationists want to say that evolution is just a theory, ID believers do not (usually).I was disagreeing with your generalization of ID belief. as for the scientists thing, Caroline Crocker's contract was no renewed and the reasons mentioned her belief in Intelligent Design. I'm sorry i don't have a list ready of all the scientists who were ever fired.I've posted this before, but here you go again. non-religious scientists who believe in IDa couple are a bit extreme, but most of the guys on here are pretty rational ID believers (and are not religious), and, they're scientists and scholars.I admit that I don't know. I do try to figure things out rationally, and ID happens to be a very rational conquest for the answers to the Universe. It's not the only theory i consider though, I have over 9000 theories in my head and I am constantly dissecting them in my head trying to figure out how i can possibly put them together or change them around a bit so that they are more reasonable.and you keep on trying to make it sound like i want scientific conquests to stop... I don't understand why you continue with that argument after i've constantly repeated that i want scientific research to continue and that i don't want it to stop at ID.it's an unfair argument. You seem to want to paint me as an irrational creationists when it's obvious i'm nowhere near that.
