"Tell me, Have you ever read the "Origin of the Species"? I have and I find it to be a pretty far stretch. The whole theory of Evolution is based on that book, and I do mean theory."The theory of Evolution is not based on OotS, that is just the book that 'first' put for the idea.  It is also a theory that we can observe in action then test."For something to go beyond a theory, it has to be proven beyond and shadow of a doubt."Actually no... There is nothing in   science   beyond a theory.  Some theories are now known as laws due to how rigorously they have been tested, but that does not mean that they are absolutely perfect or beyond reproach.  Evolution is just a theory, though one with a great deal of evidence backing it up... where is the evidence for a 6 day creation?"My question is this: Is a Scientist who studies Evolution more credible than one studying Creation? What if they both have the same Credentials, the same degrees, the same experience, but one is studying creation and one   evolution   ? Which one is More credible?"One would have to look at their research and methodologies to determine which one was found more credible."Most in that debate said that the one studying evolution was more credible than the one studying evolution."Yes, because the evidence for evolution, and a 4.5 billion year old earth, is far stronger then the evidence for   creationism  .  To be seen as credible a creationist would have to demonstrate how their theory was better at describing what we observe then the current theories.
