Even the anti-IDists require something beyond nature to explain the origin of nature. Natural processes only exist in nature and therefor cannot account for its origins.ID is NOT an argument about complexity and it certainly does NOT state that complexity can only arise from complexity. ID is about FUNCTIONAL complexity. The bottom line is we do exist and there is only ONE reality behind our existence. If you listen to the anti-ID side our existence is due to many accidents- first cosmic and then genetic.Is that scientific? How can we test that premise? What predictions does it make?IOW it is very funny what PvM offers up as science and out of the other side of his mouth rejects ID without consideration.
