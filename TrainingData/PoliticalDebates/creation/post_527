--As for scientific evidence for ID start with the genetic code. The day we observe nature, operating freely, putting together a code is the day that MicroSoft will lay off all their programmers because they are unecessary.--Please tell us how does ID explain the genetic code, and I am sure you can explain to us the various hypotheses and the evidence as to how science explains it.But you have made a clear case that ID is all about ignorance, your 'bottom line' betrays' you.So surprise me, explain to us how ID explains the genetic code. And lacking that, show that you understand today's best explanations and admit that ID is not an inference to best explanation.Looking forward to your reply.As to your evolution is atheistic by the same logic, you are missing two important points. One, ID is not scientifically fruitful, two, ID was 'created' to get God inside the class rooms. With such a history, it is not hard to understand why people correctly have come to realize ID is at best a poor theology.
