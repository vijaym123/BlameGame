Actually, the construction of the cell rather suggests chance. Mitochondria have their own DNA. It's not even specific to the organism it's in--my mitochondrial DNA matches my families', sure, but you couldn't tell the difference between my sister's and mine. Why would a designer design one organism within another organism? And why would he do this common, foreign cellular power source for animals, fungi, and plants? That speaks much less of "design" and more of "chance"--other organisms at some point, before the construction of cell walls, formed symbiotic or perhaps just very good parasitic relationships with primitive mitochondria.
