Which I argue is the main reason people have come to embrace ID and object to scienceCouldn’t atheism be the main reason people have come to embrace a certain type of evolution and object to ID?  The emotions so commonly seen in the rejection of ID support this.Well, atheists have the advantage that they can incorporate science easily as it does not interfere with their philosophical position...Just the reverse is true.  An atheist is stuck with no ID.  If science leans in that direction, (as ID says it does) that is an interpretation they must reject.  The rejection is based on philosophical assumptions, not science. Believers can go from a God who set the universe in motion (if that) and has done nothing since, to a God who involves himself in our daily lives.
