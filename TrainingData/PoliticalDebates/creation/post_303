"We detect design by looking for the tell-tale signs that an intelligent agent acted. Intelligent agents tend to produce specified complexity when they act."Riiiight.  Well "specified complexity" is a nonsense phrase to confuse the rubes.  And apparently "tell-tale signs" are also in the eye of the beholder."the animation illustrates unseen molecular mechanisms and the ones they trigger, specifically how white blood cells sense and respond to their surroundings and external stimuli."So what?  This is simply known science.  There is no "tell-tale sign" of an "intelligent agent".  Not in the eye of this beholder anyway."Seems like the burden of proof goes both ways."Nope.  Science is reality.  Reality is science.  If science can explain reality without resorting to a miracle or the supernatural, then science is satisfactory.  If you think science is not satisfactory, then the burden of proof is on you to show that it is not satisfactory.  But if the "supernatural" is "outside science", then your only chance is to show that there are some observed events (miracles) that cannot be explained by science.  This is an argument from ignorance.  If science cannot (yet?) explain this, then it must be a miracle caused by a supernatural entity.If science can explain it and ID can also explain it, then science is preferred because ID introduces an unnecessary element.  So the burden of proof is on ID to show that the extra element is necessary.
