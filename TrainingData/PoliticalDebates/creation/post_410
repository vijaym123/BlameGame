First off, the human Eye did not pop into existence by chance, it is the result of billions of years worth of   evolution  ... a process by which slight mutations (changes in the structure) proved advantageous and were passed down, leading to more complex structures.I'm not sure how ID has been demonstrated by genetics and statistics... however you are avoiding the big question that ID raises.   If life is to complex to exist without a designer, then that designer cannot be a living thing.  If the designer is not a living thing then what is it?  What was the designers intentions, where is the designer now?  What predictions does ID make regarding the future?
