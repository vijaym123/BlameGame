I recently read that after careful study the 'backwards' wiring is essential.. - something to do with cooling? I really can't recall...but considering I don't have a citation to give you - or a link.. what's it matter.But anyway..I heard a list of reasons that our eyes for functional reasons are wired differently (front to back) I'm sure if you cared to seek them out - you'll find the defense for such 'mistakes'.. it's your dime.Also.. In man's arrogance he assumes that anything he hasn't found a use or reason for must not have a use or reason... remember junk DNA..... not junk.  Remember the 'useless' appendix... not useless.  Your view that accidental nature is a great designer is what is nonsense.... Funny how man is scrambling to find any 1 thing they can point to as a 'bad design'... that in itself shows that the design is if anything near perfect.   But what's it matter -   evolution  .. a theory without mechanism.. can design anything!
