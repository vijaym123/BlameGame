Mutation and natural selection are the two driving forces behind evolution. By mutating the flu virus is evolving. There is no difference between the two.Also, you claim that we have never observed organisms evolving: this is completely untrue. In lab experiments evolution is witnessed all the time.For exampleIn addition, scientists have also witnessed the evolution of species in the wild like the Italian wall lizard.This is one of the common misconceptions about evolution. That species evolve is observed fact...that they do so through natural selection is the theory.
