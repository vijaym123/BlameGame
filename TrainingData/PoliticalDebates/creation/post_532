I never said anything about Einstein's religious convictions. Not one word.ID is not about a personal God. ID does not require a God at all. ID does not require intervention.The quote stands:"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.""But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding.Ó- Albert EinsteinAnd seeing that PvM doesn't care about the truth why is he a scientist?
