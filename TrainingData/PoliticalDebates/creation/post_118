Saying there are experts on Intelligent Design is like saying there are experts on astrology.ID is a pseudoscience.  The best definition of pseudoscience comes from Prof. Thagard at the univ. of Wisconsin."A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if:1. it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but2. the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in ralation to others, and is selective in considering confirmation and disconfirmations."    http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html
