you have such books written as, THE CONSIPIRACY OF IGNORANCE, by Martin Gross. Because the school system only teaches     evolution     the     children     attending that school will always be dumber and less intelligent than any other school that promotes spiritual growth and truth. Truth is probably the best factor in determining intelligence and one cannot have it with Gd! So that is why, in many peoples opinions, including my own, that we have this:1. A statement by Dr. James Conant in 1960's,a quote in reference to the Education establishment ( public school)  he called it a "CLOSED ALLIANCE" and little did he know just how much of a corrupt alliance it would become in the years ahead.2. Apparently one of the sad consequences of such a corrupted alliance is that our     kids     are dumber and we have to have as much as 45% of PHD's are given to non-    Americans     each year in our country, which our governement calls, NON-RESIDENT ALIENS, according to the book, Conspiracy of Ignorance.3.June 1999,the chairman of the Federal Reserve board, Alan Greenspan,  warned that the poor state of public school     education     would endanger its     constitution    , that being a people capable of maintaining its prosperity.4.In Massachusetts, April 1998 teachers where tested, all of whom had received bachelors of education, and 3 out of every 5 flunked! And that was being able to write a gramatically correct sentence.5. And sadest of all the book exposes a national crisis when it showed that at a national math test, 60% of American students could not show how to get an average number from 5 numbers provided. AND THE  BOTTOM LINE IS THE TEACHERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND UNIONS ARE IN GREAT NEED OF HIGHER EDUCATION THEMSELVES. PS INCLUDING CREATIONISM AS A N OPTION AND STOPPING HYPNOSIS ON STUDENTS WOULD BRING UP THEIR IQ'S IMMEDIATELY! My opinion.
