#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 As far as evolution, god, and the creation of man is concerned, maybe evolution is an explanation of how and not why. Maybe god does exist and he set things in motion and evolution took over after that. If you argue that "it says in the bible god created man, period" then how do you explain the fact that we don't see human remains in the same sedimentary layers as many of the dinosaurs. If you want to believe the bible, fine. But you cant pick and choose what parts of the bible to abide by. If you believe in a book written by a bunch of "translators" for king james which contradicts itself about a million times, then you are as delusional as the bible you thump.
