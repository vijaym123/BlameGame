If scientific inquiry has shown conclusively that Genesis is at best allegorical, then Christians should reconsider beliefs that presume a historical interpretation of Eden.Doctrines like original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are not described anywhere in the Bible. They're merely theories that theologians have created to make sense of the narrative. Much like a scientific theory, theology should be questioned if it contradicts new discoveries. It's time to rethink your particular theology if you find it in conflict with the conclusions of scientists, whose theories are much easier to conclusively test and verify.Despite what you say, the Bible makes sense even to me, an atheist. The Bible as ancient folklore can teach us a great deal about ancient Hebrew society: their fears, their dreams, their iconic heroes, and their perception of the world. A document does not need to be a perfectly preserved dictation from the mouth of god to be useful.
