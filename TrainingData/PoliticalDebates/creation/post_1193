#originalTopic=Is_The_Whole_Evolution_Theory_STARTING_To_FAll_Apart
 Despite every lie told be cretins - I mean, creationists - like you, nothing has been shown that contradicts the theory of evolution.  One of two things always happens:  />   /> 1) The theory makes predictions, and new evidence found fits the theory.  />   /> 2) Rarely, new evidence is found that does not fit the theory, so the theory is changed to fit the evidence. Croutonist - I mean, creationists - ignore evidence that doesn't fit their claims, which is an act of pure cowardice as well as intellectual dishonesty.
