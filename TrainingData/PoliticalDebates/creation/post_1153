#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Well evolution is by far the most logical idea I have heard about where man came from.....I mean it could be worse people could tell you that man and woman started off naked in a garden with nothing but an apple tree and a talking snake for company,...LOL how ludicrous is that?  The theory of evolution wins every time!
