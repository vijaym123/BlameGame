The following statement by the employee of NCSE is the exact form of inference to the best explanation that ID scientists use to demonstrate that there is intelligence behind life. No one would think that it is by undirected chance that all the names on the list are Steve."it becomes more impressive when you realize that all the scientists are named Steve. Census records show that people with those names represent about 1% of the US population, which means that those 900 scientists stand in for at least 90,000 scientists."ID proponents use exactly the same type of scientific statistical methods to prove beyond reasonable doubt that intelligence was involved in the origin of the cosmos and of life.
