It's about being scientifically relevant. Look at Behe, what has he done for science in the last decade? His latest book "Edge of evolution" shows how ID can only make its claims when ignoring scientific progress. Guillermo Gonzalez failed to impress his tenure committee that he should be given tenure. They promote ID, they get people to respond, and in most cases they totally ignore the criticism. Look at how Behe is ignoring the devastating observations by Matzke in this forum for instance. Of course, Behe has no duty to respond but it shows how ID fails to be able to really present its case or defend itself against real criticism. That ID has its roots in Christianity is just an additional bonus to help understand why despite its scientific vacuity, ID is still attempting to introduce it under the guise of, what is the flavor of today?, oh yes, academic freedom.You could perhaps move forward this discussion by explaining how ID explains any 'designed' system? What hypotheses relevant directly to design does it generate?I have seen various attempts by ID proponents to make claims of 'research programs' based on ID but ID lacks a foundation for that as well, I'd argue.
