"Pretty much, especially if anyone who has publicly known pro-ID views prior to getting tenure is bound to not get it."If the institution in question does not feel that ID is a valid line of inquiry then I don't see why it would give tenure to people who subscribe to the theory."If that were true then why (as an example) was Robert J. Marks asked to return grant   money   the moment he started a lab related to ID?"Was he given that money to start and ID lab?  If not then I imagine that his backers would have  been upset when they found that he was using the money given to him for a different purpose."So all I have to do is show that ID explains the workings of many features of the natural world and they'll be free to do their research?"In a scientifically demonstrable fashion yes."Name some."The nature and origin of the designer, the purpose of the design, the current location of the designer, the mechanism by which the designer acted, the process by which design decisions were made and the reasons behind specific design choices."This gives a good overview:"Talk about how purposes for what what was once though to be junk DNA... followed by arguments about how ID has been misrepresented.... I'm not sure what predictions it's making."We can detect them once they happen, which is all ID is claiming to be able to do in that respect."By what mechanism does the designer make these changes?  Why can't we look at past design decisions and then determine an overall pattern from which we can then determine the next design choice?"Probably weren't biologically relevant though (unless agency intervened)"Why did the agency intervene?  Where did that agency originate? How did that agency create life?"Explain how you could have "life" that happens to be even simpler than the most basic of cells."long chains of self replicating proteins?  proto-cells?
