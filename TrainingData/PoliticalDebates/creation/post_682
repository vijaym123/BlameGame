The full drafts were all entered as evidential exhibits with the court and are on file there.  It would be great if they were available for the world to see but they are copyright to The Foundation for Thought & Ethics so the stuff that is online is just short quotes/images through fair use:  http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/10/i_guess_id_real.html    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing_link_cd.html    http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=80  There are several articles summarizing what is in the drafts, email me at matzkeATberkeley.edu, I can send you those.  PS: I have unsubscribed from OpposingViews so I won't see any further messages on these threads.
