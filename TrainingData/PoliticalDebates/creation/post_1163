#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 This is pure ignorance.  Yes evolution is a theory which is more than I can say for any religious pretext for how we have all come to be.   If you actually read scientific papers about evolution they do not claim to be law because it is still a working theory.  Up to this point evolution is the best explanation for how we are here.  You are entitled to your religious beliefs but religion is based on faith and science is based on fact, and the facts are definitely not on your side.
