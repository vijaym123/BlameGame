Joe:We look at the options. And the anti-ID option is "it just happened". We do have direct observatiuons of agencies designing rotary motors. We have NEVER observed nature, operating freely, even come close.--PvM:No the scientific position is 'we don't know'. ---Then that is what should be on just about every page of a biology textbook- "We don't know". Yet instead we find that things "evolved" without even knowing whether or not the transformation is even possible.BTW PvM regularity arose by chance in the anti-ID scenario.The laws that govern nature "just are the way they are" - Stephen Hawking. IOW once again you don't have an explanation.BTW PvM the scientific answer to UCD is "we don't know". So why is it OK for YOU to make an inference- UCD- when we don't know, but it is wrong for IDists to make an infer3ence when it is based on observations, data and experience?
