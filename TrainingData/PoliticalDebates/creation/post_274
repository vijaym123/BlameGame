--Behe--If “scientific merit” is judged by the correspondence between theory and physical reality, then the theory of intelligent design rates very strongly.--There is no theory of ID, what's so hard to understand here. The concept of "purposeful arrangement of parts" is at best a restatement of Paley's argument and fails to recognize scientific explanations. As to the flagellum simulations, let's make sure that it is actually based on the actual pictures rather than a stylized representation. After all, we do not want to pretend that the physical reality looks like a cartoon.
