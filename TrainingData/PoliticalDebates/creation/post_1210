 Evolution is STILL happening.. Viruses evolve constantly to not be "killed off" by antibiotics, which is why we have to constantly change the antibiotics. Everything evolves currently. Even humans.....the average height of a grown man in 1800 was a lot shorter than that of a man today.Evolution. I could go on for days about the proof. Just because an ancient book written by people who weren't exposed to modern science says nothing about it doesn't mean science is a lie. You can't argue w/ science, sorry.
