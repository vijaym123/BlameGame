You're lucky not enough people know or care enough about your religion to throw out opinions based on it presented as science, philosophy, logic, or fact on the spot.  Claims that the world was created in exactly 6 days exactly as the Bible says it was have just as much credence as your religious argument.  NONE!  There is nothing persuasive about Objectivism, especially when it's disciples cite it as fact without any evidence other than, "Well Ayn Rand said so."  Come back to me with arguments not based on Objectivism, and we'll talk.  The sad part is, Ayn Rand seems like she was a very rational and logical person.  It is a shame that her modern disciples have so perverted that image.
