"Then why is the top of Mt Everest covered in fossilized clams?"Because nearly all mountains used to be ancient sea floor genius. That continental drift and plate techtonics."Why have sets of human footprints have been found on top and next to dinosaur footprints?"Because they are a hoax and have been proven to be so."Then why have fossilized whales been found standing vertically on their tails?"Because the earth moves and shifts! Remember the mountains?OK I'm going to stop there. If you can't go find the answers to some of these questions you are willfully ignorant. Science has working theories for most of this stuff and if it doesn't it's working on them because that's what science does. It knows it doesnt have all the answers yet but the very fact that you can make arguments that you made is because you have a basic understanding of science. Dont worry, friend, the answers are coming faster every day.
