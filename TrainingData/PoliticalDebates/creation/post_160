From Mr. Luskin's argument:"Design theorists *hypothesize* that if a natural object was designed, it will contain high levels of CSI. Scientists then perform experimental tests upon natural objects to determine if they contain complex and specified information.... When experimental work uncovers irreducible complexity in biology, they *conclude* that such structures were designed." (*emphasis* added)So ID first hypothesizes that CSI implies design, and then concludes that the CSI in biology implies design.  But this is nothing but a restatement of the hypothesis!  What ID forgets to do is to confirm their hypothesis, and somehow empirically support the claim that CSI necessarily implies conscious planning.  ID never even tries to do this.  Instead, ID attempts to make an induction from a single data point, arguing that since human beings can build complex machines and humans are conscious, then everything which can build complex machines must be conscious.  But one data point is not sufficient to induce the characteristics of all possible "intelligent agents", and so there is no justification for suggesting the cause of biological complexity (whatever it might have been) was a conscious entity.  One could, by the exact same reasoning, argue that everything which can build complex machines must have large, complex, biological brains.  But this would mean ID can't account for the *origin* of biological complexity after all.So ID does not use the scientific method to infer anything at all.  It merely assumes that all CSI must come from conscious minds because we humans can create it too, which is a perfectly unscientific argument.
