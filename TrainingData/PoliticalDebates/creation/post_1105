 I believe in evolution; evolution is the mechanism that some species of animals and plants use to adapt to certain circumstances do to the change. Because our planet is currently changing, some animals need to adapt to that, if they don't or are incapable then they can become extinct.  And It does exist there are animals who evolve from the dinosaurs age, like aligators, tortules and many others.
