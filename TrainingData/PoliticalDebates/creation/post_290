--ICDESIGNAs far as scientific findings go the numbers of evolution believing scientist's is on a major decline.--Historically such predictions have failed to come true time after time. In fact, the theory of evolution is getting stronger and stronger. So I have to reject your unsupported and wishful thinking.--ICDESIGNThe more technology is able to understand the more everyone will have to abandon the primitive thinking of evolutionary theory (theory being the key word). When scientists become brave enough to follow the evidence wherever it leads they will land on God's doorstep. 30 years from nowit will be embarrassing for anyone to admit to being an evolutionist.--Stop embarrassing yourself with these predictions, there is no reason to come to such a conclusion. Surely you would not want to portray such a foolish notion?But I do understand that the facts, may be somewhat disturbing to some religious people who have not only come to misunderstand evolutionary theory as being anti-God but worse are willing to go on the record with foolish statements. That just makes us Christians look well, 'foolish'
