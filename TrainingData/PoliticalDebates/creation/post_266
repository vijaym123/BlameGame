I apologize for using misleading wording. You are right in that the majority of mutation appear to have little or no effect on survival in most organisms. My point was simply that any mutation which does produce a notable prototypic effect (which is simply any mensurable change for any non-biologist out there), can be viewed as a negative change in some particular environment. For organisms with very simple and efficient genomes well adapted to a particular environment that change will likely be a negative one in their ancestral environment. Kudos on dragging out the statistical fallacies in Mr. Behe's most recent popular work. I find your reference to Simon work particularly fascinating. Whether serial duplication would be useful or not depends on whether there is any similarity between various good designs, which there empirically are for almost any designed object I can think of. In conclusion, scale free networks are cool.
