GOD is not physical except as CHRIST & a CHRISTIAN, true believers...GOD is SPIRIT ....YOU cannot PROVE SPIRIT, except for it's intervention upon men...AS in: INSPIRED....or INDWELT...THE effects of the SPIRIT's workings....WHEN the worlds or EARTH was created by GOD the writings refer to ,"the SPIRIT moved upon the EARTH & or WATERS"...I do not presume to know the totality of GOD or HE, as HE referse to himself, or itself(SPIRIT)...I would be equal with GOD if I had full kowledge & would myself BE GOD...HE or the SPIRIT rejuvinates a dead spirit,in man, EXAMPLE; in me to MY "salvation", as HE ,GOD calls this phenominon..  THIS is MY proof that HE exists & HE has convicted ME to "believe" in the writings which are contained in scripture; to which HE has given ME the gift of discernment & authenticity.... THE POWER to BELIEVE..THIS IS THE BEGINNING of SALVATION or what is refered to as FAITH WITNESS or PROOF, without which a man cannot believe...ENOUGH, O.K.? IT is a FAITH not MY own which has been given or transported to me...REF: The wind blows where it may but, ONLY the effects are seen, or made physical to the human...
