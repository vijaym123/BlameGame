 I find it relevant to point out that the answers in the "AGAINST: Evolution Is Wrong" Column are nearly twice as long as those in the "FOR: Evolution Is Wrong". This, despite the fact that nearly the debate is actually very close in terms of numbers on each side.  />   /> I would suggest the reason for this is that those who support Evolution have detailed positions based on numerous supporting FACTS. And those who oppose Evolution have relatively brief positions based on few supporting OPINIONS.
