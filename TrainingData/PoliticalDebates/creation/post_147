My other comment focused more on my atheist background, but I wanted to respond to your scientific misconceptions.Nobody thinks lightning struck goo and humans popped out. Saying such constitutes a straw man and betrays your unfamiliarity with evolutionary theory. Before bashing what you've heard evolutionists "believe," you should check for yourself. There are several excellent books, some by Christians, that introduce the basic concepts behind the modern formulation of Darwin's theory (Darwin was wrong on most of the details) and explain why we accept them. I would personally suggest any of the books by Kenneth Miller.  http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias  %3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=kenneth+miller
