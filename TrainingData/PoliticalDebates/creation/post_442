--DI--As I explained in my fourth opening statement, design can be inferred regardless of whether the designer is natural or supernatural. ---That of course is incorrect and has been discussed many times now, although the ID proponents do not seem to have a response, which is fine. It's the bait and switch between ordinary design for which we have some independent evidence, and rarefied design which lack such distinction which makes the latter one highly unreliable.Ask yourself this simple question: How does ID explain the bacterial flagella?It doesn't, it merely calls it 'designed' which is a placeholder for our ignorance as to how to explain the flagella. But it gets worse, ID is doomed to sit back idling while science has continued to expand its knowledge of the flagella and likely evolutionary pathways. And while ID could not even compete with our ignorance, it now faces an even bigger challenge, namely a scientific hypothesis.That my friends is why ID has to resort to equivocation on the terms natural and supernatural, to include 'intelligence' as a supernatural cause.What a shame that good science is used to support such a vacuous notion
