7: And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.8: And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.9: And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.15: And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.16: And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:17: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.18: And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.19: And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.Clearly God made man, then planted Eden, then made animals. To take another interpretation would be to say the Bible listed things out of order.
