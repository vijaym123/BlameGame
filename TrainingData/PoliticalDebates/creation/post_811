"It is consistent but. We don't know enough about the physics to draw any sound boarder on where that consistency begins or ends. Also one of the consistencies would naturally be, inconsistency. As every thing we have observed in the universe so far."Science is based on what can be observed / tested.  So far every observable area of the universe obeys the same laws that we observe on earth.  Without some evidence to the contrary there is no scientific way to claim that the laws will differ elsewhere."Also one of the consistencies would naturally be, inconsistency. As every thing we have observed in the universe so far."If it is consistent then it cannot be inconstant at the same time.  If we somehow observed an area of the earth where gravity was reversed then a scientific investigation would have to demonstrate what conditions 'there' caused gravity to be reversed.  That would either make the observation in line with current scientific thinking (a powerful magnetic field giving the appearance of reversed gravity) or lead to an expansion of existing theories to describe anti-gravity.The first step is to observe something that does not appear to fit within current scientific knowledge, and so far the observed laws appear to be universal in scope.Saying that they might not be, but that we have not observed where they are inconsistent is not a scientific argument.
