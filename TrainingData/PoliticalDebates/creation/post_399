Hello Richard,I admire your wealth in cash funds.  That being the kinder way to explain you chasing my comments all over the Internet in order to add hateful and irrational comments about whatever I've written.Your statements about Objectivism are without any meaning of any kind until you define the word "religion" which you apply to a philosophy of reason, not faith, of this world, not supernaturalism, of morality, not the sacrifice of a deity in order to save sinful mankind, of disbelief in God, not abject theism.  If you want anyone, including yourself, to know what you are talking about, define your key terms.Oh, and while you are at it, consult a reliable text on logic, on reasoning fallacies, on epistemology...because, if you think that Ayn Rand's Objectivism does not rest on proof, you have a gap in your knowledge of what constitutes proof and how one goes about establishing it.Don't be so angry and hasty, Robert.  You are not a sinner, don't behave like one.
