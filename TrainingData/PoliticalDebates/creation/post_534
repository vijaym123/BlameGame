--Joe GI never said anything about Einstein's religious convictions. Not one word.--and yet Joe G also said--"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind."--In order to understand this comment by Einstein, you have to understand Einstein's religious convictions lest one is merely interested in 'quote mining' but then why quote Einstein. Einstein's position is actually perpendicular to ID where Einstein says that the regularity of nature is the religious aspect of science. In other words, it renders ID meaningless as it proposes regularity not the absence thereof, which would trigger the 'design inference'.Contrary thus to Joe's words, he should have either considered Einstein's religious convictions when he quoted him or he should not have quote Einstein. To quote Einstein as if it add relevance and credibility to Joes argument is just 'mining'
