Evolution has not "ceased" in any animal. I think you are a little delusional on the subject. Let me clear this up for you:The transition of "ape" to homo sapiens is not a process that occurs through one generation."why aren't we evolving to some strange terrestrial body"For the same reason, the whole transition to a "new species" is not a transition that occurs on one generation. And what do you mean by some "strange terrestrial body"? You mean something different than what we are at this stage? For the same reason, it is not a one-generation process. Why would you not cause us a strange terrestial body today?and "why aren't there half monkey half men who have just entered the middle cycle of evolution"Evolution has no scripture that is followed. There is no one path that all species must mutate with, which is the reason why chimpanzees still exist to this date.And by half monkey half man I might interpret that as a neanderthal, and those coexisted with homo sapiens for some time. Also if you want to see a half human half monkey today, you're gonna have to have sex with a monkey (although i am unsure if that would work out).
