--As explained on that page, some of the scientific journals and other prestigious academic sources that have published peer-reviewed scientific publications by ID proponents supporting core ID arguments include:--And then the Discovery Institute continues to claim some journals, without providing much of any reference to the actual papers. And for good reason because there are trivially few if any, ID relevant scientific papers. While ID is known to quickly claim that papers support their viewpoint, the many authors of said papers have come forward, strongly disagreeing with said claims. ID has few if any ID relevant papers. It's as simple as that. Perhaps the poster would like to identify a single relevant article for us to address in more depth?As to Judge Jones extensive use of the ACLU's "proposed ‘Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law’", the DI initially suggested strongly that something was fishy about this, of course, over time they may have toned down their rhetoric showing that the ACLU was well prepared in briefing the Judge about the case. As to evidence, all that ID can do is use ill defined concepts to argue that our ignorance should indeed be seen as evidence of design, combine this with an equivocation on such terminologies as design and information and one quickly realizes that ID is all about Bait and Switch.If ID has merit, then explain how ID explains the bacterial flagellum.The silence will be deafening I predict.
