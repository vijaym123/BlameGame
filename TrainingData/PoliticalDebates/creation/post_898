Doctrines such as: original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are very well described in the Bible. It's actually not too hard to piece together if you read scripture as a "whole" since it is supposed to be about God and his will for this earth. Evolution is merely a theory at best, and has more holes than swiss cheese ;). It is made to seem like it is "irrefutable," but that is not the case. It is actually "forced" to be taught in schools as fact, although it is only the closest science can come to explaining the origin of human existence and how things developed over time. What's more controversial is the other "separate" theory, which I have no idea why its separate, the "Origin of Life." That theory is so flawed that it has to be kept a separate theory, to make evolution seem "credible." If you would like to discuss the trinity or etc, feel free to let me know. It's best to look at both sides like I have, not just one "presupposed" attitude towards the other. So would you say that the those in the bible "lied" about Jesus doing miracles, and God showing himself through signs or etc. Because that doesn't exactly represent how they acted: Jesus followers were promoting honesty, truth, forgiveness, etc... and they died because of what they saw and believed in. It would seem crazy that they would just make things up, and die for thier beliefs... doesn't it. Just doesn't work logically with your theory.
