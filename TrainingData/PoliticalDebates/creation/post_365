--Joe GBTW Christianity does not maintain that "God" Created everything AS IT IS TODAY.--Some versions of Christianity in fact do seem to do this as they allow only for minor variation. However, this is an important comment since it shows that the concept of 'front loading' which removes the design event to outside our direct observation, is fully compatible with science as we know it and thus the addition of the need of a 'designer' seems rather ad hoc and perhaps unnecessary. ID however proposes no way to resolve this conundrum, which is why, in the minds of so many, ID is scientifically vacuous.
