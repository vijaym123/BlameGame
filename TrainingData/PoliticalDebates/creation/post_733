Then why does this argument always seem to come from the creationists?  AiG was not founded, and is not funded by the Scientific community.I also question your use of the term 'anti-Christian'... Supporters of the ToE are not anti-Christian, most don't care what Christians believe as long as they don't try and push it into the realm of Science.
