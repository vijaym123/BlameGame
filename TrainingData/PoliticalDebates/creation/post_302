"Who decides if an "arrangement of parts" is "purposeful"? What does "purposeful" really mean in that statement? Do the parts have "purpose"?"If there is some form of synergy in the arrangement then yes, that would be purposeful. "Is a virus designed? A prion? A fragment of RNA? A benzene molecule?" Any of them can be a possibility. "How can you tell?"   http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php   /id/1203"Waving your hands and saying "I know design when I see it" and "all life was obviously designed" just won't cut it."Agreed, though that is nowhere near the approach ID takes with Biology (or anything else)."Your religious motives in assuming your religious designer are too obvious to allow your judgment to go unquestioned."PvM tried to make this same claim but it remains unfounded to this day. Maybe you can change that? See these discussions and join in:    http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/sorry-about-my-prior-views   "There you go again, using that word "purposeful"."I defined purposeful earlier in this comment. For detail on the cell, see the following:   http://www.studiodaily.com/main/technique/tprojects/6850.html   "Maybe cells and prions and lifeforms have a "purpose" - to grow and reproduce and evolve - but unless you can show that there is really a "need" for a designer, there is no reason to assume that there was one."I think he already took care of that one. "So your task remains impossible - "prove" that    evolution    cannot have produced "this" over the last 3 billion years. Go back 3 billion years and prove that a "cell" did not evolve from something simpler? Or wave your hands and say "I don't believe it could have happened"?"Seems like the burden of proof goes both ways. If Behe cannot "prove" it didn't happen then there's no reason to believe one can prove that it did.
