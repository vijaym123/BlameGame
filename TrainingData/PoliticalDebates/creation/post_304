"Riiiight. Well "specified complexity" is a nonsense phrase to confuse the rubes." How so?"And apparently "tell-tale signs" are also in the eye of the beholder."If you say so. Synergy sounds like a pretty universal sign to me."So what? This is simply known science. There is no "tell-tale sign" of an "intelligent agent". Not in the eye of this beholder anyway."If   evolution   cannot produce such a mechanism, what are we to conclude?"Nope. Science is reality. Reality is science. If science can explain reality without resorting to a miracle or the supernatural, then science is satisfactory."So ID is science. Good to know. "But if the "supernatural" is "outside science", then your only chance is to show that there are some observed events (miracles) that cannot be explained by science."What does the "supernatural" have to do with this? And I agree that if you can find something evolution cannot produce, and it is characteristic of a designed system then ID gains merit."This is an argument from ignorance. If science cannot (yet?) explain this, then it must be a miracle caused by a supernatural entity."No it isn't:  http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php  /id/1159  http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php  /id/1167  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/10/dover_trial_miller_argues_from_ignorance.html  "If science can explain it and ID can also explain it, then science is preferred because ID introduces an unnecessary element. So the burden of proof is on ID to show that the extra element is necessary."And if science can't explain it?
