Nobody ever said that natural selection was random.  Straw man.  (Oh look, more misrepresentation!) The random comes in when particles of RNA that came out of the primordial ooze aligned by chance in such a way to produce a single-celled organism.  The chances of that occuring randomly are absurdly small.  If you can achieve that, life springing forth from non-life,   evolution  , at least in theory, actually holds water, though there are other problems.  The rulings of a few partisan judges do not invalidate a scientific theory any more than O.J. being set free invalidates forensics.Since your arbitrary definition of a valid definition will surely not include mine, no matter what mine may be, I'm not going to bother offering up a definition for you to reject out of hand, simply because it came from me.  (Who died and made you the definition master, anyway?)  Give me your definition, and I'll beat you on your own terms.  I believe the study mentioned above is already included in the Expert Debate section, as I seem to recall reading that on this very site.Violent Atheists are easy to find.  (see, Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin, etc.)  Though I didn't mean physically violent, but rather verbally and ideologically hateful and intolerant, the above still holds true.  Atheists are no less violent than the religious.The perception of knowledge is scary because it rules out new information.  If you think or believe that something is true, you will be willing to change what you think/believe in light of new evidence.  How can you change what you know?  If we know the Earth is flat, how can it be round?  If we know there is no god, how can there be a designer?
