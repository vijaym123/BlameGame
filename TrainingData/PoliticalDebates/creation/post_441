I understand the ad hominem approach chosen by Joe, after all, what is the alternative? Showing that ID really lives up to what Joe claims it is?--Joe GAnd again the design inference relies on observations, data, and experience. And as with all scientific inferences future research can either confirm or refute that inference.That is how science operates.---Actually the design inference relies on the absence of these to infer something they call 'design' based not upon a positive hypothesis, but rather based on an eliminative approach called the 'explanatory filter' which concludes that lacking a scientific explanation we should infer 'design' even though design cannot compete with our ignorance, and even though design still may include a natural designer such as variation and selection. In other words, ID is a placeholder where, lacking sufficient explanations, it argues, nay insists that we call it 'design' just because it looks designed. The overlap with Paley should be self evident but things get worse when ID proponents attempt to validate the approach by claiming that this is how science works.In fact, this is NOT how science works, as can be trivially shown by noticing that ID refuses to constrain its designer by such scientific approaches as used in criminology which include means, motives, opportunity, as well as eye witnesses, physical evidence and circumstantial evidences. No, ID cannot rely on such because, by relying on what science has come to identify as 'rarefied' design, it has effectively chosen an approach which cannot even compete with 'we don't know' as it provides no positive hypotheses.So let's expose the scientific vacuity of ID once again:How does ID explain the genetic code/bacterial flagella and how does its 'explanation' compares to how science explains these?The lack of explanations from ID, combined with its silly name calling, should be sufficient evidence of its scientific vacuity.
