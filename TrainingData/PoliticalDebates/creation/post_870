The scientific investigation into the question of the age of the Earth, and of the universe has been going on for hundreds of years. For the past two centuries, and with accelerating access to increasingly sophisticated and reliable methods and more data, there no longer is possible to be in denial about the results science have provided.It is also worth stressing this simple fact: This is a vast scientific field of its own, involving so much detailed knowledge that a short 'debunking statement' like the one I am responding to now, is absolutely worthless. The question is so complex that it takes a lot of study to even begin to appreciate all the facts and evidence, and to properly evaluate the validity or lack of same of the results provided by science.As a non-professional in geology, radiometric dating, dendrochronology, palaentology, glaciology and probably many other related fields of science too, I can only conclude that it is impossible for 99.99% of lay people to decide who is right or wrong regarding the question of the age of the Earth.I think it would be more fair if AiG would just say "We do not know, except we believe the Bible says the Earth is 6000 years old, and here we stand." You probably are familiar with paleontologist Kurt Wise's statement about this question, and it is my humble opinion that creationism would appear more honest and reasonable if it would adopt the same attitude: "We acknowledge the scientific data, but we stand by the Bible."After all, isn't religion about spiritual matters, man's soul, and not about the material world?
