I wouldn't just go as far to say that those in the Bible lied about the miracles Jesus performed. I would go even further and state that they never existed. The Bible has some very valuable messages but if you are referring to anything from the Gospels to support your views, I would reconsider. It is well known that these books have been meddled with by "well meaning" Christian scholars over the centuries.Strange that there are absolutely no references to Jesus from that period outside of the Bible itself... which has been, at best mistranslated and at worst completely fabricated.
