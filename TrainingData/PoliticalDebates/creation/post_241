In his latest book "Edge of Evolution" Behe attempts to define this edge by pointing to malaria as an example of a designed system in which, according to Behe, two simultaneous mutations are required, and given the estimated probabilities of 1 in 10^20, this may be quite unlikely.First of all, Behe's estimate of probabilities come from a side comment in a paper which at best ventures to guess at probabilities :--The estimates for chloroquine and artemisinin are speculative. In the former case, this assumes two events in 10 years of use with exposure of 10% of the world’s falciparum malaria (Burgess &Young 1959; Martin&Arnold1968; Looareesuwan et al. 1996; Su et al. 1997 --and ignores the relevant research that shows the gradual evolution of resistance to malaria as document in various research papers:Pooja Mittra, Sumiti Vinayak, Hina Chandawat, Manoj K.
