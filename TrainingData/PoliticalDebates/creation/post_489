First, thanks for the reply. I appreciate a good discussion like the one we're having thus far.Second, I'm not sure I follow your argument.  To say that the Discovery Institute argues this as well doesn't tell me anything about whether the argument is right or wrong, good or bad, based upon it's merits.  In addition, we're not discussing whether ID should or ought to be discussed in science classes.  We're discussing whether doing so is constitional.  There is a world of difference between what should be done/is a good idea and what is constitionally permissible.Finally, to claim that ID has no secular purposes that are not shams is quite a claim to make.  You have, by making his claim, accepted the responsibility to find every possibly secular purpose of ID and demostrate with little doubt why it is a sham.  Remember--because you claimed that no such secular purposes exist whatsoever--you must negate each and every possible and potential secular purpose to prove your point.  Good luck.
