I agree!  One of the main purposes of science is to discover truth or should be anyway.  To decide what that truth is or limit it as to what it can or cannot be before even beginning the search, defeats the purpose.  That is strange.  Why would anyone who is really interested in the truth want to do this? This point is as clear as day to most people and I believe this is why so many people favor open debate on the issue.  Only Darwinists want to censor the debate.If there can be evidence against design, then, certainly, like you said, there can be evidence for design.We need to be open to follow the evidence where ever it leads and not predetermine where it can and cannot lead us.  That is not true science.  This kind of solid logic will resonate with a lot of people and help them see through the rhetoric of the evolutionists.Good points!tj
