Obviously you haven't done much reading on the AiG website.  They often cite Hebrew scholars, have documented beliefs about Genesis during various times in church history, and address what you refer to as "Biblical scholarship."  Their website has a great search engine for anyone who really cares to find out.AiG promotes a straight forward reading of the Bible.  History (which includes Genesis 1-11) is read as history and poetry is read as poetry.  This is very natural for most people unless they have a problem with the straight forward comments.  No English translation I have used mentions a dome in Genesis 1, although the topic is discussed on their site at   http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i2/firmament.asp  .There are many ways in which the Bible is self-authenticating.  The consistency of the message (e.g. man's lostness and need for a savior), the numerous fulfilled prophecies, the multiple eyewitnesses of Christ's resurrection (who stuck by the truth of their testimony even when faced with death), and the fact that it is consistent with real life.  In the last respect, the awesome design in nature and the Bible's wisdom in human relationships are what I found most convincing.  For example, God commands that we forgive, but this makes no sense if God is not our Creator to whom we must give an account.  In psychology they have found out that forgiveness is very important to our well being.  There are other truths the Bible presents that science is catching up with too.You have failed to engage the arguments presented by AiG and failed to demonstrate that they ignore the Bible or science.
