The only thing I take issue with in this argument is the comments about Lenski's work with e. coli.  I am not a scientist, but I was able to read Lenski's paper and understand it.  The paper was SPECIFICALLY about how the mutation allowing e. coli to begin metabolizing citrase (the Cit+ mutation) was dependent on some other prior mutation(s) that opened the evolutionary pathway.  Lenski published without having identified the exact prior mutation, simply because of how exciting this result is.  Let me make this perfectly clear, in case you don't want to read Lenski's paper:  The evolution of the Cit+ e. coli required one or more mutations that may not have affected the survivability of the e. coli population.  This means that e. coli which was unable to eat citrates, mutated at least twice, changing it's chemical nanotechnology once, in a manner that may not have affected the survivability of the population, then later, a mutation allowed the bacteria to make use of an alternate food source.This experiment IS the 'smoking gun.'  We have observed evolution in the lab.  We can repeat it.  We can make predictions based on it.  Darwinian evolutionary science does not explain design, because it was never meant to.  It explains exactly what we see, in the fossil record, in our own DNA, and now, in the lab:  Small inheritable random variations accumulate over vast numbers of generations to modify organisms, raising the possibility of their gene's survival to the maximum.
