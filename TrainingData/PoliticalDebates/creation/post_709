Creationist want God to be both all powerful and outside the physical forces he supposedly created. They never realize that to participate in "our" reality he would have had to relinquish his "outside sphere. Creationists want the   bible   to be the literal word of   god   but anytime a contradiction is brought up it gets attributed to the human scribes. Couldn't a god find better help, or even give a quick proofread of what he dictated. The real question is why didn't he just write it himself instead of depending on people who make mistakes.Finally, they want God to be so mysterious that no one can understand him. Yet they fail to see how futile their own beliefs are based upon a being that they cannot understand and then expect everyone else to accept what must be a human interpretation of a divine mystery, which in the end can be understood by no one.Personally, I think you can believe what you want but it is very foolish to try and find some kind of scientific backing for these religious belief and mysteries. You either have   faith   or you don't. Science can't help you with your faith, since it is by nature the antithesis of faith.
