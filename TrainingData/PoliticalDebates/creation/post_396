--PaulUnfortunately, a review of the entire corpus of actual scientific journal articles reveals an inconvenient truth: The so-called empirical scientific truths of intelligent design creationism seem to be entirely missing.---Of course, since ID makes no scientifically relevant positive predictions relevant to intelligent design, it is not surprising that the 'best' of ID is still ranking as mediocre in science. I'd love to discuss with some ID proponents what they consider to be ID's most impressive contribution to the cause.
