"The debate here is false, because both ID and Darwinian/natural selection theory are inadequate."Whether or not the Theory of Evolution is "inadequate" is not an issue.  The question is: Is it scientific?  Does it have a scientific mechanism that could explain and predict the "tree of life"?But there is no "Theory of Intelligent Design" and it can never be scientific.The overall question is: Does intelligent design have merit?  The obvious answer is no - because it explains everything (every living thing is designed?) and yet it does not have any kind of scientific "mechanism" (like mutation and natural selection) that could ever actually explain anything.
