Many people claim that certain writings are the Word of God.The Samaritans believe that their version of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy is the Word of God.Jews believe that the Masoretic text is the written Word of God. Protestant Christians add the 27 books of the New Testament to the Hebrew scriptures and believe that this is the Word of God.Catholics add to this the Apocrypha and believe that this is the Word of God.Orthodox Christians add to this some other material and believe that this is the Word of God.Muslims regard the above scriptures as corrupted and accept the Qur'an as the true Word of God.The prophet Jeremiah said, ""How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie." (Jeremiah 8:8, English Standard Version).It is impossible to know which, if any, of these contradictory opinions is true. The fact that people believe that they are right proves nothing.
