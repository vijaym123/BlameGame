What I desire to beleive is totally irrelevant. If desire guided my beliefs, I would be not only a supporter of Intelligent Design, but a young Earth Creationist and a fundamentalist Christian. But I'm not because my eyes were opened to the falsehood of those positions and that realization plunged me into a deep sense of grief at having been lied to and manipulated by promoters of bigoted dogmas. I think is it absolutly shameful for anyone to imply that my position is fanatical because I WANT to be the supreme intelligence in my universe. That is such a blatantly dishonest and ignorant strawman that I am amazed that it was even put out here.In short, not one word of Allogic's statement rings true to me.
