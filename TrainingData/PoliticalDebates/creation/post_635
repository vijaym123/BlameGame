Jon Buell, the president of the Foundation for Thought and Ethics testified in court, enjoy--BY MR. ROTHSCHILD:Q Mr. Buell, do you recognize the document I've given you, which is the second exhibit today, a Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax for 2003 to be a document filed by the Foundation?A Yes, I do.Q Okay. And if you could turn to the last page of that exhibit. Are you on that page?A I am.Q And if you go about 60 percent down the page, there's an entry for Statement of Organization's Primary Exempt Purpose.A Um-hum, um-hum.Q And the explanation that the Foundation provides to the IRS is that its primary exempt purpose is promoting and publishing textbooks presenting a Christian perspective, isn't that right?A That's what it says.Q Okay. And Pandas is one of those publications, isn't it?A No, Pandas doesn't fit this because this is not an accurate statement.Q Okay. This --A This statement was -- we had a new CP A do our 990 and audit we had never used before. He wasn't even from the state of Texas. He was not familiar with us. You know, I neither saw that statement, nobody gave him that information, and I didn't -- I certainly didn't approve it.Q Okay. So -- and so this statement that's filed with the IRS so that the Foundation can be exempt from paying income tax is false; is that what you're saying?A Well, I'm saying that I didn't see that statement.Q And just if you could turn to the preceding page of the document, those are your initials on the page, aren't they, towards the bottom of the page?A Yes.--
