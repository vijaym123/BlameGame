#originalTopic=Debate:_Creationism_vs_evolution_in_schools
Teaching evolution exclusively is dangerous to science and reason. To exclude a set of ideas a priori is to potentially exclude the truth. Thus, as a matter of principle, science should not be constrained to a single set of ideas.  Creationists argue that both sides should be taught.  Evolutionists, on the other hand, limit the scope of science to a narrow acceptance of just one theory.  Thus, to teach evolution exclusively is to promote limitations on the power of scientific inquiry.  To teach creationism along side evolutionism is to promote open scientific inquiry and critical thought.
