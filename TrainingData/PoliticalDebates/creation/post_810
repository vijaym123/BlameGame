The notion that science "assume{s} that their(sic) is no creator and then prove it" is plainly ridiculous.By "consistant" we mean that the behavior of the universe cannot vary without some physical manifestation. By rational we mean that the order of the universe is discernable. This is entirely within the edict of Scripture.You pretend to have "a list of scientific assumptions a mile lone(sic)."So, your first effort was a flop. How about making the next "mile."
