The only way that design could be detected in nature is if there were objects around that weren't designed. Otherwise,there wouldn't be any way of telling the difference. But Christianity and other theistic religions maintain that God created heaven and earth, in other words, everything. It follows that absolutely everything was designed and there is no way of singling out living things as more designed than anything else.Bzzzt! Thanks for playing.
