Anybody that thinks there is currently a "healthy scientific debate" over "Intelligent Design" has missed the history of the last 150 years. It has been known scientifically and popularly since Charles Darwin's day that   evolution   truly happened, as surely as gravity.Only the fools remain to discuss their contrived alternatives. Richards is a PhD? In what, I wonder. He would be an utter failure as a biologist.
