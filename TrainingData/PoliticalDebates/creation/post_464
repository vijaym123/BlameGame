Yes, you are right.  My bad.  His name is Sternberg, not Stenberg.  The government report on the issue validates the charges against the Smithsonian Institute. Paper victory:  A congressional committee found evidence for harassment and discrimination by the Smithsonian against Dr. Richard Sternberg, who had allowed publication of a pro-ID paper in a Smithsonian journal (see Evolution News).  The report listed numerous examples of spying, plotting, lying, scheming and creating a hostile environment against Dr. Sternberg by Smithsonian staff with the NCSEÕs help.  Few regular citizens even know that this report exists though and no action or fine was put on the Institution or the NCSE for their role in this harrassment.  If you want to look at the report for yourself, here is a link to it:     http://www.richardsternberg.org/smithsonian.php     But it seems like you have already read this.You may be right about him not losing his job.  I'll back off what I said until I can verify it with Sternberg himself.   The point is, they made his life miserable, started a smear campaign, tried to ruin his reputation, and tried to make life so miserable for him that he would resign.  They succeeded and they were not punished for this at all.  Apparently all is fair in the evolution/ID war.  They wanted to make it clear that this kind of an article is never to be published by any kind of reputable science magazine.  Then they claim that ID scientists haven't published any articles to prove their point that it is not good science.  Go figure.Now, we all know that some articles have been published, but very few and the Sternberg controversy shows why the numbers of articles that have been published is so few.Thanks for pointing out my errors!tj
