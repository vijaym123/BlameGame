1. Why is the earth the only planet that is sustainable for life forms?2. Assuming you believe in the big bang theory, what caused the big bang to occur?3. What is the purpose of life, is it just to be and then not to be?4. Is this all there is in life? Bummer5. Since people are all so different why arent we seeing planets with other types of life forms?6. How do you explain archeological finds that validate Hebrew Biblical writings regarding Gd, Jesus, and then nullify it in the same sentence?7. If the Bible is correct and one day is as a thousand to Gd is it possible that earth was formed in over a period of 6,000 years or 6 days in heaven...because as you know the farther away from earth you get the shorter time is...you did know that right?
