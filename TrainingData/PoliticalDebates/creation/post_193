Perhaps the author can explain why, of all of the thousands of researchers in geology, biology (particularly evolutionary biologists), and paleontology.. in other words the people who are truly eperts in this area.... no more than a very tiny minority support ID. Why so much emphasis on the fossil record, and little reference to what DNA tells us?And, if a common ancestor is not incompatible with ID, then why is evolution incompatible with the concept of God? Couldn't God have created the evolutionary process as his way of propagating life? Fundamental religious people often blindly call on faith to explain difficult or even paradoxical concepts (why do children die?). They appeal to God's mysterious ways, and cite mankind's hubris in attempting a rational explanation. But in the case of evolution, they turn around and claim to know that God does not favor this particular format for the creation of life. Presumably this is because the Bible provides evidence to the contrary. But now we hear that the Bible is subject to interpretation, as, instead of a 7 day process, the creation of life was done over eons, with new forms appearing spontaneously. Do you believe in the Bible literally, or do you not? And if not, how can you use it to support ID?
