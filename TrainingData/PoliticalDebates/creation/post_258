"So are we asking if a telic force exists or are we trying to psychoanalyze the intentions behind it?"Why are these two questions always independent?  I would think that any theory of ID that made no attempt to identify and analyze the designer was an incomplete theory.  Also, wouldn't a clear theory on the designer (intentions and methods) be very useful in determining what aspects of the biological world were designed, why they were designed that way, and which were evolved.
