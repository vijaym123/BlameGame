for educating us about the immense scientific amount of information that seldomly gets disseminated when ID proponents claim that 'x' could not have evolved. It's this lack of sufficient familiarity with the prevailing knowledge which has rendered ID so meaningless. Whether it is the poor scholarship by Wells or the meaningless arguments by Behe, they all seem to come down to a similar commonality: a lack of full understanding of the scientific knowledge and evidence.How does ID explain the malaria resistance or the bacterial flagellum? We already know how poorly ID has done with the flagellum, now that science keeps unraveling facts in support of predictions made several years earlier by Nick Matzke.
