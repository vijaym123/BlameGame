As I said earlier experience demonstrates that it matters a great deal to an investigation whether or not that which is being investigated occurred via agency involvement or by nature, operating freely.There is just no getting around that fact.As for the "bait and switch"- that would be you. Who else would say "we don't know" and then allow the teaching of the "no design allowed" position?"We don't know but we do know a designer wasn't involved."
