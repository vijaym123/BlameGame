I apologise for the personal slant to the first part of my first question, it was meant to be rhetorical.From your further answer I take it that you a) have read other books.b) Have no evidence outside a single source.You say "As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself. Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?"That is such a naive statement that I am staggered.1. "Since God cannot lie"  So God is not all powerful ? Surely an omnipotent deity can do anything ?2. Even if you are correct, men can lie.  A man could quite easily write a book that says this is the word of God and be lying.If I found a book describing a conflict between the Dark Lord Sauron, (who created a magical ring) and the inhabitants of middle earth.  If this book ended with "This volume is true and was written whilst under divine inspiration of the one true God."  Would you believe it ?
