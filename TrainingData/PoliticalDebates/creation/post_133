very well said.  The arrogance factor is always obvious. The entire act of presuming you know anything for sure is not scientific... Their bias reveals them - and admittedly that happens on both sides.  I don't believe a true 'scientist' exists... because no matter who you are, you are inevitably proving nothing but your world view.
