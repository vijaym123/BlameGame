The only assuption we make in science is that the nature of the universe is consistant and rational. The current estimate of the age of the universe is totally in accord with this minimal assuption.True, the universe could be insane. This is one of the questions posed by Rene Descartes in his 1644 work, Principles of Philosophy (Principia philosophiae). I find that Descartes was congruent with the Bible that the universe is indeed coherent.
