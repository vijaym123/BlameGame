Intelligent design might be a seasoned exercise in rationalization, but the claim that it is a "science" cannot be supported.  If anything can be said to characterize science, it is a profound skepticism and hard-nosed objectivity in seeking to disprove conjectures, ruling out all other possibilities before making any claim of finding "the truth".  By contrast, Intelligent Design seeks only to rationalized the observable world with the belief in an intelligent creator.  Devotees of Intelligent Design may be intelligent, rational, disciplined thinkers, but they are not doing science.
