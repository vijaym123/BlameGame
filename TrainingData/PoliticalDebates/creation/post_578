--CaseyLate last night I posted my final rebuttals to the NCSE on OpposingViews.com. This makes 12 total rebuttals for the pro-ID side and zero for the anti-ID side (though Americans United did post a sur-rebuttal tellingly titled “You Lost the Case -- Get Over It”). ---Over 375 comments, mostly showing the vacuity of ID, the NCSE need not respond. Casey's description of the NCSE's position is as usual full of empty accusations and yet fail to address the simple fact thatID is scientifically vacuous.Casey's response shows the full extent of the self deception and appeal to fallacies.Sad really but par for the course.Nuff said
