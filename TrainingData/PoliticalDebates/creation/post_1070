#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 What I feel in this context is creationism is nothing but a wrong assumption. Generally there are many supporters existing for the creationism but they are just living life in their own utopia. They should be guided right now. Normally we can find that many of them think this only for what the Bible says. Apart from this, a person who does not know science or evolution of life tends to believe that creationism is true. Sometimes, people think that creationism is science. According to the Bible, earth is flat but no one would believe this. If people trust Bible blindly then why do they not believe each and every theory said by Bible? My suggestion is to forget those things written long years ago without any logical approach. Modern science accelerated our life and we should respect the logical views without being driven by the blind dependence.
