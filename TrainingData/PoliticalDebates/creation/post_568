"How are they standing in the way? Is research into ID banned?"Pretty much, especially if anyone who has publically known pro-ID views prior to getting tenure is bound to not get it. "ID proponents are free to conduct as much research as they want,"If that were true then why (as an example) was Robert J. Marks asked to return grant   money   the moment he started a lab related to ID?"their proof has yet to reach the level or proof that Evolution has..."Can you give me an overview of that proof please? I keep hearing of it, but no one seems willing to describe it. "and so it the theory of ID has yet to reach popular acceptance."So all I have to do is show that ID explains the workings of many features of the natural world and they'll be free to do their research?"And doesn't ID have it's own host of holes?"Name some."What predictions can be made using the theory of ID?"This gives a good overview:  http://www.researchid.org/wiki/Main_Page  And here's some specifics:  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/08/function_for_endogenous_retrov.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/05/another_intelligent_design_pre.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/06/wired_magazine_unashamedly_mix.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/06/darwinist_misrepresents_guille.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/05/biologists_report_important_ge.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/what_is_wrong_with_sobers_atta_1.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/followup_on_junkdna.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/10/response_to_barbara_forrests_k_7.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/murphys_law_any_objections_to_1.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/intelligent_design_is_empirica.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/05/biologists_report_important_ge.html  If you'd like, I can also go into failed predictions from the current paradigm. "Can the designers next actions be determined?"We can detect them once they happen, which is all ID is claiming to be able to do in that respect."A much more accurate description is that a series of chemical reactions took place in the oceans of the world that led to the   creation   of increasingly complex chemical structures." Probably weren't biologically relevant though (unless agency intervened)."This led to the appearance of the very first forms of life... which were vastly simpler then even the most basic of cells."Explain how you could have "life" that happens to be even simpler than the most basic of cells.
