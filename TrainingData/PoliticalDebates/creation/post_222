"I assert that they have been heard and their arguments have been refuted and thus they are legitimately ignored until they come up with some actual scientific evidence and arguments."At least Luskin actually provide something to back up his "asserts." "Well, it has not happened in the last 20 years - why should there be the slightest chance that this non-scientific nonsense will "encourage" "new avenues" of scientific research in the future?"Actually..............   http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/06/more_similarities_between_flag.html      http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/biology_replaces_technology_as.html      http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/10/video_molecular_machines_and_t.html   ....so therefore there is pretty good reason to assume that it will. "And, if this is the actual goal of "   intelligent design   ", why is there such an emphasis on trying to get this nonsense introduced into the public high school classroom?"Ummm, I'm pretty sure if the goal of ID is to encourage new avenues of research (which you say is the goal of ID), then it definitely has it's place in the classroom. "This number seems to be in error by a factor of a trillion or so. What fool wants credit for this sentence? :-)"Where in the article you're commenting on does it use that value?"So what? 3 billion years of evolution is a loooong time."Yeah, though the debate is whether it's long enough. "The universe that we can see so far is quite simple."Yes, in a sense. Though no one can argue the laws have no structure. "It's only the evolved life forms on this Earth that appear to be complex."Not to mention the earth which sustains them."It is amazing that evolving DNA with only 4 components can produce such a complexity of life, but it obviously has, so there's no need to claim that this is "stunning"."If it didn't happen by unguided forces, then yes it is.    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/09/leading_origin_of_life_researc.html   "And even if it was "stunning", that is a meaningless adjective with respect to the discussion of the nonsense that is "intelligent design"."What "nonsense?"
