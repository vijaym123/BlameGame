The reason for the existence of the second amendment is to prevent religious people from being denied the opportunity to practice their religion.  It is also designed to prevent people from being forced to practice a religion.  These are worthy reasons for the second amendment.  However, not a single person will be prevented from practicing or will be forced to practice a religion if ID is taught in schools.  Therefore, the reasons for the second amendment are not applicable to the teaching of ID.  There is no scientific evidence that atheist students suffer mental health complications as a result of being exposed to Intelligent Design, nor evidence that their or their parent's ability to vote how they wish will be affected.  There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that harm is caused to anyone after repeated exposure to Intelligent Design.  The hypothesis that people's rights will be violated and/or harm will be caused is not supported in any peer-reviewed journals (and we all know that if it ain't in peer-reviewed journals, then it should not be believed).
