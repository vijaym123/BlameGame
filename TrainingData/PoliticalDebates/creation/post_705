“it's not that cut and dried.. some things were meant to be literal - others.. clearly not.”How can you objectively determine which things are to be taken literally and which are not?“Revelations is an example where clearly symbolism is used. No fundamental christian could discount that symbolism is used alot... and metaphors.. and analogies...and parables.. etc. etc.”Why is Revelations ‘clearly symbolism’ when the parts about burning bushes and massive floods are not?  Many fundamentalists take Revelations as being the literal truth, how do you demonstrate that they are wrong.  More importantly, how can a third party determine which view is correct? “So that leads us to the conclusion that you can't rule out symbolism in any other passage.”Yet there are those who take the entire Bible as the literal truth… that there is no symbolism present.  How can the literal and symbolic parts be objectively  verified?“ - so really the question comes down to 'If you feel the Bible was divine in origin.. do you feel 6 day creation was meant literally'. -and really - I assume it was meant literal.. largely based on the reference to 'evening and morning' repeatedly.”And for those who do not find the Bible to be of divine origin?  I’ll grant you that from a Christian perspective it claiming that the Bible is of divine origin is an important part of the Christian faith… But the same does not hold for those who are not Christian.“each section has to be interpreted individually for it's given intent... it's simply not an 'all or nothing'.. either literal or metaphor concept.. a full understanding is necessary.”At what objective point is ‘full understanding’ reached?  How can intent be objectively verified?
