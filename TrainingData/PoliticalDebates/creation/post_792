I don't see what is so hard about it. I will start be quoting a bible verse.I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me? Jeremiah 32:27Now one has ever convinced me that I should take anything other than the literal view of the bible.  If you truly want to find a great relationship with God, just believe Him.The root of the problem has to do with your view of God.  Is He a weak God, or is He a God who can do anything. There is not good reason to believe otherwise.Flip
