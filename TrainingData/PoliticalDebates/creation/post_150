The response to my comment ID Contradicts Itself is a series of peculiarly unclear assertions. For example, the responder declares: --- "We need not "know" the intelligence to draw inferences about it's existence because that's not what ID studies. ID studies the FEATURES that are best traced to an intelligence; not the intelligence itself."---Such an assertion presupposes that (1) the "features" exists separate from the entity, and that (2) the features are expressions of some intelligence one supposes exists. This is a logical fallacy. It assumes the prior existence of a thing whose features one is allegedly studying while declaring one is "tracing" them to some intelligence, which one denies one knows. The responder is dealing in word salads, i.e., formulating arguments that float without reference to reality. This approach permeates the responder's entire post. As such, it's not worth rebutting.
