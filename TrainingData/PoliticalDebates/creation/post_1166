 And what proof do you have for intelligent design?  /   /> Microevolution is indisputable. The evidence is clear.  /> Moving on...  />   /> As for macroevolution, most of you clearly don't fully understand evolution. You wouldn't have a semi-formed liver. You'd have an organ with a similar function that would gradually gain and lose attributes until it turned into a liver.  /> Any of you who are thinking that natural selection doesn't explain it, natural selection isn't all there is to evolution. Genetic drift and mutations also function in, among other things.  /> Also, most scientists no longer believe that we evolved from cavemen or whatever. They evolved from a common source and we took over their lands.  /> The theory of evolution has been refined since Darwin, and is still being refined today.  /> Yes, we did evolve out of animals that evolved out of single celled organisms. We in fact ARE animals.  /> By The Way, exactly how many of you paid attention in life science/ biology class?  />   /> One question to all you people arguing intelligent design that's always confused me: Who created the 'creator'?
