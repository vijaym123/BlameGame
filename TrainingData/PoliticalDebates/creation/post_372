Why are you claiming one designer? There's just as much evidence for a pantheon as there is a monotheistic god, but you have the prior assumption the designer is your god and automatically rule them out when you say "the" designer.You also don't bear into account other possibilities: the designer left, the designer actually meant for some other creature to rise into power (plausible, since we live on a planet 75% water and yet do not have gills,) or the designer is not omnipotent or omniscient and cannot travel back in time. These are not disprovable by the rules you've laid out as your "proof" for ID.You are not claiming "intelligent design" as much as you are "one being outside the rules of physics who is capable of time travel and travel throughout the universe, who for some unknown reason remains invested in one planet of the creation he/she/it made." Which sounds like the Abrahamic god, which means your "designer" claim is, in fact, a way to slide your narrowly defined god into science through the back door.
