When there was a move to distribute "Unlocking the Mystery of Life" DVD to Australian schools, a few worried scientists headed by Michael Archer from UNSW, got together and signed a letter "on behalf of 60,000 scientists and educators". The headlines "60000 Scientists reject ID". There were only 12 signatures on the letter and NO ONE IN ANY OF THE ORGANISATIONS HAD BEEN ASKED THEIR VIEWS.The good think about being in a position of power is that you can speak for others instead of actually informing them and asking them to speak for themselves.To comment on whether ID has merit or not, it is minimally necessary that people be properly informed of the arguments involved. Instead of informing us, the NCSE keeps telling us "ID is religion" and "Scientists think ID is silly". How about engaging with the arguments.
