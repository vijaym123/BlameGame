"Teachers have no freedom to misinform and miseducate students." There is no proof of either side in this issue. Where is the missing link? Teachers should be teaching both sides and presenting only facts that are able to be proven. We have no proof that evolution really happened as we have no proof that ID never happened. Remember that Darwin was a true racist. Read "Origin of the species" He claims that the Irish are the bottom of the evolutionary food chain. I guess teachers have the right to teach the ravings of a racist if it fits their needs.
