--SChen24--1. Secular Purpose. Note that this calls for the statute to have a secular purpose. It does not ban the statute from having a religious purpose, it merely requires a secular one. Does teaching/discussing ID have a secular purpose? It has many. For example, discussing ID can help students expand horizons. It teaches students to think critically. There are many others. I remember in the eighth grade, when we had to learn about the Moon Hoax as a part of science class. Whether it was right or wrong, whether it was wise to teach it, is all up for debate. But it IS constitutional to discuss it in science class.--That is exactly what the DI tried to argue, that ID has some secular purpose. But SChen forgot an important part 'that is not a sham', and thus while talking about ID as a bad example of science is hardly unconstitutional or enforcable, ID itself is not to be discussed as part of the curriculum in a science class.ID has NO secular purposes that are not shams, the judge realized this and ruled appropriately.
