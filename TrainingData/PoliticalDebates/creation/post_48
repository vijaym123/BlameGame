PvM wrote: However this is false and misleading. First of all it is important to point out that by design, ID means the "set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity or chance". Now what does this mean? This means that when science fails to have found an explanation for any particular system, ID argues that the default should not be "we don't know" but rather "design". This is false and misleading.  ID does not attempt to fill gaps in science, it looks at the same evidence produced by science (eg, the mechanics of molecular biology) and draws an inference different from folks like PvM.  ID sees a complex system which  contains inter-dependent parts, assembled in a highly specific way, does the math on probability this arrangement could arise by chance and concludes the system is designed.  Period.  No god, no gap filling.I invite PvM to cite any leading ID theorist filling gaps in scientific knowledge with ID, as claimed above.  Just one.
