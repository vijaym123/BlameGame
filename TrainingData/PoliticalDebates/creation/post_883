AFAIK, the languages of Genesis are Hebrew and Aramaic. Both of these have continuous spoken traditions. I'm not sure that you are making your point very well.AiG's point that 'yom' means a common sense day in Genesis 1 is valid. Certainly the Mosaic author of Exodus understood it that way when he used it to justify the creation of a 7 day week and day of rest.
