--Joe GNow you are just lying. I have stated that ID relies on our experience, which means it does NOT rely on our ignorance.--What experience do we have with bacterial flagella and the genetic code? Other than that there is a superficial similarity with outboard engines and 'computer code'. Claims of positive experience when inferring design may be valid with ordinary design, which is how real science infers design and agency, but said method is woefully flawed when it comes to 'rarefied' design for which we have no experience.Now, there is nothing wrong with using the concept of design with formulating hypotheses. After all, the heart was historically seen as a pump, leading science to proceed in a fruitful area. But here we should not conflate the usefulness with a scientific necessity or relevance.
