I would if I could.  My grounds for objection are very simple:  This is not an argument.The whole post from Mr Behe can be boiled down to, "since things are complex, they must be designed."In another post I said that ID wasn't a theory, it was an untested hypothesis.  It seems I was giving it too much credit.  It's an unfinished hypothesis.What features of the complexity of the cell points to intelligent design?  How does the complexity of the cell point to intelligent design?  These are the kinds of questions you should be answering with this argument.  Please, someone object to this argument, or give me the ability to do so.
