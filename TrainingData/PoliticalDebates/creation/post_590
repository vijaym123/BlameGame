"Creationism has more solid evidence than   evolution   does."Actually no it does not... the proof for evolution is quite strong in that 1) we can observe it occuring 2) the fossil record shows changes in lifeforms separated by time 3) genetic analysis shows similarities at the DNA level between similar lifeforms."I hope I am not being offensive or rude with my statements, I just wish to state what I believe is the truth."What we believe is true is quite separate from what we can scientifically demonstrate is true."Anyway, evolution is the only theory being taught in our schools and the evidence backing it up either has a probailty that is beyond scientific verification or it has already been proven wrong and is stilling being taught."The only places that it has ever been 'proven' wrong are in creationist literature... never in a reputable scientific study or journal."It does require faith to believe in God because He is greater than anything conceived on the earth."I completely agree with you, but faith is not evidence."Nevertheless, there is evidence for creation such as the grand canyon, or the utter complexity of the universe which all scientists are well aware of."The Grand Canyon?  The evidence for a creationist origin of the Grand Canyon is unbelievably flimsy, and is based on assumptions that are not close to scientifically valid.  The same goes for the complexity of the universe... complexity does not require intelligence."If we're choosing what is taught in our schools based on the evidence that bakcs it up, than maybe we should also be reconsidering evolution since it is not scientifically valid."Evolution, though not a perfect picture, comes far closer then any creationist or ID theories in explaining the diversity of life we see around us./r
