#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 Amusing, is all I can really say to cancer11's response. By questions such as 'can you make the sun shine on your own?' are you implying that the only reason for such a thing to happen is that God made it so? Do you require a proper scientific answer to that question?   /> I think the entire idea of creationism has gotten dearly out of hand. With science advancing so far it's strange to hear that people think, for example, that a God randomly, without any particular reason whatsoever, created the universe and everything in it. There are so many illogical flaws in that theory, it's unbelievable. Who would have thought that such a belief could spread so far?
