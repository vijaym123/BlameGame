actually I'm not simply looking backwards... I'm looking at it statistically.. in the case of the moon it is not only a necessity for life - the eclipse that I've mentioned is statistically ridiculous.  You say is it 'extremely unlikely'... no... that is putting it ungodly lightly.  If you look at it as simply being 'improbable' but so what.... then that's your choice.   We have no real choice but to 'look backwards' - so in other words any evidence is not evidence for you.  DNA could be called 'highly unlikely'.. and so could matter spewing out and forming entire universes..... this is 'the gamblers fallacy'.  If you simply think that all the species of life and the universe itself is no more than a very lucky flipping of infinite coins... be my guest - but the reasoning is not sound.
