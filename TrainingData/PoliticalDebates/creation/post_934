When there is clear and overwhelming proof that evolution is the process by which life has developed on earth, it is painfully stupid to believe that the earth was created as it is now 6000 years ago by a magical man in the sky. Citing the bible or any other religious text as proof to the contrary is akin to citing Aesop's fables as proof for talking animals.
