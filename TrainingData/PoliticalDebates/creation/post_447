You're right, much if not all of the claims about "supernatural claims/premises of ID make it invalid" rest on some faulty views on what supernatural actually means. My main criticism of anyone who tries to disqualify ID from science (because it has the implication that supernatural forces might exist) is that they usually fail to make the distinction between the IMPLICATIONS of a theory and the EVIDENCE for a theory. It wouldn't matter if the force behind design is a supernatural entity because if we make those conclusions based on what we OBSERVE in physics or biological systems then we can safely say it's testable. If we applied the same standard that critics of ID are applying to everything else in science, then we may as well conclude the big bang isn't science (since that has supernatural implications of a first cause).
