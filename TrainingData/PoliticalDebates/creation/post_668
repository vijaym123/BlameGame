--It is entirely misleading to imply that "Academic Freedom is gives license to Present Non-Science, like ID"These academic freedom bills, which typically work in conjunction with the science standards are written to strictly prohibit the teaching of religion, creationism, “creation science”, “creation facts”, and ID.--Indeed, they are, lacking any scientific content of ID, quite the same. The history of ID, via the Wedge Document, and the seminal work of Barbara Forrest and Paul R Gross titled "Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design" should be an addition to anyone's library. See for more information     http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com    /--Island--This kind of stereotypically predictable reaction-ism, and the ideologically distorted half-truths or blatant lies that go with it, are the reason why I’ve started this very incomplete list for the next academic freedom go-round in Florida.--You may be too harsh towards ID proponents. As I and others have, quite convincingly I would argue, shown, the right to speak is not a right to be heard. Certainly, there is no compelling reason why ID has earned a right to be heard in science classes, not because it is religiously motivated, that seems self evident, but rather because it has no scientific content.As to ID's claims against evolutionary theory, Nick Matzke is doing a fine job at exposing how ignorance or avoidance of scientific research can lead one to make some very silly claims about what evolution can and cannot do. For an even more chilling example, I suggest one reads Wells' "Icons of Evolution" and then the scientific reality as documented by the NCSE    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells    /claims of academic freedom to attempt to get scientifically vacuous ideas introduced into our schools' curricula should be rejected by anyone interested in the future of education in this country.
