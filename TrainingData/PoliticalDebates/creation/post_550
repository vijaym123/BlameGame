Is good science a 'liberal' theme? If you love true science, you must be a liberalYou are in good company but remember that good science, including evolutionary science knows no boundaries, Christians, republicans, democrats and independents all accept the facts of science, of course given the historical link between evangelicals and republicans we do observe a stronger lack of understanding of science amongst some who also happen to be republicans but do not confuse cause and effect here.
