To those unfamiliar with Nick Matzke, he was one of the (many) instrumental contributors to the success of the Kitzmiller v Dover ruling, as part of the plaintiffs' team. Not only has Nick contributed significantly to the unraveling of Behe's 'flagellum must have been designed' argument but he has also shown the evolution of ID from "creationist" via the intermediate fossil "cdesign proponentsist" to "design proponent". In fact, thanks to Nick Matzke and the plaintiffs' team, Behe's testimony during the Kitzmiller trials became useful evidence for the plaintiffs and the judge quoted extensively from Behe's testimony in his final ruling to show not only why the school board was motivated by religion but also that ID fails to be scientifically relevant.And of course, Nick has always been at the frontline of defending scientific competence and accuracy.
