"And it never has and never will. So, irrelevant nonsense."And it has, and always will. So therefore, relevant perspective.  http://biologicinstitute.org/2008/10/17/the-genius-behind-the-ingenious  /  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/11/biologic_explores_the_successe.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/09/as_engineers_turn_to_marine_bi.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/03/engineers_improve_human_techno.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/08/the_human_eye_is_so_poorly_des.html   "Nope. Your ignorance is abysmal.  http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/exploring-the-o.html  "Speak for yourself. In order to explain how RNA could have been the prime starter for the origin of life you must explain how all four nucleotide bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, uracil), the five-carbon sugar ribose, and a phosphate group could have formed in the same primordial soup when all six of those things develop under completely DIFFERENT chemical conditions. It would be like baking a cake by manufacturing the flower, eggs, sugar, yeast, etc. in the exact same bowl. It can't happen:  http://www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/rnaworld171.htm    http://www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/ribo171.htm    And let's not forget the dreaded Spiegelman monster:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman_Monster  "Nope - it's well-founded speculation. See above."After seeing the above, I must ask: well-founded on what?BTW: Should we stick to cellular origins for now?
