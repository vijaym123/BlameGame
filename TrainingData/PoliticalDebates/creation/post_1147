 There's really no way yet to prove it, BUT the precedence of the evolution of all other species including our own has led to a conclusion that we MOST LIKELY came from something else. We have evolved over the years, but what we started out as is still a mystery because we have no proof yet to claim evidence of our beginnings either way (creation or evolution).
