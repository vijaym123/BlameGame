--TJ10The government report on the issue validates the charges against the Smithsonian Institute. --In fact, the report shows exactly what Schloss reported. Seems that few people have actually read the report which includes the actual emails on which the report relied.TJ10, lacking in accuracy in his previous posting, is not holding back--TJ10The point is, they made his life miserable, started a smear campaign, tried to ruin his reputation, and tried to make life so miserable for him that he would resign.--Again not supported by the facts.Why is it that ID proponents tend to be so sloppy with  facts? I can understand that if one relies on ID sources for one's story, one may indeed be led to believe these 'facts' but with all the primary sources so readily available, there is no excuse for relying on 'hearsay'. Especially when some ID proponents have such a poor record in presenting the full story.
