PvM is confused.The design inference reached based on our knowledge of what nature, operating freely can & cannot do, coupled with our knowledge of what designing agencies can do.And as with ALL scientific inferences further research can either confirm or refute that inference.Also if we truly "do not know" then it is a miscarriage of science to disallow the design inference just because some people would rather stick with the "chance & necessity" diatribe.
