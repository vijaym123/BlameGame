"Why are these two questions always independent?"Because   science   as we know it today can only answer one of them."I would think that any theory of ID that made no attempt to identify and analyze the designer was an incomplete theory."I would think not, since ID only tries to identify the features of the natural world which are designed... and nothing more. Asking questions about the designer are separate from determining if something was planned or not. "Also, wouldn't a clear theory on the designer (intentions and methods) be very useful in determining what aspects of the biological world were designed, why they were designed that way, and which were evolved."Maybe, but those questions can be inferred without knowledge of intentions and methods.
