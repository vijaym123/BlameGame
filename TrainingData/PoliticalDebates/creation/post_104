currently   science   feels it's accelerating... and considering the '13.7 billion years' it's been doing so.. I don't anticipate any collapse...  why would it still be accelerating?the Bible mentions a hint -- 11 times even in 5 chapters... God 'stretched' out the heavens.  Funny how the expansion of the universe is biblical.. yet we have only recently discovered it... but of course - presuming we have a creator can't contribute anything to science! right?  How would we know... so few try.
