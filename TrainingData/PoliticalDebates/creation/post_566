"TODAY, one of the fundamental goals of scientists studying the theory of   evolution   is to figure out how life on Earth began."-Livvy     The origins of life are the focus of a great deal of study, but it focuses more on biochemistry then evolutionary biology, as there was nothing to evolve before the first cells existed."The   media   touts ID as creationism, while most universities do not support curriculum questioning the theory of evolution. In fact, since the fairly recent inception of ID, numerous teachers, professors, and academic officials have lost funding, or even their tenure, for   teaching   ID in their lectures."-LivvyThe theory that a supernatural entity created life on Terra seems very close to creationism to me... and since the theory has so little backing I would not expect it to be taught as though it were an accepted theory."A principle that states "one should not increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything" is a flawed argument, because the Theory of Evolution does not completely explain what scientists are looking for."-LivvyScientists may not yet have built a perfect picture of how life evolved, but the theory accurately describes what we observer, and allows for predictions to be made regarding what will occur to a species over time.  Every time a new fossil is discovered another hole fills in... do we really need to revise our entire world view on nothing more then some missing bones?"Evolution doesn't do a good job at describing what we see around us. We've never seen any evidence that one species can change into a completely different species."-LivvyExcept for in the fossil record, where transitional elements are quite prominent."When tigers and lions mate, when donkey's and horses mate, their offspring has always been 100% sterile this goes for all other attempted inter-special reproduction."-LivvyInterspecies mating?  New species usually evolve from existing populations due to   genetic   changes over vast time scales, not from the mating of two separate species."Proponents of evolution always bring up archaeopteryx as the missing link - but really all it proves is that there used to be a feathered dinosaur crittering around the Earth that's now extinct."-LivvyYet there are no birds before the archaeoperyx, and after the archaeoperyx the birds begin to appear.... how does ID explain that?  What reason is given for the appearance of birds after the appearance of bird like dinosaurs (which were not lizards)?
