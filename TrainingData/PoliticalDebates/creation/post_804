AiG argues that pretexts brought by the reader are to blame for difficulties accepting The Bible as literal truth.  But, since The Bible is rendered as a text written in human language, it cannot be entirely self-authenticating.  The reader must bring at least her understanding of that language in order to be able to interpret the printed word.  Every reading of The Bible is colored the reader's understanding of the language, not to mention by the translator's abilities and proclivities in preparing the particular edition being read.  Therefore, everyone who reads The Bible (or anything else, for that matter) must necessarily project a bit of themselves, including their prejudices, into the narrative.AiG may have been trying to say that, rather than finding the flaws, one should strain to hear the truth in the scripture.  But this particular argument, proceeding as it does from an absurd premise, does not hold up.
