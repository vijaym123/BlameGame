I could argue the many reasons i dont believe in creationism, but i would never be able to end my list. Also, i could give many reasons for UNDERSTANDING the theory of evolution, and i dont think that i would want to type that much, but what i will say is that evidence is evidence and sorry for the creationist side but you guys have none at all. You know what evidence we have, open a biology textbook, research a little about the fossil records, and also stop ignoring the stuff you dont believe in the "good book"(if you can call it that without being totally ass backwords). You cant just go and edit the book of "god" so that you feel better about what your believeing. That means that you cannot be a person who supports democracy because your religion calls for direct obediance to government as if to god. What is that shit. Any half brain would realize right there that what there reading makes no sense and close the book and go get one from barnes and nobles that makes sense, and has evidence to support it to boot. Drop the fairy tales already and grow up. There are more problems caused by religion than atheism, you just have to take off the blinds, take out the earplugs and open your mind. Thank you.
