Well once you accept the existence of an all powerful deity then anything is possible... The same can be said for invisible gnomes building everything.However for those who do see no evidence for a divine being (or invisible gnomes) see no reason to presume that the world was created in six days... indeed the evidence is quite strongly pointing in another direction.
