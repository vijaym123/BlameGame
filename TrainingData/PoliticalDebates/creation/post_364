I'm aware of that ID Christians give themselves a huge fudge factor by claiming that the Fall of Man somehow fouled up non-human nature. But there were, we presume, rocks and sand and and mud in the Garden of Eden. If somebody examined them on the morning before the Fall, would they also show signs of design? After all, they would be God's creation and therefore artifacts.So, Bzzzt! Thanks for playing again. We do appreciate the quarters you keep dropping in the machine.
