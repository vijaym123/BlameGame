Behe says: "Intelligent agents can plan ahead, and act on their plans."If this is true, then there should always be a conscious effort to prevent lines of organisms from evolving into specialized forms that later become prone to extinction when a sudden change occurs in the environment. What happens instead, according to the fossil record, is that many spectacular but highly specialized animals arise which then suffer from mass extinctions, followed by new and different animals that end up occupying the same ecological niches the extinct ones did. If Intelligent Design made life on Earth, we would expect the designer to make all animals generalized in form and they would almost never go extinct. Evolution by natural selection is a blind process, taking no possible future events into account, that causes most lines of organisms to become more specialized over time. It does this so a species can occupy one ecological niche and keep other species out. When several species occupy the same ecological niche, competition between them eventually cause more specialization and/or causes most of the species to become extinct. Then a sudden change in the environment causes the remaining specialists to die out. That doesn't sound at all like an intelligent agent planning ahead.
