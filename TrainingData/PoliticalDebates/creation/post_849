Using logic to apply consistent artistry to the mass of Creation, we may assert the existence of The Artist, Almighty God!  If we exercise faith toward God, by believing that He exists in the very manner that He says that he does, then we may logically apply His consistent Character, including His Artistic Signature in Creation, to all things that God, the Artist, creates.  If we believe that Adam was created by God as The Bible asserts, then we may, also, presuppose that Adam was not created as an infant since, of course, there would have been no other humans avaliable to have cared for the needs of an infant.The obvious need for Adam to be self-sufficient (along with the need for verbal communication with God during daily walks in the Garden of Eden, and enough creative intelligence to name all of the animals) would imply that Adam's creation required "apparent age."Using other words, on the day that Adam was created, his "apparent age" could have been anywhere from 13 to 30 years of age.Though these numbers may seem arbitrary, there is precedence for this range.  In various cultures around the world, a boy receives a rite of passage into manhood about the age of puberty.  In Judaism, the Bar Mitzvah marks the beginning of a man's participation in the Law of God as a "Son of the Covenant." Also, in the Jewish nation (it is my understanding,) that 30 years of age marks full maturity and the right to lead (if wise, as well) in the community of faith.To relate this information to the literal Six Days of Creation, (and the lack of the allegedly millions of years of evolutionary development,) is a simple matter of applied logic.If your world view can allow for the existence of apparent age in the creation of Adam (for multiple valid and utilitarian reasons,) then your world view can allow for the plausibility of the Earth being created with the appearance of having existed already for millions of years as well as having been created by The Omnipotent God in SIX literal DAYS!  :)
