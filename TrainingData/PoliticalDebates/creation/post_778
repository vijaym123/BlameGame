What is it with people like you ? was the bible the first book you read and then you quit reading anything else ?Can you defend your position WITHOUT reference to the bible ?Do you have any evidence, yes EVIDENCE, from another source that shows the bible is the word of God and not just a collection of books selected by the Vatican to support a particular viewpoint ?Why do you find it easier to believe in some all powerful supernatural creator that is eternal than a natural universe that is eternal ?Is it possible to prove (without reference to your book) that God exists, or does not exist ? probably not.Science is not a collection of, cast in stone, answers.  That kind of fixity is death.  Science is a process.  It will never end because there will always be more questions. You have simply abandoned the quest and with it your rational mind.For anybody who reads this with, some semblance, of that rational mind, please take a look at:   http://users.tpg.com.au/users/tps-seti/baloney.html      http://www.working-minds.com/galtmini.htm   As Epicurus siad, a little while before Christ & your book:Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?Then he is not omnipotent.Is he able, but not willing?Then he is malevolent.Is he both able and willing?Then whence cometh evil?Is he neither able nor willing?Then why call him God?
