#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I believe in evolution. I also believe in God. So how do I answer the question presented by either side? The evolutionists state that there is unequivocal evidence of life before man. Their right! The evangelical Christians believe in the literal translations of the Bible that God made the heavens and earth in six days. Their right too! How can both be right? My answer is that God's clock is not our clock. Our day is one revolution of the earth, God's day is something much different.
