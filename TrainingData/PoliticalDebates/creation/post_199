Intelligent design, if true, would indeed have amazing implications.  Again...if it were true.ID is an incomplete hypothesis, not a scientific theory.  It does not show a detailed analysis of the data that supports the assertions it makes.  It does not offer predictions that will validate it's claims.  It has not proposed experiments that can be done to either falsify or support it.ID's entire argument is: As a biased observer, I think life is designed, therefore it is.  I'm not going to explain it, or attempt to prove it, it's obvious.  If you don't agree, you must have an agenda.Newton and Kepler did turn out to be right, and the author is right, it was not because of their religious beliefs.  It was because of their solid science.  ID will not be proven right; not because it has religious foundations, but because it has no solid science.
