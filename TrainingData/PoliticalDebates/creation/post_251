I don't follow Dr. Behe's reasoning in the following:“For example, humans have acquired a number of helpful genetic changes in our battle with the malarial parasite over the past ten thousand years. The most well-known of these is the sickle cell mutation, which unfortunately can also lead to the lethal side effect of sickle cell disease.”Let’s look at this: to counter the malarial parasite (presumably, another creation of this benevolent Intelligent Designer), a Designer tinkers over the millennia with our genes to confer partial immunity, but with the side-effect of lethal sickle-cell disease. Way to go!Where is Ralph Nader when you really need him?Surely, the imperfect nature of the mechanism here is what we would expect as 'work in progress' from natural selection rather than design?
