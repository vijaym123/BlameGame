PvM:"First of all, the judge observed that the school board was strongly motivated by religious beliefs and the fact that they believed that ID presented a scientific hypothesis and thus a valid secular purpose, was their downfall ... "Thanks for bringing that up Pv, since I forgot to.  There is strong evidence that Buckingham had religious motives, and that he had a memory slip regarding funding for the books, etc.  That alone could qualify for an interpretation of 'religious motives', although Lemon Test prong 1, while requiring a "secular purpose", does not summarily rule out tentatively having a religious motive as well.  None-the-less, I don't disagree with his ruling regarding the school board.That said, none of this relates to the ID ruling, since the board members were not ID advocates, except perhaps superficially.PvM:" ... when the Judge showed not only how ID is tightly linked to religious motivations (the Wedge) but also that as a science it lacked any content."The board members weren't even aware of the 'Wedge' document, a dated (ten years), internal document of DI, and neither relevant to Dover v Kitzmiller, nor to the ID hypothesis.More on the ACLU's rubber stamped ruling, by a practicing attorney:    http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/why-we-should-not-try-to-fathom-the-hearts-of-policy-makers    /lacked any content."
