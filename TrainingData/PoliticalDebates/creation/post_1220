 Creation is fantasy and you can't prove a fantasy.  /   /> Even if evolution theory were not perfect it's still the best we've got.  />   /> The thought that a few thousand years ago fingers snapped and everything was here is utterly LAUGHABLE.  So did God stick million year old fossils in the ground just to test our faith?    />   /> It reminds me of when primitive cultures have a creation story like some big bird flew over and dropped a magic seed from which we all sprouted.  Imagine if that culture were the dominant force today and they were saying "God, he doesn't exist, the true believers know it was that big bird who dropped a seed.  Now we must insist the big bird theory be taught in schools and both Evolution and God's Creationism are to be debunked".  Nonesense.
