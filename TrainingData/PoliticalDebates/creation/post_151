"The response to my comment ID Contradicts Itself is a series of peculiarly unclear assertions. For example, the responder declares: --- "We need not "know" the intelligence to draw inferences about it's existence because that's not what ID studies. ID studies the FEATURES that are best traced to an intelligence; not the intelligence itself."---"Is the fact that we don't need to know the exact source of a design to know such a source exists just an unclear assertion? If so, explain. Oh wait....."Such an assertion presupposes that (1) the "features" exists separate from the entity, and that (2) the features are expressions of some intelligence one supposes exists."1. What do you mean by "separate?" 2. Agree, that's the whole point about design vs. the designer itself. "This is a logical fallacy. It assumes the prior existence of a thing whose features one is allegedly studying while declaring one is "tracing" them to some intelligence, which one denies one knows."How is it a logical fallacy to say that we don't need to know in person the author of a book to know that the book had an author? And what do you mean by the "prior existence" of a feature? Are you claiming that I'm bent on the assuming that the designed feature existed before the designer? Elaborate please. "The responder is dealing in word salads, i.e., formulating arguments that float without reference to reality. This approach permeates the responder's entire post."How on earth is the fact that we need not know the designer to identify design an argument that floats without reference to reality? "As such, it's not worth rebutting."Yet you felt compelled to do so.
