"The study of science is intriguing but it shouldn't get in the way of ruling out the Creator."Ruling out any creator(s) is a philosophical question.  There can never been any scientific evidence to "rule out" a creator.Creation in six literal days is a scientific question and it is clearly ruled out."there is so much we do not know."I assume you are speaking for yourself.  At any rate this does not seem to be a good basis to "point to a God with intelligence, morality and emotion--similar to ourselves".  That seems be be quite a non sequitur.  Our ignorance implies a supernatural being similar to ourselves?  I don't think many people would like this "argument".
