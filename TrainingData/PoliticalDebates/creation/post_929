In a literal translation, Genesis 1:31 and 2:1 state that God created the heavens and the earth in six days. Genesis 2:2 states that God finished his work on the seventh day. Genesis 2:4 begins an account of the day in which the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.Interpret this literally and the creation accounts dissolve into nonsense, with creation happening in one, six and seven days. To make any sense of it, both creationists and others are forced to take at least some of these accounts figuratively and not literally. If you want to take the Bible seriously, you can't take it completely literally, even if you are a literalist!
