"1) we can observe it occuring 2) the fossil record shows changes in lifeforms separated by time 3) genetic analysis shows similarities at the DNA level between similar lifeforms."How do we observe   evolution   occuring? I do not see one creature evolving into another one. How do you explain that the fossil record lacks intermediate lifeforms and only shows major transitions of organisms.  Where did the "500 million years" of time dissapear to that evolutionists call  the Great Uncomformity? What specific pieces of the fossil record prove that there were changes in lifeforms separated by time?How does DNA similarity prove evolution?You said that the creationist origin of the Grand Canyon is "flimsy," but what specific parts to you beleive are flimsy and what assumptions are you referring to?You said complexity does not require intellignece. What does it require? According to evolution it only requires random chemical reactions. By the way, in no   science   lab in the entire world has it been proven that chemical reactions can create life. Finally,This is toatlly out of curiosity, but what compelled you to decide to believe in the theory of evolution? Next time I respond I do plan on giving more evidence for creation and against evolution. I just wanted to get a better handle on where you were coming from with your argument. I also want to say that I appreciate your desire to find the truth in the origins of this earth.
