I do not 'believe' in science.  I see it as a rational way to understand the world.  I do not believe that if I drop a pencil that it will fall, I just know that according to gravitational theories that if I hold a pencil up then let go that it will be pulled towards the largest concentration of mass (which happens to be the earth).If I did hold up a pencil, let it go, and it did not fall then that would not change my beliefs... I'd just examine the situation to see what was keeping it from acting as expected.  My beliefs do not enter into it.It's the same for the current scientifically accepted theories about the origins of the earth.  I've read through the theories and the evidence, and I agree with the common consensus about the age and creation of the earth.You believe in Biblical Genesis, but I've yet to see any evidence to support it... or to give it more credence then the Egyptian, Native American, or Viking creation stories.You state that everyone lies, but then go on to say that you trust one group of scribes out of all the others.  How does their mathematical system lead to near perfect records?
