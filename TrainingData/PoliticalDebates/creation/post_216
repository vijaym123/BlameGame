--Ian asksIf a prominent ID advocate can't even get the description of one basic paper right, how are they going to handle more complicated papers on the evolution of the immune system?--In other words, it's not just the ignorance of science but the ignorance of the ID proponent which seems to trigger 'design inferences'.  The subjective nature of the design inference seems to be another problematic component. And remember, according to Dembski if the filter triggers a false positive (detects design where there is none) it would render the filter useless. Dembski goes on to claim that no false positives are ever triggered by the filter but we already know that this is wrong.
