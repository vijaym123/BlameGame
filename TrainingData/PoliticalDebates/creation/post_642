While I did feel for some time that ID had merit I also must admit that I believed for some time that it was religious due to those early panda's drafts. I changed my mind and felt somewhat angry when I realized just what those early drafts meant:   http://www.discovery.org/a/3135   #title3(Glad I learned to use the "Search" function on your site)Just take today's "Panda's and People," replace designer with creator, and there doesn't seem to be anything that states the "Creator" is supernatural in nature. Not sure if ID is without a doubt TRUE, but I know for sure it's not what the NCSE seems to think it is. Let's hope they don't hate me for starting an IDEA center......
