First of all, science does not make a claim that every feature of the universe can be explained without God. Instead, it makes a host of positive claims that a particular feature of the universe can be explained by some particular mechanism.So, belief in the efficacy and scope of evolution does not equate to a belief in a universe with no metaphysical purpose, or a universe with no creator. Furthermore, you conflate cosmology with biology. The theory of evolution has nothing to say about the origin of the universe. The theory of evolution only explains why living beings posses complex structures which aid in the propagation of life.Finally: "Did all this happen by chance?" Scientists do not believe that life is the result of "chance." Instead, we believe that life the result of the uniform operation of natural laws. During pregnancy a new organism is formed entirely by the operation of natural laws. This is not the result of chance, and does not make life purposeless.
