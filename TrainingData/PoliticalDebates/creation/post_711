Carbon 14 is not the only method of dating used to determine the age of the universe.  We can look out into the cosmos and see structures that have come about via billions of years of action, or that are so far away that they would have had to be in place billions of years ago for the light to have reached us by now.  There is also the ice core data that goes back more then six thousand years.It's also important to note that Carbon 14 production is statistically uniform over a geological time scale, since it comes from cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere.  As such it cannot be used to pin down an exact date (February 8th, 1,245,984 years ago) but is still useful for estimating a date range ."And the fossil record tells us that there’s been a tremendous change. The fossil record is very clear that these   animals   all died suddenly and were covered with deposits of mud instantly."Is it?  Though some fossils have come from creatures being covered in mud that is not the explanation for all of them.  One can also ask why the levels cluster creatures as they do.  If people lived along side mammoths and stegosauri then why are mammoth and stegosauri fossils not intermingled?  And why are there no fossilized humans in the mix?"Well, friends, my Bible has said that for thousands of years. It was a flood, but it wasn’t an asteroid that did it."The   bible   is just one of many religious texts explaining the history of the world.
