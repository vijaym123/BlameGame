 Of course evolution is real, as someone said "it is fact" there is no arguing, and i find it really funny that people who agreed with someone on this side in saying evolution does not contradict god have actually put their comments on the for side its ridiculous, you cant deny something that's being proven,,,, and i know this isn't the side for it but, do i believe in god NO! And I'm the only one with any proof, unless you don't count the fact you cant see or hear and then have the excuse "yeah but i have faith" as proof  /> and one more things those of you that think we evolved from monkeys, its apes for a start and just because you are not a scientist and emencly intelligent like them and cannot understand the process don't make it any less true, so to some up EVOLUTION IS FACT weather god is real or not, maybe open your mind to the thought that evolution could be the answer to how and not why.
