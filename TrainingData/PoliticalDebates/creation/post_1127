 HAHAHA there's always one that slips through the net.  Firstly, there's concrete evidence that we have evolved.  Secondly, if God did create everything, then we would have EVOLVED from what he made.  Darwin was a genius and a legend man!  /> Thirdly, don't take the bible literally.  If you believe in the Adam and Eve bullshit then more fool you.  That book contradicts itself more times than I've flicked a light switch.  It's not something that's supposed to be taken literally.   /> Anyone hoppin' on ma ark tomorrow..? ;)
