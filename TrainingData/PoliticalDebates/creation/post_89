  When materialist impose the supernatural, all they are doing is saying; "somethings are beyond being explained through nature and by science". They are saying somethings can't be explained through interpretation of nature.They know nothing of the same. Therefore things they define as "supernatural", must remain, ignored. The same adherence to ignorance, I mention in my first post.  Although ID has some appeal to "historical science", Darwinian evolution does even more so. We don't see ID scientist falsely promoting ID as a dogmatic "fact of science"; as we see the mainstream doing with, Darwinism.        The only silence on the subject of ID, is caused by the cotton stuffed into the ears of the materialist.
