While I have my own reasons for believing he did that, my personal opinions regarding   religion   are a bit outside of the mainstream, so I'm not going to discuss them.  The Bible says that the Jews are his chosen people.  Why he chose them, Christians don't know.  Like I said, I have my own theories, but they're hardly relevant.  Of course, this doesn't change the fact that the evidence shows this primitive culture's creation myth had some pretty remarkable insights, even if they were conveyed in a rather primitive fashion.  PS, You're quote from the theorhetical Bible was hilarious.
