Yes I'm fully aware what a Solar Eclipse is.. the point was that not only do they line up - the sun and moon fill each other precisely.  This would not happen by chance... for example if it were possible to stand on the surface of Jupiter I highly doubt that any 1 of it's 63 orbiting bodies would exhibit the same effect.  The point is that the moon to sun ratio causes them to appear the exact size... got it?.. What are the odds?  The only planet where life exists is the only planet where this spectacle can be enjoyed....And the moon is essential to life since it stabilizes our tilt on our axis.. without it the earth would wobble causing massive   climate change  .  These things show design.. not accident - which is the point.  I'm afraid you are completely missing that point though...Also, it's silly to assume our eyes would adapt to the pitch black of night if there was no moon... half the day we would still be in sunlight.  Even nocturnal   animals   require light at night to see.. they just make better use of it by it reflecting off the back of the eye.Anyway.. the list of things in this world which reveal that they were designed for our habitation is as long as the list of things in this world.... if you can't 'see' that... I guess I can't change it.
