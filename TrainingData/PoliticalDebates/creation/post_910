The bible is in fact useless.Glad I could help you out with that.Oh, and I could help you out with that "sin" misunderstanding too. There isn't any. Nor is there a choice of "obeying your God" or "acquiring knowledge". First, except for xians, acquiring knowledge is just what people do.As far as "obeying God" goes, even if anyone but you was inclined, don't you think the old boy sets his standards ridiculously high? Just how does one avoid (without castration that is, cause you know he won't let you into heaven then) committing adultery on sight of a pretty girl, when it's supposedly the thought that counts? From my reading of the bible, we're all doomed, if you give that nasty book any credence at all.Thank goodness more and more people are putting that thing in the dustbin of history where it belongs.
