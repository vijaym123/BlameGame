All this is hard to understand.  I was once where you are at.  I did not believe any of it.  I found myself wrong on everything.  The truth is not something man has much of in his nature.  What man has not lied once or twice?  The answer is none.There supposedly is scientific evidence for both beliefs......so who do you belief?My logic is there is no good reason to not believe in 6 days as the bible says.
