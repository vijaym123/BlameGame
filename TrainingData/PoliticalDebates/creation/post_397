To sneer at AynRandInstitute and Ayn Rand's philosophy is to fail to address the growing primary reason why people are deciding "God" is not an explanation of anything.I won't flesh out the arguments from philosophy here.  But, if you care to know why "God" is not included in the growing philosophy of the present and the future, I point you to Rand and Leonard Peikoff for the details.The view that there is nothing in existence that can give meaning to the anti-concept "supernatural" comes from several points in Objectivism.The Primacy of Existence places all consciousness in a dependent position on reality, cannot be the creator of it.The full acceptance of existence, as the place where you live and as the concept which names the nature of the place where you live renders invalid the notion that there is any alternative to it.The law of identity makes notions like design, created order, creation, miracles, creation by speech (the Word) all meaningless.  There's literally nothing which gives meaning to those notions, once you grasp that everything has an identity and behaves according to its nature.Reason is the capacity for knowledge and the barrier past which any claims of supernatural revelation cannot pass.  To claim that God told you somethng which reason cannot identify or validate means that you think you somehow received knowledge which your mind is not capable of getting.Reason again is the instrument of proof and insists that, before an honest man will "believe" any idea, he will view and understand the proof for that idea.  And, proof means showing how the idea is a logical conclusion drawn from evidence coming from the world in which we live.  In all of world history and among the best thinkers of mankind, no proof of the existence of God or any other supernatural entity has been provided.So, from the simple basis of the nature of reality and the inescapable nature of human knowledge-gaining (cognition), God simply fails to put in an appearance.  There is no evidence to support such a supposed being.Whether you are a (groundless) believer or a person of sincerity, devoted to reality and reason, you need to know where this conclusion about "God" comes from.  So, you owe it to yourself to take up the study of Rand's Objectivism to find out.  Because, it is the foundation for all persuasive thinking in the next century and forever after that.
