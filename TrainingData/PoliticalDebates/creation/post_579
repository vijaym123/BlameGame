Casey relies on the fallacy that undermining evolution somehow provides merit to ID. Funny that he decided not to address the lack of merit of ID.Come to think of it, perhaps understandable, as  a lawyer, what else is left to do but to attempt to impugn the witnesses.It did not work during Dover v Kitzmiller where Casey and the DI were outclassed by the NCSE and the many witnesses, and it will not work here.It should be clear to all now that ID is unable to defend itself against even the simplest observations that ID has remained scientifically vacuous. I bet that is by design.
