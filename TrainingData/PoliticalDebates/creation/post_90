--Jumpstart--When materialist impose the supernatural, all they are doing is saying; "somethings are beyond being explained through nature and by science". They are saying somethings can't be explained through interpretation of nature.---Why would materialists impose the supernatural? This just does not make sense. ---Jumpstart---They know nothing of the same.Therefore things they define as "supernatural", must remain, ignored. The same adherence to ignorance, I mention in my first post.----On the contrary, materialists do not ignore the "supernatural", they rather find scientific explanations for said "supernatural" which historically has included a lot of gaps in our knowledge.--Jumpstart---Although ID has some appeal to "historical science", Darwinian evolution does even more so. We don't see ID scientist falsely promoting ID as a dogmatic "fact of science"; as we see the mainstream doing with, Darwinism.---Of course ID could only wish for it to be a "fact of science". Those darn Newtonians and their dogmatic position.--Jumpstart---The only silence on the subject of ID, is caused by the cotton stuffed into the ears of the materialist.---Weird, so the reason ID proponents refuse to share their research is because they are materialists?It should be clear by now that science does not fill gaps with promissory notes but rather with hard work or a simple admission of "we don't know" and that ID proponents wish to assign 'design' to said ignorance as a placeholder while providing no guidance as to how ID will serve to strengthen the 'design inference'.Simple really...And jumpstart seems to believe that only "materialists" object to ID, but what about the countless Christians, like me, who have come to reject ID as scientifically vacuous even though we also hold to the concept that our universe was Created? Could it be that this has nothing to do with materialism but all with scientific content or lack thereof?
