Intelligent Design doesn't refute evolution. it simply says that it was "guided" or "started" by something beyond explanation (at this time).creationism says "God created man in his image"... nothing like Intelligent Design. Despite its origins, Intelligent Design has become something much more than just "God did it". Think of it based on the philosophy of Plato.and, Evolution is not a theory saying God had nothing to do with it. even its origins were not perfect but BECAME something better as we went along with it (like Darwin saying that the cell was very basic). the cell is actually another Universe.
