Intelligent Design is an idea, not a theory. The evidence given amounts to this: 1) Life is complex. 2) We don't have complete models of how nature could have done it.But here is where the error comes in. The ASSUMPTION that just because we don't know, something unnatural created us. You will hear people say 'there is evidence of design'. This is a very broad statement. Ask questions! What kind of evidence? Is this the conclusion of a scientific peer-reviewed study? Or is it something that "seems" right to the person making the statement? To make a judgement one way or the other, you must educate yourself on terms, and what people mean by certain words.Yet another contradiction is this: If nature could not have created us, and some intelligence did, what created that intelligence? Some other intelligence? What created that? Unnatural, natural, hmmm. The whole thing starts to smell real funny when you look at it from the side.I understand that ID claims to not focus on the designer. Rather the evidence for design. The nature of the design is inextricably related to the nature of the designer however. But as related to being taught in schools, what is there to teach? Besides a sentence saying "evolution currently is not fully understood", I can't think of anything relevant that ID could provide.It is an interesting talking point, in looking at what evolution can not currently explain. But don't make the mistake that science will continue to be ignorant of such phenomena. Despite what many think, science is just a passive tool used for understanding the world around us. The word comes from the latin word for knowledge, after all.Just remember: We Don't Know. Yet.
