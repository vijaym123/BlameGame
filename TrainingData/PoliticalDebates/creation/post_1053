I have no patience for people like you. I use to spend days arguing with know-nothings about the evidence for evolution, when I was studying biology. And that was when I cared. We'll start with evidence for design. And we'll start step by step.If it is so obvious, define "information" and pinpoint where it is located in a genome, in the chemicals: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine (that make up DNA) or any combination of those chemicals, or in proteins or amino-acid chains (whichever you choose is fine). Explain how this "information" is transferred and adapted between living organisms and provide examples. How is the information stored?
