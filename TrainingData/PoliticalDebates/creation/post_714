The Bible is the most published and most wide spread book of all times... which does not mean that it is true... and was also an important part of   education   (in some cases the only source of education) for centuries.  However that does not make it correct, or even overly wise."If you accept a being created us.. the stars.. and all we see. A being that defined the elements and set in place the physical laws, yet you draw the line at a 6 day creation, well that seems awfully faithless."And if you don't accept that?  What physical proof can be offered to back up those claims."Simply put.. if we ever were to confirm a young earth it would push the idea of God to an area where it was probable even from a skeptic's perspective. If that were the case then it would destroy the necessity for faith"So God is deceitful?  Laying false evidence about to ensure that people go wrong?
