The Earth is not billions of years old because that would mean your ancient holy book and everything you believe in would be wrong?I'm sorry but this took SERIOUS cahones to write as a defense of your beliefs. The ability for life forms to die and things to be destroyed is absolutely not dependant on the actions of a specific species of life form, but I believe you when you say that you believe that and must accept that regardless of how flimsy that shows your beliefs to truly be.
