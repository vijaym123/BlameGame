  This will and is already descending into a debate about the philosophy of science.   The anti ID crowd will insist on a strict materialistic cause and effect definition of science. Falsely assuming creators or a Creator, can not be scientifically known. Meanwhile, hypocritically saying they can know the origins, without adhering to the scientific method.   The anti ID's have stolen science as their private domain, to be used only, to promote their views of the Universe. A view that insist upon a, no Creator (filter). To be put on first, by all scientist. They are entrenched and defending their hold on science, furiously.   This isn't progressive science. It is holding to an old order that only wants to use science to discover advances that serve the status quo. But does not want to discover anything that would threating that status quo.   Real science and scientist should be free from this tyranny. Free to (follow the evidence, where ever it leads, and to what ever conclusions, bringsmore enlightenment.)  Materialist would hold us back in the, present scientific, "dark ages". Where mankind is still crawling on hands and knees. Taking two steps backward for every step forward.   Set the scientist free. Embrace ID.
