If you take a basic Biology course at the high school level (just a reminder: Biology is accepted by almost all religions regarding content)there would be a detailed explanation of how life was created by chemical compounds and reactions. Whether this was an act of God or not is the question.As a warning, you should try to avoid sticking to a book written before iron was used commonly word for word.(If you must know, I am Christian, raised Christian. Don't assume otherwise)
