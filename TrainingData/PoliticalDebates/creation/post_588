It's not about 'believing in ID', many people have come to accept by faith the existence of a god, but rather that scientists do not believe that ID has much of anything to offer scientifically speaking.--NCSE Statement--It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to "intelligent design," to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools. --Of course, if you are interested in the many rebuttals of ID by scientists, then I suggest you show your interest to discuss and we shall see where this leaves. The fact that scientists, even many Christian scientists see no scientific merit in ID is not really much of a surprise given the approach chosen by ID to rely on a scientifically vacuous concept.So what are you waiting on?
