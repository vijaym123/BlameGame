"That in no way describes the current theories about how life began."So would you like to give a better explanation on what current OoL theories exist? This is definitely a subject in origins debate that interests me most."So intelligent agents cannot create life under strict lab   conditions  ? Seems more like an argument against ID, rather then for it..."The fact that scientists who claim life can emerge without planning can't even execute the same processes on their own seems to show just how big a skillset the agency in question really is. "unless you are willing / able to demonstrate how an intelligent agent would be better at creating life then we are."My Mac is undesigned by that reasoning. I can't build one, and I don't know how it's possible for anyone to manufacture one. "Which only pushes the question of the origin of life somewhere else... while adding the burden of how did that life get to Terra in the first place."With respect to exogenesis and panspermia in general, you're right.
