In my discussions with Island I have come to the conclusion that I was mistaken in calling Island an ID supporter. However, I also have come to the conclusion that Island's speculations are based largely on a vague concept which lacks a sufficient theoretical foundation allowing one to make predictions. It's more like a calicos cat, many patches that make up the story without a clear common connection, other than that they, in some form or manner, argue against Copernican mediocrity principle. Island's entropic anthropic principle seems to fall into that category of not enough to pass judgement and not enough to make predictions.I'd encourage Island to present his claims in a more accessible and foundational format that would allow one to evaluate his claims beyond the piece meal approach chosen.And of course, if this can evolve fewer namecalling, then we may actually have a discussion on the merits of Islands claims
