After some diversions to point out that Augustine himself held some inconsistent positions, TJ finally comes to the quote I provided--TJ10I understand what he is saying, but for this to be valid, the unbeliever has to accurate in what he believes. Just because neo-darwinism is the currently accepted theory by most scientists does not meant that it is right.--The fact of evolution is so strong that denying it is foolish. Neo-Darwinism is the best explanation and there are no scientifically viable alternatives, even though the DI claims that ID should be considered one. This is like saying that the fact of gravity and the theory by Laplace caused us to reject God's necessity in the orbits of planets.If you are interested in discussing evolution, give it your best shot. ID has done little in this area and we could benefit from some real discussions. Give us your best explanation of the fact of common descent as outlined in 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution The Scientific Case for Common Descent    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc    /
