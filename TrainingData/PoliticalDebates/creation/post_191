I was going to post a long reply discussing each quote in detail, but I decided this was SO much simpler.--Insert ALL quotes from the argument here--SO WHAT?  Quoting other researchers is not science.  Analyze the data, and show how it supports your hypothesis, or go home.  Make a prediction based on your hypothesis, or go home.Perform experiments, or find new data that validates your hypothesis, or go home.ID has no merit in any scientific field because it is at best an unfinished hypothesis that makes no predictions.
