 I take issue only with the word 'No' in this title (though without it there wouldn't be much debate, so fair play).  />   /> I would agree that there is very little positive evidence for creationism and that most of the evidence that does exist is 'a priori' which means it is not factual evidence but logical argument which does not need facts (for example the ontological argument). However there are some examples of evidence based arguments for the existence of God the creator as opposed to anything else. Any example is the red-shift observation that the universe is expanding at an ever slowing rate. It is the logical (as science has noted) that the universe therefore came at one point from a single spot, and the question must arise of how something can exist from nothing. Whilst this is somewhat tenous, and not entirely evidence for earth based creationism, I think it is valid.  />   /> Further to my response, but unrelated to this topic, do please comment on my debut in new debates:  />   /> Http://www.forandagainst.com/Debates_Should_Have_A_Neutral_Column
