"the universe is under no obligation to conform to anyone’s definition of science."Well, this forum is being conducted in English and I have a dictionary.  So if you think the dictionary definition of "science" is not appropriate for this universe, I think you must be living is some other universe.  Obviously supernatural miracles occur in your universe all the time and that's why you don't think "science" should be restricted to mere “methodological naturalism.”  Well you just go and take your "intelligent design" and figure out the meaning and purpose behind all those miracles and come back with a good review paper next year.  I'm waiting....."But if the universe can provide evidence against design,..."If the designer is supernatural and science is restricted to the natural, then there could never be any scientific evidence against the supernatural designer.  Therefore your premise is false.  But in the absence of scientific evidence for a designer, the presumption is that no such designer is necessary."As long as a theory can be put in empirical harm’s way"But for "intelligent design" "theory" (whatever that is), this premise is false.  So there is no such theory."What if there is evidence of design"Sorry, your personal opinion seems to be irrelevant in this discussion."We’re talking about the publicly available evidence of nature,"Nope.  You are talking about your opinion of what you see in nature.  Same old same old, "I know design when I see it and I see design in nature."  But that's just not good enough.
