Alcoholism is a disease. Those who have it have cant help the fact that they feel an exaggerated pleasure response when they consume alcohol. Unlike alcoholics, creationists have the option to learn the truth and cure their creationism simply by reading an 8th grade science book, or attending public school. Since they refuse to inform themselves before they decide on their beliefs, they can be considered stupid.
