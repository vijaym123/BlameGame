ID doesn't undermine evolution. it doesn't say it didn't happen.and it's funny how all of a sudden you speak for every scientist. i think in Logical terms we call that a fallacy.I already said that it shouldn't be taught as a science (don't know what your rambling was about), I was just upset at how some people (not most though) react to it. you know, having to type extremely long explanations on why it's wrong (even though it proves nothing).As i've explained already, our brain automatically attempts to rationalize things and in that effect it is irrational. This has been proven (Mueller). I'm not saying that science is bad (it's one of my most favorite subjects to research on), I'm just saying that things aren't ALWAYS as they seem, and no matter how hard we try, we won't be able to reason certain aspects out because our brain won't accept it.and, I'm not saying ID has to be true just because the probability of life is practically zero. Obviously we hardly know shit about the Universe and Time. But because of this, it's not insane to suggest that there may be more to it (because there obviously is). ID may say that it's a God, and sometimes it will say it's just some kind of guide. Maybe some powerful force of energy that creates a guidance (the one i find most probable).but go ahead. just say that ID is creationist propaganda trying to destroy the theory of evolution.
