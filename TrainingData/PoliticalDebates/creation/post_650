In pandas we read: --Creation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc--The FTE and its defenders have attempted to explain this as a statement of fact, but this is a troubling explanation, defying logic and reason. Either creation is defined independently of the facts and then the data show support or we have a tautological statement. In fact, the statement above does not describe the facts and the denial of said facts, is a standard creationist position were 'God created according to kinds' and these 'kinds could not change'. Typical creationist ignorance portrayed as 'science'. No wonder, the abrupt appearance/creation is a standard religious explanation which ignores the facts of science. That thus creation became design shows that the concept of design is nothing more than a cover for creationism to hide under.The best some can do is to state that 'well, it does not mention God'...
