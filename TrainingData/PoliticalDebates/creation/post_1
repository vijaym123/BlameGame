 Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not "evolve" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.
