#originalTopic=Intelligent_Design_And_Creationism_Are_Nonsense
 I don't attempt to defend either intelligent design or creationism....However:  / Here is the problem with science: It is completely ill equipped to answer any questions of ascribing meaning.  Those of science cannot answer the question of why we are here.  There is no measurement or experiment that science has that can address this.  Because there is no ability to answer why, they say there is no why.  Those of faith use elements that are also outside the domain of science to answer their questions.  Through morality, love, virtues, evils etc. Life has meaning, and is elevated.    />   /> Making sense of life and of why we exist is not nonsense at all.  Personally, i find those questions of far greater depth, than all the hows.  Science in the end (for me) is less intellectually satisfying than theology and philosophy.
