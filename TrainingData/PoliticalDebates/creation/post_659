Stop eating at creationist's heads and settle down a tad. Look at the facts. Pick a flower and study it. Believe me, this will keep you busy for quite some time. Did this happen in a loud noise? A pot of slime? It seems it would be nicer to think of oneself as a wondrous creature created by God as the pinnacle of creation, as opposed to something that used to be an ape and somehow and eventually became a human. It leaves so much to be explained..ALSO why are you so rabidly angry at the idea of ID being in public school textbooks? Evolution is in eeevery single one. If freedom of speech and truth is such an issue why dont we put BOTH views in science books and have teachers encourage students to talk to their parents about it. So we can still be a diverse country of beliefs, not of stupid sheep.
