"You can't prove anything using that same thing, you have to use evidences outside of that."By using something outside of it, I assume you mean that you have to appeal to something more authoritative. You can't use something LESS authoritative to prove a point. So eventually you come to the end of that argument and you must have an ULTIMATE authority. One either chooses to believe in the ultimate authority of God's Word, or in man's flawed interpretation of the same evidence used by Creation Science, which doesn't exists to try to PROVE the Bible. That would mean that we're putting something else in a place of authority higher than God's Word. You can try your whole life to piece together the past using observations in the present, but if your presumptions and starting points are wrong, how can you even find the truth? Now if you have a reliable eyewitness account (and honestly, what's more reliable then the Word of the One who did the Creating?) you have the proper starting point to come to the correct conclusions.   http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2008/03/21/feedback-logic-over-bible
