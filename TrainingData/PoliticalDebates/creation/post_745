So you're saying that because it is written in the Bible that God created the universe in the manner described, then it must be true? I don't even know where to begin on this one. That kind of logic is not really going to cut it with any logical individual, Christian or not. Here are a couple of reasons why:1) The Bible has been translated and retranslated over and over again and been reinterpreted (and in some cases completely rewritten) perhaps thousands of times along the way.along the way so it's beyond question that it has changed in it's original message2) The level of knowledge exhibited by the ancients who wrote the Bible is far removed from our knowledge today, which implies that their view may be less than perfect. Amongst other things, they believed that the earth was flat.3) No one even knows who wrote Genesis. I fail to see why they should be taken as... ahem... gospel.4) Everything word written in Genesis is beyond ridiculous. For example the passage: "then God said "Let there be light!"." which is quite strange really as it was before he created the sun, moon and stars.I could go on but I think I've made my point.
