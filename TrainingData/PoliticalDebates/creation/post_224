"If there's something on "   evolution   news", it's irrelevant to "intelligent design" and/or distorted beyond all scientific recognition."That sentence alone tells me you either need to get out more, or need to at least read what the blog is actually about. Or maybe I'm asking for too much. Then again, you did take the time to at least read SOME of the article, and you seem to have conceded that it is on the topic of ID.  "So what?"Seems like you'd rather throw those words out to some of the statements in that article instead of actually refuting them. If biology leads to new design if it is viewed in that context, then ID obviously does encourage new avenues of research. "No amount of "sequential evidence" would ever satisfy a creationist."While I agree this is true for ID skeptics, I must ask: what do "creationists" have to do with this? "Now that makes good scientific sense - "chance" was sufficient."You do realize that your saying the millions of organized base pairs in the first cell just came out of nowhere right?"Might I suggest that your suggestion is without evidence or merit? It's just unfounded speculation."Ahem, might I suggest that your suggestion is without evidence or merit? It's just unfounded speculation.
