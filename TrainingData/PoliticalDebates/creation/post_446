1) Without a scientific definition of "natural", scientists cannot distinguish between natural explanations and supernatural ones.  Since they cannot make this distinction, they lack a scientifically-based justification for insisting that supernatural explanations be kept out of science.2) When actually doing science, scientists do not care if their explanations are natural.  Their only concern is if an explanation leads to predictions.  The predictive power is all that matters in science.  A supernatural explanation that leads to accurate predictions is better for science than a natural explanation that does not lead to accurate predictions.  Conceptions of "natural" and "supernatural" are relevant only in philosophy.3) "Everything that exists" is the only adequate definition of "natural" that I have been given by someone opposed to religion.  If this is a proper definition, then God and/or the intelligent designer would be natural according to science.  Therefore, anti-IDists' "It-Uses-The-Supernatural-To-Explain" argument would be moot.
