"Consider the observation of a solar eclipse. The sun is 91 million miles away (or so), our moon is 238,000 miles (or so) - to spare me the looking up of the exact ratios - can we agree they are VASTLY different in size... yet during a solar eclipse they line up exactly. What do you feel are the chances?"You do realize that a solar eclipse is the shadow of the moon on the earth when it's orbit takes it around the front side during the day.  They line up because the earth is circling the sun and the moon is circling the earth... that's all."The moon is necessary to our life for a wide number of reasons - light during night time, tidal forces, the affect on the tilt of the earth's axis, and also for measurement of time."The moon is not necessary for light during the night... because it is there creatures have adapted to it's light and use it.  The same with tidal forces and the axial tilt (in which the moon's action keeps the earths axis relatively stable.  The measurement of time using the moon is rather arbitrary, though it was used in ancient times because it was something that everyone could see and reference.  None of those things prove that the moon was placed there by an entity of cosmic power.
