--Ask yourself this: "if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?" My answer is that it can't be random.--It collapses. Why can this not be random? Simple, because it depends on the amount of mass in the universe, whether it is open or closed, and whether the expansion is slowing down, or increasing. However, your 'it can't be random'  does not require a designer necessarily since regularities such as laws of nature can explain these behaviors as well.We humans love to believe we are here for a reason, and I can understand, as a Christian myself, why we may hold positions of faith. However, when I see claims that one can prove the existence of this supernatural entity or entities using science, and then come to realize that the 'science' is nothing more than 'real science cannot explain X' thus 'x should be called designed'.And that my friends is exactly the foundation of ID.
