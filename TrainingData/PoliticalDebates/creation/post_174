Theories are not supported by finding confirming evidence only.  They are largely supported by consistently failing to find disconfirming evidence.  Conversely, they are refuted by consistently finding disconfirming evidence.  Confirming or disconfirming evidence is determined by making predictions. On the condition that the predictions logically follow from the explanation the theory provides, failed predictions are disconfirming evidence and successful predictions are confirming evidence. Although it is clear that ID has led to some successful predictions, the best way to test ID is ultimately to derive predictions that logically follow from the explanation and never (or hardly ever) make failed predictions.Those opposed to ID must use ID and generate failed predictions even when the predictions logically follow from the explanation.  Predictions that do not logically follow from the explanation will not be a test of ID.  For example, stating "If there is design in nature, then nature will be perfect" contains a prediction that does not logically follow from the explanation.  This is because we have a wealth of experiences with designed objects, none of which are "perfect".  Another example of an illogical prediction is "If the world is designed, then there should be no pain and suffering".  This is because we have experiences of designed things that cause great pain and suffering.I would like to see real scientists do real tests of ID.
