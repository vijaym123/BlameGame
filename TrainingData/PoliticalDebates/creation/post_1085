 You are under the mistaken impression that complexity and ability to buy washing machines equals more evolved. Prokaryotes are by far the most successful species on the planet earth and they donâ€™t even have cell nuclei. 99% of the species and 50% of the biomass on this planet are prokaryotes. They constantly evolve and are thought to be the first living organisms on the planet.    /> As for the other simian species they have evolved just as much as we have just not in the same ways. The big question is big brains have allowed us to expand very quickly as a species but will it ultimately prove to be a quality that lends to survivability or not.
