If you are going to comment on something in   science  , you need to back it up with actual data. Mere assertions count for NOTHING. And your statement that   evolution   is "a theory without mechanism" is simply wrong. The mechanism of evolution is natural selection, which is what Darwin identified. The appendix has a lot of lymphatic tissue which is what you would expect in an organ that no longer has a digestive function but is prone to infection. It's when that tissues fails to function that we get appendicitus. That also shows natural selection in action, as well as its limitations. Indeed, there is plenty of lymphatic tissue and ducts throughout the abdominal region.My point about the vertebrate eyes being wired backwards and therefore being an example of bad design still stands.
