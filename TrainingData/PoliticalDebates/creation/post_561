The writer of this piece is working for a salary. His job means he has to fight ID. This does not make him or her an expert on religious belief. The claim that "ID promoters insist that religious belief compels the rejection of well-established results from well-developed scientific fields like evolution" is clearly false. Note that he gives NO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES, only generalities.ID promoters do not reject ANY facts or well established results. We simply reject the extrapolation of small or trivial results to explain massive problems in the road from molecules to man.
