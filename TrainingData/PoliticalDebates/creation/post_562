--IDNET--The writer of this piece is working for a salary. His job means he has to fight ID.---Just like the Discovery Institutes pays it people you mean? And if ID were not scientifically vacuous and being introduced inappropriately into the school curriculums, the NCSE would not be involved.--IDNET--The claim that "ID promoters insist that religious belief compels the rejection of well-established results from well-developed scientific fields like evolution" is clearly false. Note that he gives NO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES, only generalities.--Just because not examples were given does not make it false.--IDNETD promoters do not reject ANY facts or well established results. We simply reject the extrapolation of small or trivial results to explain massive problems in the road from molecules to man.---So I presume this to mean that you reject ID then?
