"1) What predictions has ID made and have they so far proven true?"See the above links."2) What is the nature of the Designer?"Some kind of entity capable of guiding ends to means and pre-planning events or features before they happen or come into   existence  ."3) What is the mechanism that the Designer uses to manipulate life"What does this have to do with ID (which DETECTS existing design instead of determining how it got there)?"4) What are the intentions / motivations of the Designer"Gee, to design things maybe?"5) How can the existence of the Designer be tested?"By finding features more consistent with the existence of one. "6) Is ID just a way of pointing at things that have yet to have shown a clear evolutionary path and claiming that that is ID? "It is no more a "  god  -of-the-gaps" theory than coming across a book and concluding it had an author is an "author-of-the-gaps" fallacy."7) Is there a demonstrative level of "Design" that is constant across all designed elements?"A complexity threshold of 500 bits of information is the typically used standard. Derived from the universe's event-generating resources (time, matter, and the speed that matter can change). "Go right ahead... I look forward to seeing a fully developed theory of Intelligent Design (though I'm not going to hold my breath)."That's taken care of, now what. "However, Evolution (which does not deal with the absolute beginings of life) seems to do a good job of describing what we see around us, and can be used to make useful predictions."Like what? Oh wait, you aren't referring to these ones are you?  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_1.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_2.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_3.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_4.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_5.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_6.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_7.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_8.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_9.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_10.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_11.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_12.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/01/darwins_failed_predictions_sli_13.html  "When ID reaches that level I'll give it further consideration."It already has.
