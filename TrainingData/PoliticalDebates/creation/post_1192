#originalTopic=Is_The_Whole_Evolution_Theory_STARTING_To_FAll_Apart
 Evolution is one of the most strongly supported theories in all of science. It is nowhere near a theory in crisis. Quantum Physics and DNA research do not harm evolution in the least. I honestly have no idea where you’re getting this information from. I suppose next we’re going to see a debate speaking about how the theory of gravity will soon be rejected as well.
