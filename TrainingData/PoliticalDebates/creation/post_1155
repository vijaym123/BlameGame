#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Well, as being one of the denoted tie breakers of this debating conversation topic, I would like to point out that Evolution is both a fact and a theory. While on this particular topic, I’d like to cover the definition of the word “theory” briefly. The word theory, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty. By its definition it means “a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena”. On another topic of discussion, I would like to point out, for those who say that evolution cannot be proven, that nothing in the real world can be proven with absolute certainty (since no one will ever know everything there is to know about anything). However, high degrees of certainty can be reached. In the case of evolution, we have huge amounts of data from diverse fields. The following are some of the phenomena involved.  />   /> All of the information listed below is fact:  />   /> -Life appeared on earth more than two billion years ago;   /> -Life forms have changed and diversified over life’s history;   /> -Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors;   /> -Natural selection is a significant factor affecting how species change.  />   /> Evolution has explained many other facts concerning similar aspects as well (of which I will reference to should I be asked to). The theory of evolution has also proved itself in practice. It has useful applications in epidemiology, pest control, drug discovery, and other areas. Furthermore, if the claim of “it’s only a theory” were a real objection, creationists would also be issuing disclaimers complaining about the theory of gravity, atomic theory, the germ theory of disease, and the theory of limits (on which calculus is based). The theory of evolution is no less valid than any of the theories given above. So why aren’t the ones complaining about the Evolutionary Theory also complaining in separate debating topics about why we shouldn't accept the existence of gravity, since it’s only a theory? Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact.
