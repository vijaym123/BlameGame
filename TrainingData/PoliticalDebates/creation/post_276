"Design is recognized in the purposeful arrangement of parts, "Storms - tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.. - are machines.  They are made up of many necessary, purposefully-arranged parts, they are described explicitly by scientists as engines, they are irreducibly complex, they have countless more molecules than a cell, they are in their own ways as complicated and intricate as a cell, they cannot be replicated in a lab, they have all the hallmarks that Behe claims precludes any natural origin.  But they arise spontaneously all the time.Behe's argument amounts to "it looks that way to me, thus design".  This argument fails on so many levels.  The matter of meteorological phenomena is but one example that reveals the weakness of the ID position.
