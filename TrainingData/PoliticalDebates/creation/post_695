Certainly, there is value in the documents from which human culture has derived the Christian Bible; the value of which is to be determined individually by the reader. Let us not forget the context in which these documents were written and remember that they represent merely the views of those who wrote them. They may or may not reflect the truth. Whatever truth they may or may not contain must be determined by other facts and argument from facts.The "Book of Genesis" is one book and a narrow view. It is grossly insufficient to answering the question - how long did it take for the universe, this galaxy, this solar system, this planet and life on the Earth to form. It is terribly insufficient to answer what is ultimately an unanswerable and incomplete question. The Christian Bible and the question itself both miss a higher truth - none of the above is finished forming ... nor are we.The natural processes that created the Earth and its life in the past are not finished. They continue to create and we each too are instruments of that continuing creation.
