As much as I might believe that there is some sort of creator and that a creation occurred, you cannot justifiably intermingle science and religion. ID is just "creation science" (which is not science at all) in disguise!Teach science, not religion, in the science classroom, and creationism/ID in church. Bottom line, end of story.
