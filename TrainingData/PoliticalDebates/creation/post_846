"One thing for sure, time was and continues to be passing differently in different parts of the universe. From whose perspective is the universe 14.2 billion years?"Time does pass at different rates at different locations, but that variance follows very specific mathematical equations. The Lorentz transformation converts between two reference frames traveling at a constant relative velocity. Similar transformations exist for gravitational time dilation. (See the Schwarzschild metric.) My point being: You cannot manipulate time as you please to suit your interpretation of the Bible. Unless you wish to confine god the observer to the center of a black hole, the observable universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old as measured from most frames of reference therein."Please clarify how this negates relativity."It doesn't negate relativity; my example was derived from it. But first I must apologize, as I had my examples reversed. In an attempt to explain distant starlight on a young earth, creationists sometimes argue that the earth must be at the center of a massive gravitational field. This light would be blue shifted. The reverse is true in your case: We would expect dramatic redshift from any location in the universe where god supposedly made his observations of a 144-hour creation.
