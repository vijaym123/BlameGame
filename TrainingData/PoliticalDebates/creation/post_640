I must admit this would all go a lot smoother if there were no word count limits or rules about how many posts you could make at a given time. (rolls eyes)"Combine this with a lack of scientific content of ID" So where not just discussing the claim that ID is repackaged creationism anymore? I guess I understand..."...and the flawed scientific claims of its predecessor 'creationism..."But they weren't predecessors, you know that just as much as I do."and one comes to understand why courts have ruled in such a devastating manner to these attempts to get religion restored in classes."What attempts to.....oh, your just talking about Edwards right? "The content of panda is explained by its religious foudations."Come on PvM, you talk very confidently of these religious foundations, care to elaborate?"Of course you can move the goalposts and argue that 'God' was not mentioned in these books, we can all read between the lines."I moved the what? I know it's common for you guys (Musgrave is someone who comes to mind) to accuse us of moving the goalposts when we point out any straw men you've used, but if you want to state the early drafts promoted a religious idea, then fail to provide the evidence to back this up, then insist the religious content is there, we just need to "read between the lines," and finally accuse me of moving the goalposts, that's fine. But I would like to see actually passages to back this up..... please. :)"Heck, as a Christian and quite well versed in the creationist arguments I myself see these prints of 'designer wink wink' all over the book."Well, as a deist (I'm going through my Antony Flew right now if you know what I mean) and not quite yet a full blown Christian maybe perhaps you would know more about this then I do. I guess they were really winking hard when they said that no one can infer if the designer is natural or supernatural...right?"Calling Him a designer rather than by His true name, should be an insult to any Christian but I guess, when everyone understands that this is just an alias, it somehow seems ok?"I take it your also a closet fan of Hugh Ross am I right? ;D
