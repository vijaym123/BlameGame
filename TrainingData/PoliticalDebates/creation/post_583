"ID is not science because it can never make a prediction that is meaningful."Sure..., except:  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/08/function_for_endogenous_retrov.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/05/another_intelligent_design_pre.html    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/06/wired_magazine_unashamedly_mix.html  "ID simply tries to pretend to match any and all observations of reality."Sounds like Neo-Darwinian theory to me. "What do we know about the designer that would lead us to believe that his "design" actually matches reality?"Why would we need to know anything about the designer to draw conclusions?"So ID has no merit because ID fits anything and everything."So then Evolution has no merit because it fits anything and everything in biology. "And there was tiktaalik."Common descent neither supports, nor refutes ID.
