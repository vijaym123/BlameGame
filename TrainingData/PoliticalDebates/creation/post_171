"A. Intelligent design does not study the designer, but rather studies natural objects to determine if they bear the tell-tale signs that they were designed by an intelligent cause."And outside of action from a designer, how can the existence of an "intelligent cause" actually result in any physical change?It can't.  Whoops, your "argument" is showing cracks.Uh oh, you now have a bigger problem...First you claim "A. Intelligent design does not study the designer, but rather studies natural objects to determine if they bear the tell-tale signs that they were designed by an intelligent cause."Then you claim"But ID is not focused on studying the actual intelligent cause responsible for life."So, you say it's about studying the intelligent cause, then you say it isn't, and we're supposed ot take you seriously?ID is nonsense, and it's so far from   science   that claiming it follows scientific method immediately invalidates one's opinion.
