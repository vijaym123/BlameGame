Aristotle, Socrates and Plato.Plato being my favorite. Socrates I like a lot too mainly because I think like him on how there is no real answer for anything. That if you look into all beliefs and theories, you will find a flaw. This is why i am constantly skeptical of beliefs but I still hold them because I take elements of them to try and rationalize other beliefs.long explanation on how my mind works... i'd rather not.But maybe we can see Philosophers in different lights. After all, Marx and Adam Smith can also be considered philosophers. Marx saw a greater picture kind of thing and Adam Smith was really just an economist, but his Invisible Hand of the Market belief go a great deal along with philosophy. (and, of course, I like Smith and i dislike Marx).Einstein thought philosophically. He thought a bit on the lines of Pantheism, actually, a lot. He considered himself of an agnostic because he was astonished by the brilliance behind the Universe. But, on religion, he didn't focus too much on whether he was agnostic or w/e... he even said that "if you're religious, you might consider me an atheist". And on how the atheist would consider him religious (sort of how people constantly view me).So maybe philosophy is still vibrant. or not. maybe i'm wrong about the last few mentioned.
