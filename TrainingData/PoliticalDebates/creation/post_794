There is much scientific evidence to proof it, it's just that you wouldn't believe it anyway.  The problem being that there isn't much proof in what men say anyway.  Which of us hasn't lied once or twice.  The answer is no one.  So how can you believe what any man says.The bible is the only record of creation and the scribes kept near perfect records by their mathematical system.  So by faith I believe it.  God chose the Jews for many reasons, but one was to keep track of His relationship with man and write it down.
