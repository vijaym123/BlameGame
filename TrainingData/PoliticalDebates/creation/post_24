#originalTopic=Debate:_Creationism_vs_evolution_in_schools
Attempts to teach the creationism-evolution controversy to students are disingenuous promotions of activist Christians. Certainly, it sounds reasonable that creationism should taught in public schools in the context of it being a cultural/religious perspective? Who could argue with this? Many non believers would argue that creationism and Bible are wonderful literary works of fiction, and so, yes, they should be taught. Unfortunately those that uphold creationism as true cannot be satisfied with this because their doctrine drives them to require it to be taught as the truth. This is what many creationists are calling for in school systems. They frequently call for individuals classes to be created that teach "creationism science" as truth.
