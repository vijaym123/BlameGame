Carter points out that the coincidence found by Bondi belonged to three classes(1) the traditional kind - without use of the anthropic principle; (2) those which only require the use of a 'weak' anthropic principle; and (3) those which require the invocation of an extended (and hence rather more questionable) 'strong' anthropic principle. The Weak Anthropic Principle is described as--This prediction provides a good illustration of the use of the 'weak' anthropic principle to the effect that we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.-The Strong Anthropic Principle is described as--Condition (8) is a good example of a prediction based on what may be termed the 'strong' anthropic principle stating that the Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage.--
