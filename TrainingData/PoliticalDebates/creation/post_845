"The scripture is silent as to which locale in the spacetime continuum, the Author of the account was measuring time from on the first day of creation."Are you sure? Take a look at Genesis 1:2. If you must insist on forcing the narrative into a "materialist straight jacket," as Dr. Hurd described it, then it certainly does not appear that the observer was at a great distance. The passage states that god's spirit was hovering over the oceans, and presumably god was the observer."Even now, the age of the earth, by whatever scientific determination, assumes an eathly observer, and does does not generally take into acount that an observer from Betelgeuse disagrees with this age."Any observer in the known universe would have similar estimates for the age of our planet. An observer on Betelgeuse could make a crude estimate of the earth's age by comparing our sun with other main sequence stars. Furthermore, they could precisely measure the rate at which time passes here by running light from our star through a spectrometer. If our planet were positioned in a gravitational field such that 4.5 billion years here would appear as 6 days to someone else, then they would find light from our star to be dramatically redshifted.Incidentally, if we were positioned in such a gravitational field, we would expect all starlight outside that field to be dramatically blueshifted. That is not consistent with observations of the heavens above us.
