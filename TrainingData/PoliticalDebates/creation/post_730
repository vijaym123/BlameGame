Why do we even ask this question?  PEOPLE, Evolution is a fact,   science   measures facts.  The world is neither 4,000, 6,000, or 37,000 years old.  It is 4 Billion years old.  We can use math to estimate the time of the big bang, it is all FACT.  Gravity is fact, Evolution is fact, Creationism is so ludicrous and moronic that it is not worth even discussing.  Providing a debate makes these people think that there is a debate to be had. YOU CANNOT DEBATE A FACT.
