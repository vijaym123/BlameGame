I really have to give the anti-IDer's credit, you have a lot of faith.  More than I do actually.  Some say that God does not exist and that there is no way in this universe that he created everything, yet what doesn't make sense to me is that there is less of a chance that The Big Bang happened then God actually creating the universe.  Do the math: The Big Bang is really impossible.  I heard a statistic that said the possibility of The Big Bang happening is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling A WORKING BOEING 747.Look around you.  Look away from your computer screen for a moment and glance out your window.  Really ask yourself, "Did all this happen by chance?"  The trees, water, mountains, birds, cats, dogs; I'm not sure how people can believe that this was all a freak accident.  Was it really a concidence that the planet we call Earth just happened to be the IDEAL place for life?  Any closer to the sun, we'd fry.  Any farther, we'd freeze.  We're perfectly placed in the universe and thrive because of it.  Coincidence?  I think not.Most of all, look at yourself.  Ask any doctor and they will tell you that the human body is a remarkable machine.  Well lubricated, efficient, intelligent; what are the chances of the body that you are in now coming from a pile of goo struck by lightning (or however you believe we came to existance).  For those of you who believe that we were not created and came into existance randomly, I give you props for believing in something that mathmatically probably never happened.Also, if there is no God, then we have no purpose; we are useless beings that try to make the most of of what we have been dealt.  Is that what you want to believe?  If you do, then you have more faith than most people.I've found purpose.  I've found happiness.  Have you?
