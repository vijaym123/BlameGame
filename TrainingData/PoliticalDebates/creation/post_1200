 There is positive evidence against macroevolution.  / Whether or not evidence convinces anyone is irrelevant, it just has to be real and demonstrable. Some of the atheotards around here will never accept any evidence of any kind that disagrees with their aetheist beliefs, that doesn't mean that the evidence isn't factually real, only that they carry a ridiculous bias.
