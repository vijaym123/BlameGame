 I think you will find that there is a vast amount of evidence for evolution if you would care to look. In fact, as scientific theories go, evolution stands out as being one of the most supported theories in existence, this is evident since it has fought off decades of scrutiny and is still accepted by biologists today - more so than ever. As i say, take the time to look and you will find. Also, i don't see much evidence being provided by the other camp.
