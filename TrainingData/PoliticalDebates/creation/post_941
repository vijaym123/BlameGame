So how is that not stupid? If you can see the evidence for something, and you continue to believe something else based on no evidence, that is stupid. That's like me believing that people can fly because I read it in Peter Pan, and continually denying that people cant fly despite the evidence against it. Denial does not excuse stupidity.
