My point was not that Genesis contradicted itself but that if you took it literally it contradicted itself. The problem is not with Genesis so much as a literal interpretation of Genesis. You have to get away from literalism to make sense of the two creation stories, with their different orders of creation. You have proved my point by showing how a less than literal interpretation of the passages gets round the problem of a literal interpretation.
