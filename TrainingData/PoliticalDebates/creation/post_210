The Ayn Rand Center says:- ID claims that design can be inferred merely from observed complexity (“specified complexity”)—i.e., that complexity is prima facie evidence for design.- But on this premise, any natural being capable of designing the complex features of earthly life would exhibit sufficient complexity to require its own designer.---------------------------------yes.. a scientist who creates life requires a designer. still -- this is really your argument? That's really unimpressive. Or is this just the same old 'who made God' argument' dressed up.as a sidenote - a scientist creating life is not that impressive either.. it's the equivalent of burning a cd and saying 'look... I made music!'
