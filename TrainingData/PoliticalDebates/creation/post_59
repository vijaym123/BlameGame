--Highlander--The lack of evidence supporting materialist assumptions complexity is a chance arrangement means the opposite could be true. That many of these systems look designed and that science has not (even remotely) demonstrated a chance pathway to such organization, leaves design as the logical alternative. Until proven otherwise.--Design always has remained a logical possibility however, ID does nothing to actually demonstrate that such a possibility is actuated. In fact, there is plausible and growing evidence that complexity and information increase are inevitable outcomes of evolutionary processes and while science may remain ignorant about the exact origin and evolution of systems, this does not give ANY credibility to the 'design' arguments, lest we define design to be 'that which science does not yet understand'. But then we should be careful not to use 'bait and switch' and conflate terminology to suggest that this kind of 'design' has any relevance to the concept of Design.
