"Let’s look at this: to counter the malarial parasite (presumably, another creation of this benevolent Intelligent Designer), a Designer tinkers over the millennia with our genes to confer partial immunity, but with the side-effect of lethal sickle-cell disease. Way to go!"Uhhhh.... dude, that's the product of evolutionary processes you're talking about there, and I think you agree they're nothing to brag about. "Where is Ralph Nader when you really need him?"Screw him. Where is Ron Paul when you REALLY need him?"Surely, the imperfect nature of the mechanism here is what we would expect as 'work in progress' from natural selection rather than design?"It's definitely what we would expect from evolutionary processes. This is not a feature we attribute to design.
