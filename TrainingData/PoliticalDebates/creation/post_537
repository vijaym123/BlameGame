1.  http://www.alliancealert.org/2008/09/30/adf-sues-after-student-arrest-threatened-for-sharing-the-gospel  / Just for your information this is the same   college   that attacked me, another Christian, so very many years ago, for speaking out against   homosexuality  . Thank you ADF! God bless you, Doziers victory is mine too  http://www.thefire.org/index.php  /article/10166.html2.  http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/pressrelease.aspx?cid=3709  3.  http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2005/0906uc.asp   Quote:The Update article goes on to say that as the discussion continued about the biology books, “it became evident that they were rejected because they appeared to state the perspective that the Bible is revelation and along with faith is more authoritative than the observations of   science  , especially if there were a conflict over a ‘factual scientific issue.’”As reported by the Inside Higher Ed, the science courses that have been rejected teach not only   creationism   or   intelligent design  , but also teach the “standard content of evolution,” even if the teachers do not believe the content.end quote4.  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6875/is_n4_11/ai_n25023460  /5.  http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE  .view&pageId=945376.  http://www.christianpost.com/article/20090216/christian-student-alleges-professor-censored-speech-on-god/index.html  7.  http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=4823   This is a repeat its just too awful to let it go. There are way too many stories out there to provide on this one site all I can say is the wont destroy Christianity because they hurt Christians, it only makes them look bad and galvonizes the resolve of people of faith to continue to hold out their testimonies in a world of true hate and darkness.
