-- What features of the complexity of the cell points to intelligent design? How does the complexity of the cell point to intelligent design? These are the kinds of questions you should be answering with this argument.--The ID proponent would argue: the fact that it is complex (in other words, science cannot explain it) and 'specified' where it matches some independent pattern. In biology, function seems to be sufficient for something to be specified, so mostly anything that would arise via the processes of evolution and would not yet be fully understood would be called design.Hope this clarifies.
