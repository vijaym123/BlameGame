Intelligent Design has been misrepresented as some kackamamy religiously motivated scheme by those who are afraid to challenge what they believe in.  This misrepresentation is not true.  Intelligent design is a bold and controversial new theory based on careful examination of genetics, astronomy, and biology.  It is rapidly spreading through the scientific community, despite the bad name put forward by the Ayn Rand center and others.  This theory is not the eyeball example that everyone has heard.  "The human eye is far too complex to have come into being by chance, mwah, mwah mwah, mwah mwah."  No!  That is an opinion, not scientific fact.  Intelligent Design has demonstrated using genetics and statistics that the chances of even the simplest life randomly occuring are too small to be statistically valid.  That is a fact, not an opinion.  The logical conclusion, then, is that for life to exist, some kind of designer is required.  Committed Secularists, Objectivists, and other followers of violently atheistic religions are now terrified that, for the first time in a long time, science supports theism.  As a result of this terror, they are religiously attacking this threat.
