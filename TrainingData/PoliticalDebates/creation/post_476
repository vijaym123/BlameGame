--TJ10I agree with you though that Darwinism does not automatically lead a person to atheism. There are a lot of inconsistent Christians around. There are a lot of inconsistent evolutionists around as well. However, if naturalism is true, then it does lead to that conclusion. Since Darwinism is based on naturalism, even if only methodological naturalism, it is a very simple step to atheism from there. Many have taken that step when they started to believe in Darwinism and understood the implications of that view on the Bible and religion. God is no longer "necessary" in their eyes.---I agree, there are Christians who believe that the earth must be young, something contradicted by fact. There are Christians who believe other foolishness, but they are still Christians. The more coherent Christians have found to reconcile their faith with what God is showing them. That this means that God does become unnecessary, is what makes Christian faith so powerful. We can all believe in something we consider necessary, but what faith it is when we accept something that is not necessary and yet adds so much to our worldview?Insisting that God reveals Himself in His Creation to scientific scrutiny seems to me as lacking faith. YMMV of course.As to atheism being so compatible with science, which includes evolutionary science, such is the power of atheism that it is not compelled to reject science in favor of their philosophical viewpoints.
