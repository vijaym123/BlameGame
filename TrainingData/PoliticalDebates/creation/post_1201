 There is eye witness, reproducable evidence for "micro" evolution or change within a species which is irrefutable. However, the goo to you via the zoo evolution or "macro" evolution is a theory with way to many holes in it to be considered plausable. 1) macro evolution cannot explain first life, or how non-intelligent lifeless matter through nature (which by nature randomizes) could have created the first life which we now know thru DNA and protien sequences had a highly intelligent and spacific design. Creation or intelligent design theory fits perfectly. 2)macro evolution cannot explain the viability of transitional forms. In other words how could a half lizard half bird survive. Creation/intelligent design doesn't need this step. And the fossil record is proof for creation/ID and completely against evolution. The fossil record shows all life came into existance all at once and fully formed sometime between 600millionBC and 500millionBC. (life's big bang) there have been NO fossils that have shown ANY transitional forms, much less viable transitional forms... Micro evolution yes, girraffes necks might have grown longer over time to better enable them to reach tree branches, a cheetah's sense of sight and smell could have developed over time to make him a better hunter, and humans might have less body hair than our ancestors thanks to airconditioning/heating and the fact we now live indoors and wear more cloths. But a girraffe is still a girraffe, and a cheetah is still a cheetah and a human is still a human. Sharks have been the same since the time of the dinasours with little or no change....Macro evolution not plausable.
