Agreed, 100 percent!  This is my frustration with people who want to find every possible motive to discredit Creationism, they seem to want everyone to accept their viewpoints without question while they seemingly want to question and discredit anyone who does not see from their points of view.  There are a number of people within the scientific community who say that the Biblical account of Creation can be verified, regardless of how many days it took to be accomplished.  I believe in the 6-day Creation because our Heavenly Father is a perfect Being who can speak things into existence, He does not even have to raise a finger.  Man did not exist for millions and billions of years, but the heavens and the Earth were around that long.  As Scripture says, God is not man and His ways are not our ways.  It is fruitless and futile, in my opinion, for us, such plain and frail mortal beings, to analyze supernatural events that are way beyond human thought and rationalize a supernatural Being into such minuscule humanity, a God who is bigger and more powerful than the Solar System and Milky Way that He created.  "Vanity," says the preacher in Ecclesiastes, "Everything is vanity."
