the 10 commandments are not the sole source of morality.  The laws of the Chinese, Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, Vedic, Japanese, Incans, and numerous others were developed long before their people ever heard of the 10.  Not teaching the 5 commandments will not make people lawless any more then not teaching them the rules of Buddha.
