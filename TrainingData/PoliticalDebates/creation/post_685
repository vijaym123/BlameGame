You have GOT to be kidding me. 6,000 years old?!?!?!? Wow, some people are still stuck in the stone-age I guess. When we've got nothing but huge amounts of evidence to the contrary, and about a dozen different interpretations of Genesis (which, if you do your research, "yom" can mean a day or an indeterminate period of time), why do people still believe this? Quite frankly I find it extremely embarrassing that people believe this. We're smarter than that now. Good grief. Now, I'm a Bible believer, however, I read the Bible with a heck of a lot of common sense. You need to use common sense while reading the Bible...if you don't, you get sucked into traps like this, and you'll get sucked into paying money to conmen like Kent Hovind, who conned the IRS out of $800,000 in taxes. What a low-life.
