 WHAT! This is pointless!! First off if there wasn't evolution the diseases we have today wouldn't be as strong as they are! And there wouldn't be humans! Everything starts somewhere and evolves!  /> Notice that almost all forms of complex life have both male and female--horses, cats, dogs, humans, moths, monkeys, fish, elephants, etc. The male needs the female to reproduce, and female needs the male to reproduce. One cannot carry on life without the other. Which then came first according to the evolutionary theory? If the males came before the females, how did the males of each species appear without the females? If you believe that perhaps, maybe, probably, possibly, male and female evolved over a long period of time, what then made evolution change its initial plan and require the necessity of male and female? There is another little problem for evolutionists. Did the first fish that crawled onto dry land millions of years ago have lungs or gills? If he had gills, he would have gasped and died the moment he crawled onto dry land. If he had lungs, why did he evolve them while he was in the ocean? Also, he had to find a female (to carry on the species) who had also crawled onto the land, and she would have had to have evolved lungs also. Would you remotely consider the possibility that the Bible is right when it says that God created male and female? Why do you prefer to choose to believe a ridiculous theory than believe the truth with so much evidence around you? Is it because the Bible has moral dictates you disagree with?
