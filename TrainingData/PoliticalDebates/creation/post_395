The response by the Discovery Institute says that the "methodology for detecting design (which I discuss in my first opening statement) is entirely empirical and scientific." and "As William Dembski explains: "Intelligent design is the science that studies signs of intelligence." Unfortunately, a review of the entire corpus of actual scientific journal articles reveals an inconvenient truth:  The so-called empirical scientific truths of intelligent design creationism seem to be entirely missing.  A disinterested observor searching for signs of intelligence in the search for signs of intelligence would find statements such as this 2003 quote from Philip Johnson, one of the originators of the intelligent design movement, on a Christian radio talk show: "Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit, so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools." And here's a 1996 quote from Philip Johnson: "This (intelligent design) isn't really, and never has been, a debate about science. It's about religion." This is as good as it gets, straight from their prophet's mouth. And as Judge Jones ruled in 2005, "We have concluded that intelligent design is not science, and moreover that intelligent design cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents."  Judge Jones also stated: "It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the intelligent design policy."Intelligent design creationism may have religious merit, but it certainly has utterly no scientific merit.
