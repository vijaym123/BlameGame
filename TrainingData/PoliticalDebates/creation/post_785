"Answers in Genesis" avoids doing the one thing that might actually lead them to understand the Biblical text: studying genuine, up-to-date, Biblical scholarship that reflects a genuine desire to understand the text rather than impose one's predetermined conclusions on it.Not only is the Bible not self-authenticating, but no one comes to the Bible as a blank slate without other influences. Biblical literalism is a PR exercise. Groups like Answers in Genesis claim to believe the whole Bible and take it all literally because it persuades people who do not examine the basis for their claim. Those who do find that in fact AiG and other groups like it are making false claims. They don't take the dome in Genesis 1 literally. They never argue that one needs to believe that Yahweh created by combatting the sea monster (called Leviathan or Rahab in the Bible). Their literalism is a selective on.Moreover, Biblical scholarship has long noted that the days in Genesis 1(literal days consisting of evening and morning as per Jewish reckoning) are arranged in a poetic parallelism, with days 1-3 creating habitats that are then filled with life on days 4-6.The issue is not simply ignoring science. Answers in Genesis ignores the Bible, and yet claims to be based in the Bible. Where I come from, we call that dishonesty.
