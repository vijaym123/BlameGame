This rather poorly phrased term, suggests that there may be an enigma but let's look at the apparent correlation between habitability and our existence as observers. Is it not remarkable how so many tribes managed to find themselves located at exactly the spots where rivers ran into oceans, enabling not only an inflow of fresh water but also the protection by a moderated climate. Even more remarkable is how the ocean would provide for important sources of protein (fish etc) and enable trade with other tribes.What a the chances that life would thrive at exactly these places... Other than these nasty tsunamis and hurricanes...Thus we start to understand the Goldilocks aspect better. In fact, while the porridge, bed and chair of the child bear was exactly the right size for the teenager who intruded, other 'guests' would have found the father or mother bear's porridge etc much more to their likings.In other words, we observers are biased to be in locations in which our existence is not just possible but also likely given the environment.Some may call this an enigma others just observe the logic behind such a correlation. Simple really and so if the anti-copernicans are interested in presenting their thesis and predictions, then fine. Pointing at some quotes and some yet to be understood data hardly seems sufficient for such a position.Note that as is the case with science, there may be more to this coincidence but its up to those proposing it to present their evidence and make their case.That's how real science is done, and that's why ID continues to fail to be scientifically relevant.
