So Luskin is accusing NCSE of being both anti-religion and pro-religion.  He can't make up his mind, oscillating randomly between his desire to call NCSE a bunch of nasty atheists and his desire to call them a bunch of nasty science-and-religion-are-compatible-ists (creationists hate theistic evolution probably more than they hate the atheists, because theistic evolutionists disconfirm the creationist view which is that evolution = atheism).  Um, great argument!
