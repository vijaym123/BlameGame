I am not an atheist, and have no reason to debate with anyone concerning an Eternal Being who is greater than any of us.  "He who entertains a scoffer will do so to his sorrow, and the father of one who lacks wisdom has no joy (Proverbs 17:21)."  You have your beliefs, and I have mine.  I have given you my respect - therefore, we would never reach a common ground on the reality of the existence of God, which in my book, is a no-brainer.
