"I thought evolution is a naturally occurring process, not a consequence of a controlled experiment in a lab."So you don't believe it's possible for a naturally occuring processes to be the consequence of an controlled experiment? That would be an interesting position to hold considering that's what science is all about. All the philosophical logic in the world won't help you if you don't have a basic understanding of what science is.
