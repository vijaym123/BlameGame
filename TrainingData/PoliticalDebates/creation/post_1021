#originalTopic=evolution_vs_creationism
Evolution has been basically proven... Other than that, the only source for creationism is the creation story in the Bible. And although that's a nice story and all, I believe it was only put there as an allegory for other messages we should know, like "God is all powerful (He created everything)" and "God is all loving (the line "and He saw it was good")".
