First, even as a Bible-believing creationist, I want to say thanks for bring attention to Genesis 2. I am surprised how many Christians have not noticed this chapter. The Hebrew used it not thought to be figuaritive, but this brings attention the order and matter of time we have grown to think. I do think that in the 2nd chapter of Genesis it is referring to time as a "period" or "era", just as we would say, "I lived in California for a time". There are no specifics. I would also like to point out that Job is recorded as the oldest and thus first book of the Bible written, between Job and Psalms we see great awe and majesty described by the writers. Thought we have learned so much through science and technology, there is so much we do not know. It is amazing to me to think of the beauty, creativity and perfection that is made in space and here on earth--which to me point to a God with intelligence, morality and emotion--similar to ourselves. The study of science is intriguing but it shouldn't get in the way of ruling out the Creator.
