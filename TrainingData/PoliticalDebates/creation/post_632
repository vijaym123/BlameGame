"So I decided to check out the actual articles in question and much to my dismay I came to realize that this seemed to be a blatant quote out of context."If you came here to convince people that the quote really was out of context then I would highly suggest you give the proper context that shows otherwise."By the way, speaking of religion class, if we accept the creationist's own rationale for this bill, then shouldn't right wing fundamentalist Christian schools be forced to "teach the controversy" about religion?"No, the reason being that the bill addresses controversies among scientists about science. "You can see how quickly their argument breaks down."Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just plain ignorant, but I sure can't see any fault in the rationale behind the academic freedom bills they've been promoting. They seem fine as written:   http://www.academicfreedompetition.com/freedom.php   "You are no match for the NCSE and its hard working staff who have relentlessly expressed scientific objections to the claims made by ID proponents."If that's truly the case, then the NCSE really needs to ramp things up if they are to sway public opinion. "People such as former Public Information Project Director Nick Matzke whose elaborations on the bacterial flagella and his incredibly in depth work during Kitzmiller v Dover have exposed not just the scientific flaws in Behe's and other ID proponents claims (including your own IIRC)"I would like more information on this process and his paper "Evolution in (Brownian) Space." None of it seemed to convincing to me because parts of the flagellum seem to just appear out of nowhere, automatically assemble in the right order, location, with the right compatibility, right function, and all at the proper time. While it may in fact be a possibility, I would want more then just animation of parts coming from nowhere and just falling into place for me to be convinced:   http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5322150578555602908&ei=eDLVSJaiEZW6qAPCuNjGAg&q=flagellum&vt=lf&hl=en   What mutations occurred for this to come into play? How many ways could the process have gone wrong? "...but also helped to formulate a winning strategy to expose not just the scientific vacuity of ID but also its well established creationist roots."After reading the points between the NCSE and the Discovery institute on that claim, I am still skeptical of this as well. I would like to know more about the "well established roots," as far as I know the best the NCSE has come up with are early book drafts taken out of context.   http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/response_to_barbara_forrests_k_4.html
