#originalTopic=evolution_vs_creationism
I think evolution is an actual truth, since we are able to prove it and all. However, i think the two are closely linked.But seeing as how everyone has their own beliefs, bleev what u want. My religion has already influenced me, so i'd like to believe God created the Big Bang and designed how evolution would occur. The Bible is not all truth sometimes, because the story of creation could just be a way to improve faith, not to state the way people came to be, we hav science for that
