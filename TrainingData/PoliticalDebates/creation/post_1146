 "No scientist can give strong evidence to support evolution"?  /   /> Your dishonesty and ignorance of science proves you are not fit to even ask the question.  />   /> The big bang, abiogenesis and evolution were ALL produced by the same methodology that produced cars, televisions, computers, and doctors.  To reject evolution requires rejecting all the modern benefits of science as well.  Taking the benefits (e.g. Reading this on the Internet) while rejecting evolution is moral cowardice and hypocrisy of the worst sort.  />   /> Edit:   />   /> Dishonest arguments do not deserve respect or "nice words".  They deserve to be exposed for the lies they are, and as long as I don't use profanity or insults, I won't retract them.  The facts will stand up for themselves - he has none, and he is wilfully ignorant of the facts.
