I surely intend to do so, but these issues go beyond questions of policy. I am not sure about reactionary antifanatics and how you believe it applies to me, but I can reassure you that rather than being fanatic, I am well informed and committed to my faith and good science. If that means I am guilty of some 'crime' in your eyes, then I plead willingly and proudly guilty as I stand for accuracy in science, freedom of religion and more.I have many reasons to find 'god' and I am sure that I do not confuse my theology with my scientific endeavours, since both would suffer.I am still somewhat lost as to the nature of your argument but at least I can attempt to address your confusions.
