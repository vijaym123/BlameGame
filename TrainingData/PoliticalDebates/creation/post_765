"On the Origin of Species" is out of date. It rightfully retains its historical significance as a turning point in Western society, but modern scientists rarely cite the text directly. Darwin's theory has almost entirely been supplanted by modern refinements. Remember that Darwin published his theory before the discovery of DNA. The mechanism he tentatively proposed to explain the heredity of traits, a critical component in his theory, was flawed and incorrect. Scientists discarded such ideas and incorporated discoveries from biology to create the modern evolutionary synthesis.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis  Darwin's theory was itself a refinement of earlier ideas. It had been known long into antiquity that species inherit traits and change over time. (Domestication of animals, animal breeding, etc) Darwin was the first to propose common descent. His novel idea was that isolated populations of the same species can diverge into separate species after many generations.In stark contrast, "creation scientists" will stubbornly resist any discovery that contradicts the earliest formulation of their "theory." I use quotes because creationism offers no specific mechanisms and makes no useful predictions. The text upon which the idea is based makes absolutely no claim to scientific accuracy. In fact, the document was written centuries before the scientific method.That is how your comparison fails. Darwin was wrong in many respects, and scientists rightfully discarded those ideas. Young earth creationism is also false on many points, yet "creation scientists" have not updated their theory.
