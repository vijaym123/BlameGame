#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I think evolution is a far better explanation than the idea that the world is 5000 years old and there's a guy-in-the-sky. Like most scientific theories is not 100% defensible, but on a balance of probabilities, it is the most likely scenario.   />   /> The problem with this debate is that it falls easily into a debate on the existence of God. It is important to note that Evolution could be wrong or right whether God exists or not - in other words, the two arguments, while related, are not identical. Furthermore, an argument on God's existence fails often because it is an argument where one side brings arguments based on logic, whereas the other relies on feelings and more esoteric "reasoning". Evolution is simply a scientific theory and there is no reason why the counterarguments to Evolution shouldn't be scientific.  />   /> While I concede that Evolution theory may be false, at least in some minute details, overall is, in my view, the best and most convincing theory we have to explain our world. That is why I accept it.
