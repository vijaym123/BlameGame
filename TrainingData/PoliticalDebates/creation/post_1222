 You're right, there isn't a shred of positive evidence for creationism and creationists don't even try.  All they do is try to poke holes in evolution as if that does anything whatsoever to prove creationism is at all viable.  />   /> You have to remember that the majority of "professional creationists" are just shysters trying to make a buck out of people's religious gullibility.
