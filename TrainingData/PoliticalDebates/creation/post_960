#originalTopic=Creationism_Or_Evolution
Oh boy, here we go again. Weren't the first 1000 Creationism/Evolution debates enough?Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.Creationism is also a theory and will definitely never be proven because it's untestable, i.e. it relies proving the existence of God first. Scientists have seen organisms evolve into different organisms both directly (e.g. bacteria) and indirectly (e.g. fossils).
