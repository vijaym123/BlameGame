 Evolution is defined in Wikipedia as "a change in the inherited traits of a population from one generation to the next". You refer to the scientific model of evolution which is based on biology - can't see why everyone's jumped on the religion bandwagon by assuming that you are talking about Darwin's Theory of Evolution. So no I disagree that "evolution" is bad - and if you believe that it is bad why are you using the Internet rather than reverting to the "unevolved" practices of our ancestors?
