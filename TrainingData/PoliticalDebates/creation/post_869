Calling the ort cloud a "guess" is disingenuous at best. While no direct observational data confirms its existence, the statistically unlikely clustering of the aphelia (the furthest point in orbit away from the sun) of long period comets strongly imply its existence. And of course, most short period comets, the ones that matter to AiG's calculations, come from the Kuiper belt, which we have directly observed.
