"In Genesis, we have no reason to believe that 'one day' meant any more than 'one day' today."The Bible wasn't written in English, it was written in ancient Hebrew.  In ancient Hebrew, the word "yom" could mean a 12 hour day, a 24 hour day, or simply a long period of time.  Who's to say that's not a couple of billion years?  When it was translated into English in the Middle Ages, there was no reason to believe that it was anything other than a day.  Now, however, as all fields of science point to a signifigantly longer period of time, it is time to reassess the translation, though the text is still valid. (please refer to my other comment on this topic titled "Think about this")  Also, the Kent Hovind thing was an ad hominem, not a straw man.  It was a really good try, though.
