‘Where did I say that???’It was Livvy that originally said it.“Or convection currents, or towards the earth's core, or.... shoot, seems like anything is tried these days. I for one would like to know how such hypothesis could be falsified.”By demonstrating an alternative process would be a good start.  A comprehensive theory of how life began on earth has not yet been developed (though there is a great deal of promising research in that direction).  Once experiments showing the very beginnings of life then a full and falsifiable theory can be developed, but we are still very much in the hypothesis stage.  One could ask how a theory involving an intelligent designer could similarly be falsifiable. “I think even the most uneducated person in this debate can look up the following:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman_Monster    From the above link:"In 1997, Eigen and Oehlenschlager showed that the Spiegelman monster eventually becomes even shorter, containing only 48 or 54 nucleotides, which are simply the binding sites for the reproducing enzyme RNA replicase[2]."”That was over ten years ago… relating to one form of RNA.  More recent research seems to imply otherwise (Powner MW, Gerland B, Sutherland JD (May 2009). "Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible   conditions  ". Nature 459 (7244): 239–42)“Doesn't sound hopeful to me, especially when the most ideal conditions require some "help:"  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/origin_of_life_researchers_int.html    And since you cannot synthesis all the necessary   chemicals   in the same place or get a replicating cycle started:  www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/rnaworld171.htm      www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/ribo171.htm   ”Complete later“Looks like you have some explaining to do, especially when the most causally adequate explanation to date is intelligent intervention.”How is intelligent intervention adequate?  It assumes the existence of something that has never been demonstrated to exists, where as the mechanisms behind   evolution   are observable today.
