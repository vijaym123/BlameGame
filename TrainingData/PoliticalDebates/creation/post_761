The argument you're making would make sense if we could all just go up to God and ask, "Hey, is this true?" and God could give his answer directly to anyone who asked. But remember, when you refer to God's word, you're talking about the transcription of stories that were oral tradition for centuries. That isn't God's word, that's generations and generations of people playing the telephone game with something someone once said he heard from God (sometimes resulting in contradictory statements being supposedly made by the always-correct God). Now, we could use that, or we could use reproducible scientific tests. If you're looking for reliable evidence, there's a clear choice.
