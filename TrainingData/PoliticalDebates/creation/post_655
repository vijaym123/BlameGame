Try and quote the right text next time. Anyways..."That's too bad. But I understand."We CAN discuss that issue AFTER we settle the question of ID=Religion first. "Nope, Pandas is but one part of the argument.Want to try again?"I sure would like to know what those other arguments are. If Pandas fails to be religious in any past present or future form then enlighten me to what the other facts are that make ID's religious nature "well established."
