ID has no merit except as a religious idea.  For ID to be even minimally logical, the IDer must be God.  Positing any other possible Designer is illogical because the question can be fairly asked: where did they come from?  If they are naturally occuring, then we can be too.  If they are not, then ID just posits God at some degree of separation.ID is, in fact, just a version of creationism.  Actually, ID is one of the oldest forms of scientific creationism; a version of it was proposed by William Paley around 1802; about seven (7) years BEFORE CHARLES DARWIN WAS BORN.  The modern version of ID is differnt from Paley's watchmaker, but only because 206 years have passed.  At least Paley was honest enough to not obscure the religious nature of his idea.
