#originalTopic=Creationism_Is_Wrong
 The prospect of creationism is pretty absurd. One can't deny it from a logical point of view. I propose a compromise: Why can't we just agree that God created science and evolution? Wouldn't that yield the same result and please everyone?  />   /> The Scientists:  /> You would still have a place in the world because science would be even more of a mystery if God created it for you (that, and you would still have to figure things out on your own, like a real scientist).  />   /> The Religious People:  /> You can finally say that God created science, but that doesn't change the fact that our knowledge of it is still limited. We will need scientists, yes?  />   /> From what I can see, everyone wins.
