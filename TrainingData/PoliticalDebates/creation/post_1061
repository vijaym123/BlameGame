It's called the THEORY of evolution for a reason. Do you know why? Because it's not the LAW of evolution because it has no proof! Even IF evolution was truth(which it isn't) it doesn't proove against intelligent design. Intelligent design constitutes that something created the universe; Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe.Personally, I believe that the earth and universe was created in six literal days, and evolution has no more proof than creationism IMHO
