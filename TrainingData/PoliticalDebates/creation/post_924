Not only do I think the Young Earth Creationists are wrong in their opinions, I think their teachings should be regarded as blasphemous to God Himself. Those teachings imply that God made the Earth and universe to look billions of years old when they are not, thus making God to be a liar. And so they might as well believe in no God at all. Based on my own experience, I can state that the lies and unsupported claims of Creationism will do far more damage to the faith of Christians than evolution ever will.
