I've studied a lot of Biology and to me evolution has indeed been proved.The way science uses the word "theory" is not the same as the way its used by the general public. The general public uses the word "theory" to describe an assumption, something that may or may not be true, something not proved. Science however, uses it in quite a different context. "Theory" for science is the explanation of how something works. Not an assumption of how it may work, but a thorough and well examined explanation of how it works. Nothing is given the status of a "theory" in science unless it has been tested over and over and over again and proved by other sciences and observation. Take gravity for example. There is the Law of Gravity, which says that things tend to fall downward. Then there is the Theory of Gravity, which explains what Gravity is, what causes it, and how it works. Its not an "assumption" of how it works. Its a proved explanation of it. I have come across many religious people that see evolution as a threat to what they believe. They say it contradicts the theory that God created man. But at no point has the theory of evolution ever claimed to know WHO created the building blocks or the why. In my opinion, there is a way to accept both. If you believe that God created man then evolution is the way by which he went about doing it. What's wrong with that?
