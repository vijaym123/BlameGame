"Who designed the designer?" is a valid and important point, and IDs fatal flaw.  Jay Richards argues that not knowing "Who designed the designer?" does not prove that there was no designer.  Just as design can be inferred from Mount Rushmore (his example) without knowing anything about who designed it or where they came from in turn, so the complexity of life demonstrates design even though we know nothing of the designer except that he/she/they/it exists.  Fine.  I agree that lack of knowledge concerning the designer does not prove he doesn't exist.  I only argue that by IDs OWN ARGUMENT (that complexity requires intelligent design), the complex intelligent designer itself MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN designed, leading to a near-infinite regression that Richards himself acknowledges.  Richards then argues that each person may have his own explanation concerning how the "First Designer", be it god, an advanced alien species, or matter itself (his example), came into existence.  But no matter how you explain the existence of a First Designer, the explanation must either hypothesize complex intelligence in the ABSENCE of a previous designer, or it must hypothesize a supernatural god that who doesn't have to obey ID's rules.  Assuming that you IDers are not hypothesizing god (which would make this a theological debate, and make ID creationism-in-sheep's-clothing), you must then be suggesting that the First Designer would have been complex enough to design the next designer in the chain without being designed itself.  Does your theory allow for the existence of a natural, but complex and intelligent being that was not itself designed?  If not, then we have an infinite regression.  If so, why not hypothesize that Man is that being, and that we just don't yet understand how its possible?  Sid
