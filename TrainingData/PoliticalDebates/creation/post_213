“This whole argument is just using flaws in our definitions..   science   looks for 'supernatural' things all the time.. and sometimes we find them.. and they become natural.”Science does not look for things outside of nature (Super natural) it makes an observation of a phenomena and (under the assumption that there is a natural explanation for the phenomena) attempts to produce a theory that can be used to explain the phenomena, and to predict when the phenomena occurs.“The dragonfly gave us ideas on how to build a helicopter.... but our helicopters suck in comparison.”How so?
