 And this site says it better than I could. I love this site. I often go to read its comments and periodicals and newsletters. Here is an article on ID that does discuss the supernatural and I felt it did so very well.  http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/intelligentdesign.html  There are other nice articles too and I like the resources he uses and states at end of articles.
