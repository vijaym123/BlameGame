The whole point of bringing up the eye example is to demonstrate that ID is an actual theory, and not a simple example in which someone proclaims that something is too complex based on their own judgements.  ID doesn't use the eye example.  Scientists studying simple ribosomes forming in conditions similar to the beginning of the Earth have determined that the chances of those ribosomes forming into a cell by random chance are too small to be statistically signifigant.  It is then logical to posit that something as yet unexplained by science caused this to happen.  There is more, unfortunately, I am not a genetecist, so I can't accurately convey all the juicy details, but many genetecists have come out and said that a designer of some kind is required for genetics to exist.  We don't know what the designer is.  That's the whole point.  It is as yet not understood by science.  It's still a very new and basic theory.  Those questions are all opinion questions.
