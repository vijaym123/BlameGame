--And as with ALL scientific inferences further research can either confirm or refute that inference.--Sure, just like 'we don't know' generates the same research or more than 'design (wink wink)' did it.So at best ID is nothing more than the 'we don't know' position, but rather than calling it ignorance, they call it 'design'. What a bait and switch.
