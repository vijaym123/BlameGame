as has already been covered... the different stories of creation are in perfect agreement - you simply are misunderstanding them.  At the risk of repeating what was already said - Genesis 2:1 is the 6th day and the creation of man...it's not the story of creation - it's a focus on that day of creation in particular...  I don't want to be rude.. but I'm quite shocked that people can't read these two passages without thinking they disagree... It shows to me there's no way God COULD write the story without people disagreeing with it...Seriously... can you imagine a version of the Bible being written that some portion of the world wouldn't say 'That's not God's word... he wouldn't say that' .. or some version that no one would claim that there are contradictions?  I sure can't... man is incredibly faulty..  It's been my opinion that when God created the heavens and earth - and the   animals  .. he had a good thing going.  Then he created man... it's been downhill since.
