"In other words, the terms as defined clearly mirrored what we know as 'creationism' and that it was an inherently religious concept."See the above points, the terms prove no such thing."Even the expert witnesses for the defense, Minnich and Fuller had to admit this. Behe attempted to 'explain' away the evidence but was ruled to be illogical and the weight of the evidence presented."What "evidence?" You have yet to provide anything that says god or the supernatural is directly implicated."The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from "creation" to "intelligent design" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important Edwards decision."Which does nothing but show they wanted people to be aware that they were pursuing a different set of ideas then that of the creationists of the late 80's."This compelling evidence strongly supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled."By itself, no. You would have to find specific passages that state that ID requires God or the Supernatural."Importantly, the objective observer, whether adult or child, would conclude from the fact that Pandas posits a master intellect that the intelligent designer is God."This passage suggests otherwise, it states that, "Some master intellect is the creator of life. But such observable instances of information cannot tell us if the intellect behind them is natural or supernatural.":   http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=796   I would be naive to ignore that passage, it clearly states the opposite of what Judge Jones and the ACLU asserted. "Such is the danger of relying on a biased set of documents from the publishers of Pandas and the Discovery Institute."Such is the dangers of assuming from the start that what Jones (I should just say ACLU) states is true without actually reading the drafts for yourself. "The book argues that the origin of new organisms is "in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent.""Which means nothing more then the fact that the origin of new life forms is not reducible to matter and energy."Clearly supernatural since common intelligent designers do not require immaterial causes."Common designers use more then just ink and paper when planning something, they use information which is in itself, an immaterial cause (not reducible to JUST matter and energy)."In addition, the objections to evolutionary theory mirror the same flawed criticisms of earlier religious opposition."Fallacy of composition. What's true of the parts is not automatically true of the whole. Can you describe some of these criticisms for me?"So no wonder that reviewers such as Kevin Padian, a biologist at University of California Berkeley .. called it "a wholesale distortion of modern biology."Seems like everyone has different reasons for critiquing ID, most that I see attack it's credibility as science without really addressing the arguments themselves, but that would be part of a totally different discussion altogether. "Creation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc"Hold on......."Exactly mirroring Christian apologetics..."......except there is no mention of the special creation taking place in a day (or less then a week), nothing that states the earth is 10,000 years old, nothing which explains the geography of the earth by means of a global catastrophic flood (nothing mentioning flood geology either), nothing that says that there is a separate ancestry for humans and apes, or that the universe had a sudden creation out of nothing by either god or a supernatural being of any kind
