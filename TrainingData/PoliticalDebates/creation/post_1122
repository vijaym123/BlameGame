#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 I believe its right. My scientific evidence is the fossil record, (You may look that up.) My religious belief is this... Pope Pius once said that, "True science finds God behind every door" This is saying that science is just mans way of explaining Gods workings. Evolution is creation. For all of you who want to disprove me by saying from the bible, God made the earth in six days and rested on the seventh; allow me to tell you what I believe with a verse from the bible too. It says something like this. The human life is like a vapor of smoke to God. This is saying that the 100 years of a human life is like a second to God. So seven days very well may have been billions of years.
