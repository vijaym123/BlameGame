"there was much that Darwin did not know at that time that we now know, and his original theory has since been supplanted by more modern versions of his theory."First, don't make a   darwin  -of-the-gaps argument.  Intelligent causation has no role in   science  .  Second, if conflicting evidence does not refute evolutionary theory, then neither does it refute ID.  Why can't ID simply be revised rather than abandoned if there is ever conflicting evidence?"Charles Darwin would not have been aware of the Cambrian explosion."  There is no evidence that such a being existed.  However, the Origin of Species does talk about the Cambrian Explosion as problematic.  "The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists—for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick—as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of   evolution   through natural selection.” - p. 344; "The case at present must remain inexplicable, and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained.” -p. 351."can you demonstrate that the sequence gtgtgtg is less likely to occur via random chance then ctaagtcg?"I never stated that gtgtgtg was less likely to occur than ctaagtcg.  Since it contains only two letters instead of 4 it would actually be more likely to occur, but that's not the point.  What's-his-face asked me to explain what is meant by specified complexity and that is what I did."It was put forth that the flagellum was irreducibly complex, this was shown to be false"An untestable claim cannot be shown to be false.
