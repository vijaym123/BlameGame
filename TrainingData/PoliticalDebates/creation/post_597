--Jim--3. Design fails to place ‘design’ at risk. This is partially true. If and when the arguments are answered, such as how DNA evolved, the flagellum, etc., then the ID argument becomes weaker and weaker, as it should. The reverse should also be true. Until that time many of it’s arguments seem to be the most reasonable inference based on the evidence as we understand it today.--But ID does not explain anything, it merely states 'designed' without anything else. In fact, as Dembski has argued, design does not necessarily necessitate an intelligent designer. How can ID's argument become any weaker when it cannot even compete with 'we don't know' which is a far more scientific default position when our ignorance does not allow us to propose anything relevant yet. Furthermore, unlike science, there is no way ID's position could be strengthened as ignorance nor the absence of an evolutionary explanation can be taken as evidence in favor of 'design'. Unless we define 'design' as 'that which we do not yet understand'. But why call it design then?
