As for scientific evidence for ID start with the genetic code. The day we observe nature, operating freely, putting together a code is the day that MicroSoft will lay off all their programmers because they are unecessary.--PvMPlease tell us how does ID explain the genetic code, and I am sure you can explain to us the various hypotheses and the evidence as to how science explains it.---ID explains the genetic code the same way we explain a computer code.Again instead of asking questions all you have to do is to demonstrate that nature, operating freely can put together such a code.However it is obvious you will never even attempt such a thing.PvM:But you have made a clear case that ID is all about ignorance, your 'bottom line' betrays' you.--Now you are just lying. I have stated that ID relies on our experience, which means it does NOT rely on our ignorance.YOUR position, however, counts on ignorance.Also ID was NOT created to get "God" into anything. But thatnk you for onbce again demonstrating your dishonesty.It is clear that ID is an areligious approach to origins.
