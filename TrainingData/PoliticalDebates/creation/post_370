--BTW you people continue to ignore the fact that natural processes cannot account for the origins of nature because natural processes only exist IN nature.--Are you saying that natural processes can account for the evolution of nature because only natural processes exist in nature?--Joe GIt is a fact that design can be determined in the absence of a designer.--Sure, by understanding the constraints of the designer, the general motives, opportunities and means and other circumstantial evidence. This is called ordinary design.ID is about rarefied design which refuses to contrain the designer and thus lack a reliable method to infer design.I assume you have yet to read Wilkins and Elsberry's paper on this?That's a shame because it would lift a piece of the veil of ignorance we see so typically covering ID proponents' knowledge about science, whether it is the fact of common descent, a fact which even Behe accepts, or the scientific vacuity of design.
