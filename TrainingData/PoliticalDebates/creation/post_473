Well, isn't that what the whole debate here is about.  There are a growing number of scientists who do not believe that methodological naturalism can answer or solve all the difficult problems of the origin of life and evolution.  Methodological naturalism works well in the here and now, but when we go back to origins, the past, when we cannot see what actually happened, a lot of interpretation is necessary.  It cannot be repeated so is in some senses, not true science.  Your opinion is that it works so well.  Fine.  A growing number of scientists are standing up and saying "Hey, wait a minute, when it comes to origins, methodological materialism is lacking."  ID is about showing evidence to support this idea.Again, you may have faith that methodological materialism will solve all of these problems in the distant future.  Great.  That is your belief.  However, it is nothing more than that - a belief, a stand of faith.  There is no guarantee.ID scientists are saying "I don't think that will happen and here is why." Why can't we give them a voice since no one really knows?tj
