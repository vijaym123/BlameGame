Several scientists have already admitted that the account of Creation as described in Genesis has definite validity.  Imagine that!  Science and the Scriptures agreeing on something - that's because the same God who created our Universe also created   science   and mathematics.  That is also how I feel about this issue, and I would appreciate everyone's respect on my opinion.  But Sidneyc, I am all for the scientific reproduction of body parts like ears, noses, and limbs, not as a means of mass production, so to speak, but rather as a genuine procedure to restore quality of life to millions of survivors.  Think of the enormous benefits and psychological improvements to people whose faces have been disfigured,   workers   who have lost their fingers, feet, or other limbs in serious accidents, or   children   who were born blind or with some other birth defect.  Not all of what researchers are doing in this field for future generations is evil or bad: God gave them the knowledge and ability to pursue these goals and make them a reality.  I look forward to the day when science and   medicine   will finally be able to restore a person's sight or hearing without the help of permanently-embedded artificial devices.  To that I say, Hallelujah, Amen!
