Genesis 1:31 and 2:1 say: "And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. [The heavens and the earth finished in six days.]Genesis 2:1 says: "And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done."[God finished his work on the seventh day.]Genesis 2:4b-7 says: "In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up- for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground - then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."[the day of creation]A one day creation, a six day creation and a seven day creation. That's what you get if you interpret the Bible literally.
