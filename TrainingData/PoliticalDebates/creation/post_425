Could it be that you are biased against   religion  ? Because, I hate to break it to you but   Christians   believe that the world is round, so does that mean you disagree? Your foundation should be on whether or not your point of view is provable and truthful. I think   intelligent design   has merit on the same level as any other possible theories such as   creationism   and when we are closed minded to options thats when the evolution theory starts to break down and its probability is no more likely than any other theory, a hypothesis at best.
