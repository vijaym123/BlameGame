 Wow. Do you really think that a theory with NO evidence would be as widely recognized in the science world (and the rest of the world as well)? That doesn't make any sense.  There's a lot of evidence, I'm just not going to give examples because that would take a long time.  But really, how would such a  controversial theory (especially at the time it was proposed) get as far as it did with no evidence?
