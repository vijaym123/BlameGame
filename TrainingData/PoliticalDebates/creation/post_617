I am fast drawing to the conclusion that this discussion will never end.  Not becuase one side is confused and the other is not.  Not because one side understands science and the other does not.  Scott Minnich, Michael Behe and Guillermo Gonzalez are all scientist.  They promote ID and have been attacked.  They understand the issues as well as their opponents.  I have heard their opponents over and over try to donflate ID with creationism.  I think this is deliberate.  This shows a weakness.  I guess it's true a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.  Unpopular ideas seldom get a fair hearing.  Time will tell.
