--Robert CrowtherLike modern evolutionary theory there is more than just one side to the debate. --Any suggestions to what debates you may be referring?As to DeWolf et al, where they not the ones who also wrote a publication that argued that it was constitutional to teach ID? One of the main causes of the Dover disaster in my opinion?After all if ID has a valid secular purpose, then no matter what the motivations of the board may have been, such a purpose would have overruled any concerns.Ah, yes the by now infamous    http://www.arn.org/docs/dewolf/guidebook.htm    --Local school boards and state education officials are frequently pressured to avoid teaching the controversy regarding biological origins. Indeed, many groups, such as the National Academy of Sciences, go so far as to deny the existence of any genuine scientific controversy about the issue.160 Nevertheless, teachers should be reassured that they have the right to expose their students to the problems as well as the appeal of Darwinian theory. Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution-and this includes the use of textbooks such as Of Pandas and People that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.--Ironic isn't it "Of Pandas and People", of all books. Was that not the book which was at the center of stage in Dover?
