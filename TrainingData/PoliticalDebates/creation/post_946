Yeah that's kinda true.. however I don't think it's as widely accepted as you think it is. Maybe with the scientific community, educated community, developed countries it's more popular.. but outside of that where the vast majority lies it's much less popular.I know there's a few.. maybe not a lot.. but a few people who are smart, religious, educated etc. but choose to deny evolution because they're strongly religious and say that because it doesn't agree with them.. they don't believe in it.
