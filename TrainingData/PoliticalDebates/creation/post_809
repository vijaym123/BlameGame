The absence of a creator is not an assumption of the sciences. Scientists almost always rely upon methodological naturalism, the assumption that explanations of observable effects are most useful when they describe specific (natural) mechanisms. This has worked well so far, but nothing in the scientific method precludes supernatural explanations if the observations warrant it.Scientists gave intelligent design a fair chance. Once upon a time, intelligent design did made a prediction that we could measure and verify. It predicted that life would have "irreducibly complex" structures that could not have evolved by natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous mutations. Several candidates of irreducibly complex structures were suggested, and scientists took a careful look at each. Not one turned out to be irreducibly complex.That's worth repeating: No biological structure is known to be irreducibly complex.This is why intelligent design was rejected. It made predictions that further investigation found to be false. The vast majority of scientific ideas die this way; it's okay. The only unscientific feature of modern intelligent design is the unwillingness of many to abandon it in light of these new observations.
