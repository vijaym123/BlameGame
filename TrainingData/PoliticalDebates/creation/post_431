Pandasthumb also explored these 'accusations'    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/kitzmillerrelat.html    Enjoy--We can learn a great deal about the nature of life by com- paring body systems among invertebrate groups and by tracing the patterns of change as we move from one phylum to an- other. As we do so, it is important to keep this concept in mind: Evolution is random and undirected. A common misconception is that evolution has proceeded from one group of organ- isms toward a goal of perfection. This is definitely not true. Organisms are not better or worse than one another Ð they are simply different. And the ways in which organisms carry out their essential life functions are neither more nor less perfect than one another Ð they are merely different methods of accomplishing the tasks necessary for survival.--Context matters as does complete reporting of the facts.
