 The theories of Evolution and Creationism are not mutually exclusive but are actually complimentary.  Simply put, Evolution explains the history of the human beings physical transformation over time, and Creationism explains the birth of the human soul and spirit.  (See the opening scene in the move "2001: A Space Odyssey" when the first monkey, in the presence of the great black monolith, gains the consciousness needed to crossover and become human in spirit.)   /> The book of Genesis was written in the literary form of allegory typical of its period and was never meant to be a scientific manual.  History tells us that science as an empirically studied discipline did not come into existence until the late the 18th century in Europe so to think that the Book of Genesis some 5000 years before should have included more scientific evidence is simply preposterous.  /> And despite all of the advances in science today, no one will ever find the fossilized remains of the human spirit in any rock.   Human beings would never have discovered the theory of evolution were it not for the gift of intellectual consciousness which uniquely distinguishes us from all other species.     /> For those then who believe only in Evolution, life is but a scientific accident, a metaphysical mistake.  For those who believe only in Creationism, life is just magic.  Given the choice between "magic" or a "mistake", I choose Purpose.
