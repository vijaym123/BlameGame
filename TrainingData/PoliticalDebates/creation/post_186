"In fact, the history of life shows a pattern of explosions where new fossil forms come into existence without any clear evolutionary precursors, concurring with design theory that predicts that species might appear abruptly."Can someone that believes in ID please explain this "abrupt" design of species. When the design happens does a herd of the new species miraculously materialize into existence? Are they born to mothers of a completely different species?I'll consider that ID is more than smoke and mirrors if someone can give me good answers to how these designed species come into existence.
