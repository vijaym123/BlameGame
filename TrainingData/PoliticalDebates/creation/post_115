  Intelligent design does have merit. However it maybe usefulto use clearer terms then, "intelligent design". (Designed with for knowledge of purpose), is much more to the point.   Macro Evolution is all about, problem solving mechanisms, spontaneously generating.    It is difficult, even improbable to imagine how such a process could happen; without being jump started. There are as many opposing forces in the environment as there are beneficial. How could, fragile, non-evolved life, survive in a hostile environment? Further, what would cause successfuldesigns to leave one environment, for a totally alien environments? Sea life too land life.  There would be nothing that would lead a successful species, to make such a drastic move from one environment to a totally alien one, and fill the earth. Unless we view the environment as an intelligent entity.. IF such change was forced upon a species by catastrophic events, the species would become extinct; before random mutation, could find the correct body designs, to allow survival. So not only is the survival of the first life improbable, without pre-designed survival mechanisms. Life evolving  drastic body plan changes, to survive in totally different environments. Is also unlikely to have happened.    I don't believe an honest mind could conclude this happened incrementally over eons of time. No matter how much time is involved, because with that idea, your always putting the cart before the horse. The designed (cart) can be pulled by the environment (horse). But a horsecannot build a cart. Neither can it change a cart into a boat or airplane.The mindless environment can't do anything, without a pre-designed mechanism. We don't see the environment incubating new life,  or totally new body plans today. Why would we conclude it only happened in the past;in a even more hostel environment?!
