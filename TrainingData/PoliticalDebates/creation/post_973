Fact shmakt.That is just your opinion.Not everyone evolves. Look at Neanderthals. What happened to them? Did they die out on their own? Or was it MURDER?!!!And if its true that humans killed off the Neanderthals, can we really say it was natural selection; or is it necessarily artificial selection, having been done at the hands of humankind?*"This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection." - Charles Darwin,On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.
