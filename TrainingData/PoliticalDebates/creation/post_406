"According to its advocates, the "designer" responsible for "intelligent design" in biology could be any sort of "creative intelligence" capable of engineering the basic elements of life. Some have even seriously nominated advanced space aliens for the role."Now let's see, 100 billion galaxies ... but nah, mankind is the only intelligent being in existence. "[a] premise seems to be that as long as [we] don't explicitly name the "designer"--as long as [we] allow that the "designer" could be a naturally existing being, a being accessible to scientific study--that this somehow saves [a] viewpoint from the charge of being inherently religious in character."Absolutely.  There are two basic reasons to postulate anything.  (1) A desire for it to be true (agenda), or (2) it fits the evidence (objectivism).  Regarding a designer or creator, there is a third motivation for another position.  (3) A desire for total independence, and/or the belief that one has logic that eclipses traditional beliefs.  Atheism is more of a position of arrogance than one of objectivism.ID postulates on evidence, not a religious position.  Arguing that it is a tactic or a guise, simply because it may be in some cases, fails objectivism.  It is more of a deterministic stance, i.e. arrogance. "One does not explain complexity by dreaming up a new complexity as its cause."Sorry to go against William Occam's easily falsifiable viewpoint, but complexity is the more the norm than the exception.  And not by happenstance, but by design.
