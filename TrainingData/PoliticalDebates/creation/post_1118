#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Yes, the theory of evolution is wrong, it got popular when Darwin wrote the book "The Origin of Species" but later on many scientists proved from several experiments that it is an incorrect theory.  />   /> Even if evolution is correct, then why have we not seen any change in known history? By just using your common sense you can see that evolution is a fake theory. Many scientists have also confessed it. For example, you can see the result in the modern science journals. One of these results is here, it is narrated in "Science, vol. 207, 7 March 1980, p. 1103; A. J. Kelso, Physical Anthropology, 1st ed., J. B. Lipincott Co., New York, 1970, p. 221; M. D. Leakey, Olduvai Gorge, vol. 3, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1971, p. 272." that by outlining the link chain as Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens, evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.  />   /> So, you can see from above passage that scientists have themselves confessed, unconsciously, the right thing.
