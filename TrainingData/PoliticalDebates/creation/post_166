From Wikipedia, the Scientific Method!1. Define the question2. Gather information and resources 3. Form hypothesis 4. Perform experiment and collect data5. Analyze data6. Interpret data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis7. Publish results8. Retest So you're telling me that a procedure that starts with 3, moves to 2, pretends to have done 4, combines 5 and 6, and never ever touches on 6 or 8 or 1 is "scientific?"
