"Yet it demonstrated a radical   change   over the comparatively short span of twenty years."Time is not as relevant in evolutionary theory as is the number of generations that reproduce.  Over the span of 20 years Lenski attempted to evolve 40,000 generations of e. coli, which is the equivalent of 1.2 million years for humans (e. coli can create 6.64 generations per day, the equivalent of 166 years for humans).  Essentially then, the e. coli had 1.2 million years to change into a new species via natural selection and random mutation.  Evolutionary theory claims that the past 1.2 million years of our history has included not just one but at least three examples of speciation via random mutation and natural selection.  The e. coli did not undergo any speciation even though it is a much simpler organism.  Lenski's study failed to find support for evolutionary theory.  It did find support for change over time, but change over time is something that no ID theorist denies."can you describe an experiment similar to the Lenski experiment that could be used to test ID?"Signature in the Cell by Stephen Meyer is the best source I know that you could turn to for an answer.  "What experiment could be performed to show the action of a designer?"An analysis of the coded language within DNA, as well as any examination of irreducibly complex systems in an organism.  It is not the scientific community's belief that we must see a designer designing in order to infer design.  Otherwise, you and I would have no idea if Lenski ever designed his experiment since we never actually observed him doing so.
