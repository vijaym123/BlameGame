#originalTopic=There_Is_No_Evidence_For_Evolution
 I don't believe in evolution, or anything contemporary beyond the dictionary definition of it. But one thing many non evolutionists need to believe is, that most evolutionists have way too many ways of defining evolution. First there is periodic evolution, then a gradual changing species, or even a change in genetic DNA(not mutation but simple reproduction). The DNA example can be something as insignificant as my parents made me and that is sufficient enough as proof as I am a byproduct of evolution. Any way you flip it, the hard result is that I am still a human being. Not evolving too fast, eh? I think we need to better define what is evolving and how other than the use of pictographs and stuff. It makes it hard to argue because I believe in Creationism (not trying to through religion into the argument.) And I am trying to be as respectable to evolutionists and am eagerly awaiting opinions.
