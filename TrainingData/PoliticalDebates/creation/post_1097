#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_True
 I'm voting no based on the title of the debate and it's relationship to the explanation.  /   /> Evolution is true, is a statement that would be (it's usually stated as Evolution is a fact) and is debated at length amongst learned people who accept the substantial volume of evidence that supports the theory of evolution.  />   /> These debates usually revolve around the scientific definitions of truth, fact and theory.  />   /> The explanation that a belief in evolution is based on it being a very logical explanation is not good enough to claim it as being true.  />   /> There have been many findings regarding evolution that are fact. Certain processes of evolution are fact. This makes evolution "true" in a sense.  />   /> The unifying theory of evolution is supported by these facts and for all practical purposes is "true" but history has taught us that what at this time can be for all practical purposes "true", can later "evolve" into something that is more "true".  />   /> In the sense that the science of evolution has to deal with the idiocy of people refusing to accept any of the known facts relating to the process of evolution because they see it as a threat to their spiritual beliefs (which is ludicrous), evolution must be presented as "true", even at the cost of scientific definitions.  />   /> But that's ok...it's not like there's a clear and present danger of the scientific definitions being too watered down at the present time.  />   /> I just have to put up with the rape of the definitions used on this site by a few who use the mutated definitions in their arguments against theism.  />   /> Hizashi has to put up with the raping of Biblical passages used by some of the religious people on this site in their arguments against evolution so let the idiocy continue.
