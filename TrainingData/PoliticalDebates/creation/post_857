I think you hit the nail on the head here.  This entire argument is based on our limitations AND projections.  Why do we have to be so arrogant as to think we could understand creation, or any of God's other activities, purposes, or ways?  Romans 1 tells us that God reveals aspects of his divine nature--We witness the evidence, not necessarily comprehend it.My basic problem with "science" on these matters is that it is not true science.  Agendas are littered about.
