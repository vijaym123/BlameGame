 Actually, most leading scientists nowadays support evolution, and of course it's going to have massive holes in it: That's what makes it a theory.  As with most theories, Darwin was not the only one to hook onto the idea - there was also Wallace, Lamarck and several others around that time. And there are masses of evidence for the theory of evolution. You shouldn't immediately dismiss it because it states in a religious book that God created everything in seven days with the click of his fingers, which is an insupportable idea. Besides, many Christian priests have accepted that God created us through evolution :D As for the question 'Even if evolution is correct, why have we not seen any change since the known history?' Have you been living in a cave? Switch over to the UKTV Documentary once in a while. You'll find that species are changing and forming all the time as changes in the environment force them to. You have to understand adaptation before you debate evolution.
