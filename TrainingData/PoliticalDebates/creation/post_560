After admitting that science is not atheistic, he now accuses atheists, scientists and Christians alike of not liking ID's implications when in fact, anyone should realize that these objections are firstmost about the lack of scientific content of ID and that the strong religious foundation of ID is only secondary to this.ID is invalidated as science by its lack of scientific relevance caused by their reliance on an eliminative approach to detect design, causing their 'design' inferences to be nothing more than a position of 'we don't know' without providing any secondary information as to why their 'explanation' is better than 'we don't know'. Calling it an inference to the best explanation does not make it so. It's all smoke and mirrors.PS: Since Newton invoked the necessity of a God to explain the stable orbits of planets and since science showed this to be unnecessary later, does this mean that God has been disproven? No, at best one could say that this showed a foolish ignorance causing Newton to invoke an 'explanation' that explains nothing.
