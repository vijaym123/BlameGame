 Who enters into a scientific debate about evolution asking only for opinions? Are you serious? Forget opinions. This is science we’re talking about, not political controversies concerning presidential candidates. My bet is that you probably don’t know hardly anything about evolution to begin with. With that being said, I’ll ask you a simply question before proceeding any further in such a debate. In layman’s terms, what does evolutionary theory postulate? If you can answer this question correctly, I’ll go on to show you some evidence for the theory.
