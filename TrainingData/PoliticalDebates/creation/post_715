People tend to focus on the trees.. and miss the forest entirely.Such simplistic arguments like 'How could you have a day if there wasn't a sun yet?'...*sigh*Such a limited creation we are... so lost in the details.  If you really must have an answer to such a question... simply put - God invented the very concepts of day and night... and even if there were no sun yet, a day was still a day.  Or maybe he did it just so that you would ask the question I suppose..  There is some truth to that as well.. I know that much of what God has done was deliberately intended to cause debates like this.  Atheists absolutely hate that response, they maintain that a loving God would never want to confuse us.  I agree, he didn't want to confuse us.. but he did want to leave plenty of room for you to not believe in him.  It's completely your choice - your free will.  Faith is not suppose to be easy.
