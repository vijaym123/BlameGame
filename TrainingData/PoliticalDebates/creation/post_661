I can't say I agree with too much of what zebrakin said, so I won't defend him. I however, would like to reply to a couple claims you made about ID:1. "Less illustratively, teachers do not have freedom of speech when teaching children. I cannot go into school tomorrow and tell all the children in the class and express political opinions. I cannot go and express theological opinions. (Children: pray to Satan. I'm sure I won't get fired for telling you to do this...) Teachers simply do not have the same freedom to express their opinions in the class room as you have in a public forum."Then why are they told the only "good" religion out there is religion in which   evolution   is accepted? Does this not violate the very rule you elaborated on?   http://www.discovery.org/a/2978  Not to mention the fact that bringing satanism to the table and saying that a teacher would say SPECIFICALLY to pray to satan under a fairness curriculum is a complete straw man."I know you believe that ID is excluded from scientific texts because of its religious connotations. You probably wont believe me but nothing could be further from the truth."So it has nothing to do with BS claims about the contents of early drafts for ID books or alleged right-wing theocratic conspiracies???"ID is excluded from scientific text books simply because of its lack of scientific standing."What does it lack that would give it standing?"If ID researcher had productive scientific careers resolving longstanding questions of theory, then I can assure you ID would quickly be adopted by grant hungry professors everywhere."So since that's been taken care of in the form of dozens of books, websites, etc. what happens now?"To provide the most succinct summary I can: ID cannot be taught in a science classroom because no arguments in favor of it are scientific."Why not?
