as much as Behe's somewhat misleading--Yet, when Lenski tracked down the mutations, they tended to be degradative changes, ones which destroyed genes or made them less efficient. That is not the sort of process one needs to build complex molecular systems.--Your comments showed that you also understand that fitness is not determined by a single cause/effect. For instance, while some mutations may cause a fitness decrease in one aspect of the organism and an increase in another, the overall effect may thus be very well positive. To call the change degenerative misses the point.I hope to report more on Hubert Simon's work, quite interesting.
