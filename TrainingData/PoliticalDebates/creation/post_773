You're missing the point about the four rivers. A global flood powerful enough to carve the Grand Canyon from scratch, split one continent into seven, deposit miles of sediments... and yet four rivers remain on the surface near each other and identifiable by the same names. Just another miracle...Self consistency is not self authentication. The Bible doesn't come with a checksum.Nice avoidance of answering the question, "How does Genesis help oil companies find oil?" Here's the one perfect truthful book about the earth's past, and nothing in it can help a petroleum geologist??? How does assuming the Bible is literally true about a six day creation add anything to the observations of materialistic science? Every time they drill for oil, they are making a prediction about the past. When archaeologists go to a specific kind of rock to find a specific kind of fossil, as Shubin describes about Tikkalik, they are making a prediction about the past.Geology has a lot to do with evolution. We don't find plants and animals in random places in the geologic column, we find them in strata with a correlation of geolgic age and development. Plate tectonics unexplained by secular geology?? Plate tectonics IS secular geology!
