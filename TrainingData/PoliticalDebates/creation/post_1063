A theory (as the word is used by scientists) is a detailed description of some aspect of the universes workings that is based on long-continued observation and, where possible, experiment, that is the result of careful reasoning from those oservations and experiments, and that has survived the critical studies of scientists generally.Example... we have the description of the cellular nature of living organisms (the "cell theory"), of objects attracting each other according to the fixed rule (the theory of gravitation), of energy behaving in discrete bits (the quantum theory), of light traveling through a vacuum at a fixed measurable velocity (the theory of relativity). I could go on and on... but I think you get the picture. All are theories... all are firmly founded... all are accepted as valid descriptions of whatever aspect of the universe. AND NO THEORY is better founded, more closely examined, more critically argued, and more thoroughly accepted than the theory of evolution. If it is only a "theory"... that is all it has to be.Creationism... on the other hand... IS NOT A THEORY! There is no evidence, in the scientific sense, that supports it. Creationism is an expression of Middle Eastern legend. It is no more than a MYTH."Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe."Not a very good choice of words, by the way... atheists believe that God IS Nothing (in other words... something that is non-existent).
