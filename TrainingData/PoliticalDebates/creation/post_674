Purelabor claims that there is no proof for either side. Now I appreciate that he admits that ID has not proof but evolutionary theory is based on an exceptional depth and breadth of evidence.To call Darwin a true racist you have to ignore the facts. But I understand that calling him a racist is much easier than to refute his theory.Oh, I understand.Ignorance is a powerful motivator amongst some creationists, ID reinforces that by calling it design.
