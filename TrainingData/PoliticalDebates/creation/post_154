Intelligent Design is a dishonest way for   creationism   to try to appear scientific.  It's kind of silly when you think about it. Denying nature, the creationists attempt to replace   evolution   with biblical nonsense.  They pretend that some bodiless ghost is the cause of everything in the universe and conceal their beliefs behind a psuedo-scientific cloak of "intelligent design."
