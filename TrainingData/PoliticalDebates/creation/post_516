Just what if there is a Creator?  Isn't science after truth?  Has science proven that there is no Creator? Why is recognizing the possibility that there was intelligence behind the emergence of life a non-scientific idea?  Basically what you are saying is that if there was a Creator or intelligence behind the emergence of life, science will never be able to come up with the right answer, right?So your whole premise for ID being non-scientific is the unproven worldview of naturalism?You start off right from the get go with the assumption that there is no Creator or any intelligence involved in the emergence of life and go and try and prove your idea with science.If you want to limit science to working within the little box of naturalism, fine, but then, you have to admit that you might be wrong from the start.  I think that is what ID is trying to show us.  They simply want to show that there is good scientific evidence for considering the role of intelligence in the emergence of life.  Does that fit with naturalism?  No, but since when must scientists bow the knee to naturalism to do good science?Many great scientists of the past did not bow the knee to Naturalism and yet we revere them today for their amazing achievements.  Looking for design in nature is a great way to do science.  Naturalists have no way to explain the amazing desing we see in Nature.  Their philosophy would not predict order and design, yet that is exactly what we find.  If you have the faith to believe in millions of naturalistic miracles of chance, great.  I admire your faith.  But not everyone has as much faith in the random powers of evolution.Since you cannot even prove your worldview, don't you think it would be wise to look at both sides of the issue if you are sincerely after the truth?....I do.
