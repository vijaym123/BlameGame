"The NCSE says that "   intelligent design    is a religiously motivated attack on science", but the NCSE does not claim that is WHY it should be REJECTED. Luskin just made that part up so that he could beat up on a straw man." You must be joking, do you really think the idea (with no proof) that ID is a religiously motivated attack on science is not a claim used to reject ID??? Speaking of Straw man attacks......   http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/a_list_of_selected_responses_t.html   "Religious motives of ID proponents help keep non-science nonsense out of the public high school classroom. But ID is unscientific for entirely different reasons (as explored in the other articles on this site)."After a long and repetitive debate with PvM on the issue of religious motivations, I think there might be a ray of hope for you guys when it comes to the notion that ID is unscientific. Can you explain the rationale behind the notion that ID is not science?"Of course ID should be rejected because it's non-science nonsense."How so? (see above)
