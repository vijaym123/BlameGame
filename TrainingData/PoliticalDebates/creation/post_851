With all due respects, here is my Bottom Line, though I run the risk of being arrogan and "closed-minded," I only write for the Judeo-Christian World View.  This is mainly due to a time-factor...I only have one life on Earth in which to learn.  Therefore, I don't have time to explore any other world views because there is still so much for me to learn from this one.Your point is well-taken.  My applied logic only works for those who see the world as I do...However, I will address a couple of your concerns.First, since it is impossible for God to sin, God would never be deceptive.  Yet, THAT once given, we may now turn our attention to humans who do something similar.  It is openly taught on HGTV!It's the creation of faux surfaces, like faux rust and faux marble.  For our discussion faux rust is the most germaine.  These artists create rust and various apparently aged surfaces through chemical processes that could be expected to leave various types of residue.If The LORD chose to do something, like that, He could do an infinitely better job than we humans can.My point in my original comment was not to state some superior knowledge, but to explore a probable hypothesis that explains logically (at least to my mind) how the world works.Thanks for just a little room for letting a guy "think out-loud."  :)
