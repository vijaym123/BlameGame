"In fact, the history of life shows a pattern of explosions where new fossil forms come into existence without any clear evolutionary precursors, concurring with design theory that predicts that species might appear abruptly."This is a good example of how ID creationists describe the scientific data of the Cambrian explosion. They even extensively quote mine expert Valentine who recently has argued that based on the evidence, he believes that Darwinian processes are quite sufficient to explain this so called 'explosion' which was neither an explosion nor without evolutionary precursors.Weird stuff, but anyone familiar with the vast research in this area has to reject these simplistic and even erroneous representations of the Cambrian 'explosion'.So why do we still hear about them?
