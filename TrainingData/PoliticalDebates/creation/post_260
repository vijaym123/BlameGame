"Because   science   as we know it today can only answer one of them."Why not?  What qualities does the designers have that make them beyond study?"I would think not, since ID only tries to identify the features of the natural world which are designed... and nothing more. Asking questions about the designer are separate from determining if something was planned or not."I don't see it that way.  A theory quantifying the designers, which could be used to make accurate predictions about their next action, would solidify ID as a working theory.  Without that then the argument that random mutation can only go so far, but not further (even when given an arbitrarily long period of time), is still a better discription."Maybe, but those questions can be inferred without knowledge of intentions and methods."I would think that it would be beyond maybe.  Knowing the nature of the designers would give a huge amount of insight into why they were designing life on this planet.  Knowing the methods would allow us to replicate them in the laboratory.We could also go and meet them, I know I've several complaints on this body they designed for me that I'd like to have cleared up.
