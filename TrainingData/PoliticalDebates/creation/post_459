This objection highlights one of the problems with public education: the government should not be in the position of deciding what people ought to believe about science anymore than they should decide what people ought to believe about religion. We should have a separation of education and state for the same reason that we have a separation of church and state. So long as education remains in the government's hands, however, it must not introduce religion into public education. As ARI makes clear, ID is nothing more than religion with a pseudo-scientific veneer. It does not belong in the public schools.
