["Is   intelligent design   science?"]"Most definitely yes, otherwise no one could argue it was wrong in the first place."But we are not arguing that it is wrong.We are arguing that it is not right or wrong, it's "not even wrong".There is no definition of "intelligent design" that would allow a scientist to determine if it's right or wrong.There is only the "I know it when I see it" interpretation of the "evidence" of the "natural world".  But if "interpretations" are personal and cannot be agreed upon, then it's not science."If it didn't [matter] then you wouldn't be wasting your time injecting as much commentary on the topic as you already have."Non sequitur.  The creationists of the Texas State Board of Education wish to claim that there are "weaknesses" in evolution.  "Intelligent design" attempts to provide support for such opinions.  Therefore "intelligent design" should be properly smacked down as non-science nonsense.  That's why it "matters".
