the physical reality to which Behe so proudly points is a stylized cartoon of reality. Sure we can make designed things look designed but the actual flagellum hardly looks like the strawmen pictures by ID. Since ID seems to want to make its argument based on the similarity between a non-existent theory and physical reality, it seems to me that there are some 'minor' wrinkles to be worked out.
