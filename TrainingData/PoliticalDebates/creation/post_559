tjWho the designer is has nothing to do with ID theory and everyone knows that.But, let's just say for sake of argument, that there is a Creator. So if there is some kind of intelligence behind earthly life, and again, no one has disproven this as a possibility, then it would seem that the theory of evolution (where everything evolved by random chance with no goal or purpose in mind) would not stand up to the evidence.  Right?  Wouldn't that be the case?tj10--Capitalizing "Creator" in the second above paragraph invalidates the first statement. TJ: WRONG!  I was just using that as an example of one possibility.  And you didn't refute that logic.  Since you can't prove there isn't, since you can't prove that the answer to the puzzle of life lies totally within natural means in spite of the undeniable design, specified information in the DNA, and complexities of life, then a rational person would be willing to consider all possibilities.  Of course, a Creator does seems to me to be the most likely answer to who the designer might be, but so what?  What does that matter?  Why does that invalidate ID as science?  It is not a scientific question.  Science cannot answer that subject so that is not a part of Intellectual Design theory.  That is not a subject for science class.  ID is simply about the evidence for design.  If there is a Designer, then it naturally follows that there should be evidence for design.  Atheists don’t like ID simply because of it’s implications.  You may not like those implications, but that does not make it unscientific. That’s all I have time to write right now.tj
