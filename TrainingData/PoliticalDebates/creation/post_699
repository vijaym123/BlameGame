I recall somewhere in genesis when   god   banished and marked cain, some sort of reference to other people being alive other than just the "first" family (ie adam,eve,cain, and abel) and that the only reason that he would have marked abel was to protect him, but protect him from whom if they are indeed the only other people? so that logically leads to the assumption that there were other people living along side the "first family".
