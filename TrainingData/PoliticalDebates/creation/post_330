I hope not to be too snarky, but the Pope finally got around to admitting that  Galileo was correct in teaching that the Earth revolved around the sun (get the gravity connection). With the Pope on board, whose going to argue against gravity now?As simple as gravity appears, it holds deep fascination for today's scientists. Despite the accuracy with which we calculate orbits and such, systematic variations are observed that tell us that we don't know everything about it! The LIGO facility in Richland, WA is carrying out some of the most exquisite measurements ever made by man, hoping to learn more.  We know not what will come out form the new data.How would a PhD in Theology be a failure in biology?  Such a silly question. Of what use is it to know how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? Or how hard it would be for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle? There's not much work going on there. Better to know about proteins, enzymes, and how humans are related to bonobos (there is evolution in that).Science is not a debate society where persuasion and apologetics matter. Truth always wins. Religion simply is not concerned with the truth of anything. "Gays should not marry because it says so in the Bible."  Right.  And we should have multiple wives (simultaneously, and not serially, as now practiced), and they would be men's property.  That's the Bible for you, pretty messed up, don't you think?
