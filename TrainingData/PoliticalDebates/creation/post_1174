 I think  the case against evolution is wrong and misinformed.  / How can the arguments for evolution necessarily dismiss the idea of a God?  /> Why can't God and evolution be compatible. Possibly God designed things to include a long evolutionary process?  /> Because early hominids were not necessarily related to and evolved from each other doesn't dismiss the case for evolution. Many species died out because they couldn't compete with rivals for food and other resources and that argues for evolution of the strongest, more intelligent and resourceful. Sometimes they died out because of climatic changes in the areas they lived in.  /> Fossils can detect patterns in evolutionary change and development. They show growth patterns.  /> Evolutionary theory can help to predict that related organisms do share similarities and evolution can be seen at this micro-scale.  /> We've seen many changes in known history and in pre-history and too many to argue against.  /> The whole evolutionary process for hominids is too complicated to argue here and is wrongfully discussed in the opposing views.
