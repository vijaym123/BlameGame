At the risk of sounding like my mother, I don't know what happened to you that caused you to hate Christianity so, but it is evident that you absolutely hate it.  This goes beyond lashing back when provoked, which as a proud non-Christian in a largely Christian nation, I sometimes do, this is targeting out people of faith and ruthlessly attacking them.  There is no intelligent discussion, no reason or logic, just pure, unrestricted hate.  You are just as hateful, illogical, and utterly disgusting as the shameful examples of the human race who have the gall to say that  9-11 and the deaths of our soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen overseas are punishment from god for homosexuals.  I realize that I am attacking the messanger a bit here, but it is hard to attack the message when it is nothing but hate.
