Every time I hear a single word mentioned about the TTSS and that it somehow gives flagellar   evolution   some credibility I lose a few months off my life span. Well, then again maybe not. I'd be dead by now. "It seems that so far ID has focused on malaria and on the bacterial flagellum which shares homology with the type three secretory system, used by bacteria responsible for the bubonic plague. Seems that the designer has quite an interest in punishing humans."So are we asking if a telic force exists or are we trying to psychoanalyze the intentions behind it?
