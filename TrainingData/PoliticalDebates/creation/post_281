If the human body is not an intelligent design then you tell me what is the definition for an intelligent design.'WHAT' IS A INTELLIGENT DESIGN AND 'WHY' IS YOUR EXAMPLE AN INTELLIGENT DESIGN?   simple straight forward question.what is your simple straight forward answer?                   bet you can't do it
