I didn't respond to a word of your post because you didn't give me a word to respond to that wasn't an attack itself.  I have to question why you are so ruthlessly attacking faith, and why you feel the need to be so hostile.You somewhat ridiculously demand that in order to be a part of this discussion, I must explain all of the pieces of Christian theology that you disagree with, even though, as a non-Christian, I don't agree with many of them myself.  Furthermore, I don't believe that it is possible to gain the moral high ground, much less have it for all time, simply by believing something, whether it be Christianity, Global Warming, or even that all men are created equal.  I do believe that hate is an excellent way to lose it.  You need to take a long look in the mirror before you talk about other people's hardened hearts and enslaved minds.  While I know you revile all things Biblical, I would nonetheless advise you to "fist take the log out of your own eye," that you may "see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.  Now sir, if you do not have anything to add to this debate, namely "Was the world created in 6 days," I respectfully request that you "butt out."  You have a glass house that needs tending.
