Scientific subjects such as the creation and development of the universe aren't really democratic topics. Just because some smart people who believe in evolution are outnumbered by an army of morons who believe in creationism, doesn't give creationism any more validity. Those who believe in creationism when there is clear, scientific evidence against it are either ignorant to the theory of evolution or stupid. But those who continue to believe in creationism despite having access to the truth (like in America) are surely stupid.
