First, ID is being applied only to objects that have high levels of CSI.  Since there is no data concerning the amount of CSI the designer has, then ID is not currently applicable to the designer.  Perhaps the designer must have a designer, and perhaps not.  Science cannot make this determination at this time.Second, whenever scientists hypothesize that A causes B, they will inevitably have to search for the cause of A.  Should this stop them from hypothesizing A as a cause of B?  Science, like   evolution  , occurs one step at a time.  After we test ID, if we find that it leads to successful predictions and never (or hardly ever) leads to failed predictions, then and only then should we worry about the cause of the designer.  Reasoning otherwise puts an end to scientific inquiry.  The Ayn Rand Institute is anti-science.
