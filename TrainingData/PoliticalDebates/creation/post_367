contribution from Joe G--Joe GGeez PvM your position that everything comes down to sheer dumb luck is totally vacuous. It cannot be tested. It relies solely on circumstantial evidence which is guided by your predisposition to reject design a priori.--Of course that is a false description of my position.  As I have pointed out design is always a possibility and is rejected a posteriori--Joe GBTW everything in your position is beyond observation. Universal common descent- never observed, not even in the fossil record. Mutations accumulating to give rise to novel structures with novel functions- never observed.--Again Joe G shows his ignorance of the evidence for common descent, novel structures through mutations etc. In other words, not only has Joe shown that ID is scientifically vacuous but also, based on personal ignorance of science.--Joe GIOW there isn't a shred of science in your position.--ROTFL, you're funny Joe. When asked to defend ID, you expose your ignorance of real science.Well done
