Evolution may not have been perfect when it was first thought up, but it was still pretty damn good. Why? Because it was based on observation, and evidence. It employed the scientific method to come up with an idea that changed the way we view our world. It is the foundation that unites all fields of biolgy.Intelligent design, on the other hand began as an attempt to discredit evolution, for religious reasons. It was put in text books (such as Of Pandas and People) as a replacement for creationism, because the supreme court ruled that creationism was a violation of the first ammendment. I'D has no scientific evidence to support it's claims and never will because it requires an unobservable "inteligent agent." That which is completely unobservable cannot be scuentific because science requires observation.Could ID be taught in schools? Sure...in a philosophy class, or in a science class as an example of what science isn't. As long as there is not one iota of evidence for ID, then it can never be taught as a theory.
