 You know a debate like this can be put up to get intelligent information exchange. Obviously, it triggers some people inner child too much and all they can do is try to put people down. It's a shame, I came to this site to express my opinion and hear others GOOD opinions. Hizashi usually doesn't let me down. That can't be said for dog boy or ibanex and a few other. They should go back to playing with toys, I'll find a more intelligent site.
