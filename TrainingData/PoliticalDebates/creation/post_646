"The term creation and creationists have very clear and religious meanings."    http://www.fteonline.com/pandas-creationism.html   Check the actual context of those drafts. Did they actually use the term "creator" to specifically state God had to be directly implicated? So far all I can find says otherwise:It's not the same as the "watchmaker" argument:   http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=795   The drafts specifically state that while some master intellect is the "creator" behind life, it would be impossible to tell if the "creator" is natural or supernatural:   http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=796   Here's another passage which states that commenting on the supernatural has no place in science:   http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=797   If you could find passages in the early drafts of Pandas in which God is SPECIFICALLY implicated in the use of the term "creator" then I would be wrong. I have yet to find such a case.  "Let's not pretend otherwise, the Court certainly did not buy this after the fact 'explanation'"They didn't buy it because they never got the chance to hear it:   http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/11/was_justice_denied_to_foundati.html      http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/08/justice_denied_foundation_for.html      http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3706&program=DI   %20Main%20Page%20-%20News&callingPage=discoMainPage   http://www.fteonline.com/aclu-dover.html
