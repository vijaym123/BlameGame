"Have you been to the ICR facility to watch their presentation?"ICR teaches hilarious nonsense.  ICR moved to Texas and then wanted to give a "master of   science     education  " degree.  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board told them no.  So they have filed a nonsensical 76 page lawsuit.  So a real judge may get to judge their nonsense and pronounce it nonsense.
