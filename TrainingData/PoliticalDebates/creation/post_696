How can anyone believe that the human race began with just one pair, Adam and Eve, and refuse to face the logical consequence that the human race would have to have with brother-sister incest?  If God wanted to start the human race with just one pair of biological ancestors, then He must have ordained incestuous marriage for at least the first generation of humans.  However, books like Leviticus in chapters 18 and 20, incest is clearly condemned.  This includes incestuous brother-sister marriage!  That's the main reason why I have embraced theistic    evolution    instead of the Genesis creation accounts.
