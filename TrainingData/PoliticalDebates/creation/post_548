Good arguments are worth far more than vehement objections.In the Dover case, it was extensively proved that ID did little more than extensively use cherry-picked fact and misinformation to cause confusion about science, then extend the miracle of Intelligent Design as the "answer." Preventing this approach has nothing to do with censorship and everything to do with facts.I was taught Creationism (my education was at a private school, and the cloak of ID did not have to be used) extensively, and taught the same "controversies" appearing in Intelligent Design arguments and manuals. The result? A wasted private-school education and my having to pay in college for not having a good science education before I took a real biology class.Please review the definition of "censorship." The prevention of deceit is not censorship.
