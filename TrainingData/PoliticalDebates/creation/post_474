--TJ10Again, you may have faith that methodological materialism will solve all of these problems in the distant future. Great. That is your belief. However, it is nothing more than that - a belief, a stand of faith. There is no guarantee.---Sure, we may have come to realize that MN is insufficient to address all problems, however why should we conclude 'design' based on just our ignorance. Just because there are some 'scientists' who believe something more is needed, this is neither sufficient justification and worse, they have failed to provide ANY method to extend the MN framework.The supernatural without constraints is no explanation since it explains anything.Hope you realize that ID scientists are given a voice to speak. But they somehow failed to speak, or perhaps they just whispered ?Why should we give credence to just anyone who makes ill supported claims? Do we still believe in a flat earth? What about cold fusion. At least these were falsifiable claims but ID is not in the business of presenting any scientific hypotheses relevant to ID, other than negative hypotheses about Darwinian theory.I do not believe that global warming is happening should not be an excuse for ignoring the facts. If ID proponents believe MN is insufficient then let them make their case: how does one reliably detect the design of God?And why should we expect that God was somehow forced to get involved in His original design? What explanatory power does it have to say that God designed 'x'? What if we replace God with 'magic pink unicorn'? What if science discovers a way to explain it ? Does this somehow disprove 'design'? What is meant by 'design'ID's contribution is not to show that MN is lacking but rather that our scientific explanations are lacking and even there, they fail to do much relevant work.
