I am always tickled by claims of ID advocates that "Darwinism" stifles inquiry and that only ID creationism will 'break the shackles' that "Darwinism" puts on the mind, that ID creationism will open 'avenues of insight' into practically everything.I am tickeld by this because when you look at the scientific output of one who has subcsribed to the ID creationist paradigm, you see next to nothing.  Once prolific scientists become ID advocates, they stop producing anything of merit.  Look at Kenyon.  Look at Behe.  Look at Gonzalez.  If ID creationism were so liberating, why are not ID advoactes the ones making all the grand discoveries?For example,ID creationists like to claim that they 'predicted' all along that 'JunkDNA' would be functional.  Ask them to document their prediction.  You won't see a thing.  Especially since function was known to exist in some junk DNA as early as the 1950s.They are co-opters, embellishers, and fabricators who prey on the gullible and the uninformed and the culturally conservative.ID is not scientific, certainly not in an honest fashion.
