you've got it right.  Just looking at a girl lustfully is sinful... You're also right that it's impossible to avoid... Which is an example of why we are all sinners.  A quick quiz -What does random pre-marital sex lead to?What about   murder  ? Good thing or not so much?How about abuse of your own body..   smoking  , drinking and such - what results do you get?How about sodomy? Good thing? (nevermind.. don't answer)the simple point is... every view put into place in the Bible if followed would lead to nothing but a better life..oh.. and of course this is where the typical atheist jumps in with the stories about slavery and incest.. etc.  Don't bother...first off it's just a symptom of not actually READING the Bible and/or quoting it out of context or with a lack of understanding.  Anyone can quote mine a line to discredit the book.. but also we all know the message that is presented from the Bible - love your enemies, Judge not lest ye be judged, thou shalt not kill etc. etc. Anyone claiming different is either lying or simply not educated in it's teachings.It's a good book... matter of fact it's divine.
