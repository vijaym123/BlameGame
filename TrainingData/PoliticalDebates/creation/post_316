"Your "intelligent cause" is completely undefined."There is a little difference between COMPLETELY undefined and those other theories you are trying to disparage."We detect design by looking for the tell-tale signs that an intelligent agent acted."Hilarious nonsense.  As usual - "intelligent agent" is a completely undefined term.  So "tell-tale" signs means "I know it when I see it and I see it" as usual."Sure seems like the cell is designed to me...."Yes.  For you, "I know it when I see it" works fine because you are an idiot."Those do play a role"No.  Such nonsense has been refuted.  Fail.
