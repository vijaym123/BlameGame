"But we are not arguing that it is wrong."Okay then, so what the heck was PvM talking about his entire visit on here anyways?"We are arguing that it is not right or wrong, it's "not even wrong"."How exactly is that possible? Oh, are you beating that non-existant horse of "It's not science" again?  "There is no definition of "  intelligent design  " that would allow a scientist to determine if it's right or wrong."So what's wrong with this one:"The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection."Sounds clear enough to me. "There is only the "I know it when I see it" interpretation of the "evidence" of the "natural world". But if "interpretations" are personal and cannot be agreed upon, then it's not science."Hey onein6billion, William Paley is dead. Try the modern theory of ID. ;) brb my good man.
