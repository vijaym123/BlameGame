The Ayn Rand Center and I agree, for once, about the fact that ID is nothing more than bait and switch and that ID at best is a religiously motivated attack on science, as the DI seems to admit in their own Wedge Document. As a Christian myself, I have a hard time understanding why 'bait and switch' would further a Christian message. But perhaps I am missing something here.
