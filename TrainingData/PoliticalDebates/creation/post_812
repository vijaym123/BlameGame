"Science is based on what can be observed / tested. So far every observable area of the universe obeys the same laws that we observe on earth."Then problem, though, is the assumption that the operational laws of the universe are the same laws that brought the universe into existence. That would be like assuming that the processes that operation in my Chevy are the same processes which brought the car into existence in the first place. Anyone would say it's a crazy, flawed, and obviously wrong assumption.
