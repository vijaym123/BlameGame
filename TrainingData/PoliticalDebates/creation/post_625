oi6b>>"Open your mind and your brains will fall out."What value brains without mind?sologos>>"There is more than naturalism can engage."oi6b>>"And that's why it's called "supernatural". But there can never be any evidence that the supernatural actually affects reality." This absolute statement is an  excellent illustration of the mistake some naturalists make. Naturalism believes that by ridding itself of supernatural belief, it thereby becomes neutral, rendering its findings objective. Whenever naturalism goes beyond its methodology, it becomes an ideology, not unlike religion. This statement is a belief. oi6b>>"You wish to change the definition of "science" to include the "metaphysical"? That's silly. The word "philosophy" comes to mind, but it's not science."Science, it appears as many definitions. I like the original meaning, "knowledge". The experimental method is merely one of its methodologies. It works well, but it requires further refinements if it is to become a tool to discern "knowledge".  sologos>>"get at the core issue of intelligence operative within them both"oi6b>>"Your assertion is not supported by any evidence."Only in the same sense that there is no evidence to the contrary. Unless of course there is no such thing as intelligence.  sologos>>"God simply allows us"oi6b>>"Your assertion is not supported by any evidence."Which assertion, God, or God allows. If you don't accept the first I am powerless to change your denial.sologos>>"I would hardly call what the NCSE puts out as neutral in the matter of public relations."oi6b>>"Of course not - they are on the side of science, not religion."So non-neutrality is a good thing? oi6b>>"Riiiight. And how can science do more to "address" its limitations, than by simply admitting them? Science is "materialistic" and perhaps that's a "limitation" and science admits it and you wish to change this in some way?"Your first question is a good one. I believe that we are attempting to answer that very challenge, mostly prompted, curiously, by the incursion of naturalism into areas it is not yet honed to address. It's a healthy backlash though.  As to your second question, I believe you meant to say that MN is materialistic.oi6b>>"Nonsense. Science is the process. How do you wish to "refine" the process of science?"rScience HAS processes that have continually been in evolution since its inception.
