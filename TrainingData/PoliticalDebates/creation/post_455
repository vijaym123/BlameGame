In science, testing a hypothesis or theory means deriving predictions from them. Thus, if I hypothesize that species have changed over time, then I predict that million-year-old fossils will indicate similarities with species today but with stark differences.  It follows, then, that if predictions cannot be derived from the supernatural, then neither can if-then arguments be developed against it.  For example, one could not logically argue that if God is all-good, then there would be no evil because this is deriving predictions from the supernatural.Nevertheless, every atheist who passionately opposes theism, religion, and ID has made these arguments.  In "God: The Failed Hypothesis", physicist Victor Stenger even proposed to develop a scientific model of God that he claimed could be used to test the God hypothesis.  Naturally, he found that his model did not hold and therefore God does not exist.  But did the scientific community chastise him for baiting-and switching, for pretending like science can make statements about God when it really can't?  Of course not!  This is because his conclusions concerning the hypothesis were in the negative.  What matters to atheist scientists is not the evidence, but whether the evidence can be interpreted as atheistic.  If it can, then the evidence is strong.  If it cannot, then it is weak.  These are my predictions using self-verification theory.  Let's see if my predictions are supported by evidence.
