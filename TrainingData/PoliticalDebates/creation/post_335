--IslandThe WMAP anamoly indicates that we are at the center of the universe:   http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29210    ---Where in the article is this argument proposed?From the conclusions--Therefore, there is strong evidence either of some systematic error in the WMAP pipeline (although in a preliminary analysis, the team is now discovering similar features in COBE maps), or that the largest scales of the microwave sky are dominated by a local foreground.This finding has vast implications. It casts doubts on the cosmological interpretation of the lowest-1 multipoles from the temperature-temperature correlation and from the temperature-polarization correlation, and in turn on the claim that the first stars formed very early in the history of the universe. --I can see how Island may have jumped to the conclusion hereFrom Wikipedia--Lawrence Krauss is quoted as follows in the referenced Edge.org article:[8]    But when you look at CMB map, you also see that the structure that is observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun Ñ the plane of the earth around the sun Ñ the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe.It would be somewhat surprising if the WMAP alignments were a complete coincidence, but the anti-Copernican implications suggested by Krauss would be far more surprising, if true. Other possibilities are (i) that residual instrumental errors in WMAP cause the effect (ii) that unexpected microwave emission from within the solar system is contaminating the maps.[9]--
