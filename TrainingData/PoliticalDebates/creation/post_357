To correct PvM's confusion:Forensic detectives have to figure out the means. Motives and opportunities also come AFTER the design inference has been made.That is what I have been telling you for days- That it matters a great deal to any investigation whether or not that which is being investigated arose via agency involvement or nature, operating freely.There wouldn't be a motive for a natural death. And in a homicide motive alone is pretty meaningless.And again the design inference is based on our current knowledge- that being we have an understanding of what nature, operating freely, is capable of and we couple that with our knowledge of what designing agencies are capable of.Why is it so hard for ID opponents to understand this simple fact?
