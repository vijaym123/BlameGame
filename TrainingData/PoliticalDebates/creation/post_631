I happened to drop by the Discovery's Institute's website, which claims to be interested in improving the accuracy in reporting, and read an interesting blurb titled "NCSE Promotes Shrill Editorial Suggesting "Students be Forced to Consider the Possibility that There Is No God". So I decided to check out the actual articles in question and much to my dismay I came to realize that this seemed to be a blatant quote out of context.--By the way, speaking of religion class, if we accept the creationist's own rationale for this bill, then shouldn't right wing fundamentalist Christian schools be forced to "teach the controversy" about religion?...You can see how quickly their argument breaks down.---    http://www.asbmbtoday-digital.com/asbmbtoday/200808    /Since we have some representatives of the Discovery Institute here, in fact I believe Casey Luskin was the author, yes indeed. So Casey, can you explain?Your rhetoric may have gotten the best of you here. Suggestion for Casey. You are no match for the NCSE and its hard working staff who have relentlessly expressed scientific objections to the claims made by ID proponents. People such as former Public Information Project Director Nick Matzke whose elaborations on the bacterial flagella and his incredibly in depth work during Kitzmiller v Dover have exposed not just the scientific flaws in Behe's and other ID proponents claims (including your own IIRC) but also helped to formulate a winning strategy to expose not just the scientific vacuity of ID but also its well established creationist roots.  And that without any legal training.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Matzke    And Casey, you are surely no Karl. Consider that a compliment.
