I have found that most web sights about religion and   evolution   are bunk and are promoted by an agenda not open to reason. The mind is made up and that's it.Example fact, the OT is a collection of books written by Hebrew authors. They put to words what they believe was the revealed word of their God and was they were ALREADY practicing as a tribe.Fact, the Hebrew people were concerned about God's laws, not about science. The purpose of the Bible is man's salvation not a science text book. I believe both camps enfringe. Science is the study of the universe's physical processes, NOT origins. The "Creationists" shouldn't look to the Bible for scientific or Historic absolutes. Ex. nowhere is it claimed that Moses personally wrote the Torah but as was the custome of the day he was the likely author with scribes putting his words to the written form.
