==I asked==(1) "Ask yourself this simple question: How does ID explain the bacterial flagella?(2) "It doesn't, it merely calls it 'designed' which is a placeholder for our ignorance as to how to explain the flagella."===Bowman responds===(1) Answer: It's a machine with functional components. The design and construct process is largely unknown, but researchable.==In other words, it does not explain but rather describes. And so while science has in fact researched the 'design' and construction process, ID has done exactly what to further its case?==Bowman(2) The 'designed' designation IS in fact a placeholder, but for further study. This brings up a common complaint that ID offers no testable hypotheses. I submit that a hypothesis comes first; the testing later. Since there's no funding, and there is stigma attached, there has been little confirming research done as yet. I predict that that will change with the new crop of scientists, a few of whom may see its relevance, and pursue it. A word to any out there who may fit that category. That word is 'Nobel.'==Why should we accept 'design' as a placeholder when 'we don't know' is a much better one.I appreciate the wishful thinking and the ever prevalent promissory note. Yes, blame it on lack of funding and yet insist it is also taught in schools under the guise of 'teach the controversy' or 'academic freedom'So what hypothesis does ID propose in a non ad hoc manner?"we don't know so let's call it designed"How does real science explain it?"we don't know" let's develop new hypotheses before we jump to conclusionTelling difference...
