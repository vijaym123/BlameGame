PSYOP asks (rhetorically?): "if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?" First of all, the expansion of our universe is an observed fact.  No "if" about it.And why would cosmological expansion cease?  The same measurements which revealed the effects of some "dark energy" indicate that the expansion is accelerating.  If that is so then the question is mooted.
