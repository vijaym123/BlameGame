Teaching creationism is comparable to teaching flat earthism. The scientific consensus against creationism is as strong as against "flat earthism". "Flat earthism" would never be taught today as a legitimate theory. Therefore, neither should creationism be taught as a theory explaining the origin of the earth. This view is put forward by Richard Dawkins, a prominent opponent of teaching creationism in schools.
