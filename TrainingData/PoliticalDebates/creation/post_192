"In fact, the history of life shows a pattern of explosions where new fossil forms come into existence without any clear evolutionary precursors, concurring with design theory that predicts that species might appear abruptly."-------Let me fix the end of Luskin's quote from above: "... concurring with design theory that predicts that species might or might not appear abruptly." I would like for Luskin to explain why he thinks that ID should predict an abrupt rather than a non-abrupt appearance of species.
