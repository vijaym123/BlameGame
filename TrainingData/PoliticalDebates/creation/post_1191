 This sounds like religious faith speaking... Evolution grows more established literally every day. Just a few weeks ago they found the best transitional fossil yet, a creature with both reptile and amphibian features. Gene studies actually back up every claim darwinism makes and in fact make it easier to track evolutionary change over time.  And quantum physics doesn't affect evolution at all as far as I can tell... Evolution follows the rules of the atomic level, QM the rules of the subatomic level. And while they may be different rules, obviously the 2 systems are linked somehow or we'd all just fly apart.
