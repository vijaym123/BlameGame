it's not that cut and dried..  some things were meant to be literal - others.. clearly not.Revelations is an example where clearly symbolism is used.  No fundamental christian could discount that symbolism is used alot... and metaphors.. and analogies...and parables.. etc. etc.So that leads us to the conclusion that you can't rule out symbolism in any other passage. - so really the question comes down to 'If you feel the Bible was divine in origin.. do you feel 6 day creation was meant literally'. -and really - I assume it was meant literal.. largely based on the reference to 'evening and morning' repeatedly.So just because you have an 'as is' Bible doesn't mean cultural relativism isn't the case in some aspects - 'an eye for an eye' - was the old   law  .. for example.. turn the other cheek was   the law   when Christ came..  other parts are documentation of jewish law - others the genealogical line of Jesus...  each section has to be interpreted individually for it's given intent... it's simply not an 'all or nothing'.. either literal or metaphor concept..  a full understanding is necessary.
