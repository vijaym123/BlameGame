I'm sorry but this argument of "design is apparent, not real" always make me scratch my head in bewilderment.Its like, we see the design with our own eyes but it can't be real because we refuse to believe in a designer. You were right about one thing Arthur Hunt. Storms- tornadoes, hurricanes, etc are machines with engines.It always has been and always will be impossible to have a design without a designer. Truth doesn't stop being truth just because you don't believe it. Just because something arises spontaneously doesn't disprove a designer.
