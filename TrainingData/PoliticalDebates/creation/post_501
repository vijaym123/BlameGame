"Nothing wrong with quoting from a well argued submission by the ACLU."OK, referring to it is of course permissable, but come on, copying 91% of it.  How do we know the Judge really thought much about the issue himself?  We don't with that kind of antic. This seems like a misuse of the privilege to refer to a brief to me.  If the Judge had done the same thing, copied 91% of a well written brief submitted by an ID group, and ruled for the other side, what do you think you would have complained about?  It goes both ways my friend.  The only reason you don't think this is a problem is because he supports your view, isn't that right?....
