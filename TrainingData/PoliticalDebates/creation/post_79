2. So far, many people have yet to realize that the concept of 'design' as defined by ID is actually quite limited. In fact, few seem to be familiar with the major concessions made by William Dembski.--Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, "even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself  design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency" (TDI, 227). --Source: Ryan Nichols, The Vacuity of Intelligent Design Theory (TDI: The Design Inference, William Dembski)In other words, design does not imply designer, and in fact, as people such as Wesley Elsberry have shown, Intelligent Design cannot even exclude natural selection as a 'designer'.Crowther then continues to confuse the terminology of 'complexity and information' while ignoring that science has  shown  how processes of regularity and chance can in principle explain complexity and information, and thus ID, which lacks its own positive explanations cannot even compare it to scientific explanations.And that my friends, is the rest of the story.
