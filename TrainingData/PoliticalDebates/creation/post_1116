 I feel the need to distinguish between micro-evolution and macro-evolution. There is indeed an abundance of proof for micro-evolution but it does not at all logically require macro-evolution.   />   /> The lead scientist today have expressed that based on the theory of macro-evolution, the fossil record ought to show 99%+ of animals that were halfway through the evolutionary process (i.e. Half-developed colons etc.), however, the problem is that archaeologists have yet to find even a single fossil of this nature.   />   /> "  Well maybe there are some mistakes in the theory but as a whole concept is quite right and logical, no? "  />   /> No. I do agree that simply because the theory has holes in it, it may still be logically valid; but as a whole concept, if it has holes in it, and it is also logically valid in terminology, then there must be one or more false premises so it cannot be quite right and logical.
