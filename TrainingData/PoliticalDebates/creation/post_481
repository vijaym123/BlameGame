--TJ10I don't believe the 91% similarity in the ACLU's submission and the Judge's analysis was a lucky or freak coincidence?!! I'm ill-informed because I think he copied it? RIGHT!---You seem to be ill informed about both the extent as well as the relevance of this so called 'copying'. Hint, judges regularly copy from the "proposed findings of fact" that's what these submissions are for.See     http://austringer.net/wp/index.php    /2007/01/31/jones-luskin-and-text/ for why the actual number is likely much smaller than the oft claimed 91%Surprised? I bet..As to your other ill informed statements about the ACLU, I will let them pass as they have little relevance to ID. Needless to say, the Judge's ruling which contained part of the 'proposed findings of fact' submitted was instrumental in a ruling which was quickly denounced by ID proponents based on much ad hominems and far less an appeal to the facts of the ruling.Seems that some of the mud slinging has stuck after all.
