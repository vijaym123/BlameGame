ID is offered as an explanation for the complexity of life on Earth, which, according to ID proponents, cannot be explained by random chance and survival of the fittest.  But ID suffers a fatal flaw.  If we have to hypothesize an intelligent designer to explain life, then we need to hypothesize another intelligent designer to explain that intelligent designer, which also could not have come about from random chance.  We then need to explain the second intelligent designer with a third, and so on ad infinitum.  There are only two ways to end this infinite regression. First we could accept that intelligence and complex life CAN come about by random chance, and that the first intelligent designer in this regression did exactly that.  But if we do this, then why not just accept that WE came about by random chance and avoid the need for any regression?  Second, we could hypothesize a supernatural god that did not need to be designed by a previous intelligent designer (maybe god is a self-designing designer?).  But if we do this, then ID clearly becomes a religious argument, something ID proponents in this debate have denied. At this point no one can explain how life/intelligence formed on this planet.  But human ignorance does not constitute evidence for an even more complex and inexplicable intelligence.  Just because we can't explain something doesn't mean it can not be explained.  Sid
