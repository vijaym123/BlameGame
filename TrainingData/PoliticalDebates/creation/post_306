"Meaningless nonsense, of course. Name a "prediction"."It's funny because I already named some, provided resources to find them, and yet you seemed to dodge the argument altogether:  http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/id-is-science   (see the three links from the first comment and please respond there)"And that statement has been refuted. You can't "prove" that   evolution   can't explain "this"."If that were true then you wouldn't be able prove evolution can explain it either. And I'm interesting in what refutations to irreducibility your referring to, feel free to cite Ken Miller or Nick Matzke. I highly doubt you know of anything I haven't heard before. "Mainly because it can."Prove it. "Of course Behe ignored the original point and changed the subject to something irrelevant."So he brings up pseudogenes in one sentence in a paragraph ABOUT pseudogenes, and you say that's changing the subject??? What was the original point in that case?"If science can't explain it yet, then science will continue to explore alternatives."Nothing wrong with that. ID is merely a useless "dead end"..."While Evolution simply declares all problems solved without further notice."...to try to allow creationists to claim that evolution might be wrong."Explain how "creationists" are relevant to this discussion.
