ID is not science because it can never make a prediction that is meaningful.ID simply tries to pretend to match any and all observations of reality.But there's no "why" there.  Why should ID match reality?  What do we know about the designer that would lead us to believe that his "design" actually matches reality?Nothing --- here is reality and here is a silly "claim" that ID supports or is supported by that reality.So ID has no merit because ID fits anything and everything.And there was tiktaalik.
