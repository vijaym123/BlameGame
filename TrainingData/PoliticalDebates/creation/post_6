 Evolution is an observable fact - While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case. Observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact. The only part of evolution that is "theory" is the explanation as to "why" it occurs. But the "why" has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur, a fact that leaves no room for creationism.
