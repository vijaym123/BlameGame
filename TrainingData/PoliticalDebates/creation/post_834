Human beings added names to the days of week, they were originally and simply numbers.  The first day, the second day, the third day, and so forth.  No, God did not place elements of idolatry into His days (or anything else, for that matter).  I believe that when people take out the supernatural aspect of this issue, then we might as well give all the credit to men, many of whom always seem to know more than our Heavenly Father.   I say let's stop trying to rationalize everything in God's creations and allow Him some of the honor.
