“My answers to your questions are: 1. Why does it matter; NO; and NO. 2. NO.”It is the third ‘No’ that I find most interesting.  You freely admit that you cannot defend your position without the Bible, but are in a discussion with those who do not believe that the Bible is a valid source in scientific matters.  If a religious source that cannot be supported otherwise is valid to you then what would you say to a Taoist that supports their arguments by relying on their holy texts?“If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.”This is all well and good when talking among other   Christians  , but it comes across as ‘God did it’ when talking with those outside of Christiantiy.  If I said that the sun was carried across the sky in Apollo’s chariot what would you say?“By the way, the Vatican was not the only branch of Christianity to select Biblical Books and support a particular viewpoint, some Protestant denominations were also guilty of deciding which Books would remain in the Bible nearly four centuries ago.”So who has the correct collection of books?“As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself.”If and only if you already accept the Bible as true is this a valid statement… it does not follow if you do not already accept the original statement that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God.“Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?”The Flying Spaghetti Monster does not lie, we know this because the book describing the FSM says so and since the FSM does not lie then the book is true.
