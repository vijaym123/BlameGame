Discovery Institute writes, "...by focusing on the designer, The Ayn Rand Institute misrepresents ID: ID studies natural objects to determine if they bear the informational signatures that reliably indicate design by an intelligent cause. ID doesn't study designers."The "informational signatures?"Only conscious beings produce signatures.  And saying that a consciousness exists necessarily presupposes that existence exists.  You can't have consciousness without first having existence.Discovery's objection here reveals that he's claiming the primacy of consciousness over existence - a contradiction.Paraphrasing Ayn Rand's statement on the primacy of existence: existence exists, and consciousness is the faculty of perceiving (not creating) existence.To look for signatures is to look for a consciousness that came before/was apart from/was outside of/etc. -- existence.Jargon like "informational signatures" does not a valid concept make.
