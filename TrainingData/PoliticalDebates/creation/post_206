When I grew up, science was a useful tool for discovering things about the world around us.  What is this revised definition?  If science excludes possibilities before considering them, it has ceased to be a useful tool for learning about reality.The problem is that the origin of life is not science; it was an historical event.  Both evolutionary scientists and IDers make a major mistake by sometimes claiming to address a historical topic (the origin of life) while ignoring historical evidence.  No human observed the origin of life.  The Bible claims to be the Word of God, who did observe life's origin (as He created it).  To make up excuses to refuse to consider this possibility is shows a glaring lack of critical thinking.So while ID is useful in understanding reality because it is willing to consider the possibility of a designer, it still avoids considering important historical evidence recorded in the Bible.
