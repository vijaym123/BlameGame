Some places do seem more open to honest debate over evolution rather than just trying to brainwash kids.  But this is not true everywhere.  Science should not be about brainwashing, but about seeking for the truth and if it leads to areas that scientists do not like, then so be it.  Another way to put it is that the purpose of science is not to support naturalism, whether it be merely methodological or not, but to search out the truth. Because we all know the answer may lay outside of methodological naturalism.  You might be fishing in a pond where there is no fish. You need open debate to be able to consider all solutions to the problem, including ones that might not fit within a scientists beloved worldview.While no one is recommending mandatory teaching of ID, there is rational reason to censor it either, except that it does not fit within the methodological naturalism of evolutionists. But since that methodological naturalism is just an arbitrary thing and rather recent at that, and since it cannot be proven that the answer to the origin of life actually can be found through methodological naturalism, then there is no reason to limit the debate to that worldview.  Seems rather stupid to do that if one is really after the truth.  If we knew for sure that the truth can be found in that view, that is a different story, but the best thing that can be said now is that scientists believe they will solve it some day.  I guess both sides have faith, huh!
