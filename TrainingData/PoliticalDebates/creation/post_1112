 Yes, I believe evolution is wrong. I have too much experience with God. No I am not deluded, brainwashed, or crazy. I just know that there is a God who created this amazing universe. It's crazy to see people argue about things, because in the end, we will all understand, you'll see. I promise.  />   /> P.s.   Universe ->> "spoken one"  /> It was all spoken into existence.
