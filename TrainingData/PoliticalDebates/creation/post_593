When I read Casey Luskin's article he made some very good points.  I am sure you read the article so I won't cut and paste them here.  My problem is that instead of addressing the points he made in his article those who find no merit in ID attack the writer personally or talk about the weight of scientific opinion against him.  Neither argument is scientific in itself.  It seems to me that Luskin is being "more scientific" in that he talks about a method for testing ID. Though you disagree with the validity of his argument, you don't address it.  That's my point.  May I make another point about what "scientific" is?  When Crick said molecular machines appear designed but are not, he was never castigated for being "unscientific."  If some responds and say those moleculare machines are designed, they are harshly criticized for being "unscientific."  Why?
