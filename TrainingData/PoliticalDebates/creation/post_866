I am a strong believer in the authority and inspiration of the word of God. But I do wonder about Genesis and how it refers to no bush or vegetation were around when God decided to make Adam. This is confusing considering land and vegetation was made on day 3 and man on day 6. Does the hebrew transfer it differently? Is there possiblity that since Moses was the writer it was not a first hand account and things were not perfectly clear, similar to Revelations?Again, the fact that we do not know I believe only gives more power to God and is a reminder we are finite and know very little.
