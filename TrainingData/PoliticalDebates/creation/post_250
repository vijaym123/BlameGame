"Behe claims that "That is not the sort of process one needs to build complex molecular systems." when discussing the experiment by Richard Lenski. What Behe forgets to mention are the actual findings of the research such as"Over the generations, in fits and starts, the bacteria did indeed evolve into faster breeders. The bacteria in the flasks today breed 75% faster on average than their original ancestor.""At what cost? Did these new super-breeders need to eliminate some proteins or functions from their systems in order to achieve this ability? Do the faster breeders still have the same efficiency in the functions Lenski describes? What about population size? Despite the rapid breeding, did the population size remain the same, or did they just draw the claim of rapid breeding based on the time it took for new generations to arise?"and they also showed some interesting findings that show how beneficial/detrimental depends on the environment"Now that's a spectacular way to cover one's ass when they know they've run into a wall. Just say that the fitness only depends on the environment, and even if they show some losses in their current environment, they would do just fine and possibly even better if we just tried a new set of environmental settings. So I'm assuming that when the nylonase only had 2% the efficiency of typical enzymes, it was because we just didn't have the right environment for the bacteria, am I right?http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:MX7Px_DB75IJ:  www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm  +nylonase+  evolution  +The+new+enzymes+are+very+inefficient+(having+only+2%25+of+the+efficiency+of+the+regular+enzymes)&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us"and a remarkable mutation which caused the bacteria to feast on the citrate"This is only a fraction of the whole equation, did the bacteria retain the same efficiency? Did it retain the same population levels? Did it have to shed other functions in the process? Without this information we have no way of knowing if anything was gained or lost in this whole process."and countering behe's claims, the evidence actually suggested that this was a change in multiple sites, something Behe has argued cannot happen"I'm assuming your referring to chloroquine resistance and Edge of Evolution? I'm sure it's more than likely to happen, but not without some loss in the original functionality of the organism in question. Speaking of multiple mutations.....  http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/A3DGRQ0IO7KYQ2/ref  =cm_blog_blogCan wait to read the posts that follow...."In an earlier article in the NY Times, it was reported that these bacteria were not the same ones"Tell us the article please, just so we can know for sure you're not making this up."Of course, none of these bacteria evolved into mammals, something hardly expected given the limited timescales involved, however contrary to Behe's claims, these bacteria started to feed on citrate even though such a feat required multiple changes."See the previous points. The question at hand is whether or not Darwin's mechanism can produce the "apparent" design in nature. Now for your claim to even be relevant to this question, I would suggest that you give us the full picture and explain whether or not the citrate feeding bacteria retained the same efficiency, breeding rate, and functionality as their earlier counter-parts. "It seems clear that even these trivial examples of hard scientific work show not only that ID remains scientifically vacuous but also that ID has to reject and ignore contradicting evidence that shows it to be wrong." It seems clear that even in this discussion you've decided to give answers to questions which you know will fit your accepted conclusion. You give all this talk about a new function evolving while giving no indication as to whether or not the same level of functionality was retained from the original population. I can't say I wonder why the results of the Lenski experiment have been called into question in the first place. "What's even worse about ID being scientifically vacuous? In my opinion, ID being wrong and knowing it."Sounds like a theory I know, but it isn't ID.....
