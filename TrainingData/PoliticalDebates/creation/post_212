That argument is using a trick of semantics.  If we document something it is no longer 'supernatural'.. it then becomes 'natural'.   A 'supernatural' agent CAN be documented... evidence of a ghost for example...to say we shouldn't look for 'supernatural' agents is to say we shouldn't look for anything we haven't seen already.  It's like the idea of 'don't talk to strangers'... well if you don't talk to strangers.. how would you ever meet anyone?.. This whole argument is just using flaws in our definitions..   science   looks for 'supernatural' things all the time.. and sometimes we find them.. and they become natural.  'If creating life is not impressive then what in Science is? 'Science is useful... but my point is simply that science is based around documenting what we see in nature.. and then mimicking it -  The dragonfly gave us ideas on how to build a helicopter.... but our helicopters suck in comparison.  Nature is impressive.. man, not as much. (keep in mind I use the word nature.. but of course imply design)
