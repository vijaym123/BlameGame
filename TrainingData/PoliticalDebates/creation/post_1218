#originalTopic=There_Is_No_Evidence_Of_Creationism
 If your trying to find evidence in the Bible, your right.....of course, the Bible wasn't written to make evolutionist happy, it just supplies about 2 pages to creation. If God had thought it a more important subject, I'm sure He(she) would have told you more. But the Bible was written to tell people how to live a better life, here and how to fit in, in heaven.  />      If you know anything about Quantum Physics, you know that things change and you believe and look for them....that's where you're evidence will be found.....like the Bible said 5000 years ago,  "believe and then you will see"  />      A person with a closed or filled mind, doesn't have room to learn anything......especially the truth.
