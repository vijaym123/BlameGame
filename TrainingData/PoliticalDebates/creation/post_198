--But I think you don’t realize the importance of your concession that “The DI is correct to point out that a lack of merit of ID should not be confused with its religious implications.” Do you realize that your concession actually refutes many of the critics’ arguments that the implications of ID make it unscientific? For example, see The Ayn Rand Institute’s posts argue that if ID implies a supernatural creator (at the bottom of a chain of designers), then ID is unscientific.--I am very aware of my 'concession' namely that it is not just the religious motivations of ID which disqualifies ID as having merit as a science, it's the lack of scientific contributions (the examples you mention have little or no relevance to the concept of ID but are at best examples of "ID proponents can also do real science") which dooms ID to a lack of merit as a scientific contribution.That ID points to the supernatural is one of the major reasons why it lacks content as such a 'creator' (oops designer) cannot be constrained and thus explains nothing.I am not sure if the NCSE argues that ID is unscientific just because it is religiously motivated. I think that their argument may be better phrased as "ID's religious motivation helps explain why it has remained scientifically vacuous". This is after all not really about science.Sure, ID proponents can do real and even good science, but that hardly has any relevance to the issue of whether or not ID has any scientific merit. I hope you understand this major distinction.
