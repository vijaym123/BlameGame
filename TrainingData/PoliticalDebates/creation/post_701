Only someone who does not beleive in God would have to ask how the world was created in six days. So then, is he the intelligent designer? The one who could creat reality from nothing? Scientist have it hard only having to work with what is already made. Trying to play God is never an easy task. Science will only have more questions and more discoveries but will still find more dead ends. It all started when the devil told man he could be like God. Even now the curiosty still beckons like an unopened door. They say the new face transplants are a huge success. They can now reproduce ear organs off a rodent and now are finding more planets. Aww man, now it's not 9 any more. Another thing my son is going to hold over my head. Bottom line you cannot disprove 6 day creation.
