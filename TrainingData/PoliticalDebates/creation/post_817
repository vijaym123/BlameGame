Kent Hovind is where he belongs!  Both of his "ministries" Creation Science Evangelism, and his dinosaur theme park were for-profit organizations.  Almost all bona fide Christian for-profit organizations, such as Christian booksellers, and Christian music and recording businesses pay their due taxes.  But Hovind was so self-deluded that he thought he was above the law--the tax law!  Also, he's insane.  He believes a lot of nonsense about the government, UFOs, one-world government and Antichrist conspiracies and such.I wonder if he will ever get out.Barb Rainey
