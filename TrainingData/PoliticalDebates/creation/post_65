JoeWe look at the options. And the anti-ID option is "it just happened".--PvMOn the contrary, that's what ID's 'explanation' is "poof"---That's false. Thank you for demonstrating your dishonesty. BTW you don't have an explanation.---PvM:All textbooks teach that a designer was not "required" which is not the same as "not involved".----There isn't anything that supports that concept. All our exoperience tells us a designer is required.------PvMSo let's accept the vacuity of ID and move to real science. So what evidence do you have that UCD is not possible through the accumulation of mutations?-----LoL- YOUR position is vacuous. And there isn't any data that shows an accumulation of mutations can do what you say they did.THAT is how science works- by actually demonstrating the premise you hold.---PvMI understand why you want to abandon discussing ID, I would also hate to have to defend it.----I understand why you don't want to discuss your position. It is totally based on faith.
