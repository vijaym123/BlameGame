Luskin quotes:"May not the principle of uniformity then be used in a broader frame of consideration to suggest that DNA had an intelligent cause at the beginning?"This would seem to be the usual trick of "origins science" - an attempt to claim that abiogenesis is impossible.But another opinion is:"The book argues that the origin of new organisms is "in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent.""This refers to "new organisms" - that would mean new species, not abiogenesis.And:"creation means that various forms of life began abruptly"This is definitely anti-evolution creationism without specifying a creator explicitly.Then:In a new draft of Pandas, approximately 150 uses of the root word "creation", such as "creationism" and "creationist", were systematically changed to refer to intelligent design.  The definition remained essentially the same, with "intelligent design" substituted for "creation", and "intelligent creator" changed to "intelligent agency".So, the definition remained the same, only the nouns were changed.  I wonder why the judge ruled that this really was the same old creation story?"the basic arguments for design pre-date Christianity"Fine.  The philosophers didn't have a clue about evolution back then and you still don't have a clue today.
