The design inference reached based on our knowledge of what nature, operating freely can & cannot do, coupled with our knowledge of what designing agencies can do.---PvMWe do not know that designing agencies can design a genome or a flagella. There is no inference to best explanation.---We look at the options. And the anti-ID option is "it just happened". We do have direct observatiuons of agencies designing rotary motors. We have NEVER observed nature, operating freely, even come close.----PvMThe design infernence is alo not disallowed, it's just that it cannot compete with the 'we don't know' explanation as it fails to add anything.---The design inference is disallowed. And experience tells us it makes all the difference in the world whether or not that which is being investigated arose via agency involvement or by nature, operating freely.And also it is not "we don't know" because all the textbooks are teaching that a designer was not involved.So when it comes to teaching the theory of evolution the only real answer is "we don't know"- as in we don't know whether or not the transformations required by universal common descent are even possible via any amount of accumulated mutations.Very simple really...
