If you believe in god (which one?) and god gave you the brains to think, then use your brains and follow the evidence.The universe is around 13.7 billion years old, our planet is about 4.7 billion years old, our current human species is somewhere around 150,000 years old.Very primitive books written by humans for humans in the region of the world that around the current Israel that record how these primitive people viewed the universe is nothing more than interesting history.Be aware that while these primitive books were written, highly sophisticated societies existed in other places of the world.The reality is that we do not need a god to explain anything all the way to the big bang.Here is an example of primitive thinking (as in lack of reasoning) that many apologists use:1.
