I believe that the first chapters of Genesis, including the ancient history of the Hebrew people, should be understood within the context of covenant. My friends, Tim Martin and Dr. Jeff Vaughn, have written a book, which can be purchased at their website:    http://www.beyondcreationscience.com   /The basic premise is that the same symbolism which guides our understanding of Revelation should also guide it in Genesis. The 6-day creationists insist on a so-called "literal reading of Genesis" to come up with their fanciful notions of "the end times." This literalism includes a woman who sits on 7 hills at one time, and various dragons etc. The literalists understand these symbols in MODERN terms: locusts are helicopters, etc.When understood in covenant, we see that the Hebrew people were called out of darkness into His marvelous light. We know from Genesis that the Sun and Moon and stars represented Jacob, Rachel, and the 12 sons. We know that throughout scripture, trees and beasts are used to describe humans, both clean and unclean, fruitful and unfruitful. Darkness and light were separated, as were the land and seas in that first chapter of Genesis. Even in the New Testament, we have revealed to us that the children of light were "called out of darkness," i.e., the old covenant, into the covenant of light.It is a remarkable study of covenant, and I highly recommend that anyone interested in the subject buy it and read it. Even if you don't agree with it, you'll be challenged to expand your thinking. Even the idea that Noah's flood covered the whole planet is challenged - and all of it from a biblical hermeneutic, long ago confirmed by Milton Terry, the great Methodist expositor.Beyond Creation Science: From Genesis to Revelationby Tim Martin and Dr. Jeff Vaughnavailable:    http://www.beyondcreationscience.com   /
