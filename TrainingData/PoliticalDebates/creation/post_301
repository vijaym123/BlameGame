Behe asserts:"Design is recognized in the purposeful arrangement of parts"Who decides if an "arrangement of parts" is "purposeful"?  What does "purposeful" really mean in that statement?  Do the parts have "purpose"?  Does the "arrangement" have purpose?  Did the designer have "purpose"?  If I take an old wristwatch and remove all the springs and gears and arrange them in a circle, is the circle designed?  If I throw them in a heap, are all of the parts of the watch no longer designed?  If I pick up some metal shavings off of the floor from under the lathe in the machine shop and arrange them into a complicated mathematical pattern that I generated using a computer program, can you tell if this is a "purposeful design" or just a "random design"?Is a virus designed?  A prion?  A fragment of RNA? A benzene molecule?  How can you tell?Waving your hands and saying "I know design when I see it" and "all life was obviously designed" just won't cut it.  Your religious motives in assuming your religious designer are too obvious to allow your judgment to go unquestioned.Behe further asserts:"and the cell exhibits the most profound purposeful arrangement of parts in the universe".There you go again, using that word "purposeful".  Well, it's really good "public relations" to appeal to religious people with such an assertion.  But scientists are unimpressed.  Maybe cells and prions and lifeforms have a "purpose" - to grow and reproduce and evolve - but unless you can show that there is really a "need" for a designer, there is no reason to assume that there was one.  So your task remains impossible - "prove" that evolution cannot have produced "this" over the last 3 billion years.  Go back 3 billion years and prove that a "cell" did not evolve from something simpler?  Or wave your hands and say "I don't believe it could have happened"?
