When the Supreme Court formulated 'valid secular purpose which is not a sham', the court unlikely believed that any future, unstated secular purpose would be sufficient for something to pass this requirement. That would make the rule unenforceable. Instead, one has to go from what the arguments presented are.Now if the DI believes that some valid secular purpose may exist, then it is up to them to present said claims. I understand that "academic freedom" is their latest variant to avoid dealing with the fact that ID is without scientific content.
