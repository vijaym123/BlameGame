Natural selection isn't "random".  Misrepresented?  I suggest you read the history on the recent Dover trial, very revealing.ID is not a scientific theory, please read the definition of what constitutes a scientific theory (and not the layman's version).I'd like to see the study that has actually calculated the statistical probability of life appearing.  Has this appeared in peer reviewed scientific journals?  Please cite instances of violent atheists who committed acts in the name of atheism.  I assume by violent you mean causing physical harm and destruction of property?  I don't know of a single one but I certainly know of multitudes of religious people who have done so.Religion is scary because it invokes mysticism over reason and attempts to transcend the concept of right or wrong.  I am commanded by God to kill my own son, there is no right or wrong, only the word of God.  Hardly makes sense.
