Are we really arrogant enough to think that a day to us equals a day to God? The thing is, the Bible never says how long a "day" is. I'm a fairly strong Christian (Episcopalian), but at the same time, I realize we need to read the Bible with a heck of a lot of common sense, and realize that a lot of the terms in the Bible are very metaphorical. Does that mean my interpretations are exactly correct? I'm not saying they are. I have to read it in such a way that I can make it all make sense to me. Do I pretend to know the age of the earth? No, nobody knows the age of the earth and we never will. It also doesn't help that you have sleazy con-men like Kent Hovind (who has a fake doctoral degree, and is a tax evader and federal criminal) endorsing such an idea. That makes the whole thing seem even more ridiculous. If I'm going to believe something, it better not be the ideas of a criminal.
