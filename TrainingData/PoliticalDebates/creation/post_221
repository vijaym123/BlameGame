"It also means that scientists who hold legitimate scientific views deserve to be heard even if their views differ from the consensus."You claim that these "scientists" hold legitimate scientific views - but that is the very topic under contention.  It would seem that you claim that they deserve to be heard and have not been heard - but that is also under dispute.  I assert that they have been heard and their arguments have been refuted and thus they are legitimately ignored until they come up with some actual scientific evidence and arguments."ID holds merit because the acceptance of ID will not only encourage new avenues of scientific research,"Well, it has not happened in the last 20 years - why should there be the slightest chance that this non-scientific nonsense will "encourage" "new avenues" of scientific research in the future?  And, if this is the actual goal of "intelligent design", why is there such an emphasis on trying to get this nonsense introduced into the public high school classroom?"With about 70 billion stars..."This number seems to be in error by a factor of a trillion or so.  What fool wants credit for this sentence?  :-)" ... 100 million life forms (at least here on Earth),"So what?  3 billion years of evolution is a loooong time."... the universe is a stunningly complex place."Nonsense.  The universe that we can see so far is quite simple.  It's only the evolved life forms on this Earth that appear to be complex.  It is amazing that evolving DNA with only 4 components can produce such a complexity of life, but it obviously has, so there's no need to claim that this is "stunning".  And even if it was "stunning", that is a meaningless adjective with respect to the discussion of the nonsense that is "intelligent design".
