You are exactly right - evidence is all around you, mountains of it in fact.Consider the observation of a solar eclipse.   The sun is 91 million miles away (or so), our moon is 238,000 miles (or so) - to spare me the looking up of the exact ratios - can we agree they are VASTLY different in size... yet during a solar eclipse they line up exactly.  What do you feel are the chances?The moon is necessary to our life for a wide number of reasons - light during night time, tidal forces, the affect on the tilt of the earth's axis, and also for measurement of time.Everything in the universe has the same situation.. a conspicuously planned appearance which defies logical explanation by chance.  I've argued about this subject enough that I truly don't have the interest in going further - the evidence is all around you.  You have chosen a materialistic option as the cause... a universe that popped into being by random accident from no known source.. DNA that appeared full of information.. my accident as well.. and the vast varieties of life.. also by accident.When I was an atheist I saw no evidence for God... once I believed - I looked again and realized 'how could I have been so blind... everything is evidence!'To choose to ignore the designed nature of the universe is willful ignorance.  But yes, he is a benevolent God.. because all who seek him will find him if they do so earnestly.
