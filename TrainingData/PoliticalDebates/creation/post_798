It has been translated for about six thousand years.  I do not know how their system worked but the dead sea scrolls were identical to the written word.I told you earlier that I did not always believe in God the way He wants us to believe in Him.  I believed there was a God, but that was the end of it.  What other records are there that are six thousand years old besides the Bible.  No one has ever been able to prove the Bible wrong.  Many have tried and many have found a relationship with God the Creator because of it.I don't know everything, but what I do know is by life experience,  Why would a God as great as he is take 4.5 billion years to create the earth when there is nothing to difficult for Him. Time means nothing to God.  Some things are a mystery for sure, but that is why it takes faith to please God.
