That is where you are wrong.The old argument that layers of sediment were deposited by the biblical flood are unsubstantial.Just because i found fish bones in my trash can does that mean they were deposited there by the flood too?The creationists need to re-examine the scriptures for where it talks about Darwin's book: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection."-DarwinIf anything the battles between races in the bible would support Darwin's theory.And gravity is due to cosmic evolution, which operates at a cosmological time scale, not a geological one; So space-time while continuing to expand, has not been known to contract from our four dimensional perspective. Although antimater has been annihilated with Lithium in collider experiments under laboratory conditions to release pure energy. But this is generally known.
