I appreciate that you are making attempts to answer all these issues. Apparently there is a lot of misinformation out there about your motives, and if they are left unanswered, people will simply believe them.        I can't say that I agree with the DI in all the details, but I certainly do believe that nature exhibits intelligence and design, not to mention beauty and love. Any one of these 4 alone lends credence to a Creator, as none are necessitated by the mere existence of a universe. In fact the mere fact that there is something rather than nothing, speaks for the hand of a Creator. The fact that all 4 of these coincide, adds momentum to the argument of a Creator.
