--TJ: Again, only valid if you trust Judge Jones, and Judge Jones is really only the ACLU in disguise because of how much he copied from them. The ACLU is anti-religion for the most part, although, to their credit, once in a great while, they will take up the cause of a religious person.--You seem to be ill informed but worse, you seem to have fallen victim of the DI propaganda.That's to bad.TJ: I'm not sure how I am ill-informed.  Come on, let me hear you say it straight out. Write it out for all of us to see.  I dare you.  "I believe that Judge Jones did not copy his analysis from the ACLU even though it was almost 91% verbatim.  I believe this happened just by accident like evolution."If this is what you really want us to believe, then I want to hear it straight from your mouth.  I'll tell you up front, that I don't have the faith to believe in a chance occurrence like that.  I'm deceived because I don't believe the 91% similarity in the ACLU's submission and the Judge's analysis was a lucky or freak coincidence?!!  I'm ill-informed because I think he copied it?  RIGHT!Again, it is amazing how gullible evolutionists think people are!  Absolutely amazing!tj
