“I think this comes down to an irreducible complexity argument...”So far Irreducible Complexity has failed ever time it was tested.  It’s validity as a Scientific theory has never been demonstrated.“how many mutations would be necessary to build this simple defense mechanism.. they would all need to happen simultaneously (or as a stretch.. nearly simultaneously) to be effective.. and thus superior by natural selection.”To reach modern levels quite a few mutations, however they built slowly over the past few million years.  The immune system did not have to arise simultaneously after all…   evolution   is a game of oneupmanship.One species develops defenses against a form of attach and goes on to prosper, while another species develops a new mechanism of attack that bypasses those defenses.  All this happens in a constantly changing   environment   where multiple pressures exist.Also, once a defense against one kind of attack has bee developed it is much easier to develop new defenses against a similar form of attack (once a species has developed a defense against one type of virus it is easier to develop defenses to similar types of viruses).
