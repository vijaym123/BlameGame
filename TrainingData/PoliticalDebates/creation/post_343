While I am quite happy with pwning 2 of the three statements you made, I am certainly willing to look at your final claim which references a statement by Richard Ryals. However, since Ryals is known to us as Island, I wonder how I pwn Island's self quotation.What is there to pwn but to point out that Island self-references in the hope of furthering the argument. Is that sufficient for a pwn or do you want me to also address your 'claim'?
