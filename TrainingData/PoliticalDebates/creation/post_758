There is no proof that there even exists a God to begin with, so in that case you can't really use that either. So we don't even have a confirmed eyewitness account. As I said, it also doesn't help anything that law-breaking conmen (e.g. Kent Hovind) pedal this BS. That really makes his case look weak and makes his followers look bad when he pulls some crap like that.
