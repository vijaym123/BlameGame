#originalTopic=Evolution_Is_Wrong
 Yes I believe the theory of evolution is wrong as there are no scientific facts about that. Every living thing on this earth is created by God with miracle. If we see creation of this universe then every single thing gives us the idea of the greatness of God. God first made Adam and Eve. Adam was the first human being and then the human race begins from there. If you think, how the first man was made then logic says that some creator has created the first man and He is God. Similarly is the case of every living thing on this earth. These creatures are created by God.
