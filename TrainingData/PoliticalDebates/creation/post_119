What always gets me with the Intelligent Design crowd is that, in their aim of inserting an external designer into the mix of biological science, they seem to miss or deliberately avoid one glaring fact - once life exists, with varying degrees of success, life designs itself according to the rules established by its environment and its own specific nature. Life needs no external designer. It has the power to design itself over time. Each of us is the design - conscious or not - of our two parents, or rather, of the egg and sperm that joined to create us. Some chance and some decision-making, some design is involved. Our parents, in turn, are the chance and deliberate design of their parents before them and so on. We purposely select our mates and the environment determines whether our coupling is successful or not. No matter the species, a great amount of examination and decision-making is involved one generation to the next. That is design, however, it is life designing life.Of course, how life first appeared is a separate issue. Nevertheless, knowledge of exactly what happened is not the same as mere supposition. Hard objective science will provide the answers to our questions. Supposition remains mere supposition unless it is followed by indisputable facts. Could the basic blocks for life been externally inserted upon the Earth by intelligent beings? Perhaps, however, before one intends to teach such as knowledge, it must be more than mere imagination. If the evidence substantially supports such a proposition, then, by all means, integrate it into "what we know" and relate such knowledge to children so that they too will have your understanding. If one's imagination remains mere imagination without substantiation by objective facts, then do not behave criminally by relaying it to children as knowledge when it is clearly not.
