Richard Dawkins and Victor Stenger argue that the existence of a creative super-intelligence or God are scientific questions."the presence or absence of a creative super-intelligence is unequivocally a scientific question." - The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, p. 58-59."The process I will follow is the scientific method of hypothesis testing.  The existence of God will be taken as a scientific hypothesis and the consequences of that hypothesis searched for in objective observations of the world around us.  Various models will be assumed in which God has specific attributes that can be tested empirically.  That is, if a God with such attributes exists, certain phenomena should be observable." - God: The Failed Hypothesis by Victor Stenger, p. 17-18.Do these scientists not understand the difference between science and non-science?
