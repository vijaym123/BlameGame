I asked the questions to give Mr Behe a hint about how to formulate a proper argument.  I am well familiar with the thought process of the ID proponents, having at one time been one myself.  Of course, I grew out of it before I graduated high school.  (and no, it was not because my teacher, pawn of the evil scientist cabal to keep creation science hidden, converted me.  It was because I did my own research and thinking and most importantly, i followed the data.)
