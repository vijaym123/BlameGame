Ignorance of terminology. A "Law" is just a description of a phenomenon.For instance: in a closed system, the amount of energy in that system is finite and thus the ability for that system to work reduces over time. That is the second law of thermodynamics. An example of a closed system is a small lighter, after so many uses it just won't work anymore.A theory, on the other hand, is a model of observations that explains those observations, and has predictive power. A theory is the highest point in scientific endeavor, because it utilizes facts, laws and observations in its explanatory powers, and is the direct result of verified hypotheses.
