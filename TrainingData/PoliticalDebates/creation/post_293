ICDESIGN is suddenly not interested in hearing about science anymore. Denial, a first step towards recovery. Just wait till the anger phase, that's the tricky one as many have come to reject faith during that phase.All because of insisting that ID should be able to prove the existence of God. What happened to good old faith? Do we insist that God reveals us to us in person, just like 'doubting Thomas' before we accept His existence?I am shocked.
