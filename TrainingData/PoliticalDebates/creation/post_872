"consider reading Chance or Purpose"At any rate "chance" is an obviously derogatory word to try to bias the argument against   evolution   and "purpose" is obviously meant to imply that some "intelligence" is involved.  But unless/until there is some way to establish that some intelligence is actually involved, "purpose" is not scientific.From a review of that book:"Cardinal Schonborn is clear that a literal interpretation of the Bible is not science"So it would seem that he (like most Catholics) would reject an interpretation of six literal days.From another review:"It reads as a series of transcriptions from the Cardinal's catechism lecturesAll around, the book is a great disappointment, leading one to conclude that the Cardinal is as flyweight an author of books, as he was an OpEd writer in the NYT."
