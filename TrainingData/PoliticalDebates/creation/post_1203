 There is absolutely no proof for Evolution. Despite the fact that Darwin is hailed as a genius in much of the scientific community, there are many holes in his theory. Darwin himself stated that if it was proven that an organism could not have come to exist through slight, successive changes over a long period of time, (in other words, if an organism was shown to be Irreducibly Complex) then his theory would fall apart. Irreducible Complexity has been proven with the example of the Flagella Motor, an extremely intricate system which requires all parts of itself to exist together in order to function.
