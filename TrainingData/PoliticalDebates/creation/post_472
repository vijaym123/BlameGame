--TJ10OK, you are right on this point as well. There is a difference between methodological naturalism and naturalism. I am still learning here. However, whether a scientist is a methodological naturalist or a true naturalist really doesn't matter. When they do their work, they do it assuming naturalism to be true. In other words, they allow no possibility for supernatural explanations or causes. This is even more difficult to understand if the person is not a true naturalist.---Such is the nature of science. And yes it does matter since a scientist can believe in a God and still use methodological naturalism as a method. Also, they do not exclude the possibility of the supernatural a priori, but rather a posteriori since the supernatural fails to explain anything since it can explain everything.Imagine a scientists looking at how a particular system works. Hmm, too hard to understand, poof must have been designed. Next part, hmmm looks intricate, let's invoke the 'poof explanation' again, this is taking too long.The reason scientists have come to accept MN as a valid tool is because it works so well.
