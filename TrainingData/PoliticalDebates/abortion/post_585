At the moment of conception a new member of our species is created.  If nothing happens to him or her, in nine months they will be what anyone would consider a person.It is my opinion that it is not acceptable to destroy the unborn during those nine months simply because they have not been born yet.  The person each of us becomes is certainly molded by more than just our genes.  However, an unborn child who is aborted never gets a chance to become anything.I see no comparison between   abortion   and war.  Soldiers are combatants and sometimes they kill each other.  In an abortion an innocent life is intentionally destroyed.  The corresponding action in a war would be the intentional killing of an innocent civilian, which is considered a war crime.
