Why do you think that   abortion   should be Legal? It's like killing a human. Why not give them the chance to live! Women make choices everyday! They made the choice to get pregnant and here are the consequences. They should learn from their mistakes and   adoption   is an option!!! Because an unwanted child can lead to an abused child, therefore they can choose adoption. Going to another topic...Gay marriage should be   legal  ! There are couples out there that really want to adopt a child in need but they can't. If you need the abortion because of rape or incest, medical complications should be allowed for them to get the abortion. Don't make the wrong choice if you can't handle the consequences!! Most abortions come from teenagers and they need to learn that   abstinence   is the way to go. Too much to say about this but i'll end it here.
