I'm against the choice to:Drink and driveCommit armed robberyRapeStealMurder (publicly or privately, regardless of victim's age)SlanderTrespassLieCheatEnslaveArsonAssaultBatterand any (other) crime you can think of.of course there's always another life involved in each of these scenarios, yet they're resolved.Your error comes from the fact that boys aren't part of women.  the Y chromosome is completely foreign to them, therefore the human embryo or fetus isn't a body part; the loss of a body part always, intrinsically results in some degree of harm to the organism, the destruction of an embryo results in the ultimate degree of harm, but not to the mother, not intrinsically at least.So, if I use my hand [body part] to shoot you, you're fine with that, right?Does a man then have the right to choose what to do with his loins?You too are dependent upon another human for life; you're just not attatched by an umbilical cord.  Does that mean we have the right to decide whether you live or die?
