In theory it sounds right that the mother also has rights and that the collective should care for the fetus, if they feel it has a right to live. However, what about personal responsibility? The personal responsibility of the mother to prevent life from forming if she did not want it? It's a bit late to talk about her rights over that fetus' rights that late in the game. If she used contraception and it was truly a mistake, I still say she has the ultimate personal responsibility. If she wanted to be sure not to conceive, use 2 forms of contraception, abstain...whatever it takes. Why should I, as part of the collective, be responsible for her whims? Or her lack of personal responsibility. That is the main theme here that is missing from our society...personal responsibility!So a mother can be irresponsible, even to the point of expecting everyone else take care of the child she doesn't want?
