If there is not a majority for either the   pro-life   or pro-choice position, then it does not make sense to say that the fair solution is to allow the government to spend American tax dollars on something which half of the country opposes.  For the pro-life side, legal abortion is an approximate moral equivalent of legal slavery.  (It treats human life as if it were the property of another.)  If one disagrees and believes that a woman's control of her body is so important that it justifies destroying human life, then that person is free to support theses groups by making an individual contributions.  It is absurd to suggest that there is no legislative bias either in favor or in opposition to abortion with the current policy when the current policy effectively compels everyone to underwrite the promotion of abortion.  The MCP was the fair solution.
