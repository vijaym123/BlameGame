How often do you think an   abortion   must be performed or else the mother will die?  I would bet that is not even 1% of the total.Most abortions are performed because: (1) the baby would interfere with school or career plans; (2) the mother is pressured into it by a husband, boyfriend or other relatives; or (3) the mother believes the baby will cause economic hardship.For all of the agonizing that goes on in making the decision, in the end it basically comes down to, "Baby, you are a major inconvenience, you have got to go."In showing compassion for the mother, not enough emphasis is placed on the psychological trauma caused to the mother by abortion, which the mother is not aware of until it is too late.  That trauma is only now starting to be more widely publicized.  Perhaps you read last year about the artist in England who was pressured by her boyfriend into aborting her twins and then went home and killed herself.  Her suicide note was heartbreaking.
