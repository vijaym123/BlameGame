First, "you people" is not a very polite way of addressing people. Second, a baby implies birth has happened and no one disagrees about the human life of a baby. The problem is the pro life side trying to redefine a baby and moving it backwards until it means a zygote.Third, No sex may be a preferable way for you to live your life, I pass no judgment on that. However that is you, there are many of us that consider having sex a natural, healthy, beautiful fun experience and see no compelling reason why an accidental fertilization should be the standard of judging whether we are responsible people or not.Fourth, we have responsibility only after we have made the personal choice of keeping a fertilized egg.
