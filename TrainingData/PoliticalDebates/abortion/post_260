Cannot be committed against a dead person. A dead body has no rights whatsoever. Legally, it has some PROTECTIONS, but protections do not equate to rights. THese protections are both a) sort of new, and b) not generalizable towards all corpses.Define development. Everything develops into something else. Corpses have stages of development. If you're defining life as a single-celled organism with a unique genetic code, corpses have a lot of those.
