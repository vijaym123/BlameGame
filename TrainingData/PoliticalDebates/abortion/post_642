I am broadly in favor of contentious issues being decided in smaller jurisdictions, rather than nationally. How would you feel about a national requirement that states not be able to enact bans that   cross a less-contentious, federally-defined limit e.g. rape/incest/serious harm to the mother? This could include some kind of counseling requirement and/or late-term ban as well - negotiated, in other words.My concern is a practical one. After 30 years of bitter fighting, I don't think we would get reasonable discussions like this one. The ideological institutions are geared up and ready, on both sides. If we make a change, I'd like to have some kind of damper to prevent a draconian, reactionary swing.
