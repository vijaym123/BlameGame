#originalTopic=can-catholics-vote-for-pro-choice-politicians
The purpose of this argument is to discuss whether a Catholic can vote for a pro-choice candidate.  You apparently are not Catholic and do not agree with the Church's position on various issues.  That is fine and your right, but we are straying far afield from the purpose of this discussion.  My purpose here is to argue that Catholics cannot vote for Senator Obama with a clear conscience.In any event, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has just released a statement at their website usccb.org that basically obliterates all of the justifications for the "Yes" position on this argument.  I will be interested in seeing how the experts on that side explain the statement away.  I also think the statement by the bishops will answer some of your questions raised in your reply to me.
