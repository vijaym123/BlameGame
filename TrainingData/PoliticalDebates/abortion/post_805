Yes, but now I have dillema for all you "you're a murderer if you abort!"Assume (but these situations really do occur) that a lady is 7 months pregnant. She goes to the doctor from pain in her belly and wants to be assured everything is OK. She finds out she has a serious complication that in which, she has to make a decision: a) wait at least another month hoping she can last that long so the baby can be born (prematurely, but hopefully alive enough to survive) and she dies, guaranteed, or b) abort the child for her life. Which one should she pick? If she picks b) does that mean she's a selfish bitch and a "murderer" just because she wanted to live longer for, probably, her children she already has, her husband, and because letting her child have her life without his mother would suck just as much itself? (Even though, in most of these cases, the mother will pick option a0 and the husband will try to talk her out of it).So, sure, you can call abortion murder as much as you all want, but it's getting really out of hand. For someone to make a wise and rational decision of aborting a fetus for whatever their reason, takes a lot more guts than you'll ever think. Also to mention, to put the word "Murder" up there is just REALLY low. I mean, you're making all these women feel like they should probably commit suicide by having a murder label on them. It's harsh. Alas, what if we gave an eldery person a drug so they could finally pass away upon their wishes? I'm sure that would be in the same category as "Murder" yet, a lot of people are fighting for something like this to be legal itself (it's only legal with doctor consent in Oregon). So, really, I don't think abortion is murder, nor do I think it is a selfish, I think all of you calling it murder and selfish are selfish. :-)
