"Just look at pictures of aborted fetuses with their arms and heads chopped off." Okay, look at pictures of fetuses. Do they look like actual people? No, of course not. They look like fetuses. That is because they are fetuses, not human beings. "...unborn child." Contradiction in terms. Children have been born. A fetus is not a child."For all you know you might have just aborted the person who foudn teh cure for cancer or diabetes." People are not aborted. Fetuses get aborted. Fetuses are not people."...those who perform them are murderers." Murder means to deliberately kill another human being justifiably. Fetuses are not human beings. Therefore, those who perform abortions are not murderers.
