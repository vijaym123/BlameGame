I am happy that someone said this.  The law cannot ignore morality, and just because many voters derive their morality from religion- that does not mean that they shouldn't weigh in on the issues.  It is incumbent upon them to do just the opposite.  Unlike transubstantiation, the ending of a human life is not a theological nicety- it is an important moral controversy.
