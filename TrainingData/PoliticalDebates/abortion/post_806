i most def. think that it should be still legal for those who have been raped. These girls would have been raped and then have a new situation they also have to deal with along with the rape, and that could be stressful. For those of you that says that the reason for it to not be legal is cause its murder, it technically is not murder because if someone is raped and then find out they are pregnate would be in such a short time spand that the baby would not even be an embryo yet. there are those situations where it is an embryo but it had no human connection what so ever. it has never created memories or even knows what is going on, so if it were to be killed by abortion i feel as if it would not really matter.
