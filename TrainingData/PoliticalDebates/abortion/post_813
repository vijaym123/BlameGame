the reason i have chosen against this argument of abortion being murder in the case of incest or rape is because, you have stated that rape of a women is exactly the same as having sex without a condom. This is completely false, she has not chosen to have sex with the man who raped her, she has not chosen that she did not want to use protection. a women who chooses with someone she is planning to have sex with is at fault for getting pregnant. Those are two completely different scenarios and i am appalled that you would come the least bit close to saying that it is the womens fault for getting pregnant in a situation she did not choose, how dare you! If you were raped and got pregnant would you want the baby of the man who torments your every nightmare to be growing inside you, to further remind you of the horrific thing that happened to you.
