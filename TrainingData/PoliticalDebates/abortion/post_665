Using some god as an arbiter of right and wrong is wildly dangerous unless you live in a completely homogeneous society. After all, many religions have a god, and they often have very different moral codes. To read up a bit on at least one variation on morals, check out Peter Singer (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer  #Applied_ethics). His philosophy is quite up my alley, and might at the very least offer you a different perspective on how morality can work.To put my perspective in a nutshell, "life", or "personhood", or whatever you want to call it, should be based on capacity for cognition. This does mean that there will be both levels of personhood as well as different types, as there are both levels of cognition and a wide array of cognitive abilities.
