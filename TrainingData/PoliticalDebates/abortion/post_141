#originalTopic=Debate:_Partial-birth_abortion
A ban on partial birth abortions would stop other even more "gruesome" forms of late term abortions. The primary alternative to partial birth abortion is the dismemberment and removal, in parts (legs, arms, head, torso), of an unborn fetus while inside the mother's womb. This may be more "gruesome" than a partial birth abortion. A ban on partial birth abortion would not eliminate this primary alternative to partial birth abortion. Neither would it necessarily reduce the number of overall late term abortions being performed. This only goes toward pointing out that a partial birth abortion ban, in isolation, would not necessarily reduce the "gruesomeness" of the late term abortion procedures being performed.
