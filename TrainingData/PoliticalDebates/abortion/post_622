I am very sorry for what happened to you.  You are wrong in assuming that because I know that   abortion   kills a child that I must not care about the mother.  I do care about the mother and I care about you.  I have personal friends who have had an abortion and I love them.  I also love that precious life that was inside of you.  You don't know if carrying your child to term would be raping you again because you never did carry your baby to term. You don't know that you are better off aborting your baby because you can never know what life would have been like with him or her.  You are also assuming that because I base my beliefs on Christian principles that I must be wrong.  Are you absolutely sure there is no God?  That He doesn't love and care for us at every level?  That He doesn't care for your child who is now with Him?  Can you substantiate any claim you make or imply that abortion is justifiable?  What happened to you was horrific but how did having an abortion make it better? That baby didn't commit a   crime   against you but he/she received the   death penalty   for it.  Rape is wrong but so is   murder  .  What moral stand are you taking?  Rape is wrong because it was done to me but murder is not wrong because I committed it?   I don't know you and you probably don't think I understand you but I am going to be praying for you everyday. You may not believe it, but God loves you because He made you and He is watching over you and can bring healing into your life.
