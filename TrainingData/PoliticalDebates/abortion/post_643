As I matter of principle, I would not want federal involvement because I do not think it is constitutional.However, as a matter of political reality, you would not have states passing laws that prohibited   abortion   in cases of rape and incest.  Exceptions for those circumstances are supported by an overwhelming majority of the public.  In any event, those account for only about 1% of the abortions each year.The health of the mother exception might be more contentious because of the issue of how you define a threat to health.  I think the fact that both sides would be geared up and ready if the issue was returned to the states would actually prevent the reactionary, draconian swing you are concerned about.  Neither side would have an advantage beyond the fact that some states clearly trend towards one position or the other.
