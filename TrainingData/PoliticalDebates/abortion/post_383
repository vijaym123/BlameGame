I am sorry to disagree with you.I think it should never be up only to the woman to decide because:1. There are two humans involved: the mother and the unborn child.2. The father has to be taken into account because the unborn child is 50%"his" 3. Such a decision should always be thought out well seeking the help of family, friends, experts, etc...4. The unborn is not property of it's mother. he has it's own human rights (to live for example). If no one bothers to defend it's rights (it's own mother refuses) society has to protect him instead.Roe vs Wade is flawed in many ways:   http://www.abort73.com  /?/abortion_facts/us_abortion_law/
