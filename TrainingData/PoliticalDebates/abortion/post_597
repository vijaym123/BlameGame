First, I find it interesting that you intentionally choose the loaded term "anti-choice" as opposed to pro life to describe your opponents.  Of course the other side does the same with pro-  abortion   but that doesn't make it a sound practice.  Your argument should stand on its merits, not on emptionally loaded terms.Second, your argument that personhood is what matters is, in my view, a subterfuge.  What I can't fathom is why, when you cannot say when that is, any more than others can answer when life begins, you have no problem with proceed with abortion without an answer.  Whether the issue is life or personhood, the same problem remains.  If you can't determine when personhood occurs, you always run the risk of killing a person through abortion.In the end all you've really done is move the problem somewhere else.  You haven't solved anything.
