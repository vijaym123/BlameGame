There is no point in engaging in discussion if the basis of the discussion is in emotion. Emotion may inform our thinking, but ultimately any real discussion must come down to logic. Many aspects of life are emotional. Our emotions exist to aid us, but they are not perfect. A mother mourning for the death of her unborn child is both logical and illogical; logical because she can understand the joy she would have had with the child, illogical because there was no actual conscious being there and the feelings stem from raw emotion. When a woman chooses whether to have an   abortion  , they may feel horrible about it, but know that it is the best decision. Those that regret what they've done because they feel they have done something wrong are free to feel that way, but that should not cause us to restrict the choice of others.
