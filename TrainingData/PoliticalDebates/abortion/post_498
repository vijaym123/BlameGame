It's much cheaper for the state to pay for a woman to abort a child she cannot afford than for the state to pay for that child through its entire life. Forcing women to carry   children   to term, especially when they don't have the means or desire to raise the child is good for no one, not least the child.   Children born to mothers without the means to take care of them are more likely to be abused, uneducated, unhealthy, do drugs, commit crimes, etc.  In the book Freaknomics, the authors discuss the fact that   crime   rates inexplicably plummeted about two decades after Roe vs. Wade; they argue that this is because many poor women chose to abort their children rather than have them, resulting in fewer criminals 20 years on.
