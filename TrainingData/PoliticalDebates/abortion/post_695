You're argument rests on a false interpretation of the idea of potential. The definition of potential is, "all the necessities of y are contained innately within x  and x will become y without prevention by an outside source."For example, a seed in the ground has the potential to become a plant and will become a plant unless it is uprooted, eaten by animals, refused water, etc.A single random cell cannot replicate itself into a human, it needs a tremendous amount of human intervention.  A sperm will also not become a human, but must be combined with an egg first and be within the uterus to be classified as a potentially human. Additionally, your appendix is a part of your person-hood, as it contains your DNA.  A fetus is a different entity with distinct DNA and will be a distinct person.You have the right to kill your own person-hood, including any bodily organ that is of your own DNA.  Now, if it were actually cloned, it would become a separate entity because your mind is not split between two entities, but that is an entirely different argument.
