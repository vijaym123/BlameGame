I disagree with the binary assumption: human or not human. Something that has the potential to be human is not the same as something that is human, but it is certainly not worthless. I feel that it is dangerous to deal in absolutes.Is a brain dead person on life support a human? I'd say yes. Now in a fire, who should be rescued first, the unconscious nurse or the vegetable? Harsh!Is a convicted criminal a human? I'd say yes. But we strip that person of their inalienable rights.Is a soldier in an enemy army a human? How about an 'enemy combatant'? ...The truth is that we assign, as a society, the rights we deem appropriate to the circumstances. We constantly balance one person's rights against another's. We do not have a black and white system where every human gets the same treatment. It is a crime to sterilize someone against their will. That is assault on the potential parent, not the potential children. Somewhere along the way the potential child starts to get rights independent of the potential parent. In some unfortunate cases, those rights are in opposition. I do not believe that we should ascribe equal rights to the fertilized egg and the unconscious nurse. If only one can be saved it should be the potential mother.The humanity (humanness?) of a fetus grows with time. It is not a light switch nor a flip of a coin.
