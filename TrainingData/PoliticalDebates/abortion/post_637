When life begins is a scientific fact, so an opinion poll really doesn't help that much.  Inalienable rights means they can't be taken away, and as we all know that is not from the   bible   or from personal belief, but from our civil   society  's founding document.  By the logic of Jon Obrien slavery, prostitution, women's rights, civil rights, etc. should not have been addressed by civil   law   either.
