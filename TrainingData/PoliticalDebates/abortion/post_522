While most of your argument is very good, I do have a problem with you denying that   abortion   to save the life of a mother cannot be valid if you believe the fetus to be a person.  If there is a car crash, and two people are somehow fused together in such a way that one will live and the other will die if seperated, but if left together both will die, then the doctor has a tough decision to make, but ultimately should make.  One must be saved and one must die.  This is the same scenario as if an abortion occured to save the life of the mother.  Being as the mother usually has a higher chance of survival, it is usually wise to save her rather than the baby.  Granted, at that point, it is the doctor's decision.  As far as the other extenuating circumstances, you are right, they have no justification.  I also disagree with your apparent belief that we should err on the side of liberty over life.  I would place life before liberty, and would rather risk denying someone a freedom they should have had to try and save someone's life than deny someone a life they should have had to try and save someone's freedom.
