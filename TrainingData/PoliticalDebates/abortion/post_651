Of course they change over time, as medical knowledge increases.  Good luck finding a modern book on embryology that states that a human life is not created at conception.With regard to your point on brain activity, a brain that is dead is still a human brain.  A brain that is developing in an unborn child is still a human brain that is developing.I find the whole "brain wave argument" to be another evasion.  Is it really okay to destroy a human life simply because it does not have what you regard as sufficient brain activity?  The brain is developing.One thing is certain, if the unborn child is aborted, he or she will never have a chance to have any type of brain activity.
