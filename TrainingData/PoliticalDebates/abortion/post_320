Unfortunately, it is not relevant here.  We have already established that it is immoral to have an   abortion  , and I never said that it was moral to refuse a dying person your kidney.  Really, it's pretty cold.  Nor did I say that it was not as harmful.  In both situations, someone ends up dead.  The debate however, was not about the morality or the harmfulness of either.  It was about the government's ability to make laws.  The government cannot make laws requiring you to go out and actively save lives.  There are no "Good Samaritan" laws.  If there were, Ted Kennedy would be in prison, not the Senate.  Murder, the active killing of another person, on the other hand, is illegal. There might not be a moral difference, but there is a legal one.  Morality and the amount of damage done have nothing to do with it.
