"the body is no longer able to continue essential functions independently." We can't apply this definition because some of these essential functions cannot be continued because they are still in development. You can't say "no longer able to" if it hasn't even started yet.Simple logic.A Zygote from the moment of conception is in a constant developpement that goes beyond the moment he's out of the womb. And no dependency can justify the killing of a human being. The greater good always is life, there are no greater good than the life of a human being.Furthermore if what you said was true then the life of a human beings depends solely on the artificial technology that is able to make him survive out of the womb.
