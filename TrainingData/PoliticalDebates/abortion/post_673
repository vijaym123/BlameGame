You haven't given any reason to rule out conception as being sufficient, and you have allowed that it is necessary.  Miner's point was not that it was logically necessary that conception be considered the starting point- rather that it is 'logical' to err on the side of caution when potentially taking human life.  This is a non-technical use of 'logical', and he might have been better off to say 'rational'.  If you get past that point, then he is certainly right that if you wish to choose the most 'cautious' interpretation, then it would mean that you'd have to pick conception.  (Your suggestion of haploid gametes is just silly.)
