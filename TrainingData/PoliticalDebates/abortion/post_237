Quote from previous commenters: "...in 2002 alone there were 357 maternal deaths in the USA." It is true that indeed giving birth is NOT without its risks.But successful abortion carries a 100% rate of risk of death to the child. And in contrast to the unfortunate 357 maternal deaths we see an unfortunate rate of almost 1.3 MILLION infant deaths in 2002 to abortion (    http://www.nrlc.org/ABORTION/facts/abortionstats.html    ).I suspect it is one's ego that is willing to value one life more than another... or one life more than 3,613 others.In response to "A woman has a right over what happens inside her body," actually I believe what the previous commenter was trying to say was "A woman has the right over her own body." But science tells us that the child inside is not her body, but a completely different body and person. Common sense concludes that nobody has the right to control the life or death of another person regardless of their location, age or status (born or not).
