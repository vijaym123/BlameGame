I've been pregnant 5 times, if that means that I am uniquely more qualified than a man to make a decision about something that relates to women.Abortion kills a human offspring at the stage of human development called either embryo or fetus.  That doesn't make it non-human.  Infant, child, adolescent, and adult are names for other stages of human development.An embryo has, from the very moment of conception, it's own unique DNA.  That is a scientific fact.  It is not a part of a woman's body but a unique being that happens to be developing in the place where it was designed (by God or nature, your choice) to develop until the time it is ready for birth.It absolutely does affect everyone if   abortion   is legal.  There are many consequences to society, whether financial (when taxpayer funds are used to fund it, or in dealing with the medical consequences that often follow) or not (as in the higher rate of child abuse that we have in the time that abortion has been legal).I support groups that help women when they are in crisis pregnancy situations.  If a woman has a financial or emotional circumstance that may cause her to think that abortion is her only choice (or if she is pushed into an abortion by a boyfriend, husband, parent, or someone else), we as a society should stand up and let her know that there are ways that we can help her besides telling her that killing her child is the only option.  The way to help a woman with a crisis pregnancy is to help her solve the crisis.Abortion is a betrayal of women - even early feminists like Susan B. Anthony believed that.  Those who didn't are women like Margaret Sanger, who was a proponent of eugenics and a racist who supported Hitler.
