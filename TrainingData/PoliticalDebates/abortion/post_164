#originalTopic=Debate:_Partial-birth_abortion
Part of the mistake that a girl or woman might have made is not having used sex protection and/or not taking a pregnancy test and seeking an early, first term abortion. The argument here is that the provisions given to a woman should be as flexible as possible, affording her the "right" to make life-changing choices throughout the entire course of her pregnancy, and not locking her into an unwanted pregnancy after a certain point, as would be the case with a partial birth abortion ban. On an issue where great life-changing impact can occur from singular mistakes, and particularly when these mistakes are frequently made during an immature emotional period in a woman's life, it may be important for society to provide women with the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to make major decisions throughout their pregnancy.
