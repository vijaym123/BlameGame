I appreciate your feedback and do apologize that this thread hasn't yet satisfied your question.  Therefore, I shall here try to simplify the ojective argument.  The cell is the basic/fundamental unit of life.  Human DNA is unique to human beings.  An organism whose somatic (non-reproductive) cells contain the full human genome is therefore a human being.  A person is defined as a human being, therefore any human being is a person.  A person may be alive or dead as a human being may be alive or dead.  This seems to be important as many wish to interperet the law only for "persons".  A living person thus is entitled to those fundamental rights belonging to any other living person, in this case, life.  Since life begins at conception, and the cell at conception of human offspring contains the entire human genome, and makes up the entirety of an organism (as opposed to a sperm cell - incomplete DNA - or a hair - incomplete/non-living organism), it constitutes a human being, and therefore, by definition, a person, who therefore, from conception, as per the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America (this site seems to be restrictive to U.S. policy), is entitled to 'certain unalienable rights among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (in that order).'I sincerely hope this satisfies; it's refreshing to see someone who seems truly open-minded about the matter.
