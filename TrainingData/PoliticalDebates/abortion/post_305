Yes, yes you apparently are, for I but mirror your argument.  Now, since you bring it up, the first and primary (and therefore legal) definition of the word person is "Human Individual" or humand being - Webster's.So what makes a human being?  DNA for one.  Like you said, there are other factors, but development isn't one of them, and niether is age.  There is, however, another way to determine one's humanity; when both parents of the child are human.  Since there has yet to be shown (and never can be) any incident where two organisms of the same species successfully reproduced a member of a different species (hence the 're' in 'reproduce').
