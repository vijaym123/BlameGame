As in the past, you present a thoughtful question.  I will think more about this.For now, I will just ask "What is Natural Law?" and have we rights, after all, which are "given us by our Creator, such as Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness?"Does that still have meaning, today?  And, if not, then are we "in the soup" or not?
