I can only assume by your moniker that you are a male and consequently will never experiance facing an unwanted pregnancy.  Infants are not "being killed" because an embryo is not an infant.  Until that "child" can function and breath on it's own it's still considered part of the woman's body.  A woman does not give up her human o legal rights simply because she conceives.  Like I've said, unless the woman involved is your girlfriend, wife, mother, sister, ect. you have no right to tell her what to do with her body.  It's of no financial burden to you if she chooses   abortion  .  It's of no concern to you if she chooses abortion.  The woman is a stranger to you.  You have no knowledge of her financial or emotional circumstances.  It's none of your business unless you plan on supporting the child for the next 18 years of it's life.
