According to the logic behind this argument as to why a woman should have no legal control over her body parts, you and I have committed murder, or man-slaughter.There are thousands of innocent children who are dying everyday through lack of such a simple thing as a functioning kidney, or bone marrow.  When you choose to retain your body parts, or choose to not undergo a painful process you are killing those children through your inaction.  If you know that a child will die and you do nothing to prevent it, you have murdered that child.  According to the logic that a woman must give up control of her body parts for the sake of saving a life, all people must do so.  If   abortion   should be illegal, so also should non-compliance with other medical procedures that can save lives.
