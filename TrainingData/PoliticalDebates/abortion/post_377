The man has no responsibility until the child is born. He might die. He might skip town. He might get thrown in prison. The woman might have had more than one sexual partner around the time of conception.   The man has no rights at all. It's all up to the mother. She has to carry it for nine months(should she choose to have it). The man is irrelevant in this situation. The choice is and should only be the mother's.
