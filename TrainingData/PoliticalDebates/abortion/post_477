Yes.  Now.  Because   abortion   is now considered a "right", it is beyond the court of the land to enforce it.But don't you argue that the court (the State) can violate Natural Law?  Shouldn't the court violate the right to elective abortion?I more than that look upon the "little one's" right to life.  If we haven't a right to life, then of what value or usefullness are other "rights" (the right to free expression becomes possibly the right to verbally object within the scopes of firing squads?I've tracked down my old friend of a decade ago.  Here's some info about him.  It's dated, so I must phone him soon.      Stephen D.
