Our society is governed by laws, not by universal truth. It is a practical necessity given the slippery nature of universal truths. Society, religion, and law all change over time.The God of the Bible is the deity of many different religions, which have serious disagreements about the moral interpretation of their varied, updated translations of the bible. Not surprisingly, we each believe our current one is right.You are attempting to establish an absolute, but I see nothing here that is well-defined or unchanging.  It is certainly not clear that conception is inherently more important than a host of other miraculous events in the continuation of human life. Each is necessary, but none are individually sufficient. Life is worth protecting at every point, but not equally so.
