One thing that rarely comes up in the   abortion   debate is the high number of spontaneous abortions. It seems that God is the biggest inducer of abortions.   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/001488.htm  . An estimate of between 25 to 50% of fertilized eggs are spontaneously aborted.The figures on that are a guess because they happen before most women even know they are pregnant and don't usually get pregnancy tests done. Of the known pregnancies, about 10% are naturally aborted. How does that figure into the wonders of religion?
