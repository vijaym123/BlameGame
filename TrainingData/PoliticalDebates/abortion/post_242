"Guess what? I'm an Atheist! I'm against   abortion   because I believe that it's wrong to take a human life period. I'm also against the death penalty. As a person with a degree in Biology I realize that Human life begins at conception."In other words, one human being can coerce another human being to provide services for them, regardless of whether the other human being (providing the services) consented to this contract of sorts?
