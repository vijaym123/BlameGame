Support can be provided to women that don't want or can't handle a child. Ronald Reagan, "Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation", Human Life Review, Spring 1984. - "As we continue to work to overturn Roe v.

Pro-life people have already taken heroic steps, often at great personal sacrifice, to provide for unwed mothers."[24]
