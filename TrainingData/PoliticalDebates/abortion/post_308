"The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion" - Treaty of Tripoli, 1797, signed by John Adams, passed unanimously by the Senate, with no sign of public dissent.In other words, the government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. Straight from the horse's mouth, it doesn't get any clearer than that. The Founders conscientiously derived their secular political philosophy from Enlightenment ideas. It deliberately recognized and secured individual rights, a unique historical achievement. Religion never has, and in fact, has only ever acted against it. Tell us, what does the Bible have to say about individual rights, checks and balances, veto power, Constitutional amendments, bicameral legislatures, republican government, enumerated powers, etc.? I thought so.Moral relativism vs. religion is a false alternative promulgated by religionists. Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, provides the secular, absolute, rational basis for individual rights and the American system of government. It does so flawlessly, unlike religion, which has only ever caused an erosion of individual rights. Its ethics is fully secular. It is not based on moral relativism. Objectivism formalizes what every culture knows: That legal prohibitions against murder, rape, theft, etc., are necessary to secure the lives of its members.
