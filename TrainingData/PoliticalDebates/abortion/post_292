But seriously, I've seen your posts, nowhere do you refute the HUMANITY of a HUMAN embryo/fetus.  Can I be any more blunt?  You cannot prove the absence of the subject, nor can you deny the race (the human race) to which he/she belongs.  Therefore, and since I have here proven that an unborn human is still a human being; and since it is also true that said humans are alive, they are therefore, by definition, persons.  End of case.
