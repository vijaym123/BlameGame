There are many arguments to both sides of this issue, but I think the arguments for being pro-life are way better than the one's for being pro-choice. First of all, no matter how much you deny it, cover it up, or lie about it, abortion is killing someone. You can keep telling yourself that it isn't, but it is. That's against the law just to let you know. It is against my religion and that is one of the reasons why I think it is wrong, but I can argue from a secular point of view also. The Declaration of Independence lists three inalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn't killing an innocent baby taking all three of these rights away from it? Also, one argument for being pro-choice is that restrictions on abortion are a violation to rights of privacy, but privacy is not mentioned once in the constitution. Besides, isn't the right to life a little more important the right to privacy? If the baby itself is not causing any real danger to the mother, then she does not have the right to takes its life a way.
