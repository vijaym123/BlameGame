Your statement that the embryo during the first trimester is pre-human is your opinion, devoid of any religious teachings or thoughts of the rights of that fetus. The woman who becomes pregnant (in the vast majority of cases) is responsible for her condition--either because she was irresponsible about taking precautions, ignorant of what could happen when she had unprotected sex, or simply considers abortion a form of birth control. Personally, I felt protective of any of my children from the first moment I knew that I was pregnant, and I was already aware of their humanity. Another possibility is that many minor girls are forced by their parents or boyfriend to have an abortion when they don't want one. What about their rights?However, you sidestep the real problem. Many abortions are performed AFTER the first trimester--right up until the baby is viable outside the womb--including by partial-birth abortions. How any morally aware person can approve of killing infants that can feel pain and are capable of sustaining life outside the womb is incomprehensible to me. Yet millions of women do it, while at the same time many parents are courageously fighting to keep their prematurely born infants alive by the technology available today?I grant that a woman has the right to decide she doesn't want the child she was "usually" responsible for conceiving, but that is what adoption is for. There are untold couples who cannot have children standing in line to receive that baby. Plus, most women who decide to have an abortion never think about what physical or emotional harm that it may cause them in the future. Maybe they will be unable to conceive when they decide they do want a child. Maybe they will survive from the guilt they felt when/if they saw the dead fetus removed from their body.
