When we grant American dollars to foreign family planning clinics that use “their private, non-US funds” for abortions, we still indirectly fund   abortion  . There is no way around this, as giving such an organization funds for any of their other services frees up their private, non-US funds for abortions that would otherwise be used on the other services. If we pay their electric bill, the   money   they budgeted for it can now be used for anything, including abortions.To the millions of Americans who believe that life begins at conception this means we have funded killing the most defenseless members of our   society  . I doubt their blood will easily wash off our hands.
