It is incorrect to say that the issue has been resolved by science. What is the molecular change that is so important? The unique genetic events happen earlier, when the gametes form. Conception is a necessary event, but it is only one of many along the way. Because our biomedical sciences are in the era of the gene, we have become focussed on the importance of genes in every process. We confer a false sense of importance to a unique set of genetic material.Identical twins are illustrative. Their separate lives certainly don't begin at conception.
