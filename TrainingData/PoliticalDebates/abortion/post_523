"I would place life before liberty, and would rather risk denying someone a freedom they should have had to try and save someone's life than deny someone a life they should have had to try and save someone's freedom."which is odd, you being a military man.    we've argued this before... but now that i know you're pre-military, it has all the more meaning.  how can you be going into such a position where liberty is extended over life?  give me liberty or give me death.freedom isn't free.a thousand other cliches....     life without liberty is a poor, sad life.   not much of a life at all.
