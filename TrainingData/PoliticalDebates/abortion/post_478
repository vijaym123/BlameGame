You have to look at the concept of natural   law  , and what would allow those rights to be violated. Do the laws of the state have the right to violate those natural rights?I'd argue that yes, they do.There may be natural law, but there isn't a natural law that states, for example, that, oh, you can't smoke   marijuana  . I think you'd be hardpressed to find someone who believes that is a natural law. However, the state can imprison you for doing so, thusly infringing on your Natural Right to liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.There's no Natural Law that says you have to be loyal to your country, but the State has the right to kill you if you commit treason, violating your Natural Right to life.
