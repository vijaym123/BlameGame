Damn thats a good point, I never thought about it that way. If abortion was illegal it would just have women revert to the old ways IE close hangers. Or women would just say they were raped to get an abortion in the end it would be terrible for the feds to make abortion illegal, also I think it should be women deciding this not men. If women were trying to tell us men not to masturbate what would we tell them?
