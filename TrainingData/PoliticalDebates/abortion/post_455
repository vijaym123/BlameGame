Even if we accepted your ridiculous argument in all its vagaries that abortion has a negative impact on communities and society at large, it would be completely irrelevant. The issue is not communities or societies. The issue is individual rights. There is no such thing as a moral decision to override the rights of the individual. Overriding the rights of the individual is the negation of morality.By the way, nothing good has ever come from communities overriding individual rights. Study world history.
