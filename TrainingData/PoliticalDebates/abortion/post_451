She said her husband had a vasectomy. The failure rate is only about .01%-1%. THIS IS BIRTH CONTROL!!!!! Are you brain dead? Yes, I am sure having six   children   shows you the joys of having a child, but it also shows you the trials, tribulations, etc. of child rearing as well. What about the strain on a family of eight bringing another child in the world? Frankly, is it even any of your business? And by the way, to condemn someone who, even by anti-choicer's standards "played" by the rules and did use birth control is pretty weak. So now her and her husband have to throw on three condoms cover themselves in spermicidal, use a diaphram, and be on the pill, as well as taking Plan B after the fact? Is that enough for you? No, because if even after all this, she was unfortunate enough to get pregnant, you would condemn her anyway for not being "careful" or "responsible" enough. Do you have any adopted children? I am tired of your crowd spouting out hate and then passing the buck to some random family that wants a baby through the   adoption   system. Put your   money   where your mouth is. Keep your legs crossed horribledisaster.
