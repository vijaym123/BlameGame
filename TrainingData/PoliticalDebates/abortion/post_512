You wrote, "If federal aid is being given out there is no reason that it should favor one side over the other, if done in consonance with how our country feels about this question than the aid money will be split fifty - fifty."That is an interesting position.  It is one which frankly I've never thought of or heard before.  I suppose it would be 'fair', in terms of representing the public will.We could send money to groups abroad that counsel individuals to get abortions and campaign for   pro-choice   laws, and then send the same amount of money that tell women that they shouldn't get abortions and campaign for pro-life laws.It is an interesting idea.That would be even-handed and in a sense equitable.  I think that the MCP's way of achieving neutrality is more practical.Your suggestion would result in our money essentially 'balancing itself out'.  It would also ratchet up the level of conflict- sort of like arming two warring factions equally.  I'm not sure if that would be good (although I don't know if it would be bad either).It probably would not be a good use of tax dollars though.  It also would not be likely to further the humanitarian goals of our aid program.
