I am sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, I believe that you are the exception. I am sure that there are many women out there who had abortions and would have kept the baby if they had the same level of support that you were willing to offer. Many women don't get that support. Alternatively on the point that men should be included in the debate, I have personally heard a few men exclaim that it is unfair that they made a mistake one night, and now have to pay child support for 18 years because they didn't have a say in the matter. So men's inclusion in the issue wouldn't necessarily lead to less   abortion  . I don't think that the government (or anyone else for that matter) should ever have control over women's reproductive choices. For instance, I would be just as strongly opposed to government mandated abortions as I am towards banning abortion all together. Many women, including myself, find it unfair that men enter the   abortion debate   because a man is intrinsically different than a woman. I don't have a say over a man's reproductive organs, nor do I think that I should. Similarly, I don't think that men, the government, other women, etc. should be able to tell a woman that she has to give up her body for 9 months, regardless of what she wants. It is making her a second class citizen and a prisoner to her own womb. Once again, I am sorry for your personal experience. Maybe people should decide as a couple where they stand on the abortion debate before engaging in sex. Even so, I guess that speculation about what you would do in the event of an unplanned   pregnancy   can't be comparable to when you are actually faced with the decision.
