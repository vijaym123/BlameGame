Walking an a beach I came across a sign that read: "Sea Turtle eggs - Stay out. Fine $ 1000.00"So we may not walk on a beach with eggs of a turtle, but we may kill over 4 000 000 human eggs per year that holds the same potential as the turtle eggs - life. And we get the state to pay for it? Where did we loose the plot.
