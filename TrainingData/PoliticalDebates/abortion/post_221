The statment released yesterday by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops directly refutes this argument by Catholic Democrats.  Catholics who want to see what the Bishops have to say on this issue should go to usccb.org for the statement.It should be noted that the statement was issued under the names of Cardinal Rigali, Chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities, and Bishop Murphy, Chairman on the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development.  Catholics must fight for Social Justice and fight against abortion.  As set forth in the first paragraph of the statement, "Unfortunately, there seem to be efforts and voter education materials designed to persuade Catholics that they need choose only one approach: either opposing evil or doing good.  This is not an authentic Catholic approach."
