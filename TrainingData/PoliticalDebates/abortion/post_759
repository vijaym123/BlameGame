Could I ever personally see my mate go through abortion? See my seed fade away? No never. It would burn into my very heart and leave a big scar. But there are people out there who are willing. Those people deserve that choice even if it means that a life won't enter this world. They're just hurting themselves, but it's not my choice and I won't stop them.
