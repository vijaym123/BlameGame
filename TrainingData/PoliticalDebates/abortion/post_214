John McCain is not George Bush, and Barack Obama is not John Kerry.Obama is the most pro-abortion (yes, pro-abortion, not pro-choice, which you could concede to Senator Kerry for the sake of argument) candidate who has ever run for President.  His fervent support of the Freedom of Choice Act, along with his opposition to key provisions of the Democrats for Life sponsored Pregnant Women Support Act, clearly refute any contention that Senator Obama is pro-choice.There will be more abortions in this country if Barack Obama becomes President.  Anyone who looks past the rhetoric to Obama's actual record knows that is the truth.  Mr. Korzen and other Cahtolics like him who ignore Obama's record and vote for him in an unreasonable belief that the number of abortions will be reduced cannot claim they cast their vote in good conscience.Finally, while one can never guarantee how a Supreme Court appointee will turn out (see the abysmal Anthony Kennedy) you can be certain that a President Obama will not appoint any justice who has even the slightest chance of becoming a Roberts or Alito.  A vote for Obama is a vote for the appointment of two or three justices who will be hostile to all attempts to limit abortion for decades.  Long after Obama leaves office, those justices will be striking down pro-life initiatives.
