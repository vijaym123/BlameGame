It is simply your opinion that a new member of the species is created at conception. The issue is not that cut and dry. Genes are important, but they only do part of the job of creating a person. There is nothing inherently special about a new combination of genes, that is not what makes us who we are. Yes, a fetus is alive, and   abortion   is the end of that life. If you think war is sometimes justified then I don't see how this is "the issue here." I would never argue that abortion is a good thing. It is sometimes the lesser of two evils.
