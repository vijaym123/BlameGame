Let's actually do something about this.  It appears that we can all agree that a fetus (the new, growing organism of a pregnancy beginning at the 3rd month) is a human and thus deserves legal protection.  Let's modify our state and federal laws to declare a fetus a "full human" and protect it.  This would make abortion legal only before the 3rd month.Now that we have some sanity, consistency, and are all on the same medical / scientific page, we can begin discussing the humanity of an embryo (the new, growing organism of a pregnancy up to the 3rd month).At this point we have to decide who gets to decide the humanity of an embryo.  Is it each mother's opinion?  It is a medical board's opinion?  Congress?  The Courts?  A nation-wide vote?  Right now, the Supreme Court has essentially answered that: each monther's opinion.  Is that really the right choice?  Each mother gets to decide when her pregnancy changes from a non-human to a human?  This doesn't make sense.  There is no standard, no acceptance of facts, only pure opinion.For now, let's fix the obvious: a fetus is a human and deserves all the rights of a 1 year old, 10 year old, and 100 year old.
