Rapes account for less than 1% of the abortions each year, so in over 99% of the abortions you are not dealing with those horrendous circumstances.Why does only the mother have bodily autonomy?  Is it because she is bigger than the fetus?  Is it because we can see her, but can only see the fetus on a sonogram?  Is it because she can speak for herself and the fetus cannot?The entire concept that the mother should have complete control over the fate of her unborn child has always struck me as illogical.  If the woman wants the baby, she will protect the baby with her life and will try to do everything in her power to make sure the child is born healthy.If the mother then decides she not want the baby, for any reason or no reason at all, suddenly he or she is considered a parasite that can be destroyed.The fetus has not changed in any way.  It is still the same unborn life.  Should anyone have the authority to arbitrarily destroy another life?
