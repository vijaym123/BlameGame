Interesting argument Sylvia; technically filled with many errors, but interesting.What evidence do you have that a fetus can not think? Later term fetuses definitely exhibit brain activity.A fetus most definitely has human DNA. It has a heartbeat. It has a brain and brain activity. It is, in scientific terms, every bit as much human as you are.You are correct when you say a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. That specific kind is determined by its DNA. Fetuses are living, and they have human DNA. That makes them human.By what basis or by what evidence do you make the observation that a fetus has no mind, or that it has no independent conceptual consciousness? Please provide the evidence to support that comment. What is the magical transformation that takes place in a matter of seconds that transforms a parasite into a human being?A human fetus, from as early as 21 weeks into development, is a fully functional human being. From that point forward they continue their growth and development to improve their chances of surviving on their own outside the womb. But that does not mean that they do not have everything that is required to live on their own at 21 weeks. Your argument is based on very simplistic terms; if you can’t touch it, and you can’t see it with your own eyes, then it’s nothing more than a parasite. This makes it easier to morally justify terminating it, but it does nothing to change the facts that any   abortion   that is performed after 21 weeks is terminating a life that could very well have survived and gone on to a full, normal life and do great things.If you’re really interested in the subject and not just trying to make excuses for why it’s OK to abort a fetus at any point of it’s development I would recommend the following site for an interesting read;     http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/tul/psychtoday9809.html
