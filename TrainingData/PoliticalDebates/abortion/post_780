A wise choice. The pro-life argument usually boils down to "the fetus' is more important than the mother", and they rarely give it more thought than that, and so the debate usually just goes around in circles, as we see here with Jake.Most pro-choicers don't like abortion, and want it minimized, but realize that the best person to make the decision is the person whose life it effects most, the woman's.Interestingly, evolution tends to give most women a "mother instinct" that fights the impulse to abort. Of course, a lot of pro-life Christians also tend to disbelieve in evolution, so their venem towards pro-choice is partially modivated by some fear that without pro-lifers like themselves, everyone would run out and have abortions 5 times a day.
