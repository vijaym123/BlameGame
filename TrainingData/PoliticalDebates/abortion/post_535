I just want to say I am   pro life   in these matters. If I knock up a girl I would want to keep the baby. Mostly due to my superior physical genetics;) However I am grateful for the CHOICE to keep him/her. Because of that I am pro choice. If somebody wants to have a word that rymes whith shushmorshin then let them. Odds are they will be filled with guilt and anguish that will cause more of a hardship than the child ever would have. I am and will remain however pro free will aka pro choice. Love it or hate it other people have a choice too.
