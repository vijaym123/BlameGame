In my (sadly, lengthy) experience with the women who are drug addicts, those that do not abort unwanted pregnancies very, very rarely put them up for adoption.  Instead they keep them in extremely dangerous and abusive home situations.  Even those that are given away are frequently born addicted to drugs, which is a tough way to start life.  For some reason pro-life arguments about the rights of the unborn child only seem to extend to its right to life; I've never heard anyone argue for a child's right to not be born virtually guaranteed to have a short, painful life of addiction.  I personally think that abortion is abhorrent and would never have one, but to criminalize just seems completely insane to me.  I've never had anyone actually answer my position, just launch off on the litany of what an awful person I am and how innocent the unborn are.  "You people" is exactly what I've come to expect.
