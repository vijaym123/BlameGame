There is nothing "unlikely" about the passage of the Freedom of Choice Act if Senator Obama is elected President.  That Act will reverse the Hyde Amendment and will strike down parental consent/notification laws throughout the country.The Congress is going to be controlled by Democrats, who will certainly pass the Act, and Senator Obama has promised pro-abortion groups that the first thing he will do as President is sign the Act into law.
