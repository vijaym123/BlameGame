Whether one is 'right to life' or supports a 'right to an   abortion  ', there can be no sensible argument that citizens of foreign countries have a right which would compel the government to spend American tax dollars on family planning which includes promoting abortion.  Frankly, those citizens do not have a right to any funding whatsoever.  We provide funds as an act of charity.   Our doing so is supererogatory.  It is not the fulfillment of a duty.  If we choose to fund aid efforts, then our donations should be allocated in a way that is consonant with the values of our people.  When one takes into account that approximately half of the country opposes abortion, and a great many (which would feature prominently among this group [in spite of Mr. O Brien's protestations] American Catholics) would consider abortion to be the moral equivalent of murder, it becomes obvious that it was wrong to overturn the Mexico City Policy.
