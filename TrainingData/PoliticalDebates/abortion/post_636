One more thing: As shown by all the different opinions tehre are in the   pro-choice   side about when does personhood begins -wich is a contraddiction in itself: personhood cannot begin because it is something that appears and develop througout time- there is a certainty that some of these concepts of personhood are wrong because this would mean that we cannot abide to a universal concept of man wich is the base of all our laws and is written in the UDHR. This means that as long as we accept   abortion   there is a certainty that we are killing at least some humans persons that because of someone's personal belief was not considered such. I cannot accept that we can't turn personal belief into law, but we can allow all kinds of contradictory personal beliefs to surely kill some innocent human persons.
