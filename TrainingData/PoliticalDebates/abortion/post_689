Brad Miner's argument on the one hand approach the issue from a legal/question of   abortion   point of view to avoid scientific or philosophical arguments, but then goes to the scientific/philosophical arguments to avoid legal issues. Essentially, his argument is that we don't know, so for legality's sake we should say it's at conception, except this ignores other legal issues such as a woman's rights. He needs to either deal completely with the legal issues, or actually tackle the philosophical issues. He's trying to have it both ways.
