Actually, reversing the ban doesn't change how much money the program takes up. It just makes more groups and places eligible for funding. Those places aren't performing abortions 24/7, you know. One might say it's pretty inhumane to deny funding to a medical organization because, in addition to providing malaria nets and polio vaccines and clean drinking water, they are also willing to perform abortions. Funding should go to the groups best equipped to spend it most efficaciously, regardless of whether they sycophantically agree with the entire conservative Christian agenda.
