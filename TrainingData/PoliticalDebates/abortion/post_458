If anyone really believed that abortion is murder, he or she would be advocating the same penalty for women who choose to have abortions as the law prescribes for anyone else who is guilty of premeditated murder: twenty-five years to life, ususally.  I have never heard anyone call for that, or any punishment whatsoever for women who abort.  Therefore, it is logically inescapable that no one really believes a fetus is the same as a child, no matter what they claim to believe.
