I am saying that men should not have the deciding vote on the matter which really they do. Since women are outnumbered in our gov just like all govs. I am not saying that you do not have the right to voice your opinion and if my wife and I had a baby I would not want her to have an abortion but if she was raped then I think it would be up to her. ( I would not want to have a baby if it was from rape )
