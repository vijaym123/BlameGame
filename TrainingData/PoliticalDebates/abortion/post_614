I used 'humanity' rather than 'personhood.'  I am not talking about having human DNA, which along with life, is present before conception as well as after. In the science that you are invoking, there is no such thing as new life - life is a continuum, as is the DNA that encodes it.  Human DNA by itself defines a cell as Homo sapiens, but does not make a cell a person. That is why we are trying to develop a term to describe what IS new, a new person. There is no single point in time, no switch that occurs where a developing human goes from having none of the characteristics of a person to having all of the characteristics of a person. That is the binary thinking that I am arguing against.In the miraculous process of going from 2 adult humans to 3 adult humans there are many intricate biological steps that all must be taken at the right time and in the right order. At every stage, there is life, and that life has human DNA. Along that path, the potential adult human is granted incrementally increasing rights - from none while it is still a sperm and egg to full rights at 18 years (or 25 if you want to rent a car). Many humans never make it, or get sick and lose some of these rights, or make mistakes and have these rights revoked. It is our job (as a society) to assign rights to humans at different stages of their existence. Rights to citizens, rights to criminals, rights to the insane, rights to children, rights to pregnant women, and rights to the unborn. I shudder to compress such complexity into a binary box built of DNA.
