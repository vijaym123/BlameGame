Why do you refer to "the U.S. 'population assistance' program"? I don't know what that program is. The Mexico City Policy applies/applied to federal funding to NGOs. It was announced by Reagan at the 1984 UN International Conference on Population, so maybe that is the source of the mix-up. I don't believe there is any specific program with funding for "population assistance," whatever that means, but if you know of one I'd be very interested to see some details.I also think that Johnson's statements are misleading, particularly the reference to "groups that promote   abortion   as a method of population control." Any time someone makes a choice about getting pregnant, not getting pregnant, carrying a pregnancy to term, or not carrying the pregnancy to term, they are doing something that controls the population. Granted, these decisions are on an individual level, so it may seem like no one really has "control" -- but that's the level on which NGOs providing OB/GYN and prenatal services would be working, too. You make it sound as though there is some kind of conspiracy to abort a quota of fetuses -- this is obviously ridiculous.
