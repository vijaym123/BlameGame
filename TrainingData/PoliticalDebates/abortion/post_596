I am sorry your friend had to deal with such a terrible situation.  Even if Roe v. Wade was overturned, I do not think any states would pass a   law   that precluded   abortion   in the case of rape.  There seems to be a strong majority in favor of that exception remaining.Some women have decided to have the baby after a rape.  I remember reading awhile back about a mother who was trying to figure out how to explain to her daughter that the daughter was the result of a rape.  I think she decided in the end to tell the daughter that the best thing in her life came out of the worst day of her life.
