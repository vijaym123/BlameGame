"I think it's quite clear that there is a moment when the woman did sign a contract. "by having sex, i hearby accept the possibility that a new life within me will be created and that it will be my responsability to give him life aid until it'll be able to do so by it's own" furthermore the baby did not demand any service, they where graciously given by the mother's womb."So if a woman was raped, she also signed such a contract of her own will?Furthermore, ethics and morality are far more complicated and confused issues than a dictionary would lead you to believe.
