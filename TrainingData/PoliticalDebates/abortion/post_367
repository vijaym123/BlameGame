The title pro choice doesn't make any sense to me. The mother chooses, but does the baby get any say on whether or not they live or die? What if your life was put into the hands of a certain individual, and their choice was to kill you, to protect their "rights" and "privacy". It makes no sense to me that a life that change the world,is taken before it can take its first look at the light of day.
