It is a basic tenet of Natural Law that innocent human beings should not be intentionally killed.  The fundamental, and deadly, defect in this argument by the Religious Coalition is that if you start saying innocent life can be destroyed because it has not moved through enough "functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions" to be considered a person, that standard can easily be applied to others beyond the unborn.Does an infant pass the test?  What about a mentally handicapped infant?  What about someone in a coma?  What about someone with Alzheimer's?  Once you start making these types of judgments, you can easily end up like the Nazis, executing 70,000 mentally handicapped people (including Pope Benedict XVI's cousin), who were regarded as "useless mouths to feed."
