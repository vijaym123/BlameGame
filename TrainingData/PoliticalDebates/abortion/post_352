I see a trend that has become a thorn to the people of America. The trend is that of the courts generating law, be it a regional court, or the so called "Supreme Court"! From all of my study, the function of the court system, as well as that of the Supreme Court is to uphold "Law" which has been legislated by the "House of Parliament"...thus representing the People of America... instead of a group's opinion being honored by a biased supreme court judge. To me this represents supreme corruption and misuse of judicial power which should be indictable or impeachable.Law for the people need to be legislated through the House, representing the PEOPLE, for the PEOPLE, and of the PEOPLE, to be upheld by the court system and especially the Supreme Court system which should directly represent the HOUSE, in keeping it real.Here is one major flaw that I hope the New President can bring back to sanity, putting the laws of the land back into representing Democracy and of the people.The Supreme court system as it stands has become a means for biased minority groups to perpetrate their agenda by finding a judge of similar bias. Democracy is meant to represent theNations collective good and common sense and not that of the few in a building of a few people. (Court house).
