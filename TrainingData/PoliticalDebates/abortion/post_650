Textbooks change over time. It changes as we know things. It changes as we learn things are different. If I found you an embryology textbook that said the opposite, that said that a fetus cannot truly be considered human until week whatever, would you be forced to admit that "Scientifically, human life begins at this stage."?MEDICALLY, an authority we could possibly go to was the AMA. The AMA says there's no consensus between   doctors  .There are spectrums of opinions ranging from At Birth, to At Conception. There's no majority. There's just..a line in a textbook.Scientifically though, it's less clear. For example, we could go to the neurologists. Neurologists are the people in charge of the study of the nervous system, and it's through them that we get the idea of what constitutes dead--ie, Brain Death. Using that rule, we couldn't really start Life until--Brain life. The first neurons start firing at around 5 months, and the brain is fully developed at 7.So there's a valid scientific alternative.
