Thank you for your kind words. However, I think the need to change   the law   is precisely the problem at hand. That is the reason why many individuals on either side of the debate, especially, those in any position to influence policy are making back flips and other acrobatics in reasoning and/or twisting logic. I feel the law should reflect facts, evidence and logic, and, reasoning based on those facts and evidence presented, tempered with the wishes and benefit of the public (notice I did not say the law should reflect the will of the public at large). I expect nothing better than "gut feeling"   politics   and politics based on unfettered morality not tempered or influenced by reason and logic from the masses, who are easily influenced by demagogues and extremist "gurus"... However, that our elected leaders have debased themselves and lowered themselves to this over the last couple of years (some would say decades) such that our republic is slowly headed towards the Shura system employed by Iran or Afghanistan, where the "mullahs" are running the the government, is disheartening.
