"today signed an order that exports the torture of unborn children around the world"Sensationlist tripe with no grounding in reality whatsoever. "Family Research Council" indeed. Humans have lives for thousands of years in families and communities unaided and yet we see this body claiming to know and represent what family values are. What a joke!
