"If you think that the rights of a ball of a few dozen cells are more important than the right of a living adult to happiness, health, and choice, then you can have your opinion and I can have mine, no one is wrong or right. I just hope you can understand that when you say no abortion at any time under any circumstances, you are saying that the rights of a tiny clump of cells are greater than the rights of a fully grown, fully sentient human."At one point you were "a tiny clump of cells" too. I am Catholic and I believe that all human life is sacred whether it is one day old baby or an 80 year old man. I am going to stick with what i believe because I think it is right. If killing babies makes a person happy then they should be put in an asylum.
