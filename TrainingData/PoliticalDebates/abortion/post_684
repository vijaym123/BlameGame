Assigning a beginning is trivial from a distance and gets harder the closer you look. In some ways it is even more complex with fruit flies than with humans, since nurse cells with maternal genetics govern the development of the early embryo for quite a while before the genetics of the embryo take over. There is no scientific need to define the beginning of something more broadly than for the experiment that you are conducting. When wildlife biologists count gazelles they choose a definition that works for them. When neurobiologists study neural development they wait until some point in development when a particular event happens. This question (when does life start?) is not a scientific one. I am a scientist, but I am not claiming to have authority regarding the issue, except where others make a false claim of scientific conclusion.With regards to the simple firsts, meiosis is the first event that gives rise to a unique genetic combination that will become part of a new person. Conception is another later event that can be described the same way. Conception is special, because pregnancy is special. All pregnancies have emotional importance to the people involved and should be viewed as having a moral 'worth.' That is why we should work to reduce abortions. This is an issue of law and society, not science.
