So the right to kill a human being is a human right?  Great!  When does hunting season open?  [Please forgive the sarcasm of the previous question].However, one could use similar language in talking about a man's right to choose; that is, 'Only when [men] are able to control their reproductive capacity can they achieve true equality in society.'Of course, 'reproductive capacity,' and 'control,' are kind of vague; possibly meaning anything from abstinence to 'slaughter of children,' to 'wanton rape.'
