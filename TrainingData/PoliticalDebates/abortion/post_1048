Partial-birth abortion.That is all I have to say and I get the chills.This abortion is usually performed in the third trimester.The baby is forced into the birth canal legs first and everything except the head is delivered. The doctor then stabs the head while it is still in the canal and sucks out the brains.I will say some very important facts:At nine weeks a baby has a heartbeat.At 4.5 months he can feel pain.This baby, this human being can feel the stab of the knife. He can feel himself dying.
