Since we have arrived at a peaceful place, perhaps you can help me with something. Why are exceptions made for rape? I understand why I feel it is justified, but when I read the arguments of people here I don't understand the exception from the 'anti-  abortion  ' perspective. If I may attempt to restate the position: the fetus is an innocent human being that should be protected. How is that changed by the circumstances of rape? It's not the fetus's fault. Isn't the rape exception an instance of including the emotional health of the mother in the decision?
