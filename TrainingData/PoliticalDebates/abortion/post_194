Nowadays,Catholics can do whatever they wish in good conscience.  At least this is what they choose to believe.  This is not what the Catholic Church, established 2009 years ago, believes or teaches, however.  The rules were set down by the author of life and death, and to my knowledge, they are still in force.  Jiminy Cricket misled many of us, and we need to forget that little bug's   teaching   about 'always let your conscience be your guide.'  Our conscience can mislead us.  It's wise to always let the Catechism of the Catholic Church be our guide if we care about pleasing our Lord and preserving our immortal souls.  And certainly, don't let the current   society   trends be our guide.  That's just plain foolish.  Try to imagine how many trends have come and gone in 2009 years.  What if the Church made silly changes to accomodate these trends every time one came along?  Be thankful the Church stands firm on God's laws and obey them.  Enjoy the treasures of the Church.  We have them in abundance.  Pray for all our brothers and sisters of other faiths.  We are all one family in His eyes.
