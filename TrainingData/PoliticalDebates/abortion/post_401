First, this is a debate, not a court with a prosecution and defense.  Both sides of the argument must equally provide support for their position.I have not scoured this site looking for all of your comments.  I'm only responding to this comment and this "argument" as defined by OpposingViews.Right or wrong, good or bad, animals do have rights in the US; however, I have no intention of using that as a reason to support my position, it would not make sense.As for my reasons that a fetus (3+ months in womb) is a person, here are the basics:  Just like an infant, it- has a beating heart- has a brain with detectable brainwaves- has eyes- has arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes- has all organs- responds to sound, light, movements, pressure- actually “looks” like a humanBy the 4th month of pregnancy, there is no mistaking that what is growing inside the mother is alive and has countless attributes of a person.  It is different than an infant in these respects:- size: a 24 week old in neonatal care is smaller than a 39 week old still in the womb- development: a 24 week old in neonatal care is less developed than a 39 week old still in the womb- environment: a 24 week old in neonatal care may be breathing air with lungs, but probably has a feeding tube (i.e. umbilical cord) but is otherwise identical to a 39 week old still in the womb- dependency: a 24 week old in neonatal care is 100% dependent on a caregiver, just like a 39 week old in the womb, but the care is administered differentlyFor these reasons, I draw the conclusion that as soon as science can detect the organism growing inside a woman’s body, it is a life.  As soon as science can detect the major attributes of a person (from fingernails to DNA), it must be a person.  To my knowledge, no pregnancy has ever resulted in anything but a person, thus empirical science concludes that all human pregnancies must be of persons.To continue the debate, let's further your position that birth defines life (in this case life = humanity = personhood = legal protection).  Given partial-birth abortion (dilation and extraction), at what exact point is a fetus born?  Is this different for vaginal births and cesarean births?
