Rape counts only for less than 1% of total abortions. Rape clearly is an exception.Why can't we discuss about the main problem and then address the exceptions?The problem with   abortion   these days is that it has become simply another method of birth control.This is the main problem and one everybody should agree with: abortion is not good for women, nor for   society  . We should fight the basic problem that is unwanted   pregnancy  . And i am sorry but the pope is right: Condoms only policy does not work: we need a better sexual   education  . I really believe in the ABC system used in Africa: Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condoms:Abstinence until you find a partner, better sexual practices and use of birth control methods. As   condoms   are not 100 % reliable, to advertize that the problem to   HIV   and unwanted pregnancy is solved using condoms will not be effective.
