about the reasoning behind the two people you mention I will stick to my own thoughts. But In general it is an easier question for atheists. Saying I'm pro choice doesn't mean I think highly of destroying "potential" human lives but I do place a higher value on the women and young girls who are faced with this choice. I think we could spend our money and time in a much wiser way by teaching people how to prevent unwanted pregnancies and helping out on the contraceptive end which is, in my opinion, the best option.
