The truth of the matter is that it is entirely un-American to force one's viewpoints onto others. This is exactly what would be happening if we ban abortion, gay marriage, physician assisted suicide, etc. There are many Americans, all with different beliefs, customs, and traditions. To say that one way of thought is better than another alienates entire spectrums of beliefs. More importantly, it is completely un-American to take away the right to choose from over half of the American population based on the opinions of less than 1/3 of the population. I say 1/3 because that seems to be the usual percentage of Americans in agreement with the proposed initiative.We need to stop thinking of only ourselves and our beliefs and begin to consider the effect that proposing such a ban would cause. This is not simply pro-life vs. pro-choice. It is about remembering that one 1/3 of the nation's opinion should not infringe upon the rights of the entire nation.If one believes that abortion is wrong, the simple solution would be to not partake in an abortion.
