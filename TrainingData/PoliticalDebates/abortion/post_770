I am saying it should not be the choice of a man, definately not saying this debate is for raped women only I just think that the people that make the laws in Washington should have women decide on this law not men since there are more men in Washington politics. No it is not really saying that it is common sense most laws . Manslaughter is illegal for obvious reasons people do not argue that it should be legal. Abortion is controversial and since it is we should have women making the final decision on the matter.
