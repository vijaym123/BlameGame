I don't don't believe that   abortion   should be used as a form of birth control. I think that there should be a legitimate reason such as, family rape, rape, medical vulnerability, but a person who is willing and get's pregnant should not have the choice if the baby will be healthy and the mother will survive. I think abortion should be legal but with more restrictions.
