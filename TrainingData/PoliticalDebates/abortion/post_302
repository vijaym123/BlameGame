On what grounds do you claim human DNA as the "distinguishing factor?" On what grounds can you now logically object to granting inalienable rights to human unfertilized eggs, sperm cells, and tumors?Supernatural entities as the basis of individual rights is an irrational concept. And in practice, despite the flowery language, religion has never served as the basis of our politico-economic system. It simply isn't, and that is a fact. Our system is a secular one, based on the predominant ideas of the Enlightenment, and it should remain that way.
