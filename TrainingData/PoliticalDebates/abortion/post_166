That the Bible doesn't mention abortion.
That the Bible says that life begins upon first breath. 
The story of Adam's creation in Genesis 2:7 is the primary quote used here, when God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." 

That "thou shall not kill" is dependent on an interpretation of when life begins, which the Bible may indicates to only occur upon first breath.  
That the principle of "thou shall not kill" is consistently contradicted in the Bible with descriptions of God sanctioning seemingly arbitrary and mass killings.
That God specifically sanctions the killing of babies in multiple narratives in the Bible, indicating that the Bible may not be "pro life" in the same way that many people interpret Jesus to have been pro-life.
