It is a mistake to base our morality on actions taken during a war that could have ended civilization as we know it.  Things were done that might not have been done in less dire circumstances.  Unless a mother is actually going to die unless an   abortion   is performed, I do not see how wartime morality applies to an abortion in a suburban clinic.I hope you are right about it being difficult to end up like the Nazis.  However, I think it is critical that we stamp out elements of their ideology whenever it raises its ugly head.With regard to the rights of the mother, unless she was actually going to lose her life, I do not see how her interests would outweigh the child's right to life.  In addition, the mother probably does not recognize the trauma the abortion will inflict on her until it is too late.
