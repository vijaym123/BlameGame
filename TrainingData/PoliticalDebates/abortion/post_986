There is a difference between refuting and ignoring. I addressed every point you made and didn't keep bringing up topics that were irrelevant to the debate, such as Hitler.Abortion for Rape Victims?By Gregory KouklYou are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will.So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was.What does Hitler have to do with abortions?To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself.We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of GodWe are all lawbreakers.
