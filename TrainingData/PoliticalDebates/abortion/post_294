pig fetuses?By the way, I don't recall any proof that the fetus lacks the 'rational faculty,' and since you're bringing it up, the burden of proof is on you.  However, just because a being doesn't speak, doesn't mean it's irrational.  Furthermore, if you're going to differentiate between beings, then you must include supernatural beings (whether or not they exist) into your assertion, since God is a rational being (even if only in concept), your logic dictates that He must be a man, hence your choice of differentiation is flawed.
