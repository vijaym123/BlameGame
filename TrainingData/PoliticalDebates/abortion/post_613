Whether or not something is human is easily determined by examining its genetic code.  Human blood can be proved to be human, and canine blood to be non-human scientifically.  Whether or not something counts as a life is also a settled manner in science for most things- including fetuses (but not for some relatively odd things like viruses and prions). If it is not merely a constituent part, but  complete, and if it has the appropriate life functions, then it is a life.  (This rules out cases such as human tissue which has been made to continue to survive apart from the person it came from.)There is no question but that a new human life comes into being at conception.  Any scientist will have to admit that, and the US court system has even reviewed and verified that this is scientifically verifiable.The real position of people like O'Brien (who know better, but still say that 'it isn't clear when life begins' , because that is more marketable) is that in spite of the fact that a new human life exists at conception, they don't think that all human lives deserve rights- even the right to avoid being destroyed.  'Personhood' is a quality which supposedly is present in most humans after birth but which is never present at certain points when the life is still in utero.  Since personhood can arguably mean whatever you want it to mean, if it is necessary in order for human life to receive rights, then they can justify   abortion  .  'Personhood' is not a scientific term.  'Human' and 'life' are scientifically definable.Human lives begin at conception- this is an established fact.When human lives get "personhood" is unknown.
