is not the same as the right to life, as I have argued elsewhere on this thread. One does not treat an acorn as one treats an oak tree. One does not treat a four-year-old as one does a teenager.  Development does count.Yes, our lives begin at conception, but what we do with them comes after entering the world and it is that "doing" that counts for the moral judgement of 'innocent.'  A fetus is no more innocent than it is guilty. The "doing" is also largely what we are beyond a collection of dna. God may judge people on the basis of nothing more than their DNA(though the Bible would seem to be evidence to the contrary) but to say that "doing"  counts for nothing then perhaps we should revise our moral judgement of men like Hitler, etc.The truth is we are not passing judgement on the fetus, we are not considering their innocence or guilt, we are making a judgement about the place in our lives of an as-yet unborn fetus (I mean the first-trimester).  We are examining our abilitities, our life's goals, our financial prospects and current state, perhaps even whether this is a world ready for yet another mouth to feed --in short we are examining the wisdom of having and raising a child, not only by ourselves but others (I gave my daughter up for adoption when it was the only alternative to raising her myself, whch I could not realistically expect to do. I can't tell you how much I regret the abuse she recieved at their hands).Only someone that believes that what we Do counts for nothing could believe that the choice of a woman excercising her judgment counts for nothng against the dictates of you and your God.
