Other common logistical and/or personal reasons might exist that make a first trimester abortion infeasible, and which may provide a sufficient circumstance for a woman to seek a late, partial birth abortion.[9] These may include:
Lack of recognition of pregnancy symptoms in the first trimester, particularly by adolescents[10]
"Inability to afford a first trimester abortion"[11]
"Inability to locate medical assistance during first trimester (due to lack of local medical professionals)"[12]
"Lack of financial resources, emotional support, and/or partner"[13]
