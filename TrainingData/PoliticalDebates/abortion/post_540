I just recently was pregnant with a   baby   that had a fatal condition called anencephaly. This is a ntd where the brain and top of the skull do not form. I was told that my baby would die once it was born, if it was not stillborn.I could not emotionally handle carrying a baby for 4 more months that I knew would die. I could not sit at home in a bubble and be depressed. I have responsibilies like my daughter to take care of as well as work and school.Medicaid would not allow me to deliver the baby early in the hospital. SO YES I HAD AN ABORTION BY ANOMALY. No woman should have to carry a baby that she knows will die immediately after birth. Anyone who wants to ban abortions will ban all abortions..even the ones that women need!
