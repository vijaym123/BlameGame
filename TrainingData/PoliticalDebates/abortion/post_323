You can do whatever you want to your womb, but when you start doing stuff to a fetus inside your womb, that's different.By the way, in this entire post you make this assumption: that the fetus is just part of the woman's body.Also, men's body parts are restricted.  Notably with regards to rape and gunfire: can't go sticking things anywhere one pleases, can't adjust one's fingers when there's a gun between them pointed at someone else's head.Again, you can do what you want with your body, it's when you affect someone else's body that there's a problem; and a fetus is another body: fact of biology, women don't have male genetalia as part of their anatomy, but baby boys do (even before birth).
