I had a   baby   with anencephaly. No mother should have to carry a baby that she knows will die. It is so painful and depressing. PLEASE.....  vote   no to banning   abortion  .Vote yes to allowing state funding to pay for abortions. It cost me $2,000 dollars to get an abortion and It would have cost $10,000 to deliver in the hospital. I deserved to hold my baby and never got to.
