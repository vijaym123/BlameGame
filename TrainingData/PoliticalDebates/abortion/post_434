Don't want an abortion? Fine. Don't have one. However, don't use government power to force everyone else to live by your biblical edicts. That is immoral. America isn't a democracy. It is a constitutionally- limited republic. That means the limits are on the government, not the people.Today's conservatives hate America and America's founders, because they're incapable of living in a "free" society where everyone is capable of making choices for themselves. Pro-life means pro Human life. Those that are already living. Not an embryo nor protoplasm.
