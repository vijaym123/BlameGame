...no, they can not be Pro-Choice.The Catholic Church is very strict. According to its own self-proclaimed, self-appointed duty, it is the conduit between Man and God. It's rules - it's laws - are God's rules - God's laws. If you're truly Catholic you accept everything the Vatican says without question. It is God's word.If you call yourself Catholic and believe you can be Pro-Choice, you're delusional. I consider Catholics who believe this to have "selective faith." They follow the rules of the Vatican that are convenient for them, using the principles of Christianity as fire insurance. "As long as I ask for forgiveness, I will be saved."
