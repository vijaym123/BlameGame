Everyone knows that God has given us something we call free will. You are able to do whatever you please, but of course there are consquences. If you cannot make your own choice on who to vote for then there no longer is free will. There is only one ruler we must answer to and VOTE for and that is the Jesus himself. We have always be able to make our own decisions but your conscience tells you what is right and wrong. So in election time there will be no right man in God's eyes because he is the only one. Your choice i your choice. The only one you have to answer to his him. Voting for anyone who believes in the death penalty is also wrong if you want to put it into cases as this. Like my pastor says God doesn't believe in any type of death. From the WOMB to the TOMB
