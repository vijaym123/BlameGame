I am for   abortion   rights, although I believe that men should not really have any say in whether or not abortion is legal or not, because it is never going to affect men, it doesn't really matter if a man wants a woman to have the right to have a abortion or not, the idea is ridiculous to me, its as if  your having people in Lichtenstein vote on who the president of the United States should be. It simply doesn't make sense!
