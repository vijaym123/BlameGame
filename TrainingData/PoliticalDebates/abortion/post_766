I read everything you wrote jake all your responses, who are you to decide for a woman? It should have nothing to do with men at all, it should be the carriers' choice not ours. Your not the one giving birth to a child conceived through rape. You are not having that baby attached to you. You are not the one that got raped Jake therefore who are you to speak for the side of pro life when you are not conceiving the baby?
