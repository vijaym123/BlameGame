The Bible is the only book to have thousands of it's prophecies and none have been close to what it says but 100% right. It tells of the earth being round, the atom,the auto, the radio, TV, wars of the past, and at what point life starts. Anyone saying they don't believe in God has never read it. I would rather be pro life than pro choice. The Bible is clear in at what point life begins and is not above it's pay grade.
