Did I keep saying "black"?Sorry, then, about the mis"conception" (sorry).When I said black, I meant "onerous", deadly, foreboding.Even the first, one cell, already has the entire, human chromosome contribution from both dad and mom and it's dividing to reach the first goal of birth.  At eighteen days, there are brainwaves.  There are heartbeats before the mother knows (Latin: "little one") that she's pregnant.65% of Americans, even   pro-choice   Americans, believe that a human life is taken in   abortion  , Cameron.  An abortionist I debated once on a radio program said: "Of COURSE I know that it's human.  What do you think that I think it is, a TOMATO"!Why dehumanize the "little one"?  Didn't dehumanization happen to a people in the early Twentieth Century on Earth (where and when I spent most of my life, so far)?and, when I used the word: "foreboding", earlier, I meant to.Did you know that the medical profession had already murdered over 250,000   children   with "defects" (some as slight as mis-shapen ears), while Hitler was still a Corporal, recovering from a war wound in the Veterans' Hospital?Hitler didn't start the killing.  He just took it over.  In the end, he said: "Europe will stand up and thank me, for eliminating the defective from the gene pool".  Like almost everybody in the world, Hitler believed in Darwin's ideas of some peoples being inferior to other.  Hitler really meant what he said; and, explicitly.Anyway, don't shrink from the moral complexity, Cameron.  Even Obama (the most pro-choice of abortion President in American history, to-date) admitted that much (the outright humanity of the human fetus); and, if I'm not mistaken, he used a term I've used, "moral complexity"early during  his first News Conference.raymond
