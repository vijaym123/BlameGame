So is a human in development, also known as an embryo or fetus, among other names depending upon point of development, not human?  But they are.  No real scientist or doctor would deny that.  Well, are they not beings?  Do they not exist?  Are they not real?  Are they not present?  Then how can you physically remove the imaginary?Now, to the middle part; the issue is about the rights of two human beings: a mother and a child.  That's not even debatable since any doctor worth their degree must admit that the child is a living human being from the beginning.  It's high school biology.To the beginning, giving birth is not a sentence.  It is a consequence, but a deserved one (as all true consequences are).  And of course, being pro-life refers to the actual, real quality of life; not the whimsical, transitory one as in: 'get a life'; though we are pro-that as well.Now, where the birth of a child actually threatens the actual life of the mother, almost no one believes abortion shouldn't be considered.  But it still must be treated as any other killing.Interestingly, in the Declaration of Independence, the three mentioned inalienable rights are listed in a peculiar order: almost as if there's a priority.  [understated]  For if one's happiness takes precedence over your property, right to speak freely, or even life, I can see why there might me a little mix up at the courthouse.
