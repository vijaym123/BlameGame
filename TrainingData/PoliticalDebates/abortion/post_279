your mother feels that she killed her baby, of course she regrets that -- particularly if she felt that having a baby would have been a good thing.  And she must have.  She had at least one other child -- you.But bagpiper2005 said 'most' and I wanted to issue a ittle challenge to get some more thinking along with the obvious emotion that, for some understaable reeasons, goes with this issue.If we have had children and wanted them and loved them we can, mistakenly I believe, see our own child being killed.  What a devistating thing that would be!As ARC has commennted on this thread, it is the first trimester that is the basic issue. Though I am not associated with ARC, I agree. Rights are recognized in context. And in the context of a woman's adult life, it is her right to decide, within the first trimester, that must be recognized. If, after she decides on an abortion, she is remorseful, that is certainly sad. But her remorse is not grounds for denying the righ to an abortion to those who regret having a child and kill them -- either physically or emotionally -- after they are born.AF
