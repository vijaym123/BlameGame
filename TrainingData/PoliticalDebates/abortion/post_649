Since embryology is the scientific study of the development of human life prior to birth, I cannot think of a better scientific source for determining when human life begins.The second part of your comment gets to the heart of the matter, although I think it should be phrased differently.  At conception a new human being has been created.  It is not going to develop into a puppy, or a pony.  It will become, if that development is not terminated, a human baby.What you are really raising is the issue of when should an unborn child be considered a person, in the   legal   sense, who is entitled to   society  's protection.I think it is extremely important to separate the two concepts for the purposes of debating this issue.  Abortion destroys a human life, whether it is performed at four weeks or twenty-four weeks.  That is a scientific fact.Denying the humanity of an unborn child may make people feel better about the 1.2 million abortions performed every year in the US, but it is intellectually dishonest.The question that must be squarely faced is whether a mother should have an absolute power of life or death over her unborn child.  You may believe the mother should have that authority, but denying that a human life is being extinguished is nothing more than an attempt to evade the enormity of what has been done.
