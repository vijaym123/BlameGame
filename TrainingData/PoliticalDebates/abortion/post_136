#originalTopic=Debate:_Partial-birth_abortion
The standard process of partial birth abortion is an unnecessarily violent process that breaks from the normative treatment of life forms. The procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby’s brain, enlarging the hole, sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull. This is a violent procedure that involves a substantial degree of destructiveness, which many believe to be excessive and and grotesque. Even if the "killing" of the fetus were to be justified, many argue that the means of doing so could be more "civilized" and less violently destructive. A process that simply involved the piercing of the brain, but not the removal of the brain and crushing of the skull, for example, could be argued as less destructive and thus more "civilized".
