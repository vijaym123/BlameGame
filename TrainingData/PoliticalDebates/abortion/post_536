I'm just thankful my mother didn't take my life away. One big problem with this "law" is that it was never taken to the people for a vote. A few old guys in robes decided for us that it should be legal. I say let each state put it to the people, like South Dakota, and keep the Feds out of it.  Sid, you say you don't know when life begins, but you do know it's not at conception..??? Which is it? you don't know but you do know? Life is life whether we believe in it or not.
