Murder is a   legal   concept in which one autonomous, self-aware individual intentionally kills another. As a embryo/fetus has no legal status as a person, how can it be murdered? It can be killed, but it cannot be murdered. Your use of the term 'murder' is simply a linguistic device designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason. It is precisely this sort of emotive discourse that hinders rational debate.
