I personally do not approve of   abortion   that is my opinion.That does not mean I shuold have the right to make that choice for anyone esle.That is right it is none of anyone esle's business.It should be up to the person facing the choice.Ok if you don't believe in an abortion DON"T get one and leave jane doe alone if she does again none of your business!!
