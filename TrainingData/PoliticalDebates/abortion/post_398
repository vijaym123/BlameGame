A fetus is a potential human being, not an actual human being. Therefore, it has no rights. End of story. Whether it can feel "pain," have a heartbeat, or have "brainwaves" is completely irrelevant and constitute irrational criteria made up on the spot by neurotic religionists with an axe to grind against secularism and naturalism. A fetus is an incompletely formed, biologically dependent proto-human. Emotions and religious doctrines have nothing to do with reality whatsoever. A fetus is not a person.But then again, anti-abortions are not in the least bit concerned with reality and reason. If they were, they would not say things like, "your statement...is...devoid of any religious teachings."
