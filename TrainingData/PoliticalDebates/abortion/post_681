Mr Hammond: With holometabolic life (a word I definitely did not know an hour ago!), I think that your gradual approach would have even more justification- and yet it would still seem to me that it is merely continuously developing toward adulthood, not continuously developing toward becoming a full member of its species.  Absent the problem of a 'rights/no_rights' or 'worthless/important' dichotomy, would you not also grant that there is no basis for trying to distinguish (for any species, X) between being 'X life with the potential to be fully X' and just 'a live X'?
