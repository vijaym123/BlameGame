Who knows, maybe this is a good time for the NRLC to rethink it's purpose. I recently read this article (link is at the end) ct. 15, 2008 -- The U.S. ranks 29th worldwide in infant mortality, tying Slovakia and Poland but lagging behind Cuba, the CDC reports.The CDC's latest estimates for international rankings are based on 2004 data. But as of 2005, the numbers haven't changed much since 2000.Nearly seven U.S. babies die out of every 1,000 live births. More than 28,000 American babies die before their first birthday."The U.S. infant mortality rate is higher than rates in most other developed countries," note CDC researchers Marian F. MacDorman, PhD, and T.J. Mathews. "The relative position of the United States in comparison to countries with the lowest infant mortality rates appears to be worsening."What's going on? Racial and ethnic disparities clearly play a role. In 2005, for every 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate was:    * 13.63 among non-Hispanic black Americans    * 5.76 among non-Hispanic white AmericansPremature birth is a factor in more than two-thirds of infant deaths. From 2000 to 2005, the U.S. preterm birth rate went up from 11.6% to 12.7%.Rather than spend so much time, energy and resources (both human and financial) on stopping women from having abortions, why not dedicate yourselves to helping solve some of the problems above? There are millions of women wanting to have babies and are facing real obstacles and traumas as the numbers above show. Just something to consider.The whole article can be found here.  http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20081015/infant-mortality-us-ranks-29th
