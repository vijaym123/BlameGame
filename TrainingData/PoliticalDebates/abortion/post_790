First of all, no one's saying abortion isn't killing someone, so please stop that scarecrow argument.The pro-choice argument is that aborting a fetus is justified in certain circumstances (health risks, rape, incest). Even in cases where the mother is simply unprepared to raise a child, I'd still argue abortion should be an option, since not all unwanted babies are adopted, and end up getting screwed up in the foster system.Ultimately, the pregnacy effects the pregnant woman infinitely more than it effects you or me, so it's logical that the woman is in the best position to make the choice about what she wants to do. I personally hope it isn't abortion, but it's not our call.
