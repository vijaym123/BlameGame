Neither Ctholicism nor any other (frequenly conflicting)   religion   should have a say in this - other than mere opinion - and indeed   science   and the people have agreed for centuries on this...  Do we treat the fetus as a person in any context other than   abortion   - No!Your age is based on when you're born, we don't name a zygote or fetus, likely 99+% don't bury one if it doesn't get to birth and on and on.  It's a sad commentary that the sole issue of the fetus itself is around the abortion issue and it shows just how shallow and slanted those who wish to deny women the right to control their own bodies is.There isn't a simpler question - a life begins at birth and has almost always been thus.
