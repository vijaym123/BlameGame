Perhaps you haven't heard, there was a detailed study of what factors most influence murder rates, guess what, access to   abortion   was number ONE.  The problem is that having babies stresses families who already have limited resources.  Further, it doesn't make sense to expect young men and women to be perfect reproductive human beings, then when  they make a mistake to  require them  to have a child.   (We  are programmed to reproduced; that's  how our specie survived.)  And, by the way, you only get 2 years of welfare because we don't want to pay for your mistake.Didn't Jesus say something about forgiving sins?
