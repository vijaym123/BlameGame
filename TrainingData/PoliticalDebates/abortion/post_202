You state that "At the end of the day, the bishops remind us, individual Catholic voters must use their own “prudential judgment” – or, moral common sense – when deciding which levers to pull. If after examining the facts, a Catholic truly believes that a “pro-choice” candidate will do more to promote the cause of human life than one who seeks legal prohibitions on abortion, her or she can vote for the pro-choice candidate with a clear conscience."My question to Catholics out there is this: Are we examining the facts? If one candidate's record is more pro-life than the other (OnTheIssues.org is very helpful) how can a Catholic truly believe that a pro-choice candidate will do more to promote the cause of human life if his record is the opposite of pro-life in every sense of the word? Catholic or not, to ignore the facts, or worse, to have life issues at the bottom of your priority list, how can anyone vote with a clear conscience when defenseless babies being killed take bottom priority over the economy? If we can't trust the president to protect the most defenseless and innocent, what can we trust him with? Bottom Line: Can Catholics Vote Pro Choice? The answer is no.
