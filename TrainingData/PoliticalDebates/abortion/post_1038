IÕm not defending myself nor my viewpoint, I am boldly declaring the implications of the pro-abortionist. You must understand that if I am truly anti-abortionist, I will not waste time dancing and playing with individuals who promote the killing of human fetuses. I did not come for a fight as you have claimed, what I came for was an intellectual abortion of anti-fetus rhetoric. The undebatable? There's no such thing. Every issue is debatable. (Self-refuting argument)I am not God, the creator of the heavens and Earth. Would you care to debate or find someone to debate that proposition? Again, No man is a woman.Again, No horse is a dog.Again, No debate is a fetus.Again, 1 is not 4Again, 1 and 1 is not 7Again, 2 and 10 is 2 less than 14Again, Man is fallible.
