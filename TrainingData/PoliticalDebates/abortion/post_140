The collapsing of the skull of the "partially born" fetus is necessary to prevent pain and the risk of damage to the woman. The head is the largest single part of a fetus, and is the most difficult to pass. Similar to giving birth, the passing of the head often causes excruciating pain, struggle, and sometimes damage to the Cervix and Vagina. Collapsing the skull eliminates these risks. As such, it can be argued that the collapsing of the skull of the unborn head of the fetus is a "civilized" measure in the way that it protects the mother from harm or the risk of harm. In other words, the infliction of pain and destruction on the fetus may be canceled out by the reduction in the pain and risk of permanent damage to the woman. 
It is also arguable that it is the women's right to protect herself from the pain alone, irrespective of whether there are any serious long-term health risks that might result from passing the intact head of an unborn child.
