My original point was that on the nec/suf issue, you granted the former but made no positive argument for the latter, whereas the article was arguing that if the latter is not excluded it would be 'rational' not to err on the side of possibly taking a human life.If you just want to consider life as equivalent to independent life, then you're attempting to bypass the problem entirely by redefining 'life'.  People who are uncontroversially alive can be incapable of surviving independent of life support.  Unless people on respirators are "un-alive", that would eliminate independence as a necessary condition.Warts, moles, and tumors are not germane.  They are just body tissue which may not be functioning normally.  A zygotes is not a part of the woman's body.A chunk of metal, if left alone, will remain a chunk of metal (or deteriorate).  A zygote, if left alone, will begin the process of developing into a person.  The argument that because something is not in a state now entails that we should treat it no differently than something which is not particularly likely to enter that state is irrational.  If a boulder were rolling down a hillside toward my car and I regarded it is merely another rock on a hill, then I would be foolish.Logic can point out that an argument is invalid, but it can't speak to the merit of a definition.  Logic won't help the post-conception side any more than the pre-conception side.
