Most of what you said is absolutely correct.  This is a place of freedom, and restricting freedoms that don't harm anyone else goes against the grain of what this country was founded on.  That is why I am for legalization of marjuana and other drugs, for the rights of homosexuals, for the unrestricted right of the people to bear arms, and against all "victimless crimes."  Abortion, however, is not one of these things.   An innocent life is being destroyed.  While you certainly can make a good argument for   abortion   early in the pregnancy, and there is no reason to restrict birth control, once a feltus begins to kick and play, to respond to voices and sounds, to show emotion, it is a person, and it's inalienable right to life is being infringed.  Americans not only should but must insure that as long as rights and freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and feedoms of others they are protected.  Abortion, however, is not without a victim.  It does infringe upons the rights and freedoms of another.  This is why it should not be legal.  That being said, it also should not be banned.  What I would recommend happen, is that Congress makes a Constitutional Amendment defining at what point a specimen of the human race becomes a person and achieves citizenhood, and with that citizenhood Constitutional protection, with said point occuring at some point between conception and birth, probably late in the pregnancy.  After this point, termination of the child, as it would then be defined, would be classified as murder, and not abortion.  After that amendment is ratified, the policy as to whether termination of the human specimen prior to that point is legal or not should be left to the states.  In an ideal world, abortion of all kind would be illegal.  However, this is not the case, and this is the most reasonable compromise I can come up with.
