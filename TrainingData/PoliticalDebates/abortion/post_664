How do you scientifically prove that life begins after conception? You make an assertion without substantiating it. Let's be honest. You believe in   evolution   therefore you believe might makes right.  The weaker deserve to be destroyed by the stronger.   There's nothing weaker than an unborn child. However, if God created the world and instilled a moral compass by which to steer, murder is wrong. If you don't believe in God then how do you suscribe to any law?  What makes murder of your neighbor wrong? Let's pass a bill that says if I can prove I'm more viable to society than my neighbor, he doesn't deserve to live and there's nothing wrong with me killing him. All our laws are based on moral axioms. If you take away one, there's no reason to follow any of them.
