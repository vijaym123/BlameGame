Biologically, a new distinct human organism is created at conception.  Jon is right that the issue is not when life begins, because we know that.  It is when that life has value.  The value of a new human life is where we disagree.  Whether this new life deserves protection under the law.  Whether or not is has a "  soul  ."  So if there is not a consensus about value, and probably never will be, why is that those that want to be able to dispose of embryos and fetuses "on demand" automatically win?  Why is the burden of proof on those that think all life has value?  If someone wants to take what is biologically a human organism and end its existence, is it not on them to prove that life DOES NOT for certain have value?  If we cannot know for certain should we not always err on the side of life, not death?I am reminded of an analogy from my philosophy professor in   college  .  You are   hunting   in the woods with your friends.  You hear a rustle in the bushes.  It could be a deer.  It could be one of your friends.  Do you shot?  In other words, when uncertain you err on the side of life. Always.
