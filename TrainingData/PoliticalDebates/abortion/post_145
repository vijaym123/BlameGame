Pregnancy detection methods and first term abortion options may also be sufficient provisions to women of the means to "choose" to determine the future of their bodies. If the above prevention methods fail, there are many other means made widely available to women, which can enable them to determine that they are pregnant in the first trimester. As such, these measures may provide women with sufficient means to make a responsible "choice" to abort in the first trimester, instead of opting for a late-term abortion such as a partial birth abortion. It is arguable that a government should not be responsible for providing additional measures to a woman, and that any woman that misses these provisions has acted irresponsibly or negligently, and subsequently may not deserve further, later options, such as partial birth abortion.
