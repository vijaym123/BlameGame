The day it is decided that Roman Catholics can not vote for a   pro-choice   candidate, I, as a citizen, will make the demand that every baptized Roman Catholic legislator and every Roman Catholic judge will either resign from office or renounce the Catholic faith.  If they can not be both Roman Catholics and believers in a civil   society   established upon the principle of freedom of, and from,   religion  , they must make a choice. If citizens do not demand that choice be made that day, our experiment in   democracy   is finished.In the end, this has nothing to do with   abortion  . Something much more elemental is at stake.
