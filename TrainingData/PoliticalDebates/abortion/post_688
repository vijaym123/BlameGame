Many interesting thoughts. Do you mean really an atheist, or pretty sure. Absolutely certain atheism seems like another religious belief to me.The definition of what is alive is fun. I threw my hands up a while ago and have just decided that anything that has both the potential to use environmental energy to combat entropy and has evolved counts as alive. I throw out the consideration of the potential for future reproduction. If it evolved to get where it is, then that is good enough for me. Viruses encode proteins that combat entropy. So do some plasmids. Prions do not*. Lizard tails and sperm are both definitely alive - until they run out of ATP and die.*Prions are always tough. There are some yeast prions where the normal (non-prion) state of the protein is an enzyme that would qualify as alive. As far as I know, the prion form always loses this quality.
