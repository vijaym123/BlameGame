In most of the polls pro life and pro choice are statistically equal.  I saw no big surprises from any of the polls in the way you put it, except for the fact that even most of the people FOX polled still came out in favor for abortions in various situations with the exception of using it for unwanted pregnancies. None of the so called "liberal" news organizations established anything near a majority for pro choice.However, given that the majority of people do allow for a range of exceptions where   abortion   is permitted, Obama's repealing of the MCP brings how the federal government gives financial aid around the world more in line with the view of our citizens. The MCP established a false majority, in favor of the pro life ideas, this clearly not the case in the polls nor by the votes. Don't forget the couple of states who put legislation, trying to either restrict abortion or to do away with it entirely, to the vote in the last presidential election were defeated.Repealing the MCP just puts thing back to the equal footing between the opposing sides that existed before default status was wrongly given to the pro life side.
