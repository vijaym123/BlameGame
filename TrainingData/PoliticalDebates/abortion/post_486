The gag rule was put in place by Reagan, kept by Bush Sr., reversed by Clinton, put back by Bush Jr., and reversed again by Obama. It just alternates as the Republicans and Democrats exchange control of government. If you think the will of the people is important to listen to, you should agree with the reversal -- the people elected a Democrat, and reversing the global gag rule comes along with that.
