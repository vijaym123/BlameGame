This is going to be a deeply deranged argument, because the terms in which it is couched are badly flawed.What do you mean: 'life'?On purely biochemical grounds, sperm and ovae are 'alive'. So the embryo will obviously be 'alive' as well. But to extrapolate from this to the conclusion that an embryo represents 'human life' and thus should be afforded full human rights is ludicrous weaselling and sophistry.What distinguishes my appendix from an embryo? They have the same chromosomes - does my appendix deserve 'rights'? Should I be allowed to have it surgically removed?Some will object that an embryo has potential to become a human. But so does a sperm or ovum - to which we accord no rights of humanity whatsoever - given circumstances that are only slightly more complex.And so, in fact, does a cell from my appendix, if certain procedures are followed and the nucleus is extracted and inserted into an oocyte. If potential is the yardstick, any living human tissue has it, and I can see no sensible line of argument for special treatment of fertilised ovae that would not also apply to other tissue, or to gametes.Happily, apart from some religious ideologues and dogmatists, few people try to maintain such nonsense. Most tend to adopt an uneasy acceptance that somewhere along the process of gestation, a lump of tissue acquires sufficient similarity to a true human to acquire the rights that a human has. Unfortunately, this feeling is heavily influenced by the instinctive protective drive that all animals have for their young, and biased by it.Interestingly, the Old Testament has a much more pragmatic approach, in which children are not considered people for practical purposes until they have reached the age of around one month.
