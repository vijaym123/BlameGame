Senator Obama has promised to sign the Freedom of Choice Act if elected President.  With the majorities the Democrats will have in both houses of Congress, that legislation will certainly arrive on President Obama's desk and he will certainly sign it.With the stroke of his pen, abortions will be paid for, here and abroad, with federal funds, and the reasonable parental notification and consent laws that have widespread support will be swept away.So, in fact, this election will be a referendum on FOCA.
