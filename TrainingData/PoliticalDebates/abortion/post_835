"I understand you think life is really important. I agree. But let's play along with this hypothetical situation just for a moment. You are a fire fighter. You are in a burning building and you have evacuated everyone but an 80 year old feeble man and a child. You are the last fire fighter in the building and the building is moments from coming down. You know you cannot come back for a second trip. Do you choose to save one and leave the other to die?"It would depend, but Iwould be inclined to save the child because that is what the 80 year old man would most likely say.
