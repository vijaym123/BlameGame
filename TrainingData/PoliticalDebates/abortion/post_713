I hope you understand that I ask this quesiton in all seriouness, in an effort to understand your worldview. If life begins when God planned your life, and God has planned your life since before the beginning of creation, than that would seem to mean that you have always been alive. Is that true? Wouldn't it follow then that, for example, a 10-year-old girl is already carrying in her the life God planned her to give birth to in the future?I hope that made sense. Any clarification you could give would be appreciated.
