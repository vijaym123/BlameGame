WE are forced to pay for born-unwanted«s,WE are forced to pay for slow and painful dying still,so - why should the faithheads NOT be treated equally and pay for what THEY do not want (or never need, if male!!!)?But am I talking to the enthusiasts of the penal   law   here?If there is any "common ground" on personal matters, it can only be NO penal law, everyBODY decides over his or her OWN body, and   health insurance   pays for a limited amount of the most costly decisions (like IVF), but all of the not-so-expensives seen in the long run.
