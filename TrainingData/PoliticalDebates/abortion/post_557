It's not a good compromise because there is not over whelming consensus, among scientists, theologies or philosophies that induced abortions are taking away human lives. Since abortions can also occur naturally, would it be considered involuntary manslaughter?Unfortunately just to think or believe something is so does not make it so. What you are trying to present as a compromise is nothing more than allowing the state to decide the morals rather than a federal judge, in this case, hoping that the some of the states will decide that your morals are better than the morals of others. This is not a compromise at all, just wishful thinking that the pro life side has in the attempt to gain a legal precedent in its favor.On what basis does the pro life side form their opinion that   abortion   is murder? On what basis do they define life? These are not questions for which one can just legislate answers. And to change the laws from what they are now, these questions have to be answered. I would like to see the philosophical, legal, theological and scientific proofs they have to reach their conclusion. Belief alone doesn't cut it for me, I mean come on, some people believe in the strangest of things and never have the least bit of evidence to support their beliefs.When dealing with a question as serious as this, we should expect a little more than some people's beliefs.
