What are these corpse's stages of developmnent you are talking about? How are they called?I talk about human life's development which starts at conception and ends with death. While there is much debate on when does the life of a human being begins, there is no doubt on when does this life ends.You said: Dead body is a stage of a human being. A stage of "what"? of a human being?. Surely not of the life of a human being because life, as everybody knows, ends with death.And: Dead bodies do not have rights. To which i answered "kind of" in the sense that to kill doing barbaric acts on a corpse(whichever) is worse than just plain murder.
