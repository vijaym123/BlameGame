Let's apply Mr. Korzen's "do more to promote the cause of human life" standard to a President Obama and see how that works out.President Obama will receive the Freedom of Choice Act from a Congress dominated by Democrats soon after taking office and will happily sign it.  Federal funding would be used for abortions here and overseas and parents would be deprived of notification of, or consent to, their underage daughters having abortions.  The number of abortions will obviously increase.  Any argument to the contrary is delusional.Some Catholics for Obama try to excuse their vote by claiming Obama will do more to help the poor, which is clearly a goal of Catholic Social Justice.  However, reasonable people can disagree about which candidates' policies will do more to help the poor. What cannot be disputed is that it does not promote the cause of poor people to encourage them to destroy their unborn children through federal funding of abortion or deprive them of the right to know that their underage daughter wants to have an abortion.  Such a result cannot be in accord with the Church's goal of promoting human life.
