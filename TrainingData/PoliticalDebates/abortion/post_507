Your remark raises a valid point- which is that opposing   abortion   with no exceptions (which is not a view that I take personally) is supported by a small percent of the population, as is support for abortion in any cricumstances.  If you look at your own data, then 49% are clearly pro-choice and 47% are clearly pro-life.  Given a 3-4% margin of error, I think that there is no reason to regard this as a contradiction of my original thesis regarding a country which is split pretty evenly in half.  The question raised by the Mexico City Policy (MCP) was whether or not we should give financial support abroad to groups that would counsel women to have abortions as a form of family planning.  If half of the country would oppose this, then it cannot be consistent with our countries values.  It is consistant with half of the country and opposed by half.  Furthermore, poll data dealing specifically with the MCP shows that Obama's change in policy was supported by only about a third (35%) of the country- which makes it his least popular action to date.  -see link to Gallup poll below-  http://www.gallup.com/poll/114091/Americans-Approve-Obama-Actions-Date.aspx
