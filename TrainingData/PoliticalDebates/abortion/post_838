"I would carry the old man while the old man carries the baby and I'll die trying saving them both."I didn't say baby, I said child. And I stipulated that there is no way that you can save both, you can only save one or neither. "you know what, ...it's that kind of line of thinking that brought about the the Holocaust and the killing of the lame, blind and old in Uganda and similar shameful acts around the world in different countries at different times in history when all kind of lunatic tyrants arose."No it is not that line of that thinking that leads to genocides. I am not saying the old man does not deserve to live. But if only one of their lives can be saved, it is better to choose the child. It's just like if you did not have enough food to feed your two kids and one of them was sickly and most likely going to die and there is no way you can get more food.A ball of cells is not a human at all. A rabbit would be closer to a human than a fetus. For most of the pregnancy the fetus is not even sentient. It does not even know it exists. It does not even have the capacity for suffering. The mother's right to choose what happens to her body is more important than the life of a ball of cells that is not even conscious.
