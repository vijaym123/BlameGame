Wendy, I'm really surprised by your labeling and accusation of dishonesty.  You assign moral guilt to what was in fact a misunderstanding on my part. And the label 'religious kooks' completely undermines any dialogue.  Mutual respect and civility is a prerequiste in any discussion.  Please don't write back.  I could have heard you before but it would be very difficult now.
