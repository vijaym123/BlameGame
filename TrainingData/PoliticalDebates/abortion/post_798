At the point of conception, what really is the difference? Infact, the snail is more alive than a fetus. If you're talking purely about potential then what's the difference between ovulating and a very early term abortion? Both kill something that isn't yet life but has the potential to be life.This whole abortion argument really centres around at what state a ball of cells suddenly takes on the magical label of "human life."
