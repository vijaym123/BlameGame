You are correct in pointing out that the pro-life ethic must take into account the full spectrum.  However, you can not equate issues of the quality of life (poverty, hunger, torture) with issues of life itself (abortion, euthanasia).  Yes, we do fight against torture because it is bad.  But all issues are not equal.  Some issues are life and death issues.  We value the life - both of the born and unborn.  However, when given a person who is being tortured, a person who is homeless, and a person who is going to be killed - my priorities, my biggest fight, is going to be for the person about to be killed.  This does not mean the others are going to be ignored, but is a basic understanding that not everything is equal.  Voting for a candidate is not a full endorsement of their entire platform.  It is a vote for the best candidate.  This does not mean they are perfect, and I don't know if such a candidate has ever existed.  We must vote for the candidate who "values life" the most, and when comparing someone who endorses murder (aka abortion) on demand, the choice is fairly easy.
