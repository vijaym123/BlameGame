I am not God and cannot hope to understand all there is about Him. But I know what He says in the Bible. He planned me and it says He knew me before the creation of the world.  How that happens, I don't know, I don't need to know.  The point is God planned all life and we as humans don't have the right to kill life at any stage. And yes I agree that a girl is already carrying the life God planned for her to give birth to. In Hebrews 7:9,10 it states: "One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, because when Melchisedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor."People seem to be clever at engaging in discussion at when life begins. Anyone who has ever become pregnant (as I have) gets excited the second they know they are pregnant. We don't wait until the baby is "viable".Also, I know many women who are spending the rest of their life mourning the baby they aborted. No intellectual arguement is going to argue their grief away. I hope I satisfactorily answered your question.
