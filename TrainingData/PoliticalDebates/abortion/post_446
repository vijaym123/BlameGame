It is true that there are risks associated with abortion but there are also risks associated with childbirth. In 2002 alone there were 357 maternal deaths in the USA (    http://mchb.hrsa.gov/mchirc   / chusa_04/pages/0409mm.htm).I would be interested to see what percentage of legal abortions ended in death as this would be a far more instructive indication of its risks.Childbirth has numerous health risks (many of which are similar/the same as the ones you describe for abortion) -     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth    #Complications_and_risks_of_birthThere are also psychological risks associated with childbirth. Post Natal Depression may affect 1 in 10 women (    http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinformation/mentalhealthproblems/postnatalmentalhealth/postnataldepression.aspx    ) and can be a severely debilitating illness.
