Your first statement is mostly valid.  Your second, regarding gay marriage, is not.  America is a Democratic-Republic, and as such, policy is the will of the people.  A vital aspect for the survival of a Democratic system of government is that the people consent to live by the decision of the majority.  This is often referred to as "majority rules."  Furthermore, that viewpoint would not have been "forced" onto you.  You are allowed to keep you dissenting position, you are just not allowed to lead an armed rebellion or attempt to undermine the system just because you did not get your way.  Furthermore, you are not being asked to marry someone of the same gender, so what do you care?  His point seems to be that passing an initiative though it received a minority of the vote would be un-American, and it would be.  What he fails to take into account is Federalism.  If most of the people of South Dakota want to ban   abortion  , it is the right of the State to ban it.
