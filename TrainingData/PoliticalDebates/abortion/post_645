It is for legal purposes, not moral purposes.  The unborn child is always considered an innocent life, and the hope would be that the mother would recognize that (there was recent story in Slate about a woman who was looking for a way to explain to her 10-year old daughter that she was the result of a rape, so it does happen).A rougher version of this approach is presented by Liam Neeson in the movie "Rob Roy", where Jessica Lange, playing his wife, tells him that she is pregnant and the baby is probably that of a British officer who raped her.  She asks if he wants her to abort the baby and he replies, "It is not the baby that need killing."In the absence of the mother's decision to accept the new life, even most Catholics, like myself, would not pursue passage of a law that required the mother to have the baby.
