You quote Genesis and the creation of man, using the Hebrew word for "breath" to prove your point; however, you forget what the truely important part here was: Adam did NOT take the breath, God did it FOR Adam. Therefore, Adam didn't cause himself to breath but God put that breath of life within Adam. Same goes for the babies: while they've never taken air in through their lung, though they do get oxygen (the main purpose of breathing) through their mother making that a flawed statement anyway, they still have the breath of life in them. That is God's to give not ours to take.
