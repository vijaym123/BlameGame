Almost no one really believes a fertilized egg is a human being with all the rights that entails.  Don't believe me?  Show them an unmagnified   cancer   cell and a fertilized egg and ask them which one is a person and which one is desirable to kill.  One the other hand, almost no one believes that a full-term baby is NOT a human being.  The "line" is somewhere in between conception and birth.  Where there is a doubt, I think it is smart to err on the side of the mother.  Where there is no doubt, then there is no problem.  "Abortion" as an issue is a smoke-screen designed to divide and conquer people who would otherwise agree on enough to make them a danger to the power of the state.  It is safer to keep us at each other's throats, than to let us unite against a real enemy.
