Outlawing murder does not necessarily reduce the number of murders, but rather forces murderers to jeopardize their lives and health in order to terminate an unwanted person.Now, not all abortion is murder, but it should be looked at just as any other killing.  Afterall, if a drunk driver gets hurt in a car crash, does that mean we should make drunk driving legal?
