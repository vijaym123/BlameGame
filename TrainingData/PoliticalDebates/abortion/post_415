I have backed up my opinion with objective facts and analysis, not tautologisms. Today I restated why birth is the objective, rational, absolute criteria, so I won't repost it here. But the issue of double-murder for pregnant women is important, so I will address that here.Double-murder laws exist because the law-makers are not being rational. Look, is it somehow fundamentally different that a man fatally stabs a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman? Is he any less of a murderer in the latter case? No. Any individual who initiates physical force against another human being thereby forfeits his rights, and in the case of a murderer, the appropriate sentence is death.Now, space constraints of the prison system may not allow for just sentences to be carried out, but that is an argument for more prison space and/or executions, not making arbitrary laws to make sure that some crimes do receive a just sentence.It should be acknowledged that a woman puts tremendous biological, temporal, and mental resources, and she takes significant health risks, in carrying a pregnancy. She does so because she values the future potential of the fetus. Therefore, a pregnant woman who survives such an attack but loses the fetus loses something over and above what a non-pregnant woman loses, all things being equal. Sentencing guidelines can recognize this fact to harden the sentence. A double-murder charge is not necessitated.
