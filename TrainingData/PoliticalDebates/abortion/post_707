You're taking the standpoint that we create each other. God creates us. Before He created the world He knew me.Psalm 139:14-16Life is really wonderful and complicated! What a great work you did!You knew me from the beginning of my making, in which I was completely alone.You saw me before I was born. You know every action, past, present, and future, I will do. You investigated all my actions before the world was created.(modern translation)The arguement that many things die on their own is no justification for one human to take the life of another. We're all going to die of old age- or a car wreck- or a miscarriage. God made life. He can take it. You or I may not.  Talk to women who mourn the children they aborted.
