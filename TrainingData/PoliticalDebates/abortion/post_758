Don't get me wrong you can live however you want, just be willing to except the consequence.(read Joe's post) Take care of that kid, or at least put them up for adoption. Its not his or her fault that their parents wanted to live a certain way. The baby has the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I don't care how small or undeveloped the thing is. About the rape case; no of course I would not want to carry a rape child. But I wouldn't kill the thing. I usually try to do the right thing. Which is sometimes what I don't necessarily want for myself. That's the lifestyle that I choose to live. If it were me personally I would put the baby up for adoption. Because the best way for a kid to be raised is with a mother and a father.
