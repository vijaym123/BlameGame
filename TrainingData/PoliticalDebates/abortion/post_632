You correctly point out that O'Brien's argument commits the genetic fallacy.  As a   pro-life   atheist, I have no patience for such tactics.  It has started to seem so obnoxious from my point of view that I decided to try to start a group for like-minded people- just to show up the invalidity of the tactic of dismissing pro-life arguments based upon their presumed religious motivation.If anyone has an interest in this, please send a note toSPLASH- Society of Pro Life Agnostics and Secular HumanistsSplashForLife (at) gmail (dot) com
