This is a weak argument that appeals to emotion and does not in any way address the consequences of this law.  Fine, try to prevent women from aborting their down syndrome babies - what are you going to do with these unwanted people?  Abandoning genetically deformed infants to a shoddy state system is humane?  How do you figure?  The problem, in my view, with all anti-abortion arguments is that they're about abortion is right or wrong.  That is almost completely irrelevant, the debate here is about whether abortion should be legal or not.  If you think abortion is wrong and want to prevent it, fine.  Making it illegal will not prevent abortion.  The numbers throughout the world conclusively show that the legal status of abortion does not affect the rates of abortion.  The availability of contraception does.  Criminalizing abortion will mean lots of illegal and potentially unsafe abortions, likely *increasing* the numbers of people who die.  How is that pro-life?  If you want to protect the precious unborn babies, offer some support to mothers with unwed pregnancies.  Get out there and advocate for freely available, low-cost or free birth control.  You can't say that you want to stop abortion and try to prevent contraception from being available at the same time, at least not if you want to be consistent.  This is something that seems to happen more and more, unfortunately, particularly with the move to reclassify contraception as abortion and also make it more difficult to get, typically a position advocated by supposed "pro-life" folks.  Get real.  If you're against Roe v. Wade, you're pro-dead mothers, not against abortion.  If you, like me, find abortion to be morally troubling, you should be focusing on more widely available contraception.
