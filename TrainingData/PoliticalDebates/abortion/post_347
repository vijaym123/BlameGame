Thanks for catching that. Yes, that should have read "..to protect the health of the mother".Don't get me wrong, ussitano, I'm not in favor of abortions at all for the same reasons you give. But the reality of it is we will never end abortions; there are just too many legitimate reasons why society wants and needs to have them. I would never want a woman who was raped to be forced to carry to term a pregnancy that may result from that attack. This also applies in cases of incest. And if we know a fetus is severely deformed, I can also understand the desire to terminate it. I'm a little less understanding of those who simply failed to use protection and now think of it as an inconvenience. However, prior to 28 weeks the embryo/fetus is not considered viable and so if there are reasons to end the pregnancy, I'd prefer to allow it then with the understanding that beyond 28 weeks   abortion   would be extremely restricted.To those who claim this is already the case I would point out every piece of legislation that attempts to restrict late term abortions has more loopholes than carter has pills. And while the percentage of abortions in the third trimester is low, when you consider the total number of abortions for any given year, it's still a very large number of viable fetuses that are being terminated every year. There is far too much ambiguity in the laws today and the differences in various state laws allow people to simply go to a state that will allow them.
