The quickening issue was discussed in the context of what penalty would be imposed on someone who caused a caused a woman to have a miscarriage, or in the case of an abortion.  The penalty would be more severe if the quickening had taken place.  However, there was never any doubt that the destruction of an unborn child at any stage was an act of evil.I do not understand what you are getting at regarding the sperm and egg.  Human life does not begin until the two come together.I have searched the Vatican website and have found no statement by either Pope John Paul II or Pope Benedict XVI that the war in Iraq is "immoral, illegal, and a threat to humanity."  That is not surprising in light of the fact that no such statement was ever made.John Paul II stated as his own personal opinion, and expressly not as Church doctrine, that he did not believe the invasion of Iraq was justified.  The Church itself long ago developed the Just War theory because it acknowledged that under certain circumstances wars might have to be fought.  Reasonable people could disagree as to when those circumstances existed, and Catholics have disagreed about the Iraq War.  However, the Church has never stated as a matter of doctrine that the War in Iraq was not a Just War.The Church, through its teaching authority, talks about a hierarchy of sins.  Since we are talking about abortion and war, lets look at some numbers.  Since Roe v. Wade was decided 35 years ago, there have been approximately 50 million abortions in the United States alone.  Are you aware of any war, anywhere in the world, where that many innocent lives were destroyed in the last 35 years?
