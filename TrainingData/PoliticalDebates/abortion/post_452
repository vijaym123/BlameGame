This basically boils down to "we feel it is not safe for you to make your choices, so we're making them for you," and once again takes away all choice. It's already been pointed out that actual childbirth is harder on a woman's body than on an abortion; it's also true that many women who have abortions have no impact on their well-being (or it's improved, if they had a fetus implant in the fallopian tubes.) The FRC does not have the authority to make choices for individual women's well-being.
