Not everyone wants to live that way. I'm not saying a lavish life of sin and making out with everyone you meet is a good idea. It's a terrible idea, but some people just don't like the idea of abstinence either. And what if you take all of the measures against pregnancy and it still happens to creep up anyways?Do not forget that there are cases of pregnancy through rape. Would you want to carry a rape child? I don't think I would.
