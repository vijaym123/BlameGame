Hi Cameron.You are using a pretty sophisticated philosophical argument first made years ago in print, by a female philosopher. A friend of mine (a University Professor of Philosophy) wrote an entire book on this and a couple of other important,   pro-choice   of   abortion  , philosophical arguments.You seem somewhat sophisticated, using the argument that you do.  Are you also a Professor of Philosophy, or an interested philosophy student, or maybe just a very bright and thoughtful individual?  Perhaps you might actually know my friend: Professor Steve Schwartz.  Cameron?  I'm not sure that I spelled his first name correctly (maybe it's "Stephen").  Google his name and perhaps the title of his book will also appear.I'm sorry.  I'm a little old, now; and I can't remember the title of his book just now.  It was more than a decade ago.Let me know if you can/can't find the book.  I'll try to get you plugged into it.raymond
