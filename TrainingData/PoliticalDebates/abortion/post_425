I very much agree that the issue is the status of 'Embryo'.  But your argument cannot answer this.  The fact we know that life is conceived - or you would say potential to life - at conception.  That is established. But your suggestion that sometime on the 90th day the embryo becomes human has now basis.  This is the basic faulty premise with the argument that abortion is not killing.  You arbitrarily asign actuality.  Perhaps it should be the 87th day but then why not the 93rd.  No, logic demands that we accept that life was created at conception.  This we know and must deal with.  Assigning actuality at some later date only serves the singular interest of the mother - who may have suffered abuse accepted - disregarding the rights of the unborn.
