How about every sperm or egg that is wasted? Those can be considered "chances" at life. Should we make masturbation illegal as well?At the point of conception, all there is, is a clump of cells. To say that this clump of cells should have the same rights as a human being, is simplistic.Obviously there needs to be a point where a fetus becomes a person, however, this is certainly not at the point of conception. It can't breathe, see, feel, or think. As the law currently is, abortions are legal at up to about 24 weeks. Whether this is too early or too late is an issue of debate, however, getting rid of abortion entirely, is both unrealistic, and an infringement on the individual rights of women.Arguing that the only reason abortion should be legal is so that potential unborns have a chance at life does not take into account the billions of "potential" lives are wasted every day. Should we make sex mandatory for every girl who reaches puberty so that each egg has the opportunity to become a human? Obviously not. So what is the difference between a sperm and an egg that are separated, and a recently fertilized egg? Not much.
