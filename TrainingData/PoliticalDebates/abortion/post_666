 Actually it's amazing how moral codes regardless of belief systems are homogeneous.  No one wants to be lied to or cheated on or stolen from etc.    You're still basing your personal beliefs on the premise that there are no absolutes just different perspectives. I maintain that there is God who created all of us and instilled the truth in every single one of us. If you have differing views on how you should treat others (e.g. killing the unborn) you have a common viewpoint with the rest of mankind concerning how YOU want to be treated. (e.g. no one has the right to kill me.) Your last statement seems to imply an "uberman" philosophy: the smarter one is the greater right to life he has.
