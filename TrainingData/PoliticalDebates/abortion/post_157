#originalTopic=Debate:_Partial-birth_abortion
Mother and/or family are impoverished and would not be able to support the new family entrant. One of the most common reasons why a poor woman seeks an abortion is that "she can not take care of herself and the children she has. Most of the pregnant women helped by the Women's Medical Fund have children—many with two or three, some with as many as 10. Another birth will draw the family deeper into poverty." 
This argument may equally apply to partial birth abortion. Even if it becomes increasingly "wrong" to kill a more and more developed fetus, a partial birth abortion may nevertheless be justified on the basis that the benefits (or foregone pain) to the larger family unit outweighs the costs (or pain and lost life opportunity) to the single fetus. 
A poor woman may also be more susceptible to late abortions for a variety of reasons. Poverty may decrease the availability of certain resources that make it possible for a woman to "choose" to prevent impregnation, discover that she is pregnant, and or seek a first term abortion. This might make it unreasonable to deny poor women the ability to seek third-term partial birth abortions. The following is a list of the conditions that may make a poor woman unable to "choose" anything but a late, partial birth abortion. She may lack:
Access to condoms and other birth control resources:
Access to pregnancy testing kits.
Access to information which would make it clear that she is eligible to seek an abortion, and where and how to do so.
