Abortion should be illegal. It is taking the life of another human being. It is a known FACT that human life begins at fertilization. Let’s take a trip back to biology class; the male sperm unites with a female gamete to form a single cell called a zygote. So basically when the sperm and egg unite they then create a unique DNA of a human being. Only a small percentage of abortions are done due to rape and medical circumstances. A recent studied showed that women who were raped and had an abortion had a harder time healing than those who chose to have their babies. Since when is it expectable to punish a child for their father’s crimes?Just because you may be adopted does not mean you’ll have a miserable unsuccessful life. Did you know that Faith Hill, Jamie Foxx, and Babe Ruth were adopted? Abortion is done for mere convenience. Many women don’t know the true facts of abortion until it is to late and often feel depression, guilt, isolation, insomnia or nightmares, and much more after it is done. Even Jane Roe (Norma McCorvey) is pro-life now.I am not pro-life because of my religious beliefs; I’m pro-life because it makes logical sense that abortion is killing the life of innocent child.
