Couple of questions for you.First of all, Aristotle? Aristotle is relevant in this discussion? Traditionally, one would say "Aristotle says such-and-such and this is why he's right." not just "Aristotle says....so there."Second, there's a difference between financially dependent, or therapeutically dependent, and organically dependent. You can see this in reverse.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymothoa_exigua  This is a parasitic bug-thing (Don't be put off by my scientific jargon) that attaches to the tongue of a certain fish, drains it of blood, and eventually becomes the fish's replacement tongue. At that point, it stops being it's own bug-thing and becomes part of the fish.Some male spiders do something similar, where they basically mate, atrophy, and become an organ.So an individual organism can simply become a part of another organism. Gestation is this process in reverse.
