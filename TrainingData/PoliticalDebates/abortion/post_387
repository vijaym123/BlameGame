ajligs wrote and I quote: “The fetus also has a natural right, to life.”No. A fetus has no rights. “Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generating action.” (Ayn Rand) Simply because a thing is alive does not give it rights. Many things are alive, including insects, weeds and algae. One does not attribute rights to such things.  Individual rights have a specific meaning and it applies only to human beings.  A fetus is totally dependent on its host.  It cannot think or act without its host.  It is not a human being until the moment of birth.“A right is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context.” (Ayn Rand)   The born have a right to exist because they are born.  Not vice versa. The pregnant woman has a right to abort because she has the right to life.  The fetus has no such right.ajligs wrote, and I quote: “the fetus never had a choice.” This is true. It cannot have a choice because it has no capacity to choose. It cannot think.  It has no power of volition because it is not a self-sustaining, independent entity.Your entire argument is based on a mistaken premise that a fetus is a human being. Since you believe that, you give it rights.  But a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. By definition a human being is “a rational animal.”  But a fetus is not rational. It is impossible for a fetus to be rational before birth. It does not yet have a mind. It has no means to form a mind. As best it is a parasite.  It may look human after a certain development, but it is not yet human until it has an independent conceptual consciousness, i.e., until it is born.  Rights may not be attributed to the non-human. Women have individual rights.  Fetuses do not. Abortion should be legal.
