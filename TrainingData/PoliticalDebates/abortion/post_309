A fetus is not *metaphysically* independent. That is the fundamental issue. The other types of dependence are worse than irrelevant: Every living thing is biologically interdependent.An embryo or fetus is what it is. No one denies the facts that I have stated about their nature. What is denied is their significance, in order to make room for a religious interpretation. There is no escaping it: Either reason or religion must be used to answer this question. And religion is not a valid basis for government. Further, reason clearly states that the burden of proof is on you to establish that a fetus is a person entitled to individual rights, not on me to disprove it.
