My statement had nothing to do with a particular case, it's what it is, the reason we have courts as a third branch of government. You or I may disagree with some of the rulings but it doesn't change why they are there.As far as Roe vs Wade goes, they didn't force anything on you, if you think   abortion   is wrong don't get one.I personally think abortion is horrible but it was even more horrible when it was illegal. I personally believe life begins before conception, I decree that all birth control is here by banned. Oh wait it's not up to me, darn government trampling on my morals.
