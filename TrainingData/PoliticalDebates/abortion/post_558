  When the Supreme Court interpreted a "right to privacy" inherent in the 4th amendment of the Constitution in Griswold vs. Connecticut and Roe vs Wade, that meant that federal   law   under Constitution superceded states rights under 10th amendment. In other words, the Consitutional right to privacy took precedence. Since that time,Supreme Court decisions have allowed to states to enact limitations on   abortion  , which really is in lockstep with public opinion. As far as this latest poll saying the majority of Americans describe themselves as Pro Life, I don't buy it. One can get highly varied results in  polls depending on how the question is asked.  The other critical point is the "life begins at conception" argument. I personally don't believe that a fertilized egg is life, and think that this argument is totally unscientific, and simply reveals a misogynistic religious bias, even against birth control. Prolifers lose considerable credibility in saying that all abortions are "killing babies." Like most Americans, I believe abortion should be   legal  , and the sooner done the better. Plus there are numerous horrific instances that demand exceptions from all but the most callous religious zealots, such as child rape and incest, MUCH more common than the public has the stomach to acknowledge and condoned by Mormon Fundamentalists here in the USA.  In those cases the choice to force a child to have a baby is the worst kind of child abuse, tantamount to raping that child a second time. In the real world reproductive issues get messy and very ethically complex, making blanket legislation very difficult. These issues are better left between women and their physicians.
