If someone needs a kidney and I don't donate it and that person dies, I did not kill that person. I didn't do anything to help them, but nature took their life, not me.If a woman is otherwise healthy and at 26 weeks into her pregnancy she decides, for non-health related reasons, that she no longer wants the baby and has an   abortion   then she deliberately terminated that life.I'm not obligated to save a life, but I am obligated not to take one. There’s a huge difference.At some point morality needs to become the priority. Restricting late term abortions is not about dictating to a woman what she can do with her body; it's about protecting a viable human life, even if the woman wants to interpret it otherwise. Pregnancy is both a blessing and a burden for women, but it is the process decided by nature.And I’m sorry if I sound insensitive to your concerns but trust me, I am not. I merely want to find the balance between a woman’s choice and protecting human life. There is no simple answer and I understand your concern.
