Are proponents of elective   abortion   facing the moral complexity of this issue?  A baby's life is at stake, here.The news yesterday was that babies dance to music in utero (in the womb).  Did you know that baby boys in the womb are often seen to grow erections, when the ultrasound video goes on (as if they somehow know that they are being observed; so something)?Why not Domestic Violence and murder?  After all, Rihanna is HIS (Chris Brown's) girlfriend; isn't THAT what spouses and boyfriends and girlfriends reason?When are these bloody, black shadows going to leave our beloved land, and that high, bloody, black hand which makes those shadows, as well?
