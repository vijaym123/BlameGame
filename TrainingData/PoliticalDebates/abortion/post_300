I'm almost at the end of my reproductive years, so I will not be personally burdened by any future government rulings on the subject. My darling daughter however, is just beginning her reproductive years, I want her and her children to continue to have the right not to bear any ill-conceived offspring.  For us, our family would simple cough up the money for a plane ride for someplace where a legal and safe abortion could still be obtained. But what's a poor woman to do? Butcher herself? Or face the risk of childbirth with a child that she did not love and did not obtain proper prenatal care for? Sigh, as if we need more kids like that around.
