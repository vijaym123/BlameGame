Animals, and fetuses, have a right to life at the very least.  If they had no rights, then animal cruelty wouldn't be a problem, now would it?Where exactly do you get the notion that animals and fetuses have rights?  Where do you get the notion that humans have rights?  If you are rationally making the statement that a fetus becomes a person at birth (wherever you derive that standard from), what about that baby that is 3/4 out?  What about a baby that can survive on its own after 8 months in the womb?  What makes that magical instant where every inch of that baby is outside of the mother the key to its humanity?The coldness of the argument you present, along with the arbitrary nature of your declaration, is a little scary.  Denying that abortion is a moral choice, and that the unborn and animals have any rights whatsoever is also scary.
