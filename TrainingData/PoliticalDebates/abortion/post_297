Those gruesome pictures the pro-pregnancy crowd likes to display are not the usual aborion procedure.  Late term   abortion   are usually rare and only to save the life of the mother.  Besides, these pictures have been around for decades so they were probably done ages ago.  The majority of abortions happen in the first trimester and you'd be hard pressed to find anything that looks human.  In fact, it would require a microscope to find the embryo.  You have every right to consider abortion an act of "murder" even though there isn't a fully formed human involved. Just remember, it's the woman is the fully formed human with feelings, a life, and a future.  Your God aborts almost half of all conceptions in the first 8 weeks so I guess God isn't so anti-abortion as you are.
