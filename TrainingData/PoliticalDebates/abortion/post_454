Women who are opposed to   abortion   shouldn't have abortions.  They are the ones who end up regretting their decisions. They're easy to spot.  They're typically the ones who come in to the clinic proclaiming "I think abortion is wrong, but in my case it's necessary".Abortion is a personal and private matter.  Period.
