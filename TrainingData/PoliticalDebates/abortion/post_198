In your reasoning you have stated that Òa human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience.Ó You also said that when the church cannot speak definitively on a matter, "the consciences of individual Catholics must be primary and respected. This leaves latitude for Catholics to support prochoice politicians."Your reasoning is flawed for two reasons:The church has taught on a matter of faith and morals that   abortion   is a grave and mortal sin.  The church has also taught that supporting these policies are wrong.  Therefore the church has spoken definitely on the matter.Secondly, in your support of deferring to a person's conscience you have failed to mention what the Catechism speaks of in terms of malformed consciences.  The church clearly teaches that this ignorance, which includes defiance of church teaching, is no excuse for sins commited.  This is from CCC 1790 - 1792. I have provided an excerpt for reference: Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed.This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility. This is the case when a man "takes little trouble to find out what is true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded through the habit of committing sin." In such cases, the person is culpable for the evil he commits.Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others, enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source of errors of judgment in moral conduct.
