So a child (remember that nowadays 10-year-old«s can become pregnant) who has been raped by her father should be forced to beg him for an   abortion  ???In Brazil it was the stepfather (who was a   legal   guardian until he was put into jail) and she girl 9.Is this the "Pursuit of Happiness" in the US???Note: I chose my name from personal experience, at that age I found out that "THE HORRIBLE" would soon force me to have   children   myself, and never be able to leave the abuse family; and have fought off ANY touch since then - and it was absolutely exhausting.
