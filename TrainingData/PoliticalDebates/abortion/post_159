#originalTopic=Debate:_Partial-birth_abortion
Female rape victims may be physically prevented by the rapist from seeking an abortion in the first term. Some rape victims are sex slaves or kidnapped against their will. If only became possible for them to perform an abortion in the second or third term with a partial birth abortion, should they be deprived the right to do so? Having had no "choice" in the matter up to this point, it may be appropriate to extend the "choice" to abort with a partial birth abortion in such circumstances. 
Impregnated rape victims may be deterred from seeking an abortion at an early stage out of fear of reprisal from the rapist.
