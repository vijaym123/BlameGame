Joe O'Brien is ostensibly a very confused Catholic.  In fact I would submit he is not a Catholic at all, not believing in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, & certainly is NOT a Roman Catholic.  We are God's children.  He created all of us, starting from the unborn.  It is God's command to love each other as brothers & sisters.  We cannot approve the murder of the unborn & love God at the same time.  Those notions are incompatible.
