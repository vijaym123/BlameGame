You're assuming that universal truth is a matter of opinion or personal belief. The fact is that all our laws are govnerned by personal belief: the ten commandments.  If I chose not to believe any murder is wrong what is to stop me? Someone else's personal belief? The law? Laws can be changed. If I have enough lobbying power to implement my own beliefs over yours and get a "might makes right" policy which allows me to murder anyone I can get away with murdering what makes that wrong?  When you take God of the Bible out of the equation, what moral axiom are you standing on? Everything becomes justified through individual belief.  People didn't believe blacks had human rights. Did that make it so because it was their personal belief?  The ancient Greeks didn't believe that women had souls. Were they right because it was their personal belief? I can't let the murder of the unborn stay as a law because someone else doesn't think the unborn has rights.  You or anyone else who is in favor of   abortion   are most certainly imposing your personal beliefs on a whole population of humans: the unborn.
