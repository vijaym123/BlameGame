Ok, if a mother decided to take   abortion  , does that mean killing a human being? Consider this > I have the right to take the life of a mouse, ants, or even a micro-organism that does not even count(unprotected   animals  ), right? and consider this > so if i do not have the right to take a life of a human being, why is it that im allowed to take the life of a human being partly? for example, some of the person's cells are killed when the person is doing an X-ray test. The same goes if i poked someone lightly. What happened when the egg in the mother's womb is fertilised? Does that mean life? what if somehow i killed the fertilized egg at that particular moment? Does that mean i murdered and therefore i committed a   crime  ? well, what if i killed the sperm and the egg seperately? it's still ending a life. As i mentioned earlier, if i poked someone, it means killing some of his cells. But why is it that it's not a crime? the reason is maybe that it's minor, these cells almost has no benefit to that person and therefore it makes almost no loss. Its not the same if a ran into a man and purposely decapitated his arms. I will be sent to jail. Now lets go back to abortion. If the mother feels that the child only cause trouble for her.(cases such as financial problem, time, etc.) It also means that the   baby   has almost no benefit to the mother. I know, it means "something" to the baby. But consider this > if i cloned an animal(which is illegal), the animal's cell/dna or whatever is needed for this. so if i killed it, does it also mean killing some of the animal's cell which has no benefit at all? Every human being has individual rights of their own body. if it is allowed to kill a sperm because the father have the right, and kill an egg because the mother have the right. Surely it is allowed to kill when the egg fertilizes as the parents have the right?
