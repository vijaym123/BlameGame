While I recommend your post, what we need to consider is the notion of a justifiable homicide (i.e. self defense), which, while it rarely comes up with regard to   abortion   in the US, is nevertheless a concern.The solution is that abortion should be   legal  , just like shooting a gun, but it needs to be looked at just like any other killing.  Most abortions are murders, and the mothers are at worst accomplices - the '  doctors  ' are the murderers.
