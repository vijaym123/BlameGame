Of course conception is a necessary condition for a new human life—to argue otherwise or even bring it into doubt would simply be a waste of time. That is, assuming we have the same definition of conception.With equal certainty, conception is not a sufficient condition for new life—at least, if you define life as independent life. Without a mother to incubate a zygote into a fetus and eventually an infant, there is no independent new life. Simply remove the mother from the equation after conception to deduce that result.As for those who think that the zygote is already a new life, (not requiring that the life be independent, in other words), considering things like warts, moles and tumors each as new lives should lend to a different perspective. This isn't a completely absurd position to hold, but it is certainly eccentric and not one I feel compelled by.Then there are those who say that the zygote is a new life because it will eventually be an independent life. To me this seems no more convincing than arguing that a chunk of metal is a new car because it will eventually be used in the manufacturing of a car. There is a large emotional component to many peoples' positions on this issue that I am less affected by. When looking at the issue logically, I haven't seen a single convincing argument that the new life begins at conception.
