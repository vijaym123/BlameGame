I'm not sure how you got the idea that animals and fetuses don't have rights.  They do.  And whether you like it or not, animals in this country have MORE rights than do fetuses (or children as some like to call them).So I ask: When does a fetus become a person?  When it is 100% out of the womb?  Can you kill it (as some do) 3/4 out or leave it to die in a utility closet by inducing early labor?  Isn't this a moral question that should be taken with more gravity than dismissing it as a non-person to secure a woman's "right" to choose her convenience over responsibility for two peoples' actions in most cases?
