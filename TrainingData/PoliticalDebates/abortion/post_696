Actually, you're not allowed to make up definitions of words to suit your argument or your prejudice. Words like 'life' or 'potential' already have meanings, and your redefinitions don't help the matter. My use of the word 'potential' was employing the definition given by a dictionary, to whit:"The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of."But, since your argument is tied so heavily into your personal definitions, let's see where they lead us:o According to your definition, my appendix cell would not qualify for human rights because it would take 'tremendous amounts of human intervention' to make it into a developing embryo.o In that case, I presume that you would not accord human rights to an embryo (or a child?) produced via artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation or single sperm injection. Is that right? These require 'tremendous amounts of human intervention', and some techniques have only become possible in the last few years. Presumably you'd have no objection to even late-term   abortion   of a fetus resulting from these techniques.o And, according to another definitions of yours, 'a sperm will also not become a human'. No? What if I took sperm cells - perhaps from two different men - extracted the chromosomes from each, combined them, injected the full complement into a denucleated ovum and caused it to start dividing? That's not a human baby either, according to you - so I can do pretty much whatever I like to it, right? I bet it'll taste like chicken.You don't have to struggle with the underlying morality thrown up by these entirely plausible - if a little premature - scenarios. If you really believe that a sperm+ovum is a human being, I doubt you have the 'capacity'. That's another word like 'potential'. Make of it what you will.
