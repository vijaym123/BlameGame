Friday, post your argument as an argument rather than the debate description, so people can Favor/Opppose and Vote Up/Down.If you want to call all abortion murder, then fine, it's all murder. So are executions, euthanasia, and stepping on snails. If a fetus is undeveloped enough to not even have consciousness, then killing it is just fine by me. The world's overpopulated enough as it is. The people who want to abort their child but can't-- how well do you think they'll treat it once it's alive? Not to mention the fact that those who are barred from getting an abortion will just go and find a place to get one anyway. Usually somewhere far less safe than a hospital. The war on abortion is just as misguided as the war on drugs for this reason.
