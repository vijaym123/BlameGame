Wait a second. Do you have any evidence when you say that rape counts for less than 1% of total abortions? I'd like to see those statistics, please.And do you have any evidence of the claim that   abortion   is being used as another method of birth control? That's ridiculous. Abortions are far more expensive than   condoms   and pills.And condoms are always more effective than unprotected sex. I agree that the solution to   HIV   and unexpected pregnancies is better sex education, but I don't see how that discredits abortion as a possibility. The best way to treat a broken leg is by not breaking it in the first place, but you can't discount surgery as an option to mend broken legs.
