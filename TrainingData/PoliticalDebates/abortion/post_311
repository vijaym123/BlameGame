First, religion is entirely based on faith. Faith is a means of knowledge other than reason. Religion and reason are irreconcilable.Second, metaphysics is not a religious concept; it is a philosophical one, so it is not funny at all that I should mention it. Third, you are putting words in my mouth. I clearly said that independence--metaphysical independence--IS a criteria for personhood, an absolute requirement. That is because a person has an independent, functioning human consciousness. A fetus by its very nature does not have that. You are the one obsessed with physical and biological dependence and interdependence and umbilical cords, not me.Finally, you have not proven anything; you have simply definition dodged again. You are in a beg the question situation. When we talk about "pig" or "human" embryos, we are referring to their biological heritage (from Homo sapiens), not their moral-legal status (person). The biological heritage usage constitutes an alternate definition of the word. Indeed, in another post, you do go so far as to say that "human parentage" is what makes the definition of a human being or person, and since these fetuses are of human parentage, they are therefore human beings or persons. I have already invalidated human parentage as the essence of the concept "person" in another post.I have also invalidated "alive" as the essence of personhood. It is simply a precondition. Nor is there any basis for claiming that "alive" and "of human parentage" together have significance synergistically. Again, in another post, I explain that fetuses and humans are what they are out there in reality; they are not their definitions or an assembly of random characteristics.
