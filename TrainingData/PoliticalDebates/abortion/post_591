#originalTopic=when-does-life-begin
At conception, a living, unique member of the human species has been formed.  There is no debate here.  Any scientist will tell you that a fetus is both alive and human.  (as opposed to, say dog)  Sperm and eggs are also technically alive, and human.(assuming they came from a human)  The difference is in the DNA.  A fetus has the same DNA it will have for the rest of its life.  It is a new and individual member of the species.  Whether it is a person and thus entitled to rights is up for debate.  However, a fetus is definitely alive, and definitely a member of the human species.
