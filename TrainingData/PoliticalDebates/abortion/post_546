"Our nation was founded on the principle that all human beings are created equal.  That never meant that we are all created the same.  It means the lives of all human beings have equal value and worth, regardless of our relative skills, intelligence, and the differences in our physical ability or health.  The denigration of these values is the denigration of the human race."And yet, if they are convicted felons, you throw your airs and graces about the sanctity of life out of the window in exchange for a swift execution. All of these erronous beliefs about   abortion   and sanctity of life stem from religion rather than reality. Life is not sacred. People die every single day from completely random issues. Just visit / work in a hospital for a day. Death is sad, but it is an inevitability and nobody is going to save you after you die. If someone bothered to pick up a science book now an again there simple wouldn't be any issues.Ultimately this is an argument between the educated and the uneducated. Controversy can only exist if both parties have a sound argument in the first place. As it stands the "pro-lifers / anti-women's rights bridage" have a lot of catching up to do.
