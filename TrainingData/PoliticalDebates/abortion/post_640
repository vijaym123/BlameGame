While I disagree about the primacy of conception in the process, I do agree that a fetus (and the egg before conception) is alive and human, in the sense that its species is undeniably homo sapiens. As you say, the question really is how much protection is a fetus entitled to. I believe it is never zero and increases throughout gestation. The changing balance between protection of the expectant woman and the fetus is a political one, worthy of legislation and judicial interpretation.
