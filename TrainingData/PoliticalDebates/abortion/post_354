I have tried and tried and I can not come to the rationalization that many pro-  abortion   supporters find so easy - that somehow, a thing that, if left un-aborted, will turn into a human being 100% of the time.  (not usually, not almost always, not 99.9999999...% of the time, but EVERY time) can be killed and it somehow isn't murder, or if it is, that it is OK, because it isn't human.  How can it not be a human being? This isn't about religion or choice, but about science (the thing that becomes a human, is  a human) and basic right and wrong vs. convenience.  I don't have to be a woman (I'm not) or a religious nutbag (I'm not) to understand either side of this argument.  Why do so many otherwise decent people seem to think it is OK to kill another human?  It also sickens me that many of the same folks that are pro-abortion are charter members of PETA, ASPCA, etc.  If we cared half us much for each other, as we did for food and companionship, abortion wouldn't be an issue.
