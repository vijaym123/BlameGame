I have one simple question:If there is nothing wrong with abortion, then why do we need to reduce its use?  The Democratic Party has time and again defended not only the right to abortion, or rather the right to choose as they state, but have stated that abortion is not murder, but just another medical procedure. If this is true, then why all the work to reduce abortions?  If they truly believe that there is nothing wrong with it, what is the purpose of this new dedication to reduction?I think it is just an attempt to placate voters and appease certain members while still raking the millions of pro-abortion donor dollars and glowing endorsements from the major abortion providers and backers.
