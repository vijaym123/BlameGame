In your sense the potential for life is in everything, it is everywhere.  I actually agree - when a man and a woman think, "child", right then is when the child comes into being, even in the absolute physical sense.  This is because the physical as well as the metaphysical potentialities are present, all that remains is the act of consummation, which can either take place organically, or in a test tube.  When a man and a woman together think "child", but cannot bear one, that is true death of the unborn.
