ONE:You wrote, "I deny that there is a singularly important event in the life cycle of humans. We are Homo sapiens at every point and alive at every point. The parts of us that are new and unique appear at several different places in the cycle." I wonder if it is within the purview of science to identify a "singularly important" event.  Wouldn't ascribing importance require the abandonment of science's claims to objectivity and detachment?  If we are homo sapiens at every point, then shouldn't science merely identify the earliest point as the beginning?  If a neurologist assigns importance to when neural activity begins, then that is appropriate given his field- for that is what is important _in_his_context_.  Life without neural activity is not particularly significant (except as it affects life that does) in his field.  Nonetheless, a scientific determination of when something begins shouldn't deal with what is important.  It should deal a beginning in terms of what is earliest.  Do you disagree?  Do scientists find it hard to come to a consensus about when life begins for fruit flies?  I think that you said that you were a biologist.  I'm sure that you said that you were a scientist.  If you say that there isn't a consensus on fruit flies, then I'd like to hear more. If they don't, then it seems that humans are probably treated differently as a result of importing philosophy (my chosen field) into science (yours)?  Fruit flies are hard to invest with much importance.  We talk about "humanity" being a quality in a way that is not equivalent to the quality of being "a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens".  There is no equivalent quality of "fruitfly-ity".Sexual reproduction seems to have a pretty clear starting point. Eukaryotes get kind of hazy- where does the parent cell leave off and the daughter cell start?
