This is what it comes down to. Government is held with the responsibility of protecting certain unalienable, natural, inherant rights that humans are endowed with. These rights are basic and fundamental, among them are; LIFE, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Abortion should be made illegal due to it taking the fundamental right to life from a human, the fetus. The "  pro-choice  " argument doesn't hold water. Choice is the foundation of freedom. You have the right to choose, SO LONG AS THAT CHOICE DOES NOT VIOLATE ANOTHER'S RIGHTS. The choice of having abortion does exactly that to the fetus, it strips a human of a fundamental right and as a consequence, EVERY single other right. More importantly, pregnancy is a choice in itself. A woman has the choice to have sex, she then has the choice of using a contraceptive; furthermore, she has a choice as to which contraceptive is used. So she has many choice, however, those choices become irrelevent once life is conceived. Pro-choicers say the woman has her civil rights violated if she cannot have an abortion. What then is it called when the innocent, who doen't have a voice to defend their own inherent rights have them violated..... It's as basic as the weight of individual rights. The fetus' right to LIFE trumps the woman's 'choice' to destroy it every single time, no exceptions. I am astounished that an organization such as the Ayn Rand Institute would abandon reason on this basic fundamental issue that rests solely upon natural rights of individuals vs. the third round of choice for a woman (after the choice to have sex and then the choice to use contraceptive).
