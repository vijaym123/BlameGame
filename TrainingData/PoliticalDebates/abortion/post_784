I also come to believe that every one of us has the right to do what we think is right. Gays wants to get married, well that's their choice and I think we should respect that. But I am never pro of abortion this is way too sensitive. I think we should treat life more sacredly. It is morally wrong as we all know. It was killing another human life no matter what we push that fetuses are not babies.
