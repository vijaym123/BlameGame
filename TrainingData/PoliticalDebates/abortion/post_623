 I am always just blown away that prolife people would even consider suggesting that a traumatized child rape victim should have her rapist's baby.   YES. YES. YES. I was better off "aborting" that fertilized egg (two cells with a complete set of chromosomes does not constitute a "life" in my opinion, but potential life) and limiting the entire incident to that.It was NOT   murder  ,it was absolutely justified, and your suggestions to the contrary are just abusive. I refuse to buy into it. MY WELFARE as a traumatized young girl with a fully formed brain, body, and  consciousness should have and did take precedence over a fertilized egg. That should be a No Brainer to any rational person. No loving God would ask such a thing.  Are you even considering the   health   risks to a child delivering a baby? Did you research that at all before suggesting it?   The problem is people do not have a clue how a child's mind works, just how traumatic this is. Since you cannot understand, I will tell you that my Catholic faith,with its obsession with virginity, caused me to believe that I was ruined, dirty, defiled,that God sent this man to do this to me because I had been bad. Why else would he allow such a thing? There is no other explanation to a child, and religious teachings serve to reinforce it. That's the kind of thing that misogynistic religious dogma does to a child rape victim. The combination is absolutely lethal to a sexually abused child's spirit and self esteem. Rape of a child is spiritual murder. Needless to say, I am no longer Catholic. And although i can tell you mean well, I feel sorry for you because you have swallowed that dogma hook, line, and sinker.
