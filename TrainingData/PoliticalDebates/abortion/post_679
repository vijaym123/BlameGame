You were doing so well up until here. You are being wrenchingly absolute. The issue of aborting a pregnancy involves painful issues of moral uncertainty.I propose that there is a fundamental error in your 'beginning of life' argument. You take as given that there actually exists a definitive point at which a fetus becomes human (gets rights). You appear to be saying that   abortion   before this point is fine and afterwords in an enormous crime (murder). I think this is the wrong way to view the development of a baby. What if, instead, the moral 'crime' of abortion increases continuously throughout the process of development? What if it is wrong to abort any fetus, but at the very beginning of a pregnancy it is wrong to a degree similar to that of truancy or libel and sometime later it is wrong to the same degree as accidentally causing grievous bodily injury, and somewhere near the end an abortion is truly wrong to the degree of murder? I think this progression is much more in keeping with society's view of abortion. This allows for a compassionate comparison between the medical needs and rights of a pregnant woman and the gradually increasing realization of the human potential of a fetus.My conclusions.There is no magical point in development where a fetus transitions from worthless to human.A ball of cells can not have the same rights as a post-birth baby.No abortion is as morally inconsequential as having a mole removed.
