I believe that there should be a difference between   abortion   when the sex that created the child was consensual or if the woman was raped. If she was raped and became pregnant the woman should then be able to decide for herself but if she was just to lazy to make some guy put on a condom then she should have to go through with it. No one knocked her up agianst her will.
