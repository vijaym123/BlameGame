I don't know where to begin.  You fail to provide any reasonable or valid definition, and then object when an authoritative one is given on the grounds that you don't like it, saying that 'it doesn't make the problem go away,' without specifying what the problem is (reasonably anyway), and then reccommend your own post like it's holy writ.  Wendy, you have failed.  You are wrong.  You have lost.  I declare this because you are unwilling to admit it, but moreso because such is the case.  You've spewed nothing but fancy babble, and often haven't even addressed the issue, preferring to go off on tangents.  You criticize fact as opinion on the basis of your opinion, and rather than support it, you merely reiterate it as though it were axiomatic (few things truly are).I say this not in rebuttal, for you've given me nothing to refute or otherwise debate; I say this that you might improve, recognize these critical flaws, and to offer the chance for either surrender, or serious debate.
