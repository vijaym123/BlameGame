"This is a scientific fact, not a religious claim." No, it is not a scientific fact. Yes, it is a religious claim. A fetus may be alive, but it is not a human being. It is an incompletely formed, incompletely developed entity, and that is why it remains in the mother's body. That is a FACT, and anyone who claims otherwise is "making a political statement, not a scientific one."It is with amusement that I watch the anti-abortionists simply try to pretend that this issue is now a matter of "science," which they imply means only finding concrete parallels and precludes interpretation and analysis.Watch this: Birds possess a heartbeat. Human cancer cells have human DNA. Even rodents have "brainwaves." Those are "scientific" facts. Does that make birds, cancer, and rodents human? No? What is the difference? How do you "know" a fertilized egg has a soul? What "scientific" fact led you to conclude that?
