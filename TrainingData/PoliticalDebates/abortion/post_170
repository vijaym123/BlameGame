Discussions of quickening or ensouling addressed the issue of when the soul entered the unborn child.  Saint Augustine, without the aid of sonograms or the advances in embryology we have today, calculated that boys received their souls at 40 days after conception, girls at 90 days (apparently Speaker Pelosi's analysis of Augustine missed this point).  However, the Church always viewed abortion as a great evil at any stage of pregnancy.  Modern embryology now confirms what the Church knew all along --life begins at conception.  That is a scientific fact, not a religious belief.  At the moment of conception a human life has been created.  That life may end before birth through miscarriage or abortion, but it was a human life.  With regard to war, adultery and other types of sin, abortion and euthanasia are on their own level in relation to other transgressions.  The intentional taking of innocent lives can never be approved by the Church.
