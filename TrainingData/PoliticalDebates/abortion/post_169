Didn't the Catholic Church believe that life began at quickening and not conception at certain points in the past? The fact that the Church has changed it's views of "life" make me question the certainty of their views.The other question is why is this "sin" more important than all the others. If Catholics can't vote for Obama due to this why can they vote for McCain who is an adulterer? Why can they vote for someone who supports the war in Iraq when The Pope has said that the war is a defeat for humanity!I'm just looking for a little consistency. Surely a person that supports the war in Iraq does not value life if we take The Popes words into account in which he also made clear that the war is illegal and unjust.
