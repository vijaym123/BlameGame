its just selfish.  ok, i'll exclude cases where there is some sort of complication.  if it's a choice between abortion, and both people dieing, i dont have a problem with that.my main problem with it is that the man has absolutly no say in this.  lets say a woman gets pregnant.  the man wants the child, and the woman doesn't.  the guy can kind of see it coming and may try to talk her out of it, but that's the best he can do.  while the male half is already attached to the baby, the female half could be out there having his baby killed without him even knowing.  a child that the man wants, and would take all responsability for.  financial and otherwise.  anything it takes to keep his child alive.  it would be absolutely devastating when the guy finds that out.a sad story, yes?  now lest say that story is true.  we'll say that because it is.  my baby was killed years ago, and it still hurts.  i tried everything i could to keep my baby alive, and i failed. it was an impossible battle.
