How do you justify killing animals for food or clothing? We are sufficiently advanced in our technology and knowledge such that it is not necessary for survival. While I do indeed believe that one that has greater cognitive powers has greater inherent value, that does not mean one with lower cognitive powers should be sacrificed for the former's pleasure, only for the former's need. As such, I will eat meat under certain situations where I feel it is merited by need or a sufficient advantage to myself, but I am otherwise vegetarian.As to your view that God created all and instilled truth, how does that square with the vastly differing views on what that truth is? Any common morality can be explained using game theory. That is, either it is immoral to do to others what you wouldn't want done to you, or more broadly that which is wrong is so because of the negative impact on the society.
