I now understand what exactly proponents of   abortion   mean when they put forward this idea of "my body, my choice."  It had never made sense to me before, probably because I was looking more at the fetus, and less at the womb.  Now that that clarification has been made, and the position has been truly explained well, I think it will be much easier to come to an understanding.  This is certainly the best argument for abortion that I have ever heard.  I think there is an issue separating abortion and refusing to give up a kidney, and that issue is that of activity vs. passivity.  A child in need of a kidney will die unless you give it to him.  Refusing to do so would cause the child to die, but it would not be actively killing him.  Doing nothing would cause the child to die, but action would save him.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, (as it should be) for the government to require a person to take action to save a life.  An abortion, on the other hand, is actively killing the child.  Doing nothing would allow the child to live.  Taking action to ensure that another human dies, whether they are dependent upon your body parts or not, is generally illegal.  Unfortunately, there aren't many good analogies for the unique relationship a fetus has with its mother.  A possibility could be siamese twins.  I'm not sure how well this analogy will work out, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that actively killing and removing your siamese twin because she relies on your heart and she inconveniences you would be more equivalent to abortion than denying a child your kidney.  Of course, this example doesn't take into account whether a fetus is a person, which brings us right back to where we started.
