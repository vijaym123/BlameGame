Do you really believe you are are sovereign over your own body?  The Bible says all our days are numbered and tomorrow is promised to no man.  You have no more control over your life than if you could change the weather.  God is sovereign and that is exactly what is so evil about   abortion  .  People assuming they are sovereign and have the right to murder others- even more horrific- their own flesh and blood.     How in the world do you deduce that giving life through carrying your baby to term dehumanizes you? Giving life doesn't dehumanize us, taking it away does.  The ultimate form of slavery and dehumanization is when a person does not value another's life.  If we can not value the life of our own   children   when they are in the womb what makes any life valuable?  When one does not trust God and His sovereignty, even in instances of rape, life has no meaning or hope.  When one trusts God's sovereignty we know that even   pregnancy   from rape can bring hope and meaning.    Aborting a baby conceived from rape will not rid the mother of the trauma of rape it only compounds it by making her guilty of murder.
