I'm grateful for the discussion that is allowed on this site.  I dod not have time to read all the comments and debates. When speaking about the right to abortion because it is the law of our land, I also know that at one time, slavery was allowed in our land because it was the law of the land.  What about all the issues surrounding the racial discrimanation in this land?  Was that not at one time the law of our land?  And what was that all worth?  The cost of the ink and the paper which made it a law?  We don't need human laws to know the law that is written into every human heart.  We all know right and wrong and we don't need someone else to tell us.  We just need to stop joking ourselves.  Thank you for this chance to speak!
