so what if your husband had a vasectomy?? you already had 6 children, you know the joy they bring!! and if you didn't want the baby, you could have given it up for adoption, give it to a family that wanted the baby, instead of killing it! if you didn't want another kid, you should have used a CONDOM or BIRTH CONTROL OF SOME SORT BEFORE YOU HAD SEX!!!!
