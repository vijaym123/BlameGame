 Fewer women would have abortions if they knew what they were doing Bernard Nathanson, former abortion doctor turned pro-life, in his book Aborting America, 1979 - "Fewer women would have abortions if wombs had windows."[19] After the abortion, women are confronted with a much more profound sense of the reality of what they have done and what they have lost. This often triggers depression.
