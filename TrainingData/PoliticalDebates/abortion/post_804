"because abortion being illegal is about as useful as making masterbation illegal,"This is not the same case, there is no life forming when you are doing your own thing as compared to the life that takes place after the conception. A gamete would still remain a gamete if there's no union that occur. We are talking here about the formed life and not the "half-life" that you suggest. In that case we're all be murderers of little life.
