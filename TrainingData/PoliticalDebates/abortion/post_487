What are you talking about moving away from a true   democracy  ,in a democracy you are alloud to make chooses for yourself in this case someone esle is making it for you. I Personally do not approve of   abortion   that don't mean I can decide for someone esle and niether should you or anyone esle!!! It's should be the single person choice!!!
