I don't think asking someone to assume responsibility for her actions is too much to ask.  In the end, it only takes nine months to carry a child and give it up for adoption.  You are saying it is OK to kill the child so that the mothers "life" isn't thrown away?  Please -- Nine months of putting a kink in a social life is hardly comparable to being put to death by dismemberment.  Abortion is being used by people as a way not to pay the piper.  If you don't want children now, don't make them!
