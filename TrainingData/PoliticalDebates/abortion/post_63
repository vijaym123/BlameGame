 Abortion often leads to regret, depression, and even mental illness Carol Everett - ÒThe product, abortion, is skillfully marketed and sold to the woman at the crisis time in her life. She buys the product, finds it defective and wants to return it for a refund. But, it's too late.Ó[18] These feelings of regret often lead to depression and sometimes to a condition known as "post-abortion syndrome".
