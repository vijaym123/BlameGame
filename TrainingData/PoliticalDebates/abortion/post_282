- A fetus at 39 weeks: looks just like my son 5 minutes after birth (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/5-37.gif    )A fetus at 15 weeks: head, body, arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes... that's not a cat (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/67-10.jpg    )An embryo at 9 weeks: i not know exactly what it was, but it is definitely an animal (not a plant) and it has a head, arms, legs, fingers. (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/66-30.gif    )An embryo at 6 week: just by looking I would have not idea what this was (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/66-28.gif    )Conclusion: a fetus looks remarkably like a newborn human person; there must be a connection.(I couldn't find actual pictures, so the medical style depictions will have to do for now.  Can someone find actual pictures?)
