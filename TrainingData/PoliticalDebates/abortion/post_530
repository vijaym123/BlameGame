Hmmm...so if I don't believe that thievery is wrong, I should just choose not to do it?  Or, maybe murder?  Obviously one who believes    abortion    to be immoral will not, if consistent, "partake" in it.  But that is not the issue; the issue concerns the taking the life of an innocent human being.By the way, if gay marriage laws are passed, and I'm to live under those laws, is that not "un-American" by your definition.  After all, that viewpoint has been forced on me, against my wishes.
