The only comment I will make is about the use of Exodus 21:22-25. Read the full three verses:If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.Notice the use of grammar here. If NO MISCHIEF follows the premature birth, the man is to pay a fine of whatever the husband wants. However, if there is any mischief that follows the premature birth, the person who caused it is to repay eye for eye, tooth for tooth, right down to life for life. God considers that MURDER before the child is born. In fact, eye for an eye is a legal punishment for any adult injuring any other adult willfully. So here God is giving the unborn child the same rights as any adult would have under the Law.Please, next time you try to use the Scriptures make sure you keep your use within the context of the passage. When God was giving Moses these instructions He used specific language and didn't include a penalty for hurting the mother in these verses, it all revolves around the unborn child.
