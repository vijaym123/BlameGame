“According to your reasoning:??  “If anyone really belived death penalty is murder, he or she would be advocating the same penalty for those who carry out/sentence the death penalty as the law prescribes for premeditated murder.”Correct.“I honestly don't believe that those opposed to the death penalty want jury members, judges, and law officials to be jailed over it.“Why not?“They simply want the option off the table.”That cannot be accomplished, without punishment.“Your argument once again tries to make abortion solely a women's rights issue…”No, it doesn’t.“…when those who oppose it are heart-broken over the loss of innocent life.”Then why don’t you want the killers punished?“I will never accept the pro-choice point of view, but I can oppose it without labeling pro-choicers as murderers.”If the takers of innocent life are not murderers, what are they?  And what, then, is a murderer?With all due respect, I think your contradictions make my point.
