"Slippery-slope" argument that "once 'fetal rights' are granted to one stage of the pregnancy, nothing will prevent their extension to all stages", which is argued as going too far. The basic concern is that if certain "rights" are extended to an unborn fetus at any stage, that it would be difficult to then draw a clear line or threshold across which the "right" to an unborn fetus could not be extended. This basic slippery slope argument, in other words, indicates that abortion would have to either be always illegal or always legal, because all other intermediate laws would risk being arbitrary, and be incapable of permanency. Pro-choice advocates believe that the women's "right" to their own body is most important to preserve, and thus that it is best to fall on the side of extending full choice to the mother, and preserving the "right" to partial birth abortion.
