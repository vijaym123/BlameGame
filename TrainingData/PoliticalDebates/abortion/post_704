5 minutes before conception those same potencies are already in existence. We carry some of the "potencies" of all our descendants with us right now. In the unbroken chain of descent there are a series of miraculous transformations, one of which is conception. Why do you glorify conception over the others? After conception it is still the genetics of the mother that rule the cell. A fetus's own genetic combination doesn't take over until a short while later, but that is just another of the miracles that occur. How about the eggs first cell division? That is a big one, where the fetus will die if the chromosomes can't dance together. How about gastrulation? An incredible, complex, cellular convolution where the fetus has to prove that it has what it takes. Many fetuses don't make it there. How about implantation - the point where the fetus and mother meet and negotiate terms of gestation. Whatever we decide about the morality of   abortion   has no effect on this fundamental, biological "choice" by the womb. How about when the nascent immune system first defines 'self'? How about a heart beat or a meiotic division or a nerve impulse or a breath? Life is a string of miracles, especially during fetal development, and it is not clear to me which one deserves to be held up as the most miraculous. Each milestone is the realization of one of your bundled potencies, and an absolute requirement for all the subsequent ones.I believe that a fetus gains humanity incrementally as it passes each subsequent test. Before the milestones are past a fetus is only potentially a human being - potential is not the same as actual.
