I just made a long call to the Family Research Council in Washington DC, I was interested in possibly supporting them, I agree on many of the positions they claim to represent.  I am setting here very disappointed, to use mild comparisons they appear to be modern day Pharisees and Sadducees.  For you non   Christians   they may be people who have hidden motives and are not who they claim to be.  It is impossible to determine who or where there funding comes from.  For all we know they could be funded by interests in China who wish to have much more control over the USA.  The Fact is we just don’t know who the   money   comes from or if they have hidden motives.  Do any of you know exactly who there money comes from?  Please don’t use the Evangelical Council as a resource to find more on this subject, you will get only general meaningless data from them.  How about it Family Research Council, give us a list of your top twenty contributors and there amounts.
