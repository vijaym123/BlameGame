May I suggest a dictionary definition for personhood?The specific term seems to be lacking in mine, however, the great thing about english is that I can use its root to understand its meaning.Therefore, I submit, the definition of personhood, based on the definition of person, according to the Langenscheidt's New College Merriam-Webster English Dictionary is: Person, n, 1: Human individual.Personhood: the quality of being a human individual.
