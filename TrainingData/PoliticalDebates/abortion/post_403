Does science detect that a fetus is metaphysically independent? No. Again, a potential is not an actual. Your criteria are completely arbitrary, nonfundamental, and do not survive the light of reason.Partial-birth abortion is an oxymoron invented by religionists to add legitimacy to their cause. An abortion is not a birth. A physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth.In actual childbirth, the laws of nature induce a biological process which expels an organism fully developed to function autonomously - in a metaphysical sense.Exotic, borderline, or abnormal cases do not define the principle or category. The existence of Cesarean births does not in any way change the debate.
