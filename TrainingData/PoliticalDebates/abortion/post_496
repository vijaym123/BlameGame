That funding should have gone to educating women and men not to create life in the first place. Seriously it isn't that hard not to spread your legs. A condom takes 5 seconds to put on, birth control isn't that hard to get, spermicide costs less than having an   abortion  . There are so many preventative measures out there. That if the person gets pregnant regardless of the options available to them, then they should be forced to live the consequence there actions have brought. My   money   should not be used to fund 'fixing' someone else's mistake, and irresponsibility.
