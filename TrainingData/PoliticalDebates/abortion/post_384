This post by the ARC is just the tip of the ice burg.  If I understand the argument, the full argument involves the view that a person's right to life involves the right to live it by their own judgment of how best to do so. Since a fetus has no such judgment it has no right to live by it, just as it has, with some exceptions clearly spelled out in law, no right to on the food he/she eats, or the TV shows watched, or the education it receives.  The age of  majority is the recognition of the fact that person-hood and the full support and weight of the law is reserved for those who have developed the capacity and ability, as far as the law is concerned, for reasoned judgments about how best to lead their own lives.  This is the source of a woman's right to have an abortion.
