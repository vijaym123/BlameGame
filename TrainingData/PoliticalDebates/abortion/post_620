I think you make great sense!When I found out I was pregnant I immediately was excited. I didn't wait until my baby was "big enough to deem viable" I knew right then and there that life was growing inside of me. Most women will tell you the same thing. We all know a precious life is there regardless of his or her stage of development. People arguing to the contrary are attempting to justify murder with a lot of rhetoric (professing themselves wise they became fools). I also know many women who are spending the rest of their life grieving over the baby they aborted.  You will not be able to argue away their grief with "When is life viabile" rhetoric.In the words of John Donne: "No man is an island...any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.." Or how about Psalm 139:16 .."your eyes saw my unformed body.  All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."It's interesting to note that one of the first things Hitler did when he came to power was to legalize   abortion  .  By the time he was deposed they were killing 6 year olds who were still wetting the bed because they were deemed imperfect. Hitler knew that if you can devalue life at one level, you can learn to devalue at any level.
