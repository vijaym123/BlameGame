You just agreed with me that abortion is killing someone and not something. Isn't it against the law to kill an innocent person? I know that a lot of times it is extremely difficult to for a woman to cope with an unplanned pregnancy, but i think that ultimately, the government should make abortion illegal, but in turn provide programs to help the woman through this hard time and make the right choice in what to do with the child after birth, whether it would be adoption, or keeping the baby, in order to preserve life. I also think that the government should provide more funding for to take care of the children in the foster care system. It may be true that we shouldn't tell other people how to live their lives or what they can and can't do, but isn't that what we attempt to do whenever we vote?
