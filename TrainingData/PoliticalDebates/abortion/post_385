Abortions should be legal.ÊTo make   abortion   illegal is to deny a woman's individual rights. Whether a woman has an abortion is entirely up to her.Ê This is an issue of individual rights. If an individual's right is denied or violated, that individual is not free.Ê ÊTo the extent that all women are denied their individual rights, to that extent the nation is not free. When that's the case, males are also affected.Ê In time, the entire nation is under the dictates of whoever has the most pull and the most guns.ÊThe state and church should not interfere with this right. Both government and religious leaders have no moral say in the matter of abortion.Ê A woman might want to consult with the father of the pregnancy to discover his preferences but ultimately she alone has the final choice. It is, after all, HER life. She should be free to live it as she chooses.ÊAbortions should be legal.
