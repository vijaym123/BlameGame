We can find NO common ground, even to the point of notifying parents that their underage daughter is getting an abortion.In a country where you need parental notification for taking cold medicine and taking them on field trips, it seems that getting an abortion with parent notification is not even common ground for us. This is utterly ridiculous that Obama is not willing to let a family decide what is best for the child that is underage and pregnant. (voting NO on notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions.) What kind of president would not allow the parents decide how best to help their child? That is one huge flaw.
