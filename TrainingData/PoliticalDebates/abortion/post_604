"In the case of a fetus prior to somewhere between 21-23 weeks, it is not capable of survival outside the uterus in which it originally implanted (at least, not at this stage of our medical/technological development). It is, in essence, a "parasite" (by strict medical definition) upon the mother's system. It is reliant upon continued physical embedding within the mother's system to survive"My objections:The fetus didnt implanted because he decided to do so. The resposability of it's existence is it's mother's that engaged in a sexual intercourse. This is a basic difference from a parasite. The mother is not just some adult willing to take care of the child. There is a unique and beautiful connection between these two beings and it makes the case against   abortion   even more painful for this.So the only two things that the fetus needs is: food (by aid of the umbilical cord) and space (the womb). Just as babies need food (mother's milk) and a place to stay (it's mother's home). The only difference is that the babies needs can be replaced by any willing adult while before week 21-23 the baby needs can be covered by one person only:  it's mother. Isn't it sad that the one person that with her acting brought him to life and the one person who as the duty to take care of him is the one person that wants to terminate his life?
