I don't want to get emotional on this issue when arguing with pragmatists or just plain idiots, so to spare myself the grief over the lost lives, I will make one LOGICAL argument and leave the rest alone.Forget about religion or morals... let's look from a common sense perspective and leave everything else alone... including that embryo.  Using that logic, if the embryo was left alone what would it become?When two humans mate and a female's egg is fertilized what will be the result of that fertilization.  All physical and or mental abnormalities aside, those two cells dividing will NEVER become anything other than a HUMAN child.  They will never become a rat or a dog, or even a primate which any scientist will tell you we share 98% of our DNA with.  With that in mind, how can make arguments that it is not a person?  Will it, if left alone, become a person?  The answer is yes and there is no refuting that.  Should we not, then, bestow on that future person the same rights we would any other human in this world?  I think we should.  Think on that awhile.Winston Churchill once said: "All great things are simple, and many can be expressed in single words: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope."Err on the side of justice, honor and mercy, not on the side of political correctness.
