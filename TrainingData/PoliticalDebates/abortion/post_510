In what way is underwriting the views of the pro life side fair to the pro choice side? This is what the MCP did, said the default position should be the pro life, which ignores the view and rights of the pro choice side. Removing the MCP allows institutions in other countries on both sides of the issue to petition for aid. There is nothing implicitly stating that all the aid is going to institutions that only promote abortions, it simply allows them the same right which pro life entities have (exclusively under the MCP). the MCP was completely undemocratic by refusing any chance to ask for aid to those who promote   abortion  .Besides the bad allegory of abortion to slavery, you start with a false premise that everyone agrees on when human life begins. This is not the case, where as with slavery there is no confusion about what is wrong (and even that is a contemporary lack of confusion, because the states of succession certainly held a different point of view during that time).About individual contributions I agree that the same can be done for the pro life side as well. That's beside the point. If federal aid is being given out there is no reason that it should favor one side over the other, if done in consonance with how our country feels about this question than the aid money will be split fifty - fifty.
