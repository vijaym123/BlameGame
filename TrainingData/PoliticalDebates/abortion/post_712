The issue isn't whether things die naturally (many fetuses die in the womb,bioloby is harsh) but rather do we as humans have the right to kill an unborn child.  One could argue that after a baby is born it could catch pneumonia and die (biology is harsh) but does that give you or me the right to stop the life of another person?  God says before the creation of the world He knew me.  Life begins when God planned my life.  He's the only one with the right to take it away. Not someone who can devalue others with a lot of "intelligent sounding" rhetoric. Have you talked to women who mourn the death of the children who they aborted?
