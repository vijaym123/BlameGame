I don't believe that it would be easy to end up like Nazis. For one thing, we have their cautionary example. I would also point out that we did intentionally kill innocent Germans and Japanese in our fight against fascism. We regretted it, but did it anyway. My point is that we already break this basic tenet of Natural Law - there is nothing absolute about it. So, 'innocent human beings should not be intentionally killed without a good reason' appears to be our practical standard.You state their position as, "innocent life can be destroyed because it has not moved through enough 'functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions' to be considered a person," but there is an additional important criteria once we go from "when does a human begin?" to "is   abortion   legal?" Their is now another person's well being at stake. Any rights we assign to the fetus will always need to be compared to those of the pregnant woman when we consider the implications of abortion.
