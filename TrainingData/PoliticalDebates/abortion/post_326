if viability in an arbitrary   environment   is the criterion for life, I contend then, by your logic, that you are not alive, and therefore cannot be killed.  Therefore, there can be no   legal   consequences for anyone who wishes to 'change your current environment' (i.e. the Marianas Trench).your alternative, however, is at least more reasonable than wanton termination, and so I give you some credit for that.
