¨When does HUMAN life begin?” should be the question asked.  Carl Sagan’s book ‘The Dragons of Eden’ argues very convincingly that what separates human life and other nonhuman life is the development and functioning of the neocortex.  Therefore he argues that a rational acceptable legal compromise in the   abortion   debate should be that human life begins with the first neocortical EEG signals.  This happens in a human fetus near the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy.  When neocortical EEG signals ends is also a rational legal definition of when a human dies.
