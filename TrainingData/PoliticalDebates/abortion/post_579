You're right that there is very little difference between a full-term fetus and a newborn infant.  However, if you understood my argument as claiming anything other than this, then you misread what I wrote.  The distinction I am making is between a full-term infant (or even a pre-term infant with sufficient gestational development to survive outside the womb) vs. a fetus of insufficient gestation to allow it to survive through the independent functioning of its own bodily systems - in other words, a fetus which has not yet reached a point where it is viable outside of the uterus (with whatever medical interventions are available).  This is why I would draw the line at somewhere around 20 weeks gestation, but would prefer to see abortions, if they must be performed, take place within the first few weeks after conception.  The further the pregnancy progresses, the murkier the line becomes.  And when the point is reached where the fetus, if delivered, would have even a small chance of survival outside the uterus, I believe the line is drawn and crossed.  Any   abortion   after that point should be ONLY done if the fetus is clearly physically non-viable, such as an anencephalic fetus.  If a pregnancy must be terminated to save the life or health of the mother after the point of viability outside the uterus, and the fetus is normal and healthy, then I believe a vaginal or cesarean delivery should take place and every effort made to save the life of the pre-term infant.  Of course, this is what generally happens in such cases, anyway.  Very few mothers facing a health crisis late in pregnancy and needing to bring their pregnancy to a close would desire to lose the baby in addition.  Arguments which imply this are really quite bizarre.
