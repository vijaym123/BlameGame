I have respect for ALL life forms, human and non-human. We as a human race need to learn to respect life forms, human and non-human, and treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve. A blastocyst is indeed life. It is a ball of rapidly dividing cells. This action causes significant energy to be spent. These cells already produce adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), thus, are biologically alive. Biological death occurs when cells can no longer produce ATP. I've known a couple of women who had C-sections 3 and 4 months premature, and the baby managed to survive. It's possible, yet it's still legal to abort during this time? OK...there's something SERIOUSLY wrong with this picture if I do say so myself. Continuing to allow this morally repulsive procedure to take place is just an indication of the state of moral decay that the USA is in and it's not going to get any better unless people with good consciences step up and straighten things out.
