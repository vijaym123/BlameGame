In medical terms, an "  abortion  " happens every time the products of conception (a fertilized egg) leaves the uterus without producing a live birth.  But this happens countless times in nature, as fertilized eggs are routinely washed from the woman's uterus before they can be implanted there.  Abortion opponents might as well consider Mother Nature the world's largest abortion mill.
