you ever hear of adoption? Check into the amount of couples that are trying to adopt sometime. "Genetically deformed" and everything. The problem with you people is you don't see the baby as a real person. It's all about the poor innocent woman. Give me a break. NO sex, NO baby is the free available low-cost birth control. After that, you have responsibility. Remember that? It's the baby that is innocent in this whole issue, not the parent.
