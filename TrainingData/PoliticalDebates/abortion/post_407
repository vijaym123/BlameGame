Why do you fail to realize that your criteria is just as arbitrary and nonfundamental?  Intact dilation and extraction, to use a term you might find acceptable, and thus worthy of debate, does involve the fetus passing through the birth canal.  If "a physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth," then what does?  Are babies born by induced labor not people, then?  What about those rare times in which the subject survives intact dilation and extraction?  Are they still fetuses, though they are still alive and clearly outside of the womb?  In your previous post, you have once again proclaimed without any justification that these cases will not be considered, but that's not good enough.  This is a debate, and you must give counter-arguments against arguments brought to bear, or admit defeat.
