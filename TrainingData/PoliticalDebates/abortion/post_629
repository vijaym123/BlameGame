Liberals do not, to the extent that Conservatives do.......mind you these labels do not truly describe the majority of either party as labels are the exaggerations of the extremes.....anyway, they do not use the church as a platform for election in the same manner.  As in, the Christian values they profess are actual campaign tactics.    This group makes up a very large portion of the "right to life" fan base.   What don't you understand about how it is contradictory to be against   abortion   AND, at the same time, be against welfare?   If the church was doing such a good job.. as, if the private or faith based sector were doing such a good job at providing help to the poor... there would be no need for the welfare state to exist.  Further more, if - as is claimed - more than 3/4's of the population is Christian, why is there resistance to welfare?  To say that life is precious and must be protected against the ill-choices of the parent.  If we say we must protect the voiceless... why does it not seem contradictory to you to protect the voiceless lives of children against the ill choices of their parents? Or as is more likely, considering the evidence, the ill choices of the parenT?    This bloated inefficiency you speak to comes not from the fact that welfare is not intended to actually help the poor.  It is meant to keep the poor as exactly that - poor.  But that aside, you speak as if Conservatives have not controlled congress.  You make it sound as if "Conservatives" as this bastion of gleaming solidarity in beliefs... and are not corrupt.  If they are part of the government - they are corrupt. But you're ignoring the point...  If Conservatives run their campaigns with an eye toward the Christian base, they should be more proactive in welfare.... since life is so precious as to choose it over liberty.
