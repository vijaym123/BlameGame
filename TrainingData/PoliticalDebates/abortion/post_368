Aren't we all, by true definition,   pro-choice  ? "If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice." Choosing to not is a choice, no matter how you look at it. Abortion is a difficult decision, no matter the individual's circumstances or beliefs.  Is   abortion   a   legal   issue or a personal decision?  Should the federal or state governments decide, or should you?  We all make choices in life, you are only responsible for your own, it's called accountability.
