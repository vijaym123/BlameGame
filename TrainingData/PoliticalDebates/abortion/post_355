Here's a question that my mom's friend brings up every time human rights are brought up.Is it ethical for someone to demand services of you for free, or to coerce you into a contract that you did not consent to?  Of course not!  You never consented to the contract!Imagine the following situation.  One day, you wake up and find a human being attached to you via life-support system.  If you remove the life-support system, the human being will die.  Question: Is it ethical for that human being to inconvenience you without asking for a social contract?I think you might know where I'm running with this.And notice that I never asked whether or not it is -moral-.  Morality and ethics are two very different things.
