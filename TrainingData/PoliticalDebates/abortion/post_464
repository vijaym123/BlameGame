Why don't we make you the head of decision making for all the girls who seek abortions. You can go and hear all of their stories and decide who can and who can't get abortions. You can determine whether or not they are doing it for convenience or not. I am sure that all the girls who are out there were thinking..."I am definitely going to get pregnant and have an   abortion  . That sounds like a great idea." By the way, why do people have   kids  ? To continue their bloodline? To get some guy to finally put a ring on their finger? Because babies are sooooo cuuuute? Don't act as though women who decide to have kids are altruistic saints who should be put on a pedestal and worshipped. Even cockroaches have kids.The world is overpopulated. Keep your legs crossed.
