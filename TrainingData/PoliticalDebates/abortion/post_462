The anti-abortionists use one sloppy, cheesy phrase written in one unprofessionally written textbook used in third-rate medical schools as "scientific proof" that human life begins at conception.Such argumentation represents a wholesale rejection of reason and a hostility to actual science. It is a cynical ploy that convinces no one outside of evangelical circles. The evangelicals use it in the vain hope that somebody's say-so will vanquish others' will to think critically.
