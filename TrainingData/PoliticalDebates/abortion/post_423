if reality is the foundation of logic, how can logic be used to discover reality?  or are you omniscient?Please note, I did not contradict myself, which you would realize if you'd read what I said; there was afterall a criterion and formula for such occaision.Identities aren't axiomatic; that's why your geometry teacher makes you do proofs.Since you asked the guy with the dictionary; epistemology: the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and valididy.  It means nothing [almost] in this debate; for if knowledge is the criterion for human identification, then the comatose cease to be human, while the nature of a human fetus is still dubious; and any trainable animal achieves legal equality with man.Obviously you don't know what an axiom is, therefore; an axiom is that which is self-evident, simply put; authoritatively defined as "an established rule or principle of self-evident truth.  By the way, since it's in high school biology where one definitely learns about the basic properties of the genome, the process of reproduction, and the fundamental unit of life; I am correct in asserting that any attentive high-schooler knows that human life begins at conception.I never said that existents don't possess identity (maybe I should stick words in your mouth?); I simply said that they don't identify themselves; hence the need for proofs.  Now to answer your question, even as you put it; Truth and Fact themselves.Remember, even for the absurdly doubting Descartes, existence wasn't axiomatic; he had to prove it, but Truth and Fact must exist for the contrary is illogical, absurd, and impossible.  It would appear that you aren't as philosophically inclined as you would have me believe.  Now I tire of this.
