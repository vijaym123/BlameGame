One could look at the womb as an organic life support system.  If someone is alive, but needs mechanical aid to breath, then taking that away would be murder.  One could reason that the same would be true if it were non-mechanical.  On the other hand, if someone needed life support, and they were in the process of trying to get it from you without your consent, then denying it would probably not be murder.  If it did not pose a hardship to provide the aid, then it might be depraved indeifference to human life, but if it did impose a hardship it might not even be that.
