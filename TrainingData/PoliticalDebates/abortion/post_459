According to your reasoning:If anyone really belived death penalty is murder, he or she would be advocating the same penalty for those who carry out/sentence the death penalty as the law prescribes for premeditated murder.I honestly don't believe that those opposed to the death penalty want jury members, judges, and law officials to be jailed over it. They simply want the option off the table.  The same is true with the abortion issue.  Your argument once again tries to make abortion solely a women's rights issue when those who oppose it are heart-broken over the loss of innocent life.  I will never accept the pro-choice point of view, but I can oppose it without labeling pro-choicers as murderers.
