Yes, I have heard of adoption.  I think you'll find if you had actually read my comment and not just what you wanted to see, I never said that I thought abortion was right or good.  I was arguing about the legality of it.  Saying "everyone should just be responsible" is all well and good, but that's a completely absurd proposal to actually solve any problems.  You might as well say that the solution for our health care system is for people to just stop getting sick.  The housing crisis can easily be solved by everyone being more responsible with their money.I live in the real world, and in the real world criminalizing abortion does not help unborn babies, no matter how innocent.  It merely makes abortion unsafe.  I welcome your comments on the issue of how criminalizing abortion actually causes the loss of more lives.  If you want to take the stance that women who would seek abortion deserve to die, you are welcome to that opinion, but again it doesn't really seem to be pro-life.
