The points you make here seem to be as follows:- Regulations on abortion clinics are sometimes inadequate or ill-enforced.- Some women experience complications.- Some women have regrets after having abortions.These are real issues, but they shouldn't be dealt with by banning abortion. We should make sure abortion clinics can't weasel out of important safety regulations, that's clearly true. Every medical and surgical procedure has complications, so patients need to be adequately informed of possible risks -- this is true even of things like wisdom teeth extraction or appendectomies, but surely you wouldn't advocate banning those. Finally, some people wish they hadn't done it? That has never, in the history of our country, been an adequate reason for banning something. You might as well ban ugly ties and disco music.
