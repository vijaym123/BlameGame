It is up to the individual who wants to change the status quo to provide a reason.  For example, we have a fetus bumping along on it's way to birth.  You want to justify killing it.  You've got to have reasons.  Furthermore, even if the onus of proof is on us, that doesn't also make you the judge of what is valid evidence or not, no questions asked.  When an argument is brought up, you must argue against it, you cannot simply proclaim that it is not evidence.  I haven't read all of your comments yet, but I'm getting there, and I have not yet seen you give a counter argument.  You just state the same arbitrary proclaimation over and over again.  "A fetus is not a person, it is a potential person.  Birth makes a human.  Any arguments you bring against this will not be considered.  They will be written off as religiously motivated or invalid because I said so."
