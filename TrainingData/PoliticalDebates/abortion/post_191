Logic can be our best friend or our worst friend. Depends on the way we feel about the question being debated. First, if we recognize that the woman's human body naturally aborts a significant portion of conceived eggs than we can relax a bit on the question of induced abortions. Since they happen all the time we need not make a special case.Second, you presume that there is a soul. I don't and by the way you can never prove you or any one does have a soul. A conundrum, I know but it does swing both ways and so logical consistency would be in favor of no special case.  You also seem to presume that you know god's mind (if such a mind does actually exist) which I will grant for arguments sake, but please inform me how you or anyone could possibly know all the mysterious ways of this god?Besides, I would argue that there is "no room in catholic theology for the obvious disregard for human life" presented in wars, or even in the holding of WMDs. We should strive to educate people about sex and contraception so that those who want to have a baby have them when they want them and not because of an accident.
