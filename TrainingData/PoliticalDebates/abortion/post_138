If it is countered that this analogy is not appropriate because fetuses should not be considered on an equal basis as those subject to capital punishment, a number of considerations should be made against this position. First, those that are subject to capital punishment are often murderers or extreme offenders. Should these citizens be regarded more highly, and more worthy of decency than an unborn fetus? Maybe not. 
First, an unborn fetus has often taken on most aspects of human form, nearing "viability", meaning that it shares most of the human characteristics held by a fully grown human criminal. 
Second, both an unborn fetus and a convicted criminal share the fact that they lack the full rights assigned to regular citizens. 
On this basis, it may be appropriate to conclude that a unborn fetus and a convicted death-row criminal should be treated with a similar level of decency. Given that most liberal democracies prohibit violent forms of capital punishment, it may then follow that liberal democracies (and others) should prohibit the common methods of partial birth abortions on the grounds that they are excessively violent.
