Mike said "I think you're thinking of personhood, because there is simply no question about whether or not you are ending a life. ". Yes, I was referring to "personhood" throughout my post.  The idea of "life" in and of itself is not important to this debate.  This sound's strange, I know, but many things are "alive" that as a society we have no compunctions about killing. Many animals for food, insects as pests, skin cells when we scrape our knee.  All of these things are alive, but killing them is (for most of us) not controversial.   We even let people die when they are in a vegetative state (most of the time).  So "life" is not the standard for the debate on abortion.  The standard must be HUMAN life, which I treat as synonymous with "personhood".  With respect to a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus, the question is When does it become a person?  Certainly not at conception, by my way of thinking.  Possibly not until birth.  Arguably sometime in between.  But aside from chronological definitions, the acquisition of higher consciousness characteristic of humans from birth onward is my functional definition.  I just don't know when that happens.  And since no one else does either, we should leave up to each of us.  Sid
