 First of all, I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what happened to you.  Furthermore I am sorry that you had to receive further trauma at the hands of those who claimed to be representing Christ and His   church   yet, by your account, treated you in an unChristlike, unscriptural manner.  You did nothing to deserve what happened to you and any Christian leader who has made you feel that way are one day  going to be held accountable to God.  It's understandable that you have a lot of anger against the Church as well as people like me who are Christian (I'm not Catholic, by the way).  Therefore, I am not going to get into an arguement with you about when life begins.  I am going to tell you that there is a God and according to scripture He knew you and loved you before He even created the universe. He loves you so much He sent His son to earth to die a cruel death on a cross so one day you can spend eternity with Him. Where, as it says in the last book of the Bible "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain..."(Revelation 21:4). This  gives me great hope.  An end is coming to all evil.  If it is not true, what have we to look forward to?  More people committing crimes, more suffering until finally we destroy each other?   God cares about you and has healing and blessings to give you if you would only turn to Him.  As I said, it doesn't matter to me what you might think about me but I am not going to stop praying for you.
