I know it is a "lapsus" but i couldn't resist: "During the third trimester   abortion   should only be allowed to protect the health of the baby" How is abortion going to protect the life of the baby, i wonder? Seriously: i am against all abortion (and this is my opinion) because it simply terminates the life of a human being's life cycle. Science has proved that this cycle begins at conception and ends permanently with death. I simply think it's wrong to make a distinction of humans based on any discimination as declared in the universal declaration of Human rights article2: Size, Location, Stage of development, etc... To argue that a fetus is not human is simply false.If we agree with this we have to give all humans the same rights. The only exception to abortion, in my opinion, has to be when the life of the mother is at risk.This is to save the only life who would survive if we didn't intervene.
