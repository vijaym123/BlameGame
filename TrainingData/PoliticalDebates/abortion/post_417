But unborn child is not.  Corpse, by definition, refers to something that used to be alive and is no longer.  Child has many definitions, including the vague "a person not yet of age," and the specific "an unborn or recently born person" - New College Merriam-Webster English Dictionary.If one removes a patch of skin, an arm, or a heart, we know that it is part of the human it came from even if done without causing pain.  What part of a woman is the baby?  He/she isn't part of their mother.  How is the mother adversely affected by the removal of this 'part'?If independence is the criterion for personhood, then no person fits the bill.  People are inherently interdependent.  Now, twins joined at the hip - are they part of each other, or separate?  Do they only get one vote?  or two?Back to the beginning, I thought a trimester was 3 months, but what is cited here only applies to the 1st 3 weeks, or not at all.  As for the animal compariston (which doesn't apply), what do you mean by primitive?Any evolutionary comparison is irrelevant since fetal development is not an evolutionary process, likewise, the human being is always human, from the beginning, never becoming anything like a frog or a fish (or anything else for that matter).  If you simply mean that the child hasn't fully formed, does that mean that the Elephant Man wasn't really human?  What about my friend Kyle, whose left hand is almost devoid of fingers?  Is he somehow not human?By the way, a child has discernible fingers at 3 weeks pregnancy; that's why most abortion procedures involve the quartering of the child.  Interestingly, quartering, the practice by which a person's limbs are rent or severed in a bloody mess, has long been deemed 'cruel and unusual punisment'.  We don't even do that to our murderers and rapists, and yet we're to do it to our children?
