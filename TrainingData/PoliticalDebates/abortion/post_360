"Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[9]¥ Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for   pregnancy  , 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]"  http://www.alanguttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html  The AGI is the research arm of Planned Parenthood, the world's largest   abortion   provider. So as you can see 46% of women did not use another contraceptive method while a majority of people using other contraceptive methods report having used them inconsistently. This means that a great majority of people are not using contraceptives or are using them inconsistently. Why? Because there's always abortion available as a solution.The AGI also reports that 1% had been forced to have sex.Of course   condoms   are more effective than unprotected sex. I don't say that better sexual   education   discredits abortion as a possibility. I just think that if we address the problem at the source then less abortion will follow wich is what we should all agree with. I also think that making abortion illegal is the best solution if we want abortion to end.In poland for instance since the new 1993 law was written abortions went down from 100 000 aprox to only 340 in 2006. The law exempt the woman from being guilty of any   crime   and allows abortion when there is rape, if the life or   health   of the mother is at risk or when the fetus health is incompatible with life.Your example is not valid because in a broken leg situation surgery has a purpose of   healing   and cure. In the case of abortion surgery is used to terminate a human life. No other surgery does that.
