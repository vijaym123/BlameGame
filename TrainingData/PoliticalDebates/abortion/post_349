Late term abortions are rare and only to save the life of the woman.  So it's graphic, so is the end results of bombs being dropped on innocent women and children in Iraq.  It still doesn't address the issue of privacy.  Abortions aren't for public viewing.  You can use shock all you want but it's not going to work on everyone.  The question of   abortion   is still a privacy/medical decision.  You don't believe in abortion, no one is forcing you to have one.  We aren't living in China.  You want to have 20 kids, that's your choice and I wouldn't insist that laws must be passed forcing you to limit the size of your family.  By the same reasoning, you have no right to tell other people how many children they must have.
