I think it is strange that those who say the federal government shouldn't rule on this question want the state government to decide the very same question. What is logic of this? It Whether it's local or federal, someone is going to impose their morals on others.How about each individual decide for themselves? No need for anyone to worry about the others' morals because the decision is an individual decision.The state argument is just political rhetoric, because the pro lifers think they have a good chance of making   abortion   illegal in some states. "by the people", is obnoxious in this context when we already have by the individual.
