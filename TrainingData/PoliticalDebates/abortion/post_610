This is a scientific question. The Question should be better put this way: When does the life of a distinct human being begins? There is no debate here:   science   tell us that the life of each and everyone of us begins at conception when two haploid cells unite and fuse to create a new diploid cell called zygote that through constant and driven development will terminate it's existance with death.Personhood (that shouldn't be confused with ensoulment) is a philosophic question and is not the subject of the debate.Best link:   http://www.l4l.org/library/mythfact.html
