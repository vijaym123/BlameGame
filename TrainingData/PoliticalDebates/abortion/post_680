"becomes human" = "gets rights"   (?!?)Let's try an analogy: Suppose I asked, when does life begin... for butterflies and moths?1>Female lays egg2>Fertilization of the egg3>Egg hatches4>Larva's first moulting5>Wing disks develop6>Chrysalis forms7>Adult emergesI can't see where it would make any sense to argue for step #1.  The cell is haploid and (I believe) cannot (without fertilization) grow or metabolize.  One could argue for #'s 3-7, I suppose, but to what end?  If you start talking about gradually becoming a lepidopteran (or 'fully lepidopteran' or a 'lepidopteran being') despite being lepidopteran life, then you just seem goofy.  You can argue that the ordinary referents to 'moth' and 'butterfly' are the adults, but that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that from a scientific point of view, the term should be applied not merely to the adults.Maybe you already disagree.  If you don't, then consider that (IMO) the only reason to advocate for #'s 3-7 as when life begins for a butterfly or moth is that there is a concern regarding value or emphasis being given to one portion of the life cycle.  For obvious reasons this happens when the question is put to ordinary people about human life.  Ordinary people are not trying to limit themselves to empirically based determinations.  Scientists (qua scientists) are required to do just that.  They have every right to assess value, as ordinary people, but not from the standpoint of "doing science".  Value and emphasis (and especially the attribution of rights) are normative and arguably subjective.  Science is supposed to be empirical and objective.This business about human life with the potential to be fully human or to be a human being seems from my POV to be strictly applicable to one species.  If that is so- then how is it justified as being something other than normative and non-scientific?
