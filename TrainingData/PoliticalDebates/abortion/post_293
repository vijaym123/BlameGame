I believe I refuted the "humanity" of fetuses when I pointed out on multiple occasions that they do not possess consciousness or metaphysical independence. I could be mistaken, but there are no known fetuses who give to their favorite non-profit, write great works, or express admiration for sublime music and poetry. Let me know when that happens, and I will be glad to revise my concept of fetuses. Heck, I would even give way if they merely showed their humanity by considerately offering their unwilling, burdened hosts a break by taking up residence in an incubator somewhere instead.But since you like dictionaries, dodge this: "1. The quality of being human; the peculiar nature of man, by which he is distinguished from other beings."--Webster's Revised Unabridged 1996.Hmmm...What is peculiar to man? By what is he distinguished from other beings? The rational faculty. Aristotle already proved this.
