In the opening scene, the McManus brothers are sitting in church and then get up to kiss the feet of the crucified Christ while the Father gives a sermon.  He tells the story of how this girl was stabbed in broad daylight... "and no one so much as called the police."   At the end of the scene, as the brothers are walking out, he says "Now, we must all fear evil men.  But there is another evil.. which we must fear even more.  and that is the INDIFFERENCE of good men."    The claim that inactions are not as harmful as actions is a fallacy.  What we choose to ignore because it's an inconvenience to us to face the truth bears the same moral condemnation of the actual actions that are considered to be "evil", or wrong.   A woman gets an   abortion   for many reasons... mainly though, because it's inconvenient for her to be pregnant.  Why don't I donate my bone marrow? Because it's inconvenient.   I'm choosing to kill someone through my inaction. I, at the very least, recognize this.    I'll probably end up taking action and registering at some point, but at this point in my life - it's not convenient for me to do so.  For now though, I am still morally wrong for what I do NOT do, as morally a woman who aborts is wrong for what she does.  Anyway.  That's a good movie.You should rent it if you've not seen it.
