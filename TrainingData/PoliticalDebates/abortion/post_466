Why should it be illegal? Would you take away the choice for a 13 or 14 year old girl who was raped? Yes, there is giving it up for   adoption  , but it is the fact that a child will have to carry a child. I do think that it shouldn't even be an option for older women, because it is, usually, their own fault they're pregnant in the first place. Also, what do you think when you see a pregnant 20 year old versus a pregnant 14 year old? It won't hurt anyone older to carry their child. The only acceptable times for an   abortion   are rape and if carrying the child could kill or harm you severely.
