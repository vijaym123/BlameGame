I say life happens three months prior to intercourse, conception is utterly meaningless to me.  It is also meaningless to you, you just don't realize it. If one believes physicality is what determines agency, then, one must also believe that the very concept, of conception, is meaningless.  Thus the two beliefs are at odds.  If however you believe intentionality is substance, then, I give you any such arbitrary boundary as you please, but I cannot give them to the whole of society.
