How is it a religious fact?? It's scientific!! what does religion have to do with it? it's a living CHILD, that's going to be brought into the WORLD! GOD made the child and it's a LIVING THING. right after conceiving the baby, IT'S ALIVE. and you want it legal to kill a living thing? a living human?? that's murder. it's an innocent child.
