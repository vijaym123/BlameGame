#originalTopic=when-does-life-begin
Life has been around since the first organisms on this planet have been here but it continues.  Your mother and father were alive when their living sperm and egg met and made your living embryo.  No one cries for the lives of the other billion sperm.  However meaningful life begins when people give it value.  If we were to give all life value at conception smoking by or in the presence of any woman of childbearing age should be attempted murder because it has the ability to end the life of a new embryo.  Without omnipotence however we don't know how many 'lives' have ended before we ever knew they existed.With all of that I believe MEANINGFUL LIFE does not begin until much after conception.
