Apparently you are familiar with this ruling.  You say that during the first trimester   abortion   should be universally allowed, some restrictions in the second and even more in the third.  Well, this is exactly what Roe states.  Third trimester abortions are only allowed if the mother's life or health are in grave danger or if the fetus has such tremendous health problems it wouldn't live beyond birth but what few abortions are performed in the last trimester are usually to save the life of the woman.  So you see, compromise already exists.  Also, a fetus can not be a seperate entity until it is able to function outside of the womb.  This can't happen until about the 29th week.  Granted, there have been cases of 26-28 week deliveries but these usually result in very physically and mentally damaged children.  If a fetus delivers and doesn't take a spontaneous breath, the physicians usually won't try to resuscitate it because it means the respiratory system is too immature to function.  They don't want to put that child through any torture forcing it to try and live.  I've seen the miserable lives those children have gone through and was thankful when they finally died from all their medical complications.  Death is a normal part of life.  From the moment we are concieved we are on the path that will eventually end in our death.  It may come a few weeks after conception or years after our birth but it will happen.  Let's take care of those who are born and here in need of our help.  We don't need to drag more unwanted children into this world until we can give the one's living here and now a decent life.
