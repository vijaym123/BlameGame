No, relying on reality is the foundation of logical, rational argument. Yawn.I am losing track of all the logical fallacies you are scoring, but add self-contradiction: "Relying on a formal authority is the foundation of logical, even rational argument," followed by "...authoritative definition may plausibly be incorrect." No wonder you don't think Identity is an axiom. You just make it too easy for me.Something tells me you wouldn't know epistemology from the residue in a freshly used urinal, but the retarded and "handicapped" DO possess a rational faculty, although in varying degrees, and their rights are in fact delimited to the extent of their mental capacity, which is exactly what one would predict if man's rights are logically derived from his nature as the rational animal. Fetuses do not have any such capacity.When I read, "Consciousness is not an axiom. You do KNOW what an axiom is, don't YOU?" [emphasis mine], I almost fell on the floor with laughter. That target is so easy to hit, I won't bother shooting at it. That was even funnier to me than your bit about high school biology supporting your case.You are obviously completely philosophically uninitiated, so I could have a lot of fun here. Let's try this one. You admit that Existence is "an" axiom, Identity is not, but that Truth and Fact are the "fundamental" axioms. If Existence is not fundamental, and existents don't possess Identity, then what exactly is true or factual? The description of things which are not what they are, which you do not even know exist until you they have been proven factual and true? LOL
