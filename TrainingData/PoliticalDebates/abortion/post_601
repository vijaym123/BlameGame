I agree that personhood is the issue far more than "when does life begin."  My personal sense is that "personhood" comes at the point when a fetus would be capable of survival outside the uterus, albeit with whatever medical interventions were necessary.  Thus, the onset of "personhood" will fluctuate based upon existing technologies for sustain the life of the fetus outside the uterus.  Currently the limit would be somewhere between 21-23 weeks.  I suspect that this will change over the next few decades, allowing fetuses at lesser and lesser weeks of gestation to be sustained outside the uterus.  Once a fetus is capable of being sustained outside the uterus, I would consider it to have independent life, and therefore, personhood, including the right to not be terminated.  If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end.  Until then, it would seem to me that a declaration of personhood would have to take into consideration the rights of the mother whose body is carrying the pregnancy.  I do not believe that any pregnancy should be terminated once it has reached a point where the fetus would be viable outside the uterus, unless the mother's life or health is at serious risk and the fetus cannot be safely removed without further risk to the mother.  If a fetus is not viable, however, including for reasons such as anencephaly, then the continuation of the pregnancy should be at the mother's discretion.
