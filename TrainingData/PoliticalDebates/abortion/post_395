"That's what   abortion   would be, if the fetus were a person"You assume this without any arguments, when this is the very point we must discuss to accept any kind of abortion or not at all.The big question here is this: Since   science   as proved that the life of every   baby   begins at some point before birth (and there you have the countless premature   babies   to prove it), when does this new human life begins to exist?" and the other question: Since all newborn babies are entitled to the right to life what are the "properties" that make them human persons and that fetus don't?What is necessary here is to use all available knowledge of science, phylosophy and any subject available to give an answer to those two questions. And with the best answers we can obtain with the knowledge we have nowadays to decide first weather abortion should be morally accepted and seconddly if abortion should be   legal   or not.
