I read through all the polls and basically there is no clear majority for one extreme or the other which is exactly why I said the majority has more wiggle room. The only way repealing the MCP could not be seen as being in consonance with the will of the majority is if the default is given to one side or the other in the case of an equal split. When the MCP was legislated, it created a false majority for the pro life side by having their views be the default opinion representing the citizens of this country. Repealing the MCP just puts things back to where they should be: no legislative bias for either side. Now, international groups from both sides of the issue can fairly petition for some of this aid.
