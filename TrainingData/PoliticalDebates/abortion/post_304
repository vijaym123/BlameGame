Traveling down the Hitlerian road, now, are we? Since there is very little in the way of DNA differences between chimps and humans, 0.8% difference in sequence identity, and there is a .2% average difference between whites and blacks, does that mean that blacks have a sub-white status? Or do we bring apes into the inalienable individual rights fold? Tell me, please, what is the cutoff number?Biologically, DNA is only half the story. A LOT of unique things have to happen inside a cell and modifications must be made TO its DNA in order for a fertilized egg to even develop into a fetus, so don't call on biology to help you with this argument. A scientist will merely shrug and tell you that what defines a species is reproductive isolation - not DNA.Merely having human DNA does not make a fetus a person. DNA may be a precondition of an organism, but it is not fundamental to this discussion. What is fundamental is the actual nature of the entity involved. A fetus is not a person.
