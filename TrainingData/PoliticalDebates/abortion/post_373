Huh?Are you suggesting that women don't enjoy exercising their reproductive capacity and desire sexually competent men to Make Love with? You could be an exception and from an outdated group of "persons" carrying what is know as feministic attitudes. With my age group, that is so gone, and we are so much together on a common ground.Why am I not surprised that it's all men's fault here? speaking of control..wouldn't you just love to be in control over every man's sex?. I hope thought that the time does come that you feel equal like the Ladies that I know do.How many abortions are in fact a result of rape and not just a form of birth control or philosophical defiance?
