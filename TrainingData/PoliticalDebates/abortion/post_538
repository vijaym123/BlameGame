If your mother had aborted you, like nature probably did to a dozen or so other fertilized eggs before you, you would have never known. The states don't get to vote on every issue, get over it. Just imagine that we left slavery and jim crow laws up to the states! "Life is life whether we believe in it or not."what does that mean? that no matter what the facts turn out to be you will deny reality and leave your opinion to be guided by this "belief"? And what if you were born in a country that had no restrictions on   abortion   whatsoever, then you would believe that way. How unfortunate that decisions in life are made because of the geographical location where one is born. Thinking, examining, and reflecting are worthy things to do during one's life.
