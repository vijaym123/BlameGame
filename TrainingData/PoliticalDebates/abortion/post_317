My error?  I never said anything about chromosomes, nor mentioned anything about a whole fetus or a whole human as being a body part.  If the government has a right to govern a woman's womb (a part of her body... as in... body part), you do no retain the right to any of your body parts.    You do not retain the right to you bone marrow, nor your blood, nor one of your kidneys, as those things don't belong to you. They can be taken at will whenever the need arises because the use will save a life.   Where you get this retarded analogy of shooting me with your hand, I'm not quite sure.  And that's a very good point.   If the government has the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her womb, then the government also has the right to tell a man what he can and cannot do with his sperm.  If the government wants it - they'll get it because you no longer retain the rights to whatever your body produces, or sustains.  The same for the eggs of the same woman.  The very point of dependency IS the umbilical cord.  You nor I are dependent for life upon anyone else.  If we cannot survive because we are too stupid to know what to do - that is our own fault.  I do not depend upon someone else to breathe for me, feed me, keep me warm, etc. You do not depend upon anyone else for the same things.  If someone wanted to attach themselves to you for nine months in order to live, you have every right to say "Thank you, but no."        The rights to your body parts are immutable. This doesn't mean you can do whatever you want to with your hands.  It means no one can take it away from you.  It doesn't mean you can spit on whomever you want to, it means no one can demand that you give them your spit or face jail and fines.  It means no one can take your bone marrow from you. It means you are not responsible for giving blood.  It means you do not HAVE to give your Aunt Judy a kidney nor anyone else for that matter.  It doesn't matter if someone else will live or die based on your choice.  YOU have the immutable right to your body.   It may be crappy that a person (or a potential person) will "die"  or just not live because you choose to retain your rights, but fortunately for you - and everyone else - you have those rights.    The rights to my womb and vagina are immutable.  The rights to you testicals and what goes on in there are immutable.  If you say that because a life is at stake that a woman does not have the right to her body or any of its parts, you say our bodies are not our own.   In which case - I you had better be registered and prepared to donate your bone marrow, and your kidney.  You should have a living will that gives away your eyes, and your heart and whatever else is salvageable in the event you're made brain dead, or it's clear you won't live.   Since you seem to be so big on this "life" thing, and the idea that our body parts do not belong to our own selves.
