Using your 'logic' then every woman of child bearing age must be constantly pregnant because not fertilizing every one of her developed eggs would mean the 'death' of a potential human being or that every man's ejaculate should be preserved because each sperm could result in a 'potential' human.Again, this issue will never be resolved because I don't consider   abortion   'murder'.  To me an embryo is a potential person but the woman IS the person therefor her rights and her health are paramount. End of discussion.  Don't believe in abortion...don't have one.
