Hi,First of all after reading all the comments on this page we can agree that everybody aknowledge that the only answer to When does life begins (or more accurately as tbcass said When does the beginning of human development start) it's at conception.Now about personhood vs humanity.  To try and separate these terms has already been done several times in the past: in Nazi Germany the Jews were stripped of their personhood. In America, the native american and the african american were too stripped of their personhood. If you look in any dictionary the definition of personhood is: a human being. What you suggest here is that, based upon actual technology a human being has to be considered a "person" with all the rights that all other human beings have including the one fundamental right to life, a fetus get these rights when he's able to survive outside the womb.Let me ask you some questions:What about babies? Don't they also depend on his mother for sustaining (just as the fetus depends on the mother on this one thing). and what about old people who can't care of themselves?How did the fetus got into the mother's womb?, Was it the holy spirit or a consequence of her acts (ok, except raping)? We could say that the inconvenience is a direct consequence of her adult decision.Since when an inconvenience (of any kind, i can think of a lot worse than just being pregnant) can justify the "right to not be terminated" (killing) of a human being.Humanity does not depend on where (womb, house, car), how developped or how big (embryo, foetus, baby, toadler, adult), or how dependent we are, humanity starts when the genetic code of a man and a woman unite to form a new and unique kind of the homo sapiens sapiens specie.Any voluntarily interruption at any stage of the developpement of that human is by definition a homocide.Last thought about your :"If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end" This is even scarier that what i saw in Matrix.
