This is excellent. Saint Thomas used the concept of substance and accidents to explain this phenomenon. These are Philosophic concepts not   religious  .The analogy with the fetus is clear: the substance is that a fetus is a human being. the accident is that a fetus in a determined moment is more or less developed, but these are differences in accidents never of substance or kind.As you can see the belief that a fetus is a human being are justified by the same philosophic concepts used to explain the transubstantiation. No   religion   there.
