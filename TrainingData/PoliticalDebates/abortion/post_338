The bottom line in this debate is this:  A woman is housing the fetus. Whether or not that fetus has rights is immaterial....  the right of the woman to do with Her body as she wishes is the ultimate right.To say that the fetus has right to life is debatable, but without the woman that fetus would have no life at all.  It is her body sustaining it.If we give the right to govern our own bodies to other people, what would prevent these governing bodies from making choices that you don't agree with concerning your body parts?  There are thousands of children who have a right to life dying at this very moment from the lack of functioning kidneys.   If we had the right to tell a woman what to do with her womb, why would we not have the right to demand a kidney from a man? or a woman?  To do so would violate the man or woman's right to his or her own body, but it would save a life... and this is supposedly a justifiable reason to make such demands.Similarly, thousands of children are in need of bone marrow.  If women lose the right to govern their wombs, where is the protection of the right to govern our bone marrow?   The same reasons given to justify the "anti-choice" (or, "  pro-life  ) argument are the same reasons that would make it legal to force individuals to not only register for the bone marrow transplant list, but to give one's bone marrow to the person in need of it.    Bottom line:  The right to the self is immutable, despite the most passionate objections to what another chooses to do with one's self.
