Why wait for the Supreme Court to rule again.  Many/most abortions are chosen because of financial reasons.  So, all ye who are against   abortion  , sell your home, move into a little trailer with a couple of roommates to save   money  . Then drive over to an abortion provider and offer to PAY women to not have abortions.  $500 a month would make many NOT have an abortion.  Put all your money in a trust for the mom and baby. $500 a month for 18 years will probably make fewer abortions.  "But wait," you say, "she might not spend the money on the child?" I'm ok with someone choosing an abortion.  You won't trust her with your money but you want me to trust her with a baby?  That doesn't make sense.  Oh, you can offer to open up your home to a woman who needs a place to live. Many women live in difficult,  potentially dangerous situations.  Some do not want to bring another human into that situation, so if she knew she could live someplace better, she might not choose to have an abortion.  "But wait," you say. "She might be crazy, or steal from you, or bring home a series of dangerous boyfriends."  At least you can run out of your house or dial 911. Remember, that infant cannot call for help, not for years and years.The anti-abortion folks believe the right to life begins at conception and ends at birth.
