A fetus is not yet a child. It is the product of the woman's body despite itbeing viable future offspring. And although males have a stake in thiscreation of life they are not the ones who have to take the risks of bearingchildren. Pregnancy is a very risky situation for women and I think thepro-life camp takes this very lightly. Women are responsible for bringinglife into this world, however that responsibility falls into each and everyoneof their hands. Every woman should have the right to decide what's bestfor her health. After all it's her body and not yours.
