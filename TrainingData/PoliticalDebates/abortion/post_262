Babies ARE part of the mother.  They are part of "her" body.  Saying otherwise is ridiculous.  Where does the baby receive life?  From the mother giving it life by letting it live off of her food, water, blood, etc.  Does everyone make wrong decisions?  Yes.  But if a man decides to make a poor decision by having unprotected sex with a woman, he can leave.  Now this woman has part of a man in her that she doesn't want as well as no father to bring it into this world.  Why does she have to suffer due to someone else being a coward?  The government is not going to pay her enough to properly feed herself and take care of the baby before she can birth it to give to adoption.  Unless the government says "Here's maternity pay at the rate you were receiving prior to your pregnancy as well as free food for the baby," why should she pay for this?  It should be up to her to decide.
