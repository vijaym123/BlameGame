Is somewhat questionable--Whether we can apply what's in an embryology textbook to be scientific fact--probably not.Yes, there is A textbook called "The developing human: Clinically-Oriented Embryology" that states "a zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo)." This does not answer the question of "what is a human being" or "at which point should a cell philosophically, politically, theologically be considered a human being." It's an example of one scientist saying what they think.
