then one needs to consider all those questions before you lay down and have unprotected sex. sexual awareness is becoming more and more prominent. on the other hand, i think that most would agree that there are extenuating circumstances. ie: rape, or if the birth itself would place the mother in danger. but, it should not be a cop out for a night of bad decisions. i also think the fathers should be given more of a choice when it comes to   abortion  . not all father's are dead beats, and some would love the opportunity. in many cases this is taken from them. it is just as emotionally traumatizing for some men. where's the fairness in that. woman don't want us telling them what they can and can't do with there body's. well, start considering the fathers a little.
