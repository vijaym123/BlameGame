You simply restate your opinion that a new member of the species is created at conception. I disagree. These are opinions.I see a good analogy between an   abortion   to save a woman's life, and a nuclear bomb to save a way of life. The scale of the tragedy is very different, as is the scale of counterbalanced benefit. These are lesser-of-two-evils decisions. We do intentionally kill innocent civilians, even now in Afghanistan. We regret the necessity of the larger war. We feel sorry for the innocent lives lost. We fervently hope that none of the casualties, this time, are completely innocent. We know they will die, but we launch the weapon anyway. Rules of war just require that we try to limit the deaths of innocents.Nobody is killing an innocent fetus out of hatred for the fetus. We are talking about compassion for the woman, who is undoubtedly a fully realized human being and may also be innocent.
