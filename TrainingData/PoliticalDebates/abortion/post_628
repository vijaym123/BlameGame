Most in the "Conservative" community will favor banning   abortion  , yet call for the end of the welfare state.  ....As if the child has any sort of say in the crappy lifestyle choices of the parents.  As if the life that is so valuable inside the womb has suddenly become none of their concern.   I've always found that a bit odd.    The very idea that a "Christian" can be in favor of putting anyone to death is absurd.  The whole view of Christianity is to turn the other cheek.  It is denying that "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" is valid.
