I can only empathize with people who have to deal with secular problems with a religious foundation. Since our institutions and laws are completely (to the best of their ability) secular how should a religious person act? All I say is I'm glad I don't have to deal with those contradictions I can make decisions with no moral conflicts. Atheism is great.
