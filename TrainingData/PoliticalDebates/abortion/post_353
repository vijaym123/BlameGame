From CanadaThe Roe vs Wade decision said that founding fathers/people who made the constitution had a intention to say the fetus is not a human being and future Americans can never say its a human being.The Roe decision is based on the sole foundation the fetus is not a human being.This was the error of roe.Not liberal, activist Judges as such. Though motives are involved.Roe literally tries to say a very Protestant Christian British population created a constitution where  then and later legislatures could not vote that the fetus is a human being.Therefore the old ones intended the people of the future could not change their minds about the fetus and that at the creation of the constitution they believe the fetus was not a human being.This ia an absurdity.Such a early religious people never would put in their ultimate collection of rights the denial that a fetus has no soul and is not human until birth.They never had such a intent.They never would of agreed to such two concepts.Roe tries to stop the people from voting up or down   abortion  .Roe says abortion was settled hundreds of years ago.Roe admits there is no final conclusion on the humanity of the fetus.Roe concludes the fetus is not a human being.Roe hints a common opinion that the fetus is a human being could find its place in the constitution apparently nullifying a right to abortion. The right seems conditional.Roe was a careless opinion and carelessly allowed to exist because of the pro-abortion beliefs of the layers generally.Destroying Roe's legal credibility is not a big problem. pro-lifers just need better lawyers acting in these small circles.
