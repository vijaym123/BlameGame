Yes, because abortion being illegal is about as useful as making masterbation illegal,both are impossible to impose,and both kill an equal number of potential little lives,actually masterbation kills way more if you're a dude, but I'm not here for semantics... this time.So at the very least making it legal in the case of rape (yeah, we all knew what you meant, funny wording though) there's an opening for some future logical debate on the topic.Of course you would just have hordes of chicks describing mythical rape seens in dark alleys just to get the procedure. And yet again, not a single abortion would have been stopped.
