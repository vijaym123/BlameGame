Human life is a continuum that does not start and stop at conception. George Carlin, comedian - "People say 'life begins at conception.' I say life began about a billion years ago and it's a continuous process."[9] Therefore, you can't call a fetus something other than life; it is part of the long continuum of human life and must be fully respected as such.
