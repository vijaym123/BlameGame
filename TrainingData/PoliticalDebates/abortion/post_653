Hiding behind the various religious beliefs regarding the beginning of life just evades the question.As a scientific fact, at conception a new human life is created.  Are we going to permit that life to be destroyed?  If so, will there be a certain point where we will no longer allow it to be destroyed?The answers to these questions determine what type of a society we will be. Unfortunately, the United States Supreme Court took the issue away from society and decided an unborn human being can be terminated at any point prior to birth.  A great deal of the divisiveness in the   abortion   issue stems from the fact that the answers to those questions were mandated by the Court, not resolved through the political process.
