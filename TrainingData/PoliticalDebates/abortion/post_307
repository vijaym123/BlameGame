You're the one who's claiming body parts as criteria, as per your question of ancephalics, who are recognized as human beings (even you would, if you'd let 'em live long enough), I never did.I've never changed any criteria for humanity (to say that it no longer was), I've elaborated, and suggested additional criterion, always stating that it's unwise to restrict one's basis for humanity to any particular criteria (plural form intended).I still maintain that DNA is a major factor for determining humanity, though you'd know that if you'd even read my last post, I clarify my position that DNA may be essential (depending upon whether there is any truly distinctive set of genes for humanity), but parentage certainly is, as per all known empirical evidence, like produces like.You have yet to invalidate any of my arguments; you haven't even given a source for your percentages, which are highly unbelievable.I have yet to contradict myself, and you have yet to say anything substantial.By the way, if you look at a fetus, it does look like a human being, except for size and development, in fact the distinguishing characteristic of a fetus is that it has the "basic structural plan of its kind" - Webster's - which means all bones, organs, and tissues, whether functional or otherwise.
