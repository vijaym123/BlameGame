When the Pope speaks definitively on fiath and morals, it is infallible.  Many things have been declared infallible since 1870.  The teaching barring birth control is one example. It was definitively declared by Pope Paul VI in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, which was written specifically for that purpose.  Pope John Paul II wrote the encyclical Evangelium Vitae for a similar purpose--the bishops had asked him to clarify/codify Catholic teaching regarding life issues such as abortion and euthanasia.  The Church's anti-abortion stance was also clearly published in the Catechism of the Catholic Church which is approved and released by the Vatican undr the direction of Pope John Paul II to clearly lay out that which the Chiurch considers to be core Catholic teachings.  The Church's teaching against abortion is indeed infallible.  You are correct in your understanding of what constitutes an infallible statement in regard to codifying as doctrine matters of traditional belief, such as the Assumption of Mary.  But definitive statements from the Pope in regard to issues of faith and morals also morally obligate all Catholics and are both infallible and unchangable.
