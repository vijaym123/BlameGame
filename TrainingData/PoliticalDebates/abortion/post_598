Just because you can't nail down the exact time of personhood doesn't mean to can't say it's "sometime after this point" or "sometime before that point". I won't speak for the earlier poster, but I would argue that it's sometime after the brain begins to develop, and sometime around or before self-awareness. That is not to say there is no value in an entity during other time-frames, but that the value is not that of a "person".
