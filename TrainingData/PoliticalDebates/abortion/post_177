I disagree with your basic premise that God causes spontaneous abortions, but will accept it for the purpose of responding to your comment.The problem with your line of reasoning is demonstrated by applying it to other "Acts of God."  People are killed all the time by natural disasters.  That does not make it okay for human beings to kill other innocent human beings.
