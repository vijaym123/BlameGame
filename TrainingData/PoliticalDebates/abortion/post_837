I would carry the old man while the old man carries the baby and I'll die trying saving them both.the essence of life is not in who gets to live or who gets to die but the worth of each life both older and younger. you know what, ...it's that kind of line of thinking that brought about the the Holocaust and the killing of the lame, blind and old in Uganda and similar shameful acts around the world in different countries at different times in history when all kind of lunatic tyrants arose. nothing personal I'm just against that line of thinking. once you think one human is more important than the other when it comes to life and death, ...there is no stopping you. ...there is no limit to all kinds of wrong decisions you can make just to favor the strong and healthy and more intelligent and more able. abortion is wrong. at the moment of conception that's human life at it's weakest point if just a ball of cells, .....if that's how you'd like to put it, ....like I said you don't have the right to kill a human life just because it's hardly human. in case of rape, women are facing the hardest decisions and they need all our supports as much as we can give.but if that unborn child could talk and was shown his/her case scenario in his/her conception do you think it will be even easier for him/her. rape is the most vile disgusting way to strip a woman of her dignity and I feel for them especially when the child is growing inside of them. but it's not more the less easier for the child too. he/she did not choose to come into the world through such an act and I think if he/she grows up and learns that's how she/he was conceived, she/he will feel humiliation probably for the rest of her life but never the less she/he will need support from understanding humans surrounding. rape is an act to be completely condemned and eliminated, but we shouldn't make rash decisions when more than two lives are involved. ....
