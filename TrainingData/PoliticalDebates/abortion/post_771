You are confusing me. Are you saying that men don't have the right to be pro life? Or that men don't ever have a say at the choice of abortion? Or that men should not be able to vote on if it should be a law? What is it?What if I get married and my wife gets pregnant and she decides that she wants an abortion(Not that I would marry a woman that doesn't want kids). Don't I have a say? Isn't it my kid to?
