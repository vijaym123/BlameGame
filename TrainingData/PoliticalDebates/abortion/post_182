There is an inherent moral conflict in the   abortion   issue, even if you are an atheist.The scientific fact is that a new human life is created at the moment of conception.  A distinct human being has been created.  The issue then becomes what do you do about that fact?If you are an atheist like Camille Paglia, you conclude that abortion is the taking of a human life, but feel there are countervailing interests that make it necessary to allow abortion.On the other hand, an atheist like Nat Hentoff vehemently opposes abortion.I do not know what type of atheist you are, but clearly abortion is not a simple issue for atheists.
