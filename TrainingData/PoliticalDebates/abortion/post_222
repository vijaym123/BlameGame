Let me first just thank for a highly repetitive post, with pretty much 1 reason you couldn't vote for Obama. Who then, can you vote for?  None of these men - and none of the women - hold Christian values.  Oh there's lip service... but then, most people who claim to be Christian do little but go to church.  So voting based on your religious views is sillier than believing in the tooth fairy.  Let me just point out to you that Obama's plans as a whole are decidedly more in line with the ideals of Christ.   And indeed, if the whole of the Congress voted according to their Christianity which they claim to express there would be no Iraq war, nothing in Afghanistan, universal health care, free food for the homeless, shelters, and so on and so forth.  Things McCain is dead set against - as are most Republicans.  Yet giving to those who have nothing, and shunning the materialistic impulses are Christian values. Speaking of Christian values, is this why the Vatican is so rich?  Because it's money that gets you into heaven?  Or the way you vote?Or maybe it's your own individual actions....  Because the only reason you can come up as to not vote for Obama as a opposed to McCain was   abortion  .  Because that's the one issue that would help more people.  Good job.  Obama won... and this probably upset you because of the ONE reason you could think of.
