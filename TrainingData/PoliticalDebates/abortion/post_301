"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." - Declaration of IndependenceI cite this since I'm assuming we're talking about American Law, and to note that this inherrently axiomatic assumption by the 'Founding Fathers' is why this wasn't addressed in the Bill of Rights or the Constitution.  On a side note: the existence of a Creator is herein considered the basis for all American law, and therefore the lack of consideration (or abolition thereof) removes any premise to consider any right of anything whatsoever (including 'choice').From high school biology, the cell is the fundamental unit of life; if there exists a living cell (whether whole or otherwise), there exists life.  The distinguishing factor between humans and everything else, if nothing else, is our DNA.  Human DNA is unique and quite distinctive; as is generally phenotypically (according to looks) obvious.As was stated before; the presence (or lack thereof) of appendages or other parts (eyes, ears, etc.) is irrelevant and arbitrary; otherwise we could justify the murder of the legless.  Therefore it is likewise irrelevant in qualifying a human being for fundamental rights (in this case, life).
