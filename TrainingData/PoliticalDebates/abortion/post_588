That a fetus is a living specimen of the human species is non debatable.  It is as close to proven as science is able to get.  (I qualify that statement because science can't even prove we're all here)We do not intentionally kill innocent civilians in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Sometimes it happens, whether because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time, there is a mistake, or the enemy intentionally uses them as human shields, but never intentionally.  Sometimes it would be beneficial to intentionally kill innocent civilians (read Lone Survivor) but we do not, as a matter of policy.  Sometimes, individuals do, but they are swiftly and harshly dealt with.  if you don't believe the media or whatever for whatever reason, you can trust me.  While I haven't been over there, (yet) I have friends who have.  They all tell the same story.  Your slander of the U.S. military is repulsive and is misleading in the debate.  Rules of war require that intentional killing of innocents be met with court martials, dishonorable discharges, and severe sentences at the least and war crimes charges at the most.  You're right, nobody is killing an innocent fetus out of hatred for the fetus, but that almost makes it more disturbing.  Except for in cases in which the woman's life is in danger, they are being killed for convenience, like a dog than nobody wants anymore, except that they require dogs be put down gently.  Fetuses often writhe in pain as they are doused in chemicals, or struggle to escape the hose as they are ripped limb from limb by a vacuum.
