Betty, your argument dismisses the fact that the unborn fetus is a separate life entity. The decision to have an   abortion   is a decision to terminate not the mother's life but the life of the fetus within. You are arguing for the right to terminate someone else's life.With that said, there are many reasons why a pregnancy should not continue. Certainly when the health of the mother is at risk is one of them. If the pregnancy is as a result of rape or incest is another. And finally, like it or not, sometimes accidents happen.The problem society has is it can't seem to understand the concept of compromise. It's always an all or nothing deal. Either we don't allow abortions at all, or we allow abortion at any stage of development for any reason. But I truly believe the answer is one of compromise. During the first trimester abortion should be universally allowed. During the third trimester abortion should only be allowed to protect the health of the baby. Abortions during the second trimester should be allowed, but should be somewhat restricted (i.e., perhaps require the father's permission, or require counseling first.. something that forces the decision to be carefully reviewed, but still allow for it).It is a slippery slope, and finding the right balance is not easy. I, for one, would never ask a rape victim to carry the results of that rape. But I can never done legalizing the murder of a baby that is, in most cases, viable outside the womb.
