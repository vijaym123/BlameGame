A little bit of this and a little bit of that....  a dash of socialism, a healthy handful of capitalism, and the passing on of taxes back to the states, sprinkling of other things....  Choosing to mix disciplines and principles will eventually lead to a government system in which a classification of one is useless, since we recognize that no one classification will work alone.    To work toward the creation of a more perfect union! YES!    That's why it's probably best if you discard these nonsensical labels of Conservative and Liberal.  Most people don't even know what those mean anymore, they've become so distorted.  Ever notice the hostility you automatically transpose onto so-called "Liberals"?   People hate this name "SocialistBetty"...  make completely irrelevant comments about it.   ...which is why I chose it. Because I'm evil like that.  But more to expose how people really feel about things without having to dig very much.  I share more of the true values of conservatism (old-school) than I do socialism.  Although socialism has nice aspects to it, it's like saying that Kant, as a philosopher, was completely right about everything. Um... no.   But to combine those things that do work with what Does work in capitalism... to find the "Golden Mean" and untie the Gordian knot...   it may not be possible, but our love of labels certainly isn't helping.Isn't that what we're supposed to be striving for? A more perfect union of our states?  Not getting hung up on naming ourselves as one thing and one thing only?
