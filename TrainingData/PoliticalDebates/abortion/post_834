"I am Catholic and I believe that all human life is sacred whether it is one day old baby or an 80 year old man."Okay first of all we are talking about laws so your religion is irrelevant don't even say the words Catholic, god, or sacred in a debate about laws or you are automatically incorrect. Just bear with me for a moment I see I have to hold your hand to get you see this.I understand you think life is really important. I agree. But let's play along with this hypothetical situation just for a moment. You are a fire fighter. You are in a burning building and you have evacuated everyone but an 80 year old feeble man and a child. You are the last fire fighter in the building and the building is moments from coming down. You know you cannot come back for a second trip. Do you choose to save one and leave the other to die?
