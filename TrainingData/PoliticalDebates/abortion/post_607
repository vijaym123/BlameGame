You have a very cold view of the rights of a rape victim.  As to your other views, I do not believe that a fetus should have the rights of a fully-developed human being until it's systems are able to function independently outside the uterus (not get it's own bottle and change it's own diaper, but simply breathe oxygen, process food and eliminate waste independently, without reliance on its mother's body to do these things FOR it.  As long as it is fully reliant upon her body to carry out these processes and incapable of doing so on its own, it is functionally a PART of her body, and her rights supercede its rights.According to YOUR model, the rights of the fetus TAKE PRECEDENCE over the rights of the mother.  According to your model, the woman who becomes pregnant CEASES to have human rights until a baby is delivered or the pregnancy spontaneously aborts.  Why should the fetus have MORE rights than the fully-developed independent human being in whose body it resides?  This is a situation in which the rights of one being will HAVE to supercede the rights of another.  Whether the rights of the fetus supercede those of the mother, or the rights of the mother supercede those of the fetus is the question, at its heart.  Therefore, since only one of the two is capable of surviving independently of the other, the reasonable choice would seem to be that the individual capable of independent survival has the right to do so.  Since the fetus cannot survive without taking over the body of the mother and without forcing her to forego her rights to function as she chooses and to medically control her own body, the fetus has fewer rights than the mother.
