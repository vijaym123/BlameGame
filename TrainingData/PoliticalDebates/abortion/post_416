I still don't agree that it should be legal until the third month, because it's still a living thing, the mother is eating, sleeping, LIVING for the baby, until it can do it on it's own.BUT I do agree with you on this "a fetus is a human and deserves all the rights of a 1 year old, 10 year old, and 100 year old."i agree, that's true.
