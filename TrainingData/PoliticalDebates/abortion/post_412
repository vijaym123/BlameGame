To pretend that the poster above you who disagrees with you does not exist, after you have just responded to her, indicates that you have substantially broken with reality. To pretend that everyone is on the "same page" as you regarding abortion is proof of it.I will let you guess as to the clinical term for this condition.You object to a pregnant woman's opinion as non-objective, then demand that your own opinion, that a fetus is a human deserving of the rights of a 10-year-old, get treated as an objective fact. Then you wonder which authority's opinion establishes reality. But no one's opinion establishes reality. Reality exists independently of human opinion, and reason is our only tool to understand it.And reason is clear on this issue. There is no humanity of a fetus to discuss because a fetus is not a person. You cannot offer any rational, logical, secular evidence that a fetus is a person, because there is none. There can be no evidence for that which does not exist.
