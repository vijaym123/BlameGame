It is amazing to see how the advances in embryology since the mid-70s have required   pro-choice   Catholics to rely upon doctrines like quickening and ensouling in order to justify their position.  Instead of addressing the question of when life begins, they choose to address a religious question -- "When does someone receive a soul?"  Not surprisingly, they conclude that there is not a consensus answer.  Uncertainty is bliss.However, the issue of when human life begins is a scientific one.  At the moment of conception, a distinct human life is created.  An individual member of our species, with his or her own DNA, has come into existence.  That life may be cut short before birth because of miscarriage or abortion, but the life is a human one.  It is not going to be a puppy.  It is not going to be a pony.  It is going to be a baby.Evading the fact that life begins at conception may let people like Mr. O'Brien sleep better at night, but it is intellectually dishonest.  I actually have more respect for people like the feminist writer Camille Paglia, who is honest enough to admit that abortion takes a human life, but feels that countervailing interests mandate that we allow the practice to exist.
