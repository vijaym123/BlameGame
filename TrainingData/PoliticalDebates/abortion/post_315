I posted below. Perhaps you didn't read  it.  The issue is not when life begins, or if there is a life at all.  The issue has to do with right of the individual to retain the right to her body.  Simply because there is another life involved doesn't resolve this issue.  If it is such a poverty that a child must die so that you may live as you wish, I would just be curious to know which child you donated your kidney to.  Or how many times you've given bone marrow so that a child may live who would otherwise die.  If you say that the government has the right to decide what to do with your body parts, you would be forced into giving away a kidney so that another might live.  If you say the government has a right to decide what you with your body parts you would be forced to endure the painful process of bone marrow transplant.  While it is indeed a sad fact that   abortion   occurs, it's only logical to say we cannot make the choice for a woman in regards to her womb.  We cannot govern another's body parts based on emotional appeals.  We cannot govern your kidney or my bone marrow based on emotional appeals that doing so will save lives.   Our bodies are ours completely.     A fetus, zygote, baby, etc. depends upon another human for life.  That woman has right to govern her body.
