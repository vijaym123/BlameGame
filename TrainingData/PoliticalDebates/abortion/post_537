robbyjohn said "Sid, you say you don't know when life begins, but you do know it's not at conception..??? Which is it? you don't know but you do know? Life is life whether we believe in it or not."I don't see the problem.  They're separate questions.  Does life begin at conception?  No.  Does life begin at birth?  I don't know..maybe. Does life begin in the 30th week of gestation?  I don't know...maybe.  My point is that the beginning of life cannot be defined by means of oversimplified developmental stages, like conception or birth, or by arbitrary physiological criteria like heartbeat.  Human life must be defined functionally, based on the acquisition of higher order consciousness/awareness, which are hallmarks of the human mind, and essential characteristics of human beings vs. other animals.  At this point, those concepts are strictly philosophical since science cannot even define them clearly, let alone state with certainty when they begin.  I realize this is a hot-button issue, especially in view of the deep religious views of most Americans. I also realize that it is psychologically satisfying to have simple black-and-white answers to important issues. But this does not justify sweeping, blanket pronouncements by either side in the absence of supporting facts.  I'm afraid we just have to live with the uncertainty, and keep our laws flexible enough to accommodate it.  Sid
