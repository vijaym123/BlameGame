I am not against all abortions. I am against human abortions. I don't care if trees or chickens are aborted by their mothers (wich by the way no animal specie do). The point in this debate is Humanity. Because all our laws place the highest value on human life. Since we know that life does not begin at birth but at conception we must defend every human being from the moment it comes into being. Without life no other rights are available to anyone.
