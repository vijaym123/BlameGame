You said a fetus is not a human, but gave no support for that opinion.  What defines a human?If 'it can feel "pain," have a heartbeat, or have "brainwaves"' does that not mean is it something different than a mass of tissue that cannot?There must be some scientific / logical / medical / criteria we can use to determine this.
