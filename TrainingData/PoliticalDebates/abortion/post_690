We can all agree that a fertilized egg is alive. But so also is an unfertilized egg or a sperm. They're not dead, and they're not inanimate objects like a stone. Almost every cell in my body is alive. Life began eons ago, and continues uninterrupted from one generation to the next. So we're not talking about the beginning of life, but the beginning of a particular living individual.Genetically, we could say that a new individual begins when a new combination of genes emerges. This happens whenever an egg or a sperm is formed, and it happens again when an egg combines with a sperm. The latter combination usually lasts longer than the former, but does that make it the only beginning of an individual?And when a fertilized egg divides into two identical twins with no change in genetic profile, are they both still the same individual as was the original cell? If not -- if identical twins are different individuals, then unique genetics must not be the definition of a unique individual. So what is the significance of the fertilization of an egg? Maybe a fertilzed egg is just a potential human being, or dog, or whatever, in the same way that a sperm or unfertilized egg is. Maybe it's the development of a functioning, thinking brain with a unique mind that constitutes the beginning of an individual. That seems to make sense.The religious, of course, substitute the word "soul" for "mind," and they speculate blindly about when the soul is assigned to the body, having absolutely no information on the subject. Interestingly, as well, I believe they tend to conceive of the soul as much more mature than the rudimentary single-cell body it supposedly inhabits, capable from the beginning of self-awareness and thought and probably a love of God. That's why killing a brainless single cell is repulsive to them. It really is just a religious issue.
