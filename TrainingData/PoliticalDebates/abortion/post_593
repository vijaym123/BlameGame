The sperm and egg have DNA patterns from the parents.  It is the combination of the DNA patterns that creates a new person.  Sperm by itself does not become a new life.  An egg by itself does not become a new life.  You combine the two and you have a new life.  A new person will come into the world in nine months as long as nothing happens to the unborn child during that period.
