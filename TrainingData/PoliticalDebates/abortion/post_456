I say government and church's have no right to interfere in a woman's choice about her own body..Only she knows what is best for her and her situation and being forced to give birth to a child changes a mothers life forever, rather it be a choice to keep the child or give that child up for adoption.and most unwanted pregnancies are the burden of poor women who don't either can't care for them properly or she was a victim of rape or incest and no way should she be forced to have that child.....A person I feel has a better chance to get over an abortion then to have a child they give up and wonder the rest of their life where and how that child is......I say as long as it is very early in the pregnancy, abortion should be an option available to all women and decided between her, her doctor and if involved the father of that fetus....that is my stand.....
