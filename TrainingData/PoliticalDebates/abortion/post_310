Funny that you should be using metaphysics in an argument; but thanks for making my point: dependence isn't a criteria for life, humanity, or lack thereof.Okay, good, so who cares about pig embryos?  In other words, a fetus and an embryo are both living beings; more specifically we're talking about HUMAN embryos and fetuses, and thus HUMAN beings, and therefore we are talking about persons, the plural of which is people.  Thank you once again for making my case.Now, I believe you are confusing this argument with arguments for existence in which the burden of proof is logically one-sided.  We're not debating whether unborn human beings (persons) exist, that's already proven.  We're debating whether these beings are human or not.  You can prove whether or not they're human; I have.  Now the burden of proof still remains with you that they are not human, or not alive.  You cannot make either case, because the contrary to both of these assertions is false.
