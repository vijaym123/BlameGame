I believe owning and keeping a handgun in your home makes you liable to accidental injury or even death. So I'd like to see honest statistics showing whether owning and keeping a handgun makes you safer.This has nothing to do with the question of whether it is your right to oown a handgun.  The current   legal   opinion is that you do.  This could, of course, change. In the past, many Supreme Court decisions have been reversed.  This recent decision seems very questionable.Note that if you do have in your home a handgun, and a burglar enter, he/she will "have the drop on you".  He may not shoot you if you dont show him your gun. but he surely will if you do.So I urge you not to have a handgun.  A   sports   rifle is a different matter.I also see it as being more effective to show people that having a handgun only gives you a false sense of security.  In real life, it will not help.  This approach is likely to be more effective than trying to pass legislation, which might require changing the Constitution.GKM
