Have you actually read the newspaper? There are several cases and some that a gun prevented them from being a dead victim. I speak from experience. As for the easy access of guns, criminals would have access to guns in the black market regardless if they banned guns. Cocaine is illegal but some how people still gain access to it...well, how does that happen?
