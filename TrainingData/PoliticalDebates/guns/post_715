It is not an easy feat to be allowed a concealed weapon.  You have to be 21 years of age, go through and extensive background check, as well as other things.  Students that are too busy getting high and drinking are not going to get guns because they wouldn't be able to pass these tests.  Good people, trustworthy people, would be the ones with guns, not the idiots.  If I was in class and someone came in to shoot everyone, I would love to know that my teacher or a student that is qualified to carry a gun can save my life and I'm sure my parents would be just as glad.  If you're a parent and you think that guns on campuses are a bad thing then you should do some more research.  See what happens when a gunman brings an AK-47 to your child's classroom and then tell me that you wouldn't like a good citizen in the room with the ability to save your child's life.
