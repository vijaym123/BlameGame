"a drunk kid with a permit will get in an argument with another kid at a party and shoot them. The idea that only the most trustworthy and responsible will get permits is wishful thinking."This is the exact kind of argument the Brady Bunch uses every time there's a bill up in a state's house or a local municipality. They say "allowing people to carry in restaurants will only lead to shootouts in the restaurants and in the parking lots when someone takes a parking spot..."And yet, in the 37 states that now allow carry in restaurants that has not been the case. Their argument is based purely on fear and ignorance while the REALITY is that it is not the case. FBI statistics show that   concealed carry   contributes to an overall reduction in   crime  . One is statistics, the other is propaganda. Please don't confuse the two.
