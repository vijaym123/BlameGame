the only middle ground that the brady bunch agrees with is total and complete disarmament. criminals will always find guns! the only hope is to jail repeat offenders and keep them off the streets! punishing legal working class gun owners by confiscation will only create a bigger problem.  England pretty much disarmed their citizens and crime has skyrocketed! you are not allowed to defend yourself and are at the mercy of any criminals element. only concealed carry in 38 states allowed the crime rate to drop 20 to 30 percent. I think down deep your a boob and are afraid of guns.  where I live it takes a half and hour to get a cop to your house. if you dont defend yourself you will be history.
