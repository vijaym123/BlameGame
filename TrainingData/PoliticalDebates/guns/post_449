"Shouldn't this study have concluded that a gun in the house, when shot at somebody, is almost always used to shoot a criminal if this was true? How could   guns   be killing innocent people, even suicidal people, at such a higher rate than criminals? Suicidal people should be a minor blip in the results compared to criminal   deaths   if the NRA claims are true. But they're not."Let's see the proof. There are plenty of studies that show that guns are used far more to prevent   crime   than commit it.
