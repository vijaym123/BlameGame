So your argument against people owning guns is that since some people might make stupid mistakes then it is okay to punish everyone?With that logic we might as well ban cars because some people will get in wrecks from being bad drivers, ban alcohol because some people drink too much, and ban kitchen utensils because some people stab themselves.
