In 1991, I had 3 guys come at me in a parking lot, the only thing said was one of them muttered "just kill him", I quickley showed them a 9mm semi auto, didn't even point it at them, & they just turned around & went back into the darkness.There was not enough time or distance to unlock & get back into the car, & going around ether end of the car to escape would have only put me closer to them.I became a believer that evening, & a certified trainer the following year
