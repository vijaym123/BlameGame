You shouldn't use your schools " gun-free enviroment" as an argument. It doesn't hold much weight. When I was in school... do you know how many drug deals I saw take place in my school (and took place in...-snicker-)? Did you also know my school was (still is) a drug-free enviroment? It's quite amusing actually.....what comforts people's minds. It's the simple things. You can paint the world whatever color you want. It's still a cruel world. It's still full of thieves and murderers. You can make yourself as vulnerable as you want. I'll make myself as protected as I can.
