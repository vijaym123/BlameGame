This first link gives an overview of Mexican   gun laws  . You can see they have much tighter restrictions on the types of   guns   you can have, more steps to legally own guns, and generally restrict access to guns in general.  http://www.davekopel.com/espanol/Mexican-Gun-Laws.htm  Mexican Gun LawsThis second link shows international violent death rates, and breaks them down by gun and non-gun   deaths  . You can see that despite Mexico's tighter restrictions on guns, they have nearly triple the   homicide   rate by guns (9.88 vs. 3.72/100,000) and more than triple the total homicide rate (17.58 vs. 5.70/100,000).   http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvintl.html  While the U.S. certainly has a much higher rate than some countries with extremely strict gun laws - Japan, for example - countries like Brazil, which make it all but impossible to obtain a permit to carry a gun outside the home, have much higher gun homicide rates despite restrictions. So a simplistic look at rates without looking at other factors does not tell the whole story.
