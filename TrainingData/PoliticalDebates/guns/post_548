Get your facts straight - gang related handgun   deaths   accounted for less than 20%. Crimes of passion and against acquaintances accounted for more than 60%.The defense comment was sarcasm .... Of course hand   guns   can be removed from the population as they were in the UK through buy-back and other aggressive programs. Its the will to fix the problem that is needed. It is absurd to suggest that all citizens should pack guns to make things safe. You still haven't provided a good reason for handguns - or Uzi's (part of the sarcasm). A rifle or shotgun is respectable. The rest are stupid.
