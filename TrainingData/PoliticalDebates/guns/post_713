A gun permit has nothing to do with grenades, bombs etc. . . . lets be real.  If you are licensed and trusted to carry everywhere else in the state what is special about a school?  Either you can be trusted and pass the background check or you don't.  There is nothing magic about crossing a line onto school property that will suddenly make a licensed gun owner less responsible than he/she was off of school property.This is just another feel good rule that is costing lives again. .  .
