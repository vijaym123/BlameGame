Honest people will need the right to own guns as long as criminals have them.  A truely free society with privacy rights will find it very difficult to take them away from criminals.  When the police in Dallas Texas take 20 minutes to respond to a home invasion, the homeowner needs to be armed.  BTW:  the criminals have to guess which 1 of 10 isn't.
