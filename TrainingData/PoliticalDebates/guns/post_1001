 I defiantly think that all persons should be able to carry fire arms (one word or two ? ) I think there should be exceptions for those that have used fire arms in the commission of a violent crime.   />   /> Overall, I think that a community should let the public know that they are armed and have some sort of self policing system to deal with crime in that particular area. IE. Ted robs Glen of $500 at gunpoint, Glen calls a number that alerts local area residents, those local residents, who are "on call" respond and track down Ted. Ted is himself held at gunpoint until LEO can arrive.   />   /> In a short time the word would get out and there would be little incentive for criminal behavior in such areas.    />   /> This would also enforce another idea; the government should be afraid of the people. If the people are afraid of the government, then that is tyranny.   />   /> Keep free speech, keep the second amendment, and keep the ideas of freedom and liberty alive.  />   /> Http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tyranny  /> http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty
