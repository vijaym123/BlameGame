"...anyone who reads it knows that it means the right to keep and bear arms belongs to those who have served in militia..."Assuming that you are a citizen of the U.S., then you, personally, have served and are serving in the militia: as have everyone else.  The militia is composed of all citizens, who can be called forth in defense of the country, region or area not just for military service, but police actions also.  In addition, the militia can be called to aid in natural and/or man made disasters.In essence, the militia is the willing cooperation of free men and women who consciously choose to support and defend the society and government they have created.
