 These waffling pukes make me sick. You gonna wait on the cops to help you with the varmits breaking into your house. Hell no, you want a heater that will cool these varmits heels. Once you have a loved one raped, robbed, or murdered then you will get the root feeling of why it is better to kill the varmits. If someone breaks into my house, i am guessing they are not there to help me in some matter. Rather, they are there to hurt, steal, and rob me of my money and possessions. You wait on the cops to help you and I will take my weapon and settle this before the cops show up 30 minutes or even longer. You wimpy pukes just wait till someone bursts your dream of how things should be and you will want a way to protect your loved ones.
