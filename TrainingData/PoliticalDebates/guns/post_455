Many suicide attempts are not really meant to end a life, rather they are a call for help. These people typically don't pick a reliable method.  Most people who pick a gun mean to die--If a firearm were not easily available, they would pick another effective method.  Another aspect of this is a fairly significant difference in philosophy, separate from the gun issue--Self-reliance vs. dependence on authority.  The idea that because I may harm myself I should be prevented from doing something reinforces dependence.  Letting me judge the risks myself and make my own decisions is self-reliance.
