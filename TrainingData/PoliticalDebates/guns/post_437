Someone once said to me in a discussion about concealed carrying of   firearms   that "Only police should have   guns  " I said "Ok lets look at that. Police have the responsibility to keep the civil peace and solve crimes, not prevent them. Crimes are not preventable. The robber or rapist is not going to be deterred by police programs or fear of arrest, he has already made the decision to commit a   crime  . The odds of police interference are remarkably low. The odds of actually getting caught for a   murder   are 1 in 14. The responsibility for your own safety is ultimately yours, not the police. I choose to carry a   firearm   to protect myself and those I love. By being in proximity to me you are also being protected, as I can prevent a rapist or robber from harming you. Carrying a gun is a heavy burden, I have made the decision to take human life if necessary to protect myself with all of the emotional and physical baggage this entails. If you were being assaulted I guarantee that you would be praying for someone with a gun to help you and stop the perpetrators.I do not choose to carry a gun to take lives, I carry a gun to save lives, Maybe even yours
