It is true that accidents happen and innocent people die when an irresonsible person leaves a gun in the wrong place around the house. Still, guns do not kill people, people kill people - sometimes by just leaving the gun accesible to an inocent child.  But we must keep our eyes on the big picture.  Our founding fathers knew what they were doing. They had not only vission but also experience - gun control that removes all guns only makes it easier for the bad guys.  The bad guys are not going to give up their guns, and they will be more willing to take a life to obtain anything they want knowing they are less at risk from retaliation from a would be victim.  To see what would happen at athe national level if you take away our right to bare arms just spend a couple of days in Mexico.  Just spend a few days in Monterrey driving a nice vehicle.  Crooks do not hacitate to jump you because they know that, unless you are one of the bad guys, you are not going to have a gun.  So they will even jump you with only a screw driver in their hands!  It is an unfortunate truth, but as long as there are human beings willing to take what is not theirs, people have to be able to defend themselves.
