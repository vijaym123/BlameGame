Just as in our neighborhoods, there are not enough campus police officers to protect every individual student, nor is that their job.  Most states that allow concealed carry allow any law-abiding citizen 21 and older to carry.  If we believe 21 is the magic age then why not allow a college student that is 21 to protect themselves if they so choose.  Concealed carry permit holders are some of the most law abiding citizens in the nation and there are numerous cases when CHP holders have stopped an attack without firing a shot.  College campuses are safe but in those rare instances when an attack occurs, an armed student can save lives.
