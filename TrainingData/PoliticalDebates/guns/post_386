By telling stories instead of concrete numbers, you ignore the larger picture. For every incident of a tragic fatality from a firearm, there are an equal, or greater number of incidences where lives are saved by firearms.To try to use an occasional story to legislate the majority is a disservice against all Americans. Review this story for basis:    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/08/AR2008060800576.html    A Japanese man drove a large truck hitting pedestrians and then stabbing them. If we legislated on emotion and anecdotes, as the original poster would suggest, we would ban renting large cars and many types of knives.
