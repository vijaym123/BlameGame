Sevesteen pointed out the 1% errors- but you are not correct in saying more innocents die as a result of guns than not. It's just not the case. You can check with FBI statistics if you like.as for the rest of your argument-Ignore guns for a moment, and view only the Bill of Rights as you referenced.To allow significant infringement of the 2nd amendment is to set precedent for the entire BOR to come into question. You mention the suspension of HC, how about the suspension of all free speech? Religion? Right to a fair trail, trail by jury? What about the right to not self incriminate?You speak of modern America- but you cannot speak of future America. Who knows what the political climate will be in 50 years? 100? certainly no one in the past predicted our current political and technological climate.You risk negotiating rights for the youth and the unborn of America by using today's standards as your guide. You have no knowledge, and no right to legislate what Future America will want and need for itself. You open the door for more than guns to be taken away. Do not do so without significant consideration.
