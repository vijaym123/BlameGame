"The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect ourselves". So when an american enters you're home with intent to kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork? I do agree that most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury, but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your property. If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or lose a television, I would rather lose the television. The question is whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my family. I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family. If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point. The fact of the matter is we don't. When America gets to the point where I can go to sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then I'll consider getting rid of my gun. Until then, we live in a dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself.
