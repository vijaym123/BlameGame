Banning guns will not make gun-related deaths decline substantially. The majority of gun buyers are law-abiding people who keep the guns for self defense. Guns used in street crimes, especially from gangs, are typically illegal. If guns are banned, the illegal street guns will still be circulated, but the innocent people will not be able to obtain a gun for self-defense.
