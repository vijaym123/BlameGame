Well look at prohibtion in 1919 and on, also known as the Volstead act. Alcohol was completely banned yet everybody still drank. They found ways to drink. People had to brew underground, and drink in underground bars, but it happened. Even major Authorities including police and judges were found down there. The same things would happen with guns, and who would be the people to illegally own guns? Not harmless hunters, but gangsters and other criminals who are dangerous with such weapons. It is still going to happen. Maybe we just need tighter gun laws when purchasing them.
