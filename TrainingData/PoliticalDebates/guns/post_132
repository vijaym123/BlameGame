The English Bill of Rights included legislative restrictions on the right to bear arms. Oral arguments in DC vs. Heller. March 19th, 2008 - "JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we're going back to the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to be subject to the control and limitation and restriction of Parliament. And I don't think there's any doubt about that. And that's what we're talking about here, are legislative restrictions."
