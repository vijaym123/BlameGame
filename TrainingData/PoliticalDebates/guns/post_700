While examining these figures, one must not neglect to consider the unique demographics that we have in the United States. Please don't interpret this as racist . . . I'm just trying to make a point: If all black crimes were taken out of these figures then the United States would have one of the LOWEST rates of gun violence. Anyone who has studied statistics on even a master's level knows that you have to adjust for these things in order to formulate a conclusion so this point is very salient.
