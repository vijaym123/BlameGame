What is your education level? Oh nevermind. Listen bodily functions are not repeat not rights. As for making choices about the direction of ones life well i'm flabergasted, you almost make my point fore me, yes Virginia we do have the right, God given of protecting our lives and of those around us,in order to do this you have to be educated in the use of all the tools around you,Knowing the enviroment you travel in, use of ones physical abilities, i.e. karate or kung fu,what I am trying to say is that a gun is an inanimate object, atool to be used for good or evil as "man" so choses. As we live in a Free society(getting less all the time) a "man" should be free to use any tools at his disposal for the protection of our very being.Also note that most of the people I know already know that the politicians and wall street aren't to be trusted, they squandered trillions and will continue to do so as long as the sheep can be led astray. They will not save you and If you give them unlimited power, economic or otherwise they will surely abuse you, as for me and mine i will protect it the best that i can with All the tools available to me.
