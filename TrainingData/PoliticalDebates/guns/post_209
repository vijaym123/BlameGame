I know at least 4 people who have been robbed, with a couple being at gunpoint. In all those instances having a gun de-escalated the situation, resulting in the robbers turning and running. Gun ownership in this country is at an all time high, and   crime   is at a 35 year low. From 1977 - 1997 90% of all multiple victim shootings happened in states where there was no right to carry. 91% of all defensive uses of   guns   end without a shot fired.There is plenty of proof that guns in this country result in lower crime, especially violent crime.
