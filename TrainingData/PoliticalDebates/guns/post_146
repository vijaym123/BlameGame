 An individual right to bear arms helps protect against domestic tyranny One of the primary purposes of the Second Amendment of the constitution was to protect against domestic tyranny. The reason for this is based, in large part, in history, but it remains relevant today. At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, one of the greatest fears was that a King-like figure would emerge in American government, or that the government would simply become despotic and tyrannical, like Britain was believed to have become leading up to the Revolutionary war. Hedging against the emergence of a tyranny in America, therefore, was of primary concern. The Second Amendment was designed to ensure that the people were fully empowered with the threat of violence to combat the emergence of a tyrant. This took the form of an individual right to bear arms and to form a militia to combat a tyrannical government.
