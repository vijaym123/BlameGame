Look at a country such as South Africa. The law there requires that gun owners either store their weapons in government approved safes or that they carry their weapons on their bodies. Based on the opinions expressed here, that should mean that they are much safer than other countries particularly since a large proportion of the population owns some sort of weapon (and most choose to carry since the safes are expensive). The reality is that they are not. Instead criminals assume that anyone they attack is carrying and don't bother using the guns as threats. Instead criminals shoot first out of fear that their victims will be able to shoot back otherwise. The number of robberies that would result in wounded pride and a small financial loss in the U.S. instead result in murder. While I am an American, the only people I know who have been held up in this country have escaped unharmed, while I have known two S. Africans who were killed during petty theft and I have S. African friends who have safe room built into their homes as insurance against home invasions by armed robbers. These are not elitist rich isolated folks who have been impacted by the criminal response to gun laws, but everyday middle class citizens.The idea that many of my fellow citizens are walking around armed scares me more than the idea that some criminals might have weapons. I have no issues with sport rifles used for hunting and I don't have an issue with individuals living in rural areas where wildlife poses enough of a threat that carrying a gun could be considered a safety measure as long as the owners are trained in their use. However, I have an issue with the blanket argument that everyone, everywhere is better off if they own weapons or that all Americans are better off because our neighbors own weapons. The data don't really seem to support this.
