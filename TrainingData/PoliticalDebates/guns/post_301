 The idiots are the people that go buy a gun, take it home, and put it up. Never bothering to learn how to properly handle it. Never sitting down with thier family and   teaching   them the inherent dangers of   firearms  . Yes a gun is dangerous. As to having an advanced warning, that is where practice comes in. Practice until you are sick of it. Practice makes you prepared. Being prepared gives you the ability to react quicker. To think more clearly. I myself have been around firearms my entire life. I am confident in my   firearm   skills, but I still practice. I don't own or carry a gun to to make myself feel safe, I feel it is my civic duty to protect my family, friends, property or even a complete stranger from any harm that is unforeseen.
