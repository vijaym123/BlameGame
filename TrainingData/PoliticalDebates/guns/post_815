It's not that hard to learn how to use a gun. I'm 15, and in just 3 hours, when I was 12 years old, I learned how to safely use a rifle, pistol, and shotgun.Why can we trust the people LIKE US in the military with automatic weapons, tanks, and explosives to defend our own country but we can't trust ourselves to defend our own lives?I do, however, agree with the fact anyone willing to buy a gun should take some kind of safety course or such, and we should make it a law.
