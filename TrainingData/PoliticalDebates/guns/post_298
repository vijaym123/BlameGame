The big problem in this country is the dumbing-down by the government schools and the maintenance of that dumbing-down by the totally controlled media.The Second Article (they should never have been called amendments since they do not amend the Constitution that was designed to limit and restrict government) clearly states that the Right to Bear Arms "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED" and that is what all of the liberal, socialist and whatever other title they can be called, individuals fail to accept.The video that has been shown on the internet about the young lady whose parents were murdered in a restaurant rampage by a madman clearly states the fact: The Second Article was specifically designed to protect the state citizens from GOVERNMENT!
