Words that no one EVER wants to hear.  When you say, --if guns were illegal--  I feel you, but it is a fact that they DO exist and to wish otherwise is just so much fantasy.  The world can be an ugly place and to know and understand this is the only REAL defense.  To accept where you are is to know how to best proceed.  I believe in the right to keep and bear arms as well as the right to choose to leave your protection in the Ðlimited-- hands of others.  But if you abdicate your responsibility in deference to the state, then you get what you get--fat campus police in swat gear hiding behind trees while your loved ones are being gunned down inside.But I don't believe that guns in book bags are the answer either.  I would advocate a --volunteer only-- campus home guard.  It could be staffers, faculty and administration.  The college could vet, set parameters and police them.  In the cases cited, it was an individual who understood lethal force and used it in defending the innocent.
