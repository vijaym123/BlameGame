I'm not sure what you are responding to.   Maybe it would be more productive to find out what restrictions you think are reasonable and constitutional.  Which of the proposed or actual laws I mentioned above are reasonable, and why?  Are any of my facts in error? Where is the line between a constitutional local law and an unconstitutional infringement?
