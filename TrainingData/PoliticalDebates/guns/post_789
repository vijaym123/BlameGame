Brady,How many times do you need to hear this and from how many law abiding citizens.  A GUN DID NOT KILL THOSE KIDS AT VIGINIA TECH!!  CHO DID!! And it was made easy for him.   If Virginia Tech allowed CWC how many   parents   would have been spared the agony of empty beds.  My heart goes out to them and they can thank your contributing agenda for being forced to be defenseless sitting ducks.I'm not hearing any gun   shots   coming out of the Utah   campus  '.  I am in Minnesota so it is a bit far for the gunshots to be heard.   What?  No gun battles using a keg as a shield?  No enraged gun battles over a parking space?  No professors being shot for handing out a bad grade?  What you also will not hear from the Utah campus is gunshots of random killers.  They will be much safer at malls and churches unless I am there.  Yes.  I know.  Your misguided agenda would make me a criminal for protecting myself and others.  Just as you did these students.
