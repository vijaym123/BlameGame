FINALLY. Someone who pointed out that violent crimes in Europe ARE HIGHER. Good lord. Stop listening to propaganda. In fact BBC recently did a report on how crime has gotten worse.Get y'alls head out of the sand. Europe's moving away from government intervention. Were moving toward it. Europe's starting to realize that gun control fails. Were moving towards it. Why do we not look across the pond and realize how much it sucks? High crime, and high unemployment.
