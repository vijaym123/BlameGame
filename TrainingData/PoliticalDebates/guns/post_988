 This is ridiculous.  No matter what the "bad guys" are going to get firearms.  All gun control does is make it harder for the law abiding citizen to get a gun.  Less than 5% of violent crimes committed with a firearm are with a legally purchased firearm.  You're not going to do any good.  You want to see violent crimes go down?  Make it easier for law abiding citizens to buy firearms and train them to use it to defend themselves and others.
