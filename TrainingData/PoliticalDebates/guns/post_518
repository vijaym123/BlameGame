The Brady people are typical of many others.  Ignorant, but passionate.  They have a right under our   constitution   to campaign for the repeal of the 2nd amendment.  I am far more concerned with judges who allow them to influence their decisions (read empathy) so that the 2nd amendment is not upheld.  Our empathetic judges can see words that don't appear on paper when it comes to privacy issues that don't exist in the words of the constitution, but can ignore the plain language of the 2nd amendment.  Don't worry about the Bradyites, work to get politicians elected who will appoint judges who can read.
