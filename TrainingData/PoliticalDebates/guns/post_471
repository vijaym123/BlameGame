I wasn't exactly sure which article to put this under, but since this is recent I will use it.  I apologize that it is not particularly in response to the National Parks issue.  http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/18/obama.protest  .rifle/index.html"A man toting an assault rifle was among a dozen protesters carrying weapons while demonstrating outside President Obama's speech to veterans on Monday, but no laws were broken. It was the second instance in recent days in which weapons have been seen near presidential events."I couldn't believe the article when I read it.  That is some serious 2nd ammendment protesting.  I love it really.  When was the last time you ever heard of a weapon being allowed anywhere near the POTUS?  Two things stand out so strongly:1.  Local and state   law   enforcement did not confiscate the weapon (temporarily) or remove the man from the protest. (He possessed it legally)2.  The Secret Service didn't either. (I have zero idea what they must have been thinking, other than "Do not blink today".In my opinion this changes the question of carrying in parks, or churches, or Starburcks to carrying an ASSAULT rifle in proximity to the POTUS.And not to make too big a point of it, but this is President Obama we are talking about.  He's not what you would call a pro-assault rifle, NRA card carrying kind of guy.  If people were carrying elephant   guns   to a Roosevelt rally, maybe I would be a little less interested.  So many different questions and thoughts ran through my head when I read the article.  I am left with:"Ain't America grand"?You may like guns, or hate them.  But what you should absolutely appreciate is that this country is indeed still free, even if it's not perfect.  If President Obama intended to send a political message on this one, please at least give him the credit for having the nerve to do it.
