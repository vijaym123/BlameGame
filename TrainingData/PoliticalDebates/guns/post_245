I'm what most consider a gun nut (6guns 1000+rounds). I've had three great dogs that have been great supplements to my family's security. They let the   kids   pull their ears and tails. My mut is about 40 pounds. He successfully protected my son and I from two Mastiff dogs. That one day was worth all the   food   I ever bought him. Mastiffs are about 200 pounds each and would have destroyed us. Dogs can be both lovers and fighters.
