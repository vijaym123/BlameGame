Look at some European countries that banned guns. Guess what nothing has changed. If people want to kill they will and they will find a way to get a gun to do so! So you want to get rid of hunting, which is a trillion $ a year industry and if you ban guns millions of jobs would be lost. YOU THINK WE ARE IN A RECESSION NOW! You idiot!
