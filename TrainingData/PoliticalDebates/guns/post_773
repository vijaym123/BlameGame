These examples alone show how everyday citizens can protect themselves and others with the ability to concealed carry a firearm.  Imagine if people like the security officer and the principal did not have firearms on them, innocent lives would have been lost.  I believe that is enough evidence alone to show the capabilities of what the ability to carry a concealed weapon on college campuses.  Nothing can argue otherwise...it is a yes or no situation, yes carry concealed firearms and have the capability to protect yourself, or no, don't allow the carrying of concealed firearms and allow citizens to become subject to the danger that they may face.
