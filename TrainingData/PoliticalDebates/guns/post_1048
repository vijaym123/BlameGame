 No, I don't agree. The number of people killed by guns in the United Kingdom last year was unbelievable. I can understand why people would want to carry them for self-defense, but I believe this would lead to further problems. Guns are dangerous weapons and in my opinion they should be banned. I even disagree with hunting rifles, as these too are dangerous.   />   /> No one should own a gun. Messing around with guns can lead to serious accidents and using them in self-defense could also lead to tragic consequences. If guns didn't cause harm then I would say that everyone has the right to own them, but since they are so dangerous and so many innocent lives have been lost to them, I say that they should be banned altogether.
