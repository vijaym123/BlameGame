I'm not at all sure I trust anyone on campus with me with a concealed-carry weapon if they're just a student. What if they're paranoid enough to carry a concealed-carry weapon simply because they're paranoid? There's absolutely no assurance that whoever has the gun won't overreact to a tense situation, or a perceived attack, and shoot unarmed people. I support concealed-carry in the hands of people trained to use a gun and discriminate between hostile people and those who are just panicked. Random people with the money to obtain a gun and the nervousness to want to carry one every day do not inspire me with confidence.
