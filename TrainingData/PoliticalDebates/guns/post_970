 I'm for Gun elimination, let the law and   / military have them, the city where the President signs laws is flooded with gun crimes, and that's practically the tour  /> capital of the world, now the murder capital of the country. This is where they legislate such laws, in D.C. Babies own the guns, Babies that can't even vote yet,  /> And in D.C. Babies are dying, that's like arming the middle easterners, then saying  /> "Hey they have weapons of mass destruction, " Let's arm ourselves and go get them.  A weapon of mass destruction is a child with a gun.
