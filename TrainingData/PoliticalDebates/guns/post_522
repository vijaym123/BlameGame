I carry a concealed handgun and I was responsible enough to get a permit to carry (although I disagree that I should have to "ask to protect myself" by getting a permit). Putting that aside, I carry to protect myself and others with me should I come face-to-face with someone intent on harming others. All you folks who think we should lay our sidearms down at the alter of the government, read my lips!! One day, it may be me or someone just like me, that saves your "  guns   kill" ass from someone wanting to anniliate you with their gun that they do no carry legally. So, why don't all you whimpering folks start prodding your legislators into going after the ILLEGAL guns and leave us that follow the rules alone, PLEASE??
