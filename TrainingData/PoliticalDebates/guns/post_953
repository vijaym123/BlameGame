the are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for safety. i have said this many times. move to a place with a low crime rate, get an alarm, or buy a guard dog. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray. buying a gun for protection is just stupid and paranoid. who would you even be protecting yourself from anyway? a burglar, because most burglaries occur when your not even home, make the gun pointless.
