It's 3am.  You're done going out for the night, and say goodbye to your friends.  You start walking home from the bar/restaurant with your wife.  A group of men is approaching you on the dark street.  You have your hands.  Do you feel safe?Then you remember, you moved to China, you live in Shanghai, a cosmopolitan city with millions of people and no guns.  Not even the police have guns.  You are safe, you're perfectly safe.  You smile at the men, who are friendly and also walking home.  You're glad you're no longer paranoid about personal safety as you were when you lived in the US.In a violent society like the US, whose violence is in part perpetrated by a prevalent gun culture, perhaps it is safer to own a gun.  But we should work towards living in a society where the risks of owning a gun outweigh the benefits.  It's nice to wander down a dark city street in the middle of the night and not think twice about getting shot.
