Heres one for ya.......GUNTOWN USA  http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55288  QUOTE "In March 1982, 25 years ago, the small town of Kennesaw Ð responding to a handgun ban in Morton Grove, Ill. Ð unanimously passed an ordinance requiring each head of household to own and maintain a gun. Since then, despite dire predictions of "Wild West" showdowns and increased violence and accidents, not a single resident has been involved in a fatal   shooting   Ð as a victim, attacker or defender."
