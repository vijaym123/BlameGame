 I'm sorry...this has got to be one of the stupidest arguments ever...even if you have to have a license, u think everyone will get one, no...and if you do have to get a license, u think the cops then would check everyone who has a gun's license, no..because its like driving, u see someone driving they are assumed to have a license...  /> If you want to carry a gun, become a cop..
