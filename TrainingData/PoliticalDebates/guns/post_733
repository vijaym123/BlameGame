The real crux of the matter is the intent of the perpetrator.  It doesn't matter what tool he or she uses to murder, that tool is one hundred percent activated by an individual who is completely determined to murder innocent people: without regard to the individual, family, position in the community or accomplishments. The perpetrator *will* do his best to murder."... I believe there is a better way of controlling violence - armed or unarmed - without the injuries inherent to guns and knives or other like tools..."In the quiet calm of a home, study, seminar or classroom it is logically impossible to argue against the above quote in any reasonable manner.  Yet, in real life, an individual who is completely focused on murder rarely presents an opportunity for someone to neutralize that individual with something less than deadly force coupled with sudden action; powered by a singular intent.  As of this time, there is not an effective non-violent method or tool available which is relatively inexpensive and available to the public for immediate self protection.  When those become available, then, perhaps, differing methods can be employed."...If we cannot show compassion toward our violent assailants, what right have we to the claim of civility?"We both claim and possess civility because we employ less than civil actions toward *only* those who employ violent means toward others and ourselves.  Counter question: What value are we, civil and otherwise, if we choose a violent assailant over friends, family and associates?
