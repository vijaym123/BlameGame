Yes I feel safer because I am safer. I have used my gun on more than one occasion to prevent theft, assault and who knows what else had I not been armed. In all cases I did nothing to provoke anyone, never fired a shot and no   children   died from my weapon.  In "real life" just having the weapon is enough of a deterrent.  In cases when I did not have a weapon it resulted in a physical altercation sometimes resulting in injury.Typically a burgler would make some type of noise entering your home.  Unless you welcome him in by leaving the doors and windows unlocked.  I could never imagine a situation where anyone woud "have the drop on me" ever, especially in my own home.  And having a gun in my home is no more dangerous than any other tool.
