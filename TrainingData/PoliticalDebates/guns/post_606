This comment: "Where do many sociopaths end up? In the   military  ." is so insulting, it makes my blood boil. As a third generation veteran of the U.S. Army, married to a second generation veteran of the U.S. Air Force, and as an American who actually has respect for our military, I would advise you to shut your fat trap. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. The military in this country represent the bravest, most patriotic, most selfless among us. I have seen the pride that our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines take in their duty to defend this nation. And I have seen the lengths to which they will go to defend each other and others (my former team leader pulled 5 Iraqis out of a burning building with disregard for his own safety.) I would guess you don't know a single person in the military. But if you do, I hope they have a chance to read your stupid comment and let you know what they think of it.
