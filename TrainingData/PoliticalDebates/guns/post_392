A whole lot of people don't know what the current laws are. There is an impression that criminals go to gun shows to buy $100 full-auto AK47's from dealers without a background check.  If lying on a 4473 usually put you in jail (like it should...) then pretty soon the word would get out, and people would quit trying.  If we aren't even going to make a token attempt to enforce a law, we shouldn't keep that law.Eliminating the supply to the law-abiding is fairly easy--Just pass a law.  Eliminating the criminal supply is much more difficult.  Guns last decades or centuries--I personally know someone who until this year carried a gun last manufactured in the mid 1920's.   We can't keep consumable drugs out of our country--Can we keep durable guns out?  If not, then the lack of supply is more than made up for by the lack of resistance.
