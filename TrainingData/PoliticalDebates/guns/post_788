StriveforYourDreams-Your argument is based alot on the potential for things to happen, rather than what th reality of a situation may be.  Yes, guns "can" misfire and someone "can" accidentally pull the triggen, but can you also consider the fact that a gun also has the potential to never misfire at all, or that a person handling a firearm has the repsonsibility and the expertise to never accidentally pull the trigger.  In your response, I see doubt in society and the potential good of everyday people.  As with anything, there is bad aspects, but you are failing to see what is good.  There are plenty of law abiding citizens that have the responsbility and the ability to carry a concealed firearm.  Also, you are placing blame on controlled substances, rather on firearms themselves.  Ultimately it is the fault of an individual, not the firearm that they carry or the drugs that they take.  When you talk about the potential for misfire.  I have been a hunter for 7 years, and all my time spent around firearms, I have never had a gun misfire or hangfire on me.
