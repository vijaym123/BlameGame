I understand that   guns   were confiscated by   police  , with the help of National Guard troops operating in a state   military   capacity, on the orders of the Mayor, Ray Nagin.Regarding US troops firing on US Citizens: It has in the past (W Virginia Coal Miners, etc.). Posse Commitatus is still   law  , still emphasized at state NG level, but is also officially ignored.Another factor if the effluvium really hits the air-movement system: There is now (formed I think AFTER Katrina) a loose organization of former and current service and law enforcement members who claim that they will hold to their oath, not carry out any unconstitutional orders, including to disarm law-abiding citizens. They call themselves "Oathkeepers".
