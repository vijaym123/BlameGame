First, I am not using a gun as my last line of defense. I'm using as my first. What are you going to do? Ask the guy who's invading your home for a timeout so you can upgrade from a slipper to a knife, then from a knife to   baseball   bat, then from a bat to to a gun? No, come prepared for the worst, and hope for the best. Second, Silverant, why are you going to chamber anything? You should have it locked and cocked and ready to rock. (Sorry, couldn't resist a little cheese). Seriously though, if you have an empty gun, sell it and get a free rock. ;-)
