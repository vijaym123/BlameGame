Look up "National   crime   report" on google.  I don't have time or inclination to get them.  But nobody seems to argue with them.The average Brit (or aussie) being more civilized than us free-range Americans,  the UK has always had a low   murder   rate,    guns   or not.   In fact,  around 1900,  all you had to do was pay a 10 shilling   tax   to carry concealed. Yet the murder rate was lower than now.  The book "Against the Odds" (look it up) notes that even in the mid 1600's london had only a dozen murders or less a year,  compared to one a day or so for Paris.The sociologists tell us the the main varible in the white non-hispanic US murder rate is to be of southern US extraction,  which I am,  partly.  Look up ( Virginia senator ) James Webb's book on us,  aptly-entitled "Born fighting".   An honor culture again.  Don't mess with 'em.OTOH,  my Danish-  immigrant   ancestors up north  universally own   firearms  .  It's a farm tool like any other.  Flatly-stated,  they just don't shoot each other.
