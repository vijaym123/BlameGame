 Court rulings upholding the individual right to bear arms Blizz v. Commonwealth, in 1982, held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire." Dred Scott v. Sanford (1856) ruling suggested a universal individual right to bear arms, writing "It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union . . .the full liberty . . .to keep and carry arms wherever they went."
