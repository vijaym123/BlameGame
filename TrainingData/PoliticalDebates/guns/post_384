maybe it's time to change your position.You claim: “owning a gun in many instances places our   children   in grave danger.” I’m sorry, but on what ACTUAL RESEARCH is your claims based? The federal government lists the total firearm related   deaths   for children (0-14) as 251 out of 4,178,898 or 0.69 per day; while there were 2,716 in the same age range, 7.44 per day, that drown. (CDC WISQARS Injury Mortality Reports, 2006) While each death is a   tragedy   4 children die each day in the U.S. from parental neglect and abuse. (National Center on Child Abuse Prevention, 1998 Annual Survey) and Over 13 teenagers die every day in automobiles,SEVEN are behind the wheel. (U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, 2001).If   guns   are the problem: Name the U.S. cities with STRICT   gun control   laws AND   crime   rates LOWER than the national average.Whom do you propose should bear the responsibility of protecting you and your loved ones if not you?The courts have ruled that   police   have NO DUTY TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS; despite the non-binding slogan “protect and serve” on their   cars  :Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616 (7th Cir. 1982) (no federal constitutional requirement that police provide protection) Calogrides v. Mobile, 475 So. 2d 560 (Ala. 1985); Cal Govt.

Cmwth. 170, 478 A.2d 937 (1984) (no liability for failure to provide police protection)Besides: If YOU are unwilling to protect your loved ones by all means, including with a gun, why should a police officer risk his life to save something that is of such little value that even the OWNER is unwilling to protect it?Name the last massacre that WASN’T in a “Gun-Free Zone”.Or how about naming 5 massacres in “Gun-Rich Zones”.
