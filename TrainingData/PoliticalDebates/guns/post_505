This statement has no basis in fact. As a matter of fact, the opposite has been shown to be true in study after study.According to the FBI's   crime   statistics, counties that do away with bans on citizens' right to carry see an average 8.5% drop in violent crime rates.Neither the Brady Campaign or any other pro or anti gun group has been able to show a direct correlation in   gun control   and reduced crime rates. In fact, the opposite is almost always the case.In addition,   legal   carry permit holders have a crime rate that is far below that of the general population.Base your decisions on fact rather than fear and prejudice. In the words of Al Gore, "The debate is over." Only this debate isn't based on covering up the facts. It's based on exposing them.
