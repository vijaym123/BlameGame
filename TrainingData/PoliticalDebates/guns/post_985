 If someone wants to kill someone else obviously they are going to attempt to kill them in some way. If its easier to kill someone with a knife then your fists they will use a knife if its convenient to get. If a guns easier to kill someone then a knife and its convenient to get then they will use a gun. You are right in the sense that if we make it more inconvenient to get guns they will be used less but that does not mean there will be less killings. Also for gun control to work we would have to take guns away from everyone which is against the constitution and i doubt the NGA-national gun association is going to get them up without a fight-legally of course.
