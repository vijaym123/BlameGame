yes...allowing the youth of america to posess guns, knives, ...perhaps grenades, bombs, etc....is a great way to keep colleges safe!!!! is this for real??? my obvious answer to this question is absolutley not....and if i were a parent and heard that this was allowed...you bet id be knocking on the deans door.....wearing a bullet proof vest of course!
