You must be kidding.  China is the number one violator of   human rights   in   asia  ..and that is saying something.. The reason the PEOPLE don't have   guns   in China is because the government dictates what the people do. The government is AFRAID if the people had the means to defend themselves they WOULD! .. I'll take the USA, problems and all.
