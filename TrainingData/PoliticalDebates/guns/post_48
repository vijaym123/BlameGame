 If the 2nd amendment was to protect an individual right it would have clearly expressed it If the intentions of the framers had been to protect an individual right to bear arms, they would have clearly expressed this. Yet, the Second Amendment is not at all clear about an individual right to bear arms. The natural reading of the clause would indicate that the right relates only to the first, qualifying clause that states, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State...". It is a stretch to read into the language an individual right. If this was the case, why wouldn't they simply have explicitly stated that an "individual right to bear arms should not be infringed".
