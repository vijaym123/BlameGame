You can count me in as one of the well-armed populace, and if the gun and ammo sales in the last 6-8 months is any indication there are a lot of us.  More than 5 Billion rounds of ammunition sold, and more   guns   sold in the period since the   election  .  That's more than was sold during the previous two years combined, if the gun blogs are accurate.
