the brady campaign is a dangerous organization!  They seek to change our constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.  The second amendment is very clear on its intent.  It is to protect us from our government should it become our enemy which happens worldwide.  where we live it takes cops a half and hour to arrive in the event that your life is in danger. The right to self defense is a god given right,not necessary to get permission from the brady communist campaign to protect our own life.  these people that support the brady bunch would have done well when adolf hitler was in power. use violence to subdue the citizens and if they dont agree with you,kill them.
