 In my Nevada neighbourhood, there is a sign, “Congested area. Illegal to discharge firearms.” That gives you an idea about how prevalent gun ownership is here.   /> It is way past due for the U.S. To institute stricter gun-control laws, specifically on hand guns. But every time the Supreme Court tackles it, “gun nuts” go ballistic about the Second Amendment.  /> I wonder how fast these folks’ tune would change if they shot their 9-year-old son when he was en route to the bathroom at midnight. Or if that boy shot his little playmate with Dad’s loaded gun in the nightstand.  /> Awhile back here, a crazy drunk guy barged into the wrong house. The terrified homeowner shot the guy in the thigh as he lurched down the hallway, causing a fatal wound to the femoral artery. The homeowner not only wasn’t charged with manslaughter, he was roundly praised in the local newspaper.
