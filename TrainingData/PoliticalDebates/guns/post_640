I live I thought in the same country as you-I experience alot of freedom everyday including giving my opinions openly!  I know my views are definately in the minority but that doesn't bother!  I like a good and civil debate on just about any issue! I do take back what I said earlier about the government restricting the sales of   guns   to 2 per family!  Hunters and sportsmen in general, are   law   obedient, responsible gun owners-I don't really have a problem with them at all!I count you as one of them because I realize I struck a raw nerve with you especially, and I'm sure your an avid hunter and responsible!
