I really can't imagine a situation where someone who is unstable enough to think that shooting someone is a good idea, but stable enough to maintain a criminal history clean enough to legally buy a gun, and who doesn't own a gun and is mad enough to  go find a gun store, pick out a gun (without appearing to be a nutcase to the gun shop people) spend a couple hundred dollars, fill out the NICS 4473 form, wait for the background check, then go back and find the person they are mad at and shoot them....but not so mad that they wouldn't still want to shoot them a couple days later.   Is there  evidence that people with clean criminal backgrounds commit murder with guns they have bought at a licensed gun dealer in the last 10 days in any statistically meaningful numbers?  On the other hand, I've seen stories of someone who needed a gun to protect against a nutcase, but was killed before the waiting period was over.  Thankfully a rare situation, but more common than what a waiting period is theoretically supposed to protect against.
