#originalTopic=Debate:_Right_to_bear_arms_in_the_US
 No US citizens are in a militia and so none have a right to keep and bear arms The purpose of the Second Amendment - being defined by the "militia" clause ("A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State") - is related to the upkeep of the militia. Rights are offered to citizens only in so far as they might enable the upkeep of the militia. Yet, no US citizens are currently in a "well regulated militia". Therefore, there is not present context in which citizens would have the "right to keep and bear arms"; there is no militia in which that context would exist.
