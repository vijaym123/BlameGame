the general public should be able to posses guns for self defense and safety. i agree that there should be some restrictions like if you are a convicted felon you are not aloud to posses a gun. but a citizen trying to protect himself should be able to have a gun. some may say that crime happens because of guns. guns don't kill people, people do. but even if guns were outlawed the criminals would find illegal guns and would find other ways to harm people. all people shouldn't have they're safety taken away just because of what criminals decide to do with the guns.
