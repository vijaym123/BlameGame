While I agree with your basic point, (I think) you certainly come off as irrational and a tad bit crazy.  It just gives the other side more ammunition.  Is the Brady Campaing dangerous?  Yes.  Does that statement need to be the first line with an exclaimation point, in an argument that isn't even about the Brady Campaign?  No.  You're on the right track, but you need to take a chill pill and present your arguments in a calm, rational and reasonable way.  If you sound like  a crazy person, you're not going to convince them that letting you keep your guns is a good idea.
