Errr.... they must do so in an organized manner to be a militia.  (Just... one... teeny tiny distinction.)All members of the Rotary Club are citizens.I am a citizen.Therefore, I am a member of the Rotary Club.Okay, I don't actually know if that's a stipulation to being in the R.C., but you can see how that doesn't work.  That all members of a militia are citizens doesn't mean that all citizens are members of the militia.  But I have since examined this issue in my mind for laborious hours and have come to think that this only says the protection against federal imposition upon the arms of the militia shall not be infringed.  It doesn't say that if you aren't in the militia you can't keep and bear arms... but it doesn't say that it is a right that can't be infringed, or controlled.
