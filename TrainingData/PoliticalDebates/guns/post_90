#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
The DC handgun ban is made ineffectual by legal purchases in Maryland and Virginia. DC is very small and very close to Maryland and Virginia, making it very easy for people to legally purchase guns outside of DC and bring them in. It also makes it very easy for blackmarket sales to occur.
