You people are idiots.When someone walks into a bank and holds it up... how does your gun make you safer? When someone shoots you from a highway overpass.... how did you your gun make you safer?When someone walks into your home in the middle of dinner... how will your gun make you safer?Do you walk around with holsters and your six-shooter?  What the fuck is this.... 1886? Did their   guns   make Them safer? Or wait.... was that when everyone DID have guns... out in the open? Yes. Yes it was.  And were they safer?No. They weren't.  Guns do Not make you safer.   Just like a basement keep you safe in a tornado unless you have advance warning - the same applies to a gun.   Having one doesn't mean you're safer unless you have advance warning.
