 I agree with Johnshier. Gun control, if used as it is meant to be used, which is registration, and documentation, is a good idea. However, democrats and liberals take gun control as "we control all the guns, which means you get none."  when in the real world, can't and doesn't work, as criminals can and do get guns regardless of gun control laws. And an unregistered weapon in the hands of a criminal is more dangerous than an armed registered citizen.
