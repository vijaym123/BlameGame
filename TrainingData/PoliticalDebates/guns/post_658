I have to agree with Vigilance on this one...The common folk had the same weaponry that the governments had other than cannon...Cannons were not an everyday luxury for most citizens..Todays populous hardly has the capabilities the government has...We the people give the government the authority it has, to accumulate its' arsenal...Why is it the government would take my putrid weaponry ???
