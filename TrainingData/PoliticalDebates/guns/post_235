The wonderful thing about a gun is that it isn't a booby trap or some uncontrollable death machine.  It is a highly controllable death machine.  Say the wife stands at the top of the stairs, levels her firearm at the intruders, and demands that they stop what they are doing and explain themselves.  The boys say, "Ma, it's me, everything's fine!" and the intruders either surrender, allowing the police time to get there, they go to jail, and no one gets hurt, or they try some funny business, in which case they die.  Having a firearm is not enough.  Knowing how to use it safely and effectively is just as important, if not more so.  There's nothing wrong with having an alarm, a dog, and a gun.
