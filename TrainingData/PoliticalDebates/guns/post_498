Hi Countryboy: By unloaded and locked up I'm aluding to sensible firearmsafety: If you are in a camper or motorhome, keep your firearm in a se-cure toolbox, closet, cabinet or under your matress...Keep a magazine ofammo somewhere nearby but known only to you or another adult companion.In this manner, there is no accidental or kid's-curiosity gunfire. Ifyou need to respond to an emergency, you can do so but nobody else isable to shoot your firearm...Packing heat around a campsite or having aloaded piece laying around can attract trouble...Enjoy the park: If youaren't comfortable with people there, move to another campsite or informone of the rangers of your observations/concerns...Aaron..
