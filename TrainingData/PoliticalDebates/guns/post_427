SUPGV, Aren't you the one in another post who said "Causal effect is always hard to determine"?  Yet here you're making a blanket statement that more   guns   equal more violence.  It's funny how that whole double-standard thing works with anti-gunners.  To paraphrase your comments in "Fewer Guns in North East...", Did more guns really lead to MORE   crime   or were there many other factors such as DOWNTURNS in the   economy  , LESS aggressive policing, LOWER incarceration rates, INCREASE in crack cocaine use? Just a thought...
