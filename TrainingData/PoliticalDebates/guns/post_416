"if the majority of your students don't want you armed in the classroom they are sharing with you, then I believe you shouldn't be armed. I would extend that to a city, state or nation."No, no, no. Rights guaranteed in the Constitution, i.e. the supreme   law   of the land, can't be denied just because they're unpopular. So if I start speaking out against   gay marriage   in San Francisco they should be able to take my right to   free speech   away? If I commit a hate-  crime   in a predominately black city should they be able to take my right to a fair trial away? If I do a news report over a corrupt presidential administration should they be able to take my freedom of the press rights away from me because the president's popular? Our rights are not to be compromised just because they're unpopular."Guns allow people to perpetrate violence and kill other people on a large scale and with little effort."Only in the hands of a criminal. I'm not a criminal, so why should I be restricted when it comes to myself owning   guns  ?
