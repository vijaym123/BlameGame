  Assault rifles are no different than any other   firearm  . With the exception of appearence. As far as fully automatic weapons go, the only way you can legally own one is to have a federal   firearms   liscense. Which envolves a background check, inspections, properly secured storage, and a nominal fee. Maximum capacity magazines are irrelavent. It's just that much more   money   you send down the barrel when you shoot. When you start talking about banning certain firearms, you leave the door open for other things. High capacity leads to bullet type. appearance leads to caliber. Pretty soon, your down to the pump shotgun and rimfire. If you haven't seen or heard about all of the anti-gun legislature, that is their sole purpose. COMPLETE DISARMAMENT. And anyone that can think for themselves knows that when a   society   can no longer defend themselve from tyrannicle government, freedom and liberty are no longer. Don't let it happen. Your classic styled   guns   or a weekend plinker using an AR type rifle. It's all the same to them.
