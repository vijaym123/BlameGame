i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. guns used for hunting are fine, but they do not serve any purpose other then that. guns such as AK-47's should be band because they are overkill. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer. kind of like how some knives such as switchblades are banned because they serve little purpose.
