If you do an internet search on the Brady Bunch you will find that they do advovate totally disarming the entire population. There are probably a number of reasons for this so just consider this one possibility: the belief in a utopian society. I am always concerned when people push Utopia. It is unattainable except at the cost of the people. I would not care to live in the sterile environment of such a society in which freedom lost is the cost. Further, consider who the allies of the Brady Bunch are: DiFi, Carolyn McCarthy, Chuck U Schumer, et al. Research their anti-gun positions.
