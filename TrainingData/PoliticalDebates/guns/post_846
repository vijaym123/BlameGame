I think that the statement of "Guns kill people. Guns kill children" is totally true. But people try and tell you that its the person that uses the gun to kill that people and the children or they could have a mental disease that makes them do it and then later they don't understand what they did. Wrong. I think that if somebody is mental, they should even get a gun. I feel that only police and other people in that group of upper class people like that should be the only ones with guns and weapons like that. Well what about the defense of people? What if you get robbed and he has a weapon (not a gun) and you have nothing to defend yourself because of this law. Well that sucks (: No with less guns getting robbed shouldn't be a big deal... Use a frying pan or something to protect yourself or better yet call the cops. But guns do kill people and children, yes it is fair that police and upper class or that enforcement get guns (they need them and use them for a purpose). THE RIGHTS FOR GUN SHOULD BE LIMITED FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR THE BAD REASONS AND GIVE THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR GOOD REASONS TO HELP AND SAVE PEOPLES LIVES (:
