#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
 A ban on legal handguns disadvantages citizens against armed criminals. Criminals, who are able to acquire guns,irrespective of the illegality of doing so, welcome a ban on legal handgun ownership. This is because it decreases the risks that they will rob or attack a citizen that has a handgun, and whom may attack back.
