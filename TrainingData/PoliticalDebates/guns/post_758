I know how to load a gun, hold a gun, and fire a gun. I wasn't a bad shot when I was practicing. That does indeed make me unlikely to just accidentally shoot someone. What about the situations you want people to be carrying a gun for? Put me in a school hallway with gunshots coming closer and a gun in my hand, and it probably would end badly; I'd worry I would shoot the wrong person for running through a door and startling me. I have even less confidence in the nerve and judgement of the student body. Flight beats fight unless you've trained for combat. Colleges aren't a threatening atmosphere. Anyone who gets up in the middle of junior year, after an entire year and a half of no incidents and seeing no weapons, and still straps on their concealed-carry holster might just have an issue with his or her threat-assessment meter. That's... uninspiring.
