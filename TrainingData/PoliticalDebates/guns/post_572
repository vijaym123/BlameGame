From your perspective I can only imagine how much safer you feel. I too carry a handgun for personal defense, in addition I have a CCL which permits me to carry a concealed gun in public (there are exceptions to this which vary from state to state). I live in a rough town, not to mention I teach at a high school which is prone to violence, and I just wish they'd let the teachers carry handguns for protection as well.
