If you stay in the city and are uncomfortable with   firearms   then by all means, don't buy one.  We're talking about people who want them for perfectly legitimate and necessary reasons of self defense, to have them in   national parks  .National parks are, in many places, wilderness.  Wilderness with   animals  , reptiles and sometimes people who threaten other people's personal safety.  We are afforded a right to self defense by any means through common and established   law  .  Removing one of the best and immediate ways of self defense by banning firearms in National Parks significantly impedes that right.  I am happy the government finally realized that.I always carry a firearm when I go into the woods, most often a handgun because it's smaller, lighter and easier with which to navigate through the bush.  I always felt ignoring this law would be the best policy for myself, believing that facing a judge would be more preferable than facing a pack of feral dogs or some other wild animal that would do me harm.  Judges and juries can be reasoned with.  Hungry and enraged wild animals cannot.
