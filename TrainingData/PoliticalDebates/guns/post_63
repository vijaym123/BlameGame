To maintain the handgun ban a change in the constitution is imperative The constitution is the basis for allowing gun possession within the US society. All court decisions go back to the Second Amendment text and interpret it either  by the spirit of the law or by the letter of the law. The actual possibility of possession of guns within the US society is  guaranteed through the existence of the amendment per se. Constant interpretations and different conclusions drawn upon the same text mean that any radical decisions regarding banning guns can always be argued against based on the same text of the amendment.If consensus is reached about enacting such a change within society such as banning guns than it must be legitimized  by a change in the constitution .In this will reflect a common will of the people in the  foundation  of all the legal system within the US i.e the constitution.
