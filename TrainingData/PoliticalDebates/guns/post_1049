 We used to have  slack gun laws over here ,but then things like the Hungerford massacre happened.All our gun laws changed and restricted what guns were legal.  /> And thankfully no one has had the ability to go crazy and shoot up a school, no civilian should be able to have a firearm unless it's a hunting rifle.
