I was about to commend you for being one of the only no arguments that offered a calm, thought out statement.  Then I read your Neutralizing argument and lost hope.You see all life is not precious.  Someone who wold only do harm to thier   society   has no place in that society.  And there are those of us who would be happy to do what you are unwilling or unable to do, remove that person from our society.To me the most intelligent choice is to arm myself equally or more than anyone who might choose to do harm to me or my loved ones.  This is not lazy or brutish.  And beyond all of this your "all life is precious" argument falls flat in the fact that you support a government who murders millions of innocents through collateral damge around the world fighting unjust wars.But the real issue is deterence.  Most of the time the mere presence of an armed citizen is enough to deter any from even initiating an attack.
