My wife and I were sitting at home watching tv one evening when we noticed something moving outside of our living room window.  As we continued to sit there, we noticed that there were two men looking in our living room window.  They looked in and then moved away.  It was not long until they were back.  This time they stayed watching for a longer time.  I picked up the phone, dialed 911.  The operator told me that it would be 15 to 20 minutes before an officer could get to our home.  Not knowing what was to come, I went to the bedroom and got the shotgun.  When they came back the third time, I leveled the shotgun at the window.  I did not fire.  However, they did leave and did not come back.  Later that night, they broke in and raped a women a couple doors down from us.  Do I believe in guns saving lives?  Yes, I do.
