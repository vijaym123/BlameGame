Shadow, I take some comfort in your reassuring words about the US military and their primary loyalty to the Constitution rather than to the C-in-C.  But I still worry that the line between "Constitutional" and Unconstitutional" may be vague or difficult to define in a particular circumstance.  It's not a question of loyalty.  Its a question of knowing when a line has been crossed.  But lines are never that clear.  Look at the war on terror.  Warrantless wiretapping?  Secret courts?  Military tribunals?  "Detainees" who are nether prisoners of war nor criminals?  War with no declaration from Congress?  It seems to me that we have crossed a line (or are at least pretty close), but there is hardly any outcry from the public, and certainly no evidence that the military is thinking coup.  If you throw a frog into a pot of boiling water, it will jump right out again.  But if you put it in a pot of cool water and slowly turn up the heat until boiling, it will stay put until it's dead.  I think the water is warmer now than it ever has been...and no one has noticed.  Sid
