Actually, if you read the chart I gave you, you'll see that Chicago is ranked 15th. No, that's not just the order it is listed in.Burke's arguement is specifically that places where guns are illegal has more gun deaths. That's his arguement. That's the arguement I answered. That chart shows conclusively that the opposite is true.The graph is based on per capita, so that DC has less people is completely irrevelant. You do know what per capita means don't you? That means it's taking into consideration the population.You are just going to have to face the fact that places where guns are legal, have more gun related deaths.That's the arguement Burke put forth. That's the arguement I rebutted. And the facts show conclusively that I am correct.I'm not sure what your arguement is at all.
