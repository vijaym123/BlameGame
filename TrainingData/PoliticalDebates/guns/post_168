"Keep" could confer only a collective right to keep and store, not a personal right. It is possible that the intention of the Second Amendment was for communities to collectively "keep" in storage their weapons, but not necessarily for them to keep these weapons in their homes as personal possessions. It should be considered that a keep is noun, referring to a place of safe storage. To keep, then, to some extent has the notion of safe storage associated with it. Thus, a right to keep arms could simply mean the right to keep weapons in community safe storage.
