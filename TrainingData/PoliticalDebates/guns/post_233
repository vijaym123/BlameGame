Same scenario.  Your boys snuck out and then snuck back in... and did a piss-poor job doing it, breaking a lamp.  Your wife is scared. She gets the gun out, and sneaks to the top of the stairs and shoots.  You will never know what this is actually like, hopefully...  but this is what happens more often than not.  If you're so scared of someone breaking in, you should buy an alarm and a get a dog.
