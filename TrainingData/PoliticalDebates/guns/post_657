I am hard pressed think of any weapon you showed to a continental soldier or framer would be outside his imagination.  At the time of the Constitutional Congress, ALL rifles were assault rifles.The entire purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to ensure the civilian populace has the power to overthrow the government.  I understand the utility of instant checks to keep powerful weapons from felons and the insane, but who has what should never be in a database.  We saw what the Germans did with that information, and we should all be very suspicious of anyone who claims "it can't happen here."Vigilance is among the smaller costs of freedom.-James
