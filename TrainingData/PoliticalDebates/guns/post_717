"a drunk kid with a permit .. at a party"First off, the folks that would be allowed to carry on campus would be the ones that are LICENSED to do so. They ALREADY carry these firearms.We dont hear about these students "shooting" other students at parties... Allowing students to carry on campus would just allow them to walk across the campus line with their firearm that they ALREADY carry virtually everywhere else.We are talking about concealed carry in a CLASSROOM environment.We dont hear about Students that are licensed to carry, shooting up parties off campus. Why would these 21+ year olds start opening fire at those same parties when the only thing that would change is the allowance to carry IN CLASS.
