It's always an amusement for me when I consider the specious nature of those who tout "gun control."  With the simple fact that gun laws ONLY affect the law abiding, you might think that what's really required is a sure and severe punishment for those that break the law whether it be by misuse of a hand gun or a Ping Eye 7 iron.The anthropomorphizing of an inanimate object when it comes to assignation of blame is a specious argument and a vacuous concept.  The problem with the pro gun-control lobby is that they are focused on the symptom and not the disease.  Guns are neither good nor bad, those attributes are properly reserved for people.  Knowing that, we should enforce the laws against criminals and for gosh sake stop blaming the tools.
