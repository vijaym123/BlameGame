 The only thing I have to say about this is:  /   /> GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE. PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.  />   /> If there was a way to control people then you could stop gun violence all together but seeing as you cant do that you cant stop gun violence. Once you have a solution to how to control people Mr Flagg I would love to know. Thanks And don't come back with stricter laws because most gun violence is with an illegal gun. So people just need to educate themselves about proper gun use. This wouldn't make gun violence end but it would help to make the population more aware.
