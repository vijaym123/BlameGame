Sorry but I have never ran across any one as left as you.Why would any one want to give up any of there freedoms.Freedom is what made this country Great!When someone trys to take any freedoms from any America that is when there on the fighting side of me. Americas have died so you can have your freedoms! So why would you wont to take other Americas freedoms away?
