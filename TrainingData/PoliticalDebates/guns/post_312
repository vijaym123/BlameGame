"Peace comes through laws"? Come on. There are hundreds of laws on the books regarding   guns  , yet they do not prevent gun crimes from happening. In contrast, gun ownership in this country is at an all time high. In 1986, only six states allowed you to carry a gun. Today 48 allow at least limited carry, with about 40 allowing most   law  -abiding citizens to carry. And   murder   rates are at a 35 year low. And there are over 4,000 defensive uses of   firearms   every day in this country, so the reality doesn't match your implication that guns don't protect you.
