The US Constitution is so frequently called upon for support for free gun ownership and yet it appears those who use it to defend their arguments seem to have forgotten to read it. The protection afforded by the Constitution is not for personal unsupervised ownership of   guns   , but the right to formation and governance of militia (National Guard, Army, ...). Specifically:"To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the   discipline   prescribed by Congress;The logical extreme of this so-called right? Personal   nuclear     firearms   ? Mandatory gun ownership? School   children   required to wear holsters as part of their school uniforms? Some of this is already happening ... Because of guns, America is the least safe country in the world. If nothing else, handguns should be eliminated. I challenge anyone to explain why handguns (concealed guns) are needed - except for   law   enforcement or for personal use to defend against other handguns. If handguns were banned, then only criminals would have them for a while, making it easy to pick out the ones the   police   should shoot. Home owners could still have a personal Uzi at home. Still, far fewer people would die given the majority of   deaths   are passion-related - killed by someone you know and/or love.I have lived in 2 countries where guns were banned and can attest to the safety and calm it affords the citizens not to have to worry about being held up at gunpoint, shot by a road-rager, killed by an angry spouse.   Americans   deserve a hand-gun free country.
