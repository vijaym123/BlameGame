A background check is different than a waiting period--I agree with reasonable background checks, but in most cases that can be done by phone in a few minutes, without a significant wait.  A wait inconveniences the law abiding--I'm allowed to carry a gun, and I already own several.  There is no gun shop in my town.  A waiting period would mean that if I wanted yet another gun, I'd go to the gun shop, almost certainly while carrying one of the guns I already own, pick out my new gun...then I'd have to drive back to the shop once the wait was over.  If I see a bargain while I'm visiting the other end of the state, I essentially have to pass it by.  Waiting periods may have made some sense for first-time buyers before technology made instant checks possible.
