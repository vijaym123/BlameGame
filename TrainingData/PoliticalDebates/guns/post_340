That's why even they can't provide a study that shows that banning   guns  , or even restricting access to them by   law  -abiding citizens results in a reduction in   crime  . However, if you have access to such a study, can you please provide it here? I will personally forward it to the Brady Campaign if you can. On the other hand, there are plenty of studies that show a reduction in crime in areas where handgun carry is allowed. So to say that the evidence is ambiguous is a misrepresentation of the facts. And in general I agree with your statement on anecdotes. But they do serve to emphasize a point. I guess you said that though, didn't you? ;-) Good closing statement too.
