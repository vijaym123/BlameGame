It is physically impossible for the police to be everywhere at all times. Both Vtech and NIU had officers or some form of security on campus and shootings still occurred. At NIU the officers responded in under 3 minutes and still 6 people died. That is a phenomenal response time and people still were killed and injured. Not to mention according to the supreme court case Warren v. District of Columbia the police are under know legal responsibility to protect any specific citizen. So actually it is YOUR responsibility to protect yourself so no blaming the government for this one its all on you.These students are also adults you can only obtain a permit in most states if you are over the age of 21. I don't recall any stories where permit holders got mad and pulled their firearms to scare or intimidate off campus so why would it happen on campus.  That is already illegal to do so why does this scenario happen on campus if it doesn't happen off campus when these adults carry everyday. You are right college students have a lot on their plates but since we already proved it is their responsibility to protect themselves i guess they will have to deal. We don't advocate a permit holder to act as a one man/women police force and go after an assailant we just want the opportunity to defend ourselves when we are directly threatened. Also since you have to be 21 in almost all of the states I am not aware of many 21 year-olds that are just out on their own most are college juniors and seniors and they are adults who can already carry in malls, movie theaters, restaurants and in some states bars. They dont cause problems there so why is it that college campuses automatically make every permit holder a deranged killer.
