#originalTopic=should_Guns_Be_Illigal
 If guns are freely available then gun crime, and death/serious injury from guns will be much higher.  It is as simple as that.  The guns don't kill people, people kill people statement that is trotted out is such waffle.   People cannot shoot someone without a gun just as a gun cannot shoot without a person to pull the trigger.  It is the combination of the two that kills.   There is no need to have guns.
