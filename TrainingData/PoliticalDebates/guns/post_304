The Proper Handling And Use of Weapons - Man's ultimate tool, with a capacity for good and evil almost beyond comprehension, is the ultimate test of maturity and, indeed, wisdom. - AnonymousFrom the time you pick up a firearm, you become a part of a system over which you have complete control. You are the only part of the system that can make a gun safe or unsafe.A firearm is only an instrument. It contains no evil, no conscience, and no ability. It is strictly the intent , competence, and character of its user that decides the outcome of any and all actions taken with it.Remember: no gun can be made accident-proof. A gun is just a machine, with no judgment of its own. It responds to your actions, whether wise or foolish. The only truly effective safety device is the mind of a cautious person who never forgets that a moment's carelessness can produce permanent tragedy.I am a huge believer in the second amendment. I work at a Gun store and I've seen and heard the stories from customers who have been robbed as well as the managers who have been held up. Guns prevent crimes and If you talk to anyone where I work theyll tell you them same. We've seen people come in the store and try to "check," us out and once they saw all the employees carrying weapons they decided it wasnt a good place to try and rob.
