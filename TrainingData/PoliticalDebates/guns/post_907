Yes of course!!Guns might hurt people or even kill people!The point is:u cannot control the ones actually have guns!They will hurt people when they want!!They will use their guns!!If u don't ban it,what is the use of police??They trained to be strong and catch the thieves...Now,all Americans got guns..Even police cannot stop them from stealing..(because they got guns either)...So how can we let the Americans hurt people by using guns again and again?
