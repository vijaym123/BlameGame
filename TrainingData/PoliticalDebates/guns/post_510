The argument that we have problems because we don't enforce the existing laws is a dangerous trap.  The NRA position seems to be "some   guns   are dangerous, but others are not, we should ban the dangerous ones and strictly enforce those bans, but keep sporting   firearms     legal  ."  This is wrong for two reasons.  The first is that all guns are dangerous.  It is not difficult to ruin someone's day with a .22.  This rhetoric leads to a flippant attitude around deadly weapons.  The second reason is that some guns are REALLY dangerous, and that's exactly why we need them.  (Surprised you, didn't I?)  The Founding Fathers didn't consider sport shooting and hunting to be of such value that it required a Constitutional Amendment.  They felt no need to similarly protect other passtimes.  That Amendment was passed because they realized that without arms the people would have no means by which to overthrow the government, and no means to force them to follow the rest of the Constitution.  It's not about safety, or hunting, or sport.  It's about protecting the right of the people to armed insurrection against a tyrranical government.  As such, the "...Right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  That means that our RIGHT to keep AND bear (not just lock unloaded in a safe with trigger guard, but actually carry around with us) ARMS (not just certain guns that the government decides are safe for us to have, but all arms, from a Saturday Night Special to   military  -grade C4) shall not be infringed (limited in any way).  Therefore, the NRA's argument that we "need to enforce the laws on the books," is rubbish.  There should be no laws on the books.
