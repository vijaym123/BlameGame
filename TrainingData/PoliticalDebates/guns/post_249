You don't even know how many   guns   you have??? You are not a gun nut, you're just a nut. You are the kind of person who will have the neighborhood   kids   break in, steal some guns, then go shoot up an entire school.I can't imagine that any responsible gun owner would think what you're doing is safe or intelligent.What it the purpose of having so many guns? Perhaps to make up for some other shortcoming in your life?
