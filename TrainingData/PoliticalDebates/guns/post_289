I don't want a gun and after reading a story about some paranoid who shot his own 3-year old daughter dead through his bedroom door because he was convinced it was a "buglar" the thought of guns makes me sick.  I was in Iraq for two years after the Saddam government fell, and every day I saw the result of people using any gun they could get their hands on to defend their "freedom" apparently - bus loads of people, killed for nothing.  No thanks.
