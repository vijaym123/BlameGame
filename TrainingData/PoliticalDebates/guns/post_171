To "keep" arms could only mean to "upkeep" them in a collective sense. Some interpretations of "keep" have hinted that it is simply to clean, maintain, and "upkeep" arms. This could be done in a barracks, in which case, the right to "keep" arms would have nothing to do with a right to individual possess. In Parker v. District of Columbia (to be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court under the name District of Columbia v. Heller), this argument was made.
