In your previous post you wrote:"The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime   , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required."And then in your reply to my post you wrote:"So sorry to burst your bubble that you believe that no crime can touch you but it can and those that wish to protect themselves are the only ones you are trying to hurt."Now, your ignorance regarding my view of crime notwithstanding, are you adding a feature of the second amendment or are you changing your mind what it's for?I'm ambivalent about   guns  .  I'm quite positive, however, that the more people that carry concealed guns we have the higher the accidental death rate and   murder   rate will go.  When you get people carrying them everywhere they are always available when you've had one too many drinks or you get upset with another driver or you happen to fly into a jealous rage.I'm considering getting some weapons myself, in case you are curious.  I would hate to have all the primitive people around me (read NRA members and criminals) being the only armed ones.
