rudbeckie: "(In South Africa) criminals assume that anyone they attack is carrying and don't bother using the guns as threats. Instead criminals shoot first out of fear that their victims will be able to shoot back otherwise."That's why the death penalty is important.  "The number of robberies that would result in wounded pride and a small financial loss in the U.S. instead result in murder."Many small financial losses add up to big losses.  There are so many robbers in South Africa that if the victims did not defend themselves they'd quickly be stripped of everything.South Africans have the option of copywrighting a white armband to signify to robbers, "I don't resist robbery" and publicizing its meaning throughout the country.  You could have a law that anyone who resists while wearing the white armband is convicted of entrapment and even murder.  The robbers could seek out victims wearing the armband so they wouldn't have to shoot first.  See how few South Africans will be willing to wear the armband!"The only (Americans) I know who have been held up in this country have escaped unharmed, while I have known two S. Africans who were killed during petty theft...."I knew several Americans who were murdered by robbers when they tried to flee without paying.  You are advising us to give up our 4th Amendment Right to Freedom from Unwarranted Searches and Seizures.  If safety is worth giving that up, shouldn't we begin by removing the ACLU handcuffs from the police?Meanwhile, in Europe, where (to judge by the murder rate) there are way fewer violent criminals than in America, you have a much, much higher robbery rate.  In South Africa, people simply need to work together harder to kill criminals faster.
