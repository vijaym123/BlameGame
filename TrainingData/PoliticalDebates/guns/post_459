"The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime   , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required."Hm, that sounds a bit like something you made up.  The actual verbiage of the amendment is as follows:"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."So, you might interpret that to mean states defending themselves against the Federal government, but mostly it sounds like having weapons for use in a, er, well regulated militia.  Well regulated.  Not a bunch of loners carrying around concealed weapons who fancy themselves as some kind of frontier justice.
