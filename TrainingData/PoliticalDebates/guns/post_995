 Ah, but you see, it is partially because of the Brits that we have the second amendment. The original framers of the constitution had developed a bit of distrust in government strong arm tactics due to certain disagreements with the British government and worked to limit government power in a number of ways. One of which was to insure our populations right to arm themselves.   /> Frankly I agree, and I think that history would support me on this. A government needs to be at least slightly afraid of what its people might do, or else they tend to collect more and more powers to themselves, and govern in such a way that has less and less to do with the wishes of the people.
