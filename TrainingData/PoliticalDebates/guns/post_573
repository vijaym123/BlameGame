I support STOPHANDGUNVIOLENCE.ORGThey have helped Massachusetts take the lead in sensible gun laws.See for example,    http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/131-70.htm   It is against the law in Massachusetts for people to let dogs walk in fields or woods during hunting season.Keep your kids safe!  Keep the dogs inside the house for the first two weeks of December!Remember: If dogs are allowed in fields, kids could die!
