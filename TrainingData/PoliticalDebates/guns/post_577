Please, Please show me where in the 2nd amendment to the United States Constitution it has any limitations on the bearing of arms....Personally I feel that everybody should enjoy the freedom to protect themselves, be they felons or even mentally ill people, and the way I feel about it is backed up by the Constitution, as it says we have the freedom to pursue "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" Prohibiting people from owning guns just takes the RKBA from law abiding citizens it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them for evil purposes.If it is felt that a person is too dangerous to own a firearm then that person should not be free in our society he should either be commitment for a mental illness that keeps him from functioning as a member of society or he should be in prison as he is too violent to be among the citizens that are allowed all their freedoms as enumerated in the constitution.
