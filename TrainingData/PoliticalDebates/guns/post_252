Thank you for your concern, but I am quite well protected, thanks.You have unwittingly exposed one of the fatal flaws in the   gun control   argument: the "what if?" You hypothetical situation does nothing to support your position. Given that logic, the fact that my aunt was killed when an 18 wheeler hit her car and it exploded, killing her instantly, even though she was wearing her seat belt, I shouldn't wear a seat belt either, right? Wrong. Because the fact is, both seat belts and   guns   save lives every day. Just because sometimes they don't do it, doesn't mean you shouldn't take proactive steps to increase your chances of surviving when bad things happen.But I don't want to leave your question unanswered. In your situation, chances are my gun would be completely useless. But it doesn't always turn out that way. Ask Tom Jones of College Park, GA, who on May 4 of this year shot and killed one of two home invaders who was pointing a gun at him and his friends. He didn't just surrender his life to the scum who had invaded his home, and saved the lives of 10 people inside his home. But, his gun didn't make him safer, did it? Wrong again.  http://www.wsbtv.com/news/19365762/detail.html  Finally, I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. However, I don't see anything in your statement that would lead me to believe I would be safer if he had been my dog. Cars and people come and go all the time in my subdivision, so a dog barking at those with whom he is unfamiliar would tell me nothing. I have two dogs that bark at even familiar people. Either way, I don't put my safety, and certainly not that of my wife and two   kids  , in the hands (or paws) of anyone but me. Because ultimately, it is my responsibility, and mine alone.
