Actually we will get rid of   guns  . It's just a question of time. Just as gay marriage will be legalised - just as the right have lost, and will continue to lose every significant social battle, including slavery and granting women the vote. The bibles will also go and we will all grow up... the world will move forward... And you will be lost, just as the dinosaurs were... evolve people... evolve - or be lost to the legers of history.
