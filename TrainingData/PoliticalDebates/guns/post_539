I would say that it should be overturned.  All Americans should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they own or carry a hand gun.  I myself see no problem in it.  I do not agree with high noon justice, but I do believe that every American is afforded the right to keep nd bear arms no matter what city or state they live in.
