My fiancee works in city center Philadelphia and is, wind permitting, a well hocked loogie from some not very nice places.  Given that her calves are about the size of my biceps, she can offer about zero effective resistance to anyone offering  her violence.  I hope she never needs to use the pistol she carries, but I'm glad she has it.
