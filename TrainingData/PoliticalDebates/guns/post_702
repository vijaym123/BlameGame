Apples and oranges.   The US is a pretty diverse place. Gun violence here tends to be confined to specific cultural groups that flatly don't exist in most other places.   How many inner city black gangs do you-all have in Australia?  E.g., roughly half of all US murders are committed by blacks,  who represent 14% of the population.  Of this,  the predominant part is committed by inner minority city males between 17-35 years of age,  about 4% of the population.  Much is related to the drug trade. Hispanics and rural white southerners are also disproportionately represented.  The unifying factor seems to be an "Honor culture",  where interpersonal disputes are traditionally resolved by violence.   It is not particularly related to the presence or absence of firearms,  which may actually be scarce overall in high crime areas.  If memory serves,  the murder rates among Americans of European descent tends to resemble that of where their ancestors immigrated from.
