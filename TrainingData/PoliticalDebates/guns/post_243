"Most robbers are there to steal stuff and get away with it."  That's true, guess where they can find the jewelry, the most   money  , and   credit cards  .  In your wallet/purse, around your neck and wrist.  If a bad guy is so brazen as to enter a home with an alarm and shot the dog, do you honestly think that's as far as he'll go?  Why not take hostages?  Why not take that pretty little wife, or   god   forbid, that pretty little daughter?  That's a terrible scenario I know but guess what?  You don't have a   firearm   to defend yourself or family.  You are completely at the bad guys mercy.  If he really is a bad guy, then mercy is definitely NOT what you are going to get.  And for your comment on the police?  There's a saying, even amonst the police.  "When seconds count, the police are only minutes away."  The Supreme Court has ruled that police aren't required to protect it's citizens.   http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14766800&BRD=1585&PAG=461&dept_id=213470&rfi=6    It is up to the individual to protect themselves.  So sitting in your bedroom "hoping" the bad guy(s) will just go about there business then leave.  Well, that's a pipe dream.  As for me personally? I sleep on one side of the house and my   kids   bedrooms are on the other side with the entrances in the middle. God help anybody who tries to keep me from getting to my kids to protect them.I am completely and irreversibly positive   guns   make you safer.
