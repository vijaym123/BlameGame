So you would rather not allow law abiding students any chance at protecting themselves from criminals from various crimes from assault, rape to murder on the fact that there is a small chance of an accident. Firearm accidents are incredibly rare and someone getting injured in a firearm accident is even rarer. But even the federal government states that firearms are used over 2 million times a year for self defense. Also the statement that guns on campus is a completely fallacy, guns are on campus the incidents at VTech and NIU prove that criminals wont follow the law and the cops cant be everywhere at once to protect everyone. Not to mention by your thought cops shouldnt be allowed on campus because they carry firearms and they could accidentally shoot someone.
