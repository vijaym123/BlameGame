Why do you even ask a question based on this premise?I don't live in Shanghai. I would not want to live in Shanghai.  If I lived in Shanghai, I would be trying to change their tryannical rules and probably would be part of a rebellion to change it by force.The US is not a violent   society   compared to other countries.  Thank God the Founders saw the need to guarantee the   right to bear arms   in the Bill of RIghts.I have been living in the US for over 60 years now.  To this day, I have never worried about getting shot going down the streets in any city.  If you are so worried about that, maybe you should move to Shanghi.I like my "  gun culture  " just fine.  I have not seen anything better yet.
