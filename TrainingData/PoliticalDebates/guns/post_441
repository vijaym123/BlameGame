If you REALLY want to evaluate statistics, read John Lott or Ralph Cramer.  THEY have correct statistics.  One of which is; The actual number of weapons in America has INCREASED over the past ten years and the number of violent acts with a weapon has DECREASED. That alone belies the whole premise.The actual number of times that a weapon is used to prevent a   crime   is estimated between one million and two million times a year AND most of them did not require firing the weapon.
