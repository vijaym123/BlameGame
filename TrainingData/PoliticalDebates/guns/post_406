Your statement that "[...]  guns   enable   crime  [...] is completely untrue. Crime existed long before guns ever did. The only thing that taking guns out of the hands of criminals (if that were even possible) and   law  -abiding citizens would do is change the weapon that criminals use. And accepting an increase in "general violence" is not an acceptable side effect of banning guns. What people continue to forget is that the guns are already in the hands of criminals, have always been in the hands of criminals and will continue to be in the hands of criminals. There is still no credible study linking   gun control   and reduction in crime. Until there is, gun control advocates are standing on very shaky ground.
