I currently carry Concealed Weapons Permits(cwp) or Concealed Handgun Licensees(chl) from 3 different states. Two of those state required mandatory training before I was able to obtain the permit or license. Everyone I know that carries practices on a regular basis and/or competes in pistol shooting competition. I have a mandatory 100 rounds a month at the minimum that I must shoot if I am not competing in a competition that month. That is a personal requirement I keep, if I don't shoot that month then I don't carry, from what I have seen from most police firearms training schedules I shoot more than most cops. It is usually closer to 200-300 rounds a month with upwards of 1000 on months with more than one competition or if I can afford it. I am also taking the instructor/range master course this summer so I can teach the class that is necessary to obtain a CWP in my state
