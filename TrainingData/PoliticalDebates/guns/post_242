Well it depends how redneck thrillbilly you are.....  Most robbers are there to steal stuff and get away with it.  If they get caught it does them no good. If you're a robber and an alarm is going off, AND you shot a dog - now is when you run. Neighbors hear things like gun   shots  .  The second the alarm was tripped an alert was sent out.  The police are most likely already dispatched to the location... if they're worth anything other than the pain in the ass they are where I live and can drag themselves away from stopping people who are walking because ....they're walking.....   At this point, what is the point of stealing anything?  You're already going to be seen...  and most likely if you stay to search the house to kill someone, you'll be caught in the act and possibly killed, too.   The people who are in the house are already aware you're there so they're now either hiding or have the doors locked... which means it will take you longer and more bullets to get to them to shoot them... which is not why you're there anyway.  And if it was.. if your sole goal is to kill someone or ones, you're really effing stupid to have gone about it this way.  If you wanted to kill the people, just walk in during dinner and shoot.  You're more likely to get away with it than tripping alarms and shooting dogs.  If you really want to shoot someone... the fact that the other person has a gun won't make that person any safer, if that's your intent.  It just means it's one more thing that'll be left for the family to decide what to do with after the person is dead.   Having a gun doesn't make you safer.
