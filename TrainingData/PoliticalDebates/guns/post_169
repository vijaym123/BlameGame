If the concern was to have a militia for national security or to combat tyranny, the collective meaning of "keep" would make sense. If collective security was the goal, and the existence of a militia was toward this end, then "keeping" weapons collectively would make sense. Why would it matter that individuals keep their weapons in their homes? It's the collective, communal, militia possession that matters.
