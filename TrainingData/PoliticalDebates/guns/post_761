I think that if someone with alot of money wants a concealed wepon because their paranoid shouldn't be able to obtain one.  If they always think that somone is after them then they should get some help.  If its someone that wants one because they would feel safer in a situation when they are robbed then by all means let them have one.  But for paranoid people that are short tempered and tense in a tight spot.
