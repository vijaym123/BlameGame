what im saying here is that we have to be very careful when it comes to this subject of a gun amnesty, as they may take your guns, but then corrupt law members then may give them to some quite nasty organised crime syndicates.For those who want to blindly say the law would not do something like that, then you are not allowing for the strongest existing element- HUMAN NATURE.
