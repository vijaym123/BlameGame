I disagree that the study I suggested would be meaningless. If the study were carried out across a range of areas with similar demographics, in homes with and without   guns  , you could isolate the gun variable to a reasonable degree. Obviously you cannot control for all the extraneous variables and you couldn't categorically say that the rate in homes with guns is X% and in homes without guns it is Y%, but you would be able to determine if there is a visible trend difference. But to a certain extent you are correct in that statistics are easy to distort, and tend to be shaped by how the question is framed.
