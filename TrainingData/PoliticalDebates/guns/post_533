More guns = more gun deaths. Yes of course, I never said otherwise.Clearly having guns provides utility in the form of safety. Indeed guns may actually save lives in some instances, although I have never seen any data to indicate this effect is even the same order of magnitude as its dominant effect.Please look at the relationship between Switzerland and the USA.There does appear to be a more carefully balanced policy that can lead to all the positives and not so many negatives of gun ownership.In answer to your specific points:Out of date; The studies span 5 years, with the newest only 4 years ago. Could you point me to something to shows a dramatic change during this time?Bereft of data; Well no, it contains exactly the data it indicates. How you choose to interpret the data is the interesting part.
