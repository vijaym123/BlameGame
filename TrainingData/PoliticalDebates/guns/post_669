Are there more killings each year by "ordinary" folks or by criminals and thugs? And what business did an 8 year old have even having access to a gun unsupervised? That's not the   constitution  's fault. That's the parent's fault. You're not going to get rid of the   guns  . Face it. So don't try and take mine so that I'm a helpless victim.
