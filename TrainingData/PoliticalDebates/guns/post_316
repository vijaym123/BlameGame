Why do you think the bad guys have   guns  ?  Because they want to take advantage of those of you that don't have guns....watch an old western it's not all about shoot'em up bang bang.  It's about protection from   animals   and humans that want to do bad things to you.  If you have a gun and know how to operate it properly you are more like going to feel safer with it than with out it...Ask a Cop...which would he or she prefer to walk around and try and protect people with or without a gun?
