The point is that my family isn't worth 'playing the odds' with.  I'm not going to stand about saying "there was nothing I could do," when I can buy a gun and go kick some ass.  There IS something you can do.  But you can't wait until the bad guys show up to prepare for it.My family deserves better than excuses and tears on their graves.
