I find your argument inadequate, circumstantial and irrelevant, comparing overall homicide rates to "gun related" deaths.Chicago is 15 on the list because it's sorted alphabetically... :/BTW, Hawaii's figures rival those of Chicago according to that same list.Of course the lowest gun related deaths will be in the the states where guns are banned, duh.Lowest bun not nonexistent.DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.Plus the DC area has fewer population so the 'per capita' figure will naturally tend to be higher.Still it does nothing to counter MBurke12's argument.
