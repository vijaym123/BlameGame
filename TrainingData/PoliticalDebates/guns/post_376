"every day innocent children accidentally kill themselves or are killed by another child" - that is an outright lie at worst, and a complete stretch of the truth at best.  If you include children killed by gang members AND include gang members killed by gang members, then yes every day would certainly be true.  To make such a statement you have to consider everyone under the age of 20 a child & completely innocent.  If you want to end gang violence you need to lock up the gang members, not disarm law abiding citizens.
