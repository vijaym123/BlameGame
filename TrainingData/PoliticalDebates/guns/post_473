Uhh, well, hell yes.We should all get used to seeing citizens carrying   guns  , just like in the Old West.The cops carry them.  Why shouldn't citizens carry them?  Citizens carry guns for the same reasons that cops carry them.  Self-preservation.I just don't see a problem with that.If you are uncomfortable seeing someone with a gun on his hip, you should stay home and watch the Disney Channel.
