The one time I used my 45, I was glad I had it.I was at home ,it was early morning.My dogs were in a kennel in the backyard,barking.Our driveway had no cars in it as my wifes car was in for repair and she was using mine---this is something thieves look for.I was in bed, the dogs had woken me, a shadow went by the bedroom curtain on the sliding glass door,I grabbed my 45,ran down the hall, stopped at the corner and peered around it. I could here prying come from the sliding glass door in our living room.Two guys outside were trying to break in, they thought no one was home-------Surprise-----I held them at gun point called the cops and had even discharged a round to let them know I meant business. Cops came, wife arrived home for lunch, what a day.But in the end it was bad guys-0, good guys-2 ---- 2-bad guys equals 2 points.So, Damn right it makes us safer,but with firearms ownership comes a heap of responsibility, so keep your weapons like you keep your wife and kids, close by your side and respect their unique abilities.
