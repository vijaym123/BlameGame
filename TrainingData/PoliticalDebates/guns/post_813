People need the right of defense, safty, a gun. People argue that it will just put guns in the wrong hands, but arent they already? Really will makeing it Illegal do anything? I think not, because its not Guns that kills people, its people. The gun wont kill you without someone behind it, not all people have the right reasons for haveing a gun, but does that mean people who do have the right reasons will be punished and left unarmed, and defensless?
