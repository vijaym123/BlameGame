"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Ñ That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."  (emphasis added)According to the founding fathers and the Constitution, rights do extend from a deity.  Your simplistic view of religion and recognition of something higher than oneself is misleading.  The argument against handguns as being "unnatural" is absurd.  Just because something is unnatural does not mean that it is a right.  I am fairly certain, though it is possible that I am wrong, that you have argued for healthcare as a right.  Healthcare is not natural.  Clothes, shelter, and a fair and speedy trial are not natural, but they are rights.
