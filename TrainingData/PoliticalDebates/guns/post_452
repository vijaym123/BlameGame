If you really believed that guns in homes are an unacceptable danger and that they have no redeemable value, why don't you and others holding the same belief, put decals on their window and doors declaring your dwelling as a gun free zone.Think of all the health care cost savings that would be realized when the bad guys would know which residences they could rape and plunder without risk of getting shot!
