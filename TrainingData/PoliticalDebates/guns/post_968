#originalTopic=Gun_Control_For_Or_Against
 If you make gun control laws you'll only take guns away from good, law abiding citizens.Criminals  don't licence guns anyway.I believe punishment should be harder for owning an illegal gun.That'll discourage criminals from using firearms while still protecting our rights.Plus banning arms is a fashist policy.
