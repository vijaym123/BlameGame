The decline in assault weapon use is due mainly to a decline in assault pistol (APs) use: According to a 2004 report to the National Institute of Justice, "The decline in the use of AWs has been due primarily to a reduction in the use of assault pistols (APs), which are used in crime more commonly than assault rifles (ARs). There has not been a clear decline in the use of ARs, though assessments are complicated by the rarity of crimes with these weapons and by substitution of post-ban rifles that are very similar to the banned AR models."
