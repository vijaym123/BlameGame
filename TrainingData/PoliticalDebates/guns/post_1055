 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people.'  /   /> Ahh the old ones are the best. Unfortunately guns do make it a hell of a lot EASIER to kill people - squeeze a trigger slightly and somebody dies. You can kill someone from a distance. You can kill someone without them ever seeing you. You can even kill lots of people at once.  />   /> So guns are great, huh?   />   /> Imagine a country where people don't need guns to protect themselves, because hardly anyone has them. In 20 years I've never seen a single gun in Britain, except for the odd one or two on the police guarding important places. Do they exist? Certainly. But they are so rare, that people don't feel so unsafe as to need a gun by their bedside.   />   /> If just one life was saved by making killing that little bit harder - by making people thrust a knife into their victim ; to see the pain and suffering - then it would be worth it, surely? Or maybe you think it'd only be worth it if 100 lives were saved; or 1,000?  />   /> As for this 2nd Amendment guff, even if it said 'people can carry guns' as opposed to just the right to be armed, the name is in the title: AMENDMENT. This constitution of yours isn't fixed in stone; it is designed TO BE MODIFIED to fit the times. Like the little amendment that introduced prohibition - that didn't work out so well, so it was scrapped. England once had a law similar to your 2nd amendment, but we scrapped it over a century ago - so get with the times !
