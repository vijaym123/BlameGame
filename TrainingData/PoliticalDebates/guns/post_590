that in this situation the federal government still controls the army?If the army's on the side of the federal government, I'm sorry but no amount of firearm training will equip you to deal with a tank, a helicopter, a mortar shell. Game over.If the army ISN'T on the side of the federal government, then we've got very little to worry about because they'll take care of things. Like Turkey does every couple of decades.How exactly has the federal government turned against you? I mean that literally. The guy was elected with a majority--a massive majority--and that gives him an awful lot of political capital to spend. So how are the people not with him?Liberal and socialist are certainly political standpoints, and yeah, Obama and Pelosi are relatively left-leaning. This does NOT mean they're out to control the world, or are spying on you. Or you get to shoot them. You cannot shoot a person based on their political beliefs.Who, exactly, is spying on you?
