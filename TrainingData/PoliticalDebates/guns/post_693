The days of people truly needing guns in their everyday lives to protect themselves from predatory animals are gone, at least in the vast majority of the United States (even Montana)  Predatory people, on the other hand, are something else entirely.  Nowhere do law abiding citizens need guns more than in poor urban communities rocked by gang violence.  Gangsters do not follow the laws, nor do they get their guns legally.  Those who intend to use their guns for less-than-legal purposes will aquire them in less-than-legal ways.  The only way to insure that the common man can bring the same firepower as a hardened ganster to the fight at his front door is to lift firearm restrictions.  Gangsters are not the only predatory people out there, however.  In the Declaration of Independence, it is written, "That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it."  The Second Amendment was written to insure that should this country come to such dire straits, the people would be able to fight back.  It is for that reason that any and all restrictions on the Constitutional right to bear arms are unacceptable.  It was the intention of the Founding Fathers for citizens to possess military-grade weapons to prevent the government from overstepping its bounds.  The Supreme Court is NOT the last word against tyranny, it is an educated and well-armed populace.  That is what firearms (and arms in general, as technology advances) mean in America.
