And show me where it says that ONLY members of a militia have the right to bear arms. This is a typical anti-gun misinterpretation of the 2nd Amendment, and it is wrong. The Supreme Court has said it's wrong, history has said it's wrong, and even our founding fathers have said it's wrong. "Arms in the hands of the citizens may be used at individual discretion for the defense of the country, the overthrow of tyranny or private self-defense." - John Adams"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms in his own lands." - Thomas JeffersonI could go on.What it is saying is, since there is a need for a militia, the "right to bear arms shall not be infringed." Nowhere does it say that "the right shall not be infringed if you are a member of a militia."
