do you mean a gun should not be the fall back defensive???The gun is a weapon made for the peasents, for those soldiers who couldnt take years to train. Of all the other weapons in the world the gun is the most efficient for self defense, taking little training and thought to use. Are you saying a knife would work better when the majority of Americans dont even know how to use a knife??? They would end up cutting themselves let alone their assaulters. If one had a gun, a single warning shot in the air will make them run before the need of killing. however one still needs to have the killing intent or they will be attacked and be in a tausle for the gun.
