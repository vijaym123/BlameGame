#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
Historically gun control laws and prohibitions have been applied even at the federal level In 1969 federal legal initiatives aimed at increasing federal control and regulation over gun commerce, possession and licensing.This goes to prove that historically people have aimed at regulating the individual right to bear arms in the name of a greater public safety. The DC Handgun Ban should be analyzed holistically in terms of previous attempts and legal initiatives to control and regulate gun possession.
