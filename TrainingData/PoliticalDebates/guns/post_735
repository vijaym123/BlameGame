I recall as a child (way back in the seventies) my parents driving a neighbor and his wife to the airport. They were going on vacation. When his turn came to board the plane he was asked to open his briefcase. When he did, I remember the sense of awe when I saw a holstered .38 special and his policemans badge.Perhaps had someone like him been on those planes on 9-11, thousands of lives would have been saved.
