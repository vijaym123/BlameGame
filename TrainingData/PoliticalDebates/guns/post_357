I completely agree that the right to carry a gun does indeed make you safer, whether it is in your own home or at a college campus.  I am highly aware the fear people have about the wrong kind of people being able to carry, but the truth is that there are plenty of people that have respect for firearms, and therfore will use them to protect themselves and possibly others if needed.  It makes complete sense that crime would be lower in right to carry states.
