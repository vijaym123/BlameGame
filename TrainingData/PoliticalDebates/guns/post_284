The way I see it--a person has the right to bear arms--especially in his or her home's for protection only.  However a lot of people purchase guns and do not know what to do with them at all.  That is the kind of people  that makes everyone else look bad.  If a person is not instructed on how to use the gun--then they are a danger to themselves and the people they live with.  Remember guns do not kill.  But people kill.  Remember the make my day law???? Anyone--it gives you the right to protect your self and your family as well.  Lets face reality--if a person breaks in to your home with you in it--he or she means business--and you are in grave danger as well---so the only defense would be to have a gun in the house and know how to use it as well. I do not agree with the old cliche--make sure the robbers are in the house and then shoot to kill.  However you can detain them long enough to call the law and have them picked up and put in jail instead---then press charges. As far as guns in a educational facility--I do not agree with that at all.  These are just children that do not have a life line in their stable--and do not have enough common sense to use one correctly as well.
