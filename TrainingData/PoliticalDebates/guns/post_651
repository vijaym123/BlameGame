Adam,How fast does it take for a police officer to be dispatched to a given location on average?For most places, it's 3-5 mins.Most violent crimes take much less time to complete.Those of us that buy and carry guns for protection are sobered by this fact. All "pro gun" and "anti gun" folks agree that violent crime is a problem.  The big difference being that many anti-gun folks feel that the police are a good enough resource.  The fact is, the police are not required to protect you from crime.  Look it up, the supreme court has ruled on this fact.  While the police are necessary, their role in reality is a general duty to enforce the laws.  [South v. Maryland, 59 U.S. (How.) 396, 15 L.Ed., 433 (856)].The duty to protect yourself is up to YOU.  Now, if you don't like guns, that's fine with me.  I happen to think they are a great way for a person to protect themselves.  I'd encourage you to try shooting for yourself to see for yourself.In closing, I'd reverse the question on you and say, why should the government be allowed to forcibly keep me from protecting myself and my loved ones?I don't like answering questions with other questions, but I think in this case it's appropriate."How well has banning illegal drugs helped stem their use?"I think you see where I'm going with this.  When you restrict guns, all you end up doing is giving more power to people to use guns illegally.  You strip the power for regular, law-abiding citizens to use them for their own defense.
