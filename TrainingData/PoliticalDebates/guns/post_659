Why do you want to take my weaponry ??  My conflict is not only with my Represetntatives but also with neighbors like YOU...What are you afraid of from me ,I do not flaunt my gun in your face...I do not use my gun illegally...Why are you so eager to throw away your forefathers experience & knowledge about how government can put you into servitude..Your government just passed a record financial debt on you ,placing you & your children into servitude...Maybe you have a self destructive nature to want us all to become defenceless...I can't help you perpatrate that which I believe to be a fudamental mistake on my part or on societys' part... SORRY...
