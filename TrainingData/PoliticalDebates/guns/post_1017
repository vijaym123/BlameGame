 A city in Florida tried that two decades ago, it got great press at first but eventually it was clear it wasn't lowering crime and in fact the accidental shootings as well as the hassles to some people who really didn't want to pack heat were simply too much, they repealed it.  It's just not that simple.  Even when you think back to the stereotypical Wild Wild West the truth is NOT EVERYONE carried a gun, not even when faced with lawlessness.  Arming society to the teeth just isn't the answer.  />   /> Also think of the parts of the world where everyone is armed now - Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, etc., the presence of all those guns didn't lead to peaceful societies.  The people don't walk around confident no one would dare attack them for fear they'll get gunned down.  Instead the bad guys still make their move, the good or neutral guys hide, and the wide proliferation of guns makes it hard for any civilian or military authority to sort out the good from the bad.
