Until the'70's, congress was the entity which constructed and passed ordinances for DC.  Since congress has (had) bigger fish to fry, they allowed DC to craft and pass ordinances on their own.  In 1975 or so, the DC council passed an ordinance which outlawed *all* private individual new pistol purchases, and required *all* firearms to be either locked separately from ammunition in your home or disassembled and stored (read locked up).  Pistols which were previously owned before the new ordinance were required to be registered."...if you really feel that you cannot protect yourself without a handgun, practise civil disobedience responsibly..."There is something that I would like you (and everyone else reading this) to read: "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" by Martin Luther King.
