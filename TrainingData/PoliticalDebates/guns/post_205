"South Africa has a high crime rate because a lot of the people, ie young men under 35 are unemployed or marginally employed. The police outside of the tourist areas are on the take and wouldn't know how to investigate a crime if the criminal fell on them, the whites have little interest in changing anything as they are still on top economically, the rich are interested only in their swiss bank accounts, and the poor soldier on as always."Other than the fact that I have had rural police in S. Africa be of great assistance to me and I have experienced the frustration of urban cops in the U.S. who were more interested in their own power than helping someone in trouble, I'm not entirely sure how your explanation for the crime rate in S. Africa suggests that the U.S. should be any different. I too am increasingly worried about the direction S. Africa is taking when the current political hero of the day very likely raped at least one woman and got away with it by saying it would have been an insult to her if he hadn't because of the way she dressed (there are at least some cultural differences between our countries). However, I don't think that means that criminals will behave any differently in the U.S. when our population is armed to its teeth. Fear is fear. It can be yours or the criminals' but, oddly enough, the result is the same: heavily armed folks who think it's a good idea to shoot first and worry about the consequences later.(oh, and my earlier comment should read "safe rooms")
