 I think the underlying problems is not that there are too many   guns  , on the other hand there are too many criminals. We want to blame an inanimate object for the obvious failure of the   parenting   skills of a large part of the population. Lets start at the root of the problem, we are raising our   children   to be criminals. Criminals that steal, rob and rape and   murder  . If these people were raised to value human life, who were raised to KNOW the difference between right and wrong, to stay away from those who do not, and raised their voices when they saw the law being broken, then we would not have the need to carry guns. Its not the guns that should be regulated its the parenting skills of people who do not get involved in their children's lives. These   kids   run the streets  following the gangs, listening to music that glorifies the types of behaviors that we as a   society   abhor. And we question why they wound up dead in front of a liquor store. Was it a gun that killed your teen son?  NO!  IT WAS YOU!  You had the responsibility to raise him to be an upright young man and YOU FAILED! Don't blame guns, look in the mirror. Your child is why I must carry a gun to protect my life and the safety of my loved ones
