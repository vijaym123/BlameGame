There is a reason the Army uses guns. . . they deal with folks trying to kill them.  Peper spray and almost anything else "non lethal" is questionable at best as to if it will work.  If they attacker is high on something I almost guarantee it won't work.  Tasers are great but one shot maybe two. . . not good if my life is on the line - cops don't even use them if it is life or death.  Naumadd I wish we lived in a world your ideas would work in but we don't.  I have spent years learning Karate and if attacked and in fear of my life I still would rather have a gun to fall back on.  Only a gun let you deal with the bigger guy, the guy attacking a small woman, drug crazed, the armed attacker or the multiple attacker issue.  It also lets you stay out of reach of his knife or other weapon.  If I am in fear of my life there is no reason I should be forced to use anything less effective than a gun and risk further injury or death because what I use didn't stop the guy.  For now guns are the best we have.  Until something better comes along and we all get to set our phasors on stun then we should be allowed to have a gun if we pass the legal tests to do so.
