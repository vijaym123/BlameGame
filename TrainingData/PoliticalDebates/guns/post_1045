 While I'm not for banning guns, or taking away that right, I don't think that using this type of argument works.  Here's the 2nd Amendment:  />   /> A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.  />   /> There are a lot of interpretations of this floating around, but at first glance it appears to be advocating the use of guns in order to protect the state - which is the job of the military now.
