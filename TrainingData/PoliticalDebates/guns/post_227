As an outsider, I've always found the idea that US citizens feel a need to arm themselves against their government as fairly curious. While I can understand the historical context in which the 2nd Amendment was made, getting my head around the present day relevance of it is difficult. From my (limited) observations, there seems to be a perception of the government as a monolithic ill-intentioned entity that is constantly plotting the oppression of the American people, yet I can see no credible basis for this perception, but perhaps its a cultural thing...From my perspective, government is simply an organisational construct made up of people. People who have more or less the same basic ideas and values as those who distrust the government. It has no will of its own, and can only act through the actions of people. If the people who are acting on the government's behalf are citizens like everyone else, with the same values and beliefs, it seems doubtful that many of them would willingly turn of the majority of their fellows. In my experience, governments are not evil but rather benignly incompetent. When they do harm to people, it tends to be by accident rather than intent. To infer malfeasance from incompetence, and using it to justify an armed populace on the basis of an unlikely scenario eventuating, seems to me to be drawing a very long bow.This brings me to a couple of questions that someone might like to answer for me (or at least comment on):1. Where does the present day fear of government come from? 2. Is it a realistic fear (given the various constitutional mechanisms to prevent the misuse of power)?3. Is being armed against hypothetical government oppression worth all the harm caused by the misuse of   firearms  ?
