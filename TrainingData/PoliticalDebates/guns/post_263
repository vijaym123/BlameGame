Over 2 Million cases of defensive uses of guns every year in the US alone.  Accidental deaths of children by so-called "accidental" shootings are consistently in the double digits typically between 50 & 80.  In fact accidental is the wrong word.  Negligent is the word to use.  In every case of so-called "accidental shootings" multiple standard gun safety rules are violated, and in most cases the negligent discharge is performed by adults mishandling their guns while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  Children are more likely to die by drowning in toilets, bathtubs, or buckets of water than they are to die by negligent discharge, especially if you follow standard safety practices & don't handle your guns while under the influence of  drugs.  Better yet, just stay sober all the time.  You can have just as much fun & best of all, you actually remember the fun you had the next morning!
