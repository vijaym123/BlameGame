 America's modern military makes the militia unnecessary for national security The initial intent of the militia was, in large part, to provide for national security. The concern at the time of drafting the constitution was that the federal government and its military would be incapable of providing for national security. The militia was seen, subsequently, as a means to fill the gaps left by a deficient national military. In modern America, however, it is clear that the military is fully capable of providing for the national defense. As such, the militia is no longer needed to fill in the gaps. The national security context in which the Second Amendment was created, therefore, no longer exists. This means both that the Second Amendment may no longer apply in modern America and also that any individual rights that had applied for the purpose of upholding the militia and national security, may no longer exists as well.
