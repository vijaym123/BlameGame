"But it is no guarantee that you will survive an attack."And if unarmed, you can almost certainly guarantee that you won't. But being armed helps even the odds at the very least and tips the scales in my favor at the most, depending on how the attackers is armed."Gun ownership, as I see it, creates a false sense of security, regardless."There are approximately 4,000 people every day who would disagree with you. There are over 1.5 million defensive uses of   guns   every year, and in 91% of them not a single shot is fired. Merely brandishing a handgun has therefore been proven to be an effective deterrent against   crime  ."Crime rates are far lower in countries that do not allow citizens to own handguns[.]"What about Mexico? Are you implying that Mexico has a lower crime rate than the U.S. They have much stricter   gun control   laws than the U.S. but a much higher crime rate. Or what about Switzerland? Gun ownership there is very high, yet the   homicide   rate is relatively low. The countries that the anti-gun lobby uses as examples are countries, like Japan, that don't have a long history of gun ownership anyway, unlike the United States. According to the U.N. Scotalnd was the most violent developed country, with assault three times more likely than in the U.S."I believe that the rising crime rates from guns in Canada are the results of organized crime and the increasing   drug trafficking   in that country."And despite similar trends in the U.S. crime is at a 35 year low here, while gun ownership is at an all time high. Coincidence? Maybe, but the FBI's crime statistics suggest otherwise. In their survey of all 3504 counties in the U.S. crime is shown to be significantly lower in counties that have few restrictions on gun ownership and carry."I do not believe that the writers of our   U.S. Constitution   meant for the Second Amendment to allow anyone unlimited unchecked access to   firearms  [.]"Those who have studied the writings and lives of them disagree. "Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."        --- Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr, 1785. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, (Memorial Edition) Lipscomb and Bergh, editors. "One loves to possess arms, though they hope never to have occasion for them."         --- Thomas Jefferson to George Washington, 1796. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, (Memorial Edition) Lipscomb and Bergh, editors."No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms."         ---Thomas Jefferson: Draft Virginia Constitution, 1776."To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to demolish every   constitution  , and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental   law   of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws."         ---John Adams, A Defence of the Constitutions of the United States 475 (1787-1788) I could go on, but you get the point."The numbers of handguns and firearms severely outnumber the entire population of our country, and that's a very chilling thought."Yes, it is chilling to me how 280 million (estimated number of guns in owned in the U.S.) outnumbers over 360 million (estimated number of people in the U.S.). Chills me right to the bone in fact. Even more chilling is the fact that 60-65 million homes have guns. And yet there aren't 60-65 million   shooting   deaths every year. Chilling. Brrrrr. Do the research and you will see that guns in America do make you safer. No amount of emotional arguments or skewing of statistics, or even outright lying by the Brady Bunch, the antiFreedom States Alliance, or the aptly names Violence Policy Center will change that.
