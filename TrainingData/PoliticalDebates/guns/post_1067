 Let me write this carefully.  I'm neither 100% one way or the other BUT I did have to research and debate this topic in college...  />   /> It's undeniable crimes are higher in countries with lots of guns.  Yet there's also a grain of truth to the simple claim that when you ban guns only the criminal will have guns.  What you need is a careful middle ground.  Personally I say 1) Guns should be registered and gun holders should be licensed.  You have to be licensed if you own a car because if the wrong person is driving badly they may kill someone, the same should be true with having a gun.  2) Procuring the gun should require some sort of background check and/or waiting period.  Look if you're truly legit you've got nothing to fear from be checked out or waiting a bit longer.  3) Gun training should be mandatory for gun owners and include awareness of the law, gun safety including lock-up and anti-theft, as well as basic gun maintenance and practice shooting.  If you're going to have the gun you should do it right.  4) Military weapons are for the military.  The right to keep and bear arms does not mean any and every type of gun that can ever possibly exist is yours to have.  Ordinary guns - rifles, shotguns, even some pistols, those are fair game.  But the common citizen has no business owning 50mm machine guns, rocket launchers, armor piercing bullets, etc.  />   /> So, I'm saying "against" because I don't think it's as simple as make them illegal.  Instead make ownership of them RESPONSIBLE and add serious consequences for those who are irresponsible.  />   /> And frankly the 2nd Amendment buffs who are going to vent and say no restriction of any kind ever should be on guns are doing a tremendous disservice to their cause.  Frankly I would prefer to utterly ban all guns instead of allow a wild wild west anything goes scenario.
