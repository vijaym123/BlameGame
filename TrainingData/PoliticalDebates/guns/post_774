My Reasons why No Guns on Campus:1) Someone who may have a mental illness may hurt or kill someone.2) There are some(or a lot) of cases that kids in Elementry, Middle and High schools manage to get guns from their parents' or grandparents' room or get a gun from someone else.3) Some colleges tend to have their students to have parties with alchols and if two people(may be drunk) may began to argue a bit and out of norwhere, one of them pull out a gun and shot the another person.I understand couple of colleges allow their students(21 and over) to carry weapons and guns save lives, but guns can also take others lives of innocent people.
