i don't think we should ban all guns, but certainly some. if you want to hunt, then go ahead a buy a hunting rifle, but what if the purpose of a gun other then that. getting one for protection is stupid since there are many other options you have before resorting to a gun for protection. think about getting an alarm, moving to a low crime area, or buying a guard dog. i think guns such as AK-47's are overkill and should be banned. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer?
