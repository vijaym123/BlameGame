Aaaaand, in the event that you don't actually hear someone until it's too late, part of being a responsible gun owner is ensuring that access to you weapon is limited.   In my room is a locked closet with a locked cabinet. In a separate closet is a locked safe with ammunition.     I Have to do this because I have a child.  I can't take into account what my child will one day do, even if he appears to be going down the correct path.  At the moment it's even more necessary because of my child's age. My weapons of deer destruction are really of little use to me unless I have pre-warning that someone has entered my "zone".  Can I say "breached my perimeter"? Is that too Sargento of me?   Same scenario... those aren't the kids, they're really intruders, and they're good at what they do.  They are in your wife's room before she even wakes up.  What good is that gun going to do her?  That's why it's the last line of defense.   Buy an alarm, get a dog.  If you're so worried about your family...  suck it up.  Besides... this guy has kids.  You and I both know full well he doesn't have loaded guns.  And if he does, they are securely locked.    It's almost to the point of being useless, like I said.
