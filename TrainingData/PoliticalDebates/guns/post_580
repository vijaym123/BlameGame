If the ban was so effective then Washington DC would have lead the nation as one of the safest cities, not one of the most dangerous.you had to pander to suicide to try to find some statistic that in some way could paint DC as not one of the most violent places in the country.Population density and poverty create violence- not the availability of guns. Attacks on guns are heart string issues that waste funds and pander to voters during election cycles. If you cared about the constituency of the people you served, you would stop stripping them of rights and treating them as incompetent, and empower them. Allow them their rights, show that they can be something, and put the piles of money into something productive.
