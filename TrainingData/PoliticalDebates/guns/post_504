For one Obama is staying Way far away from the gun debate with good reason. He knows better. It would draw the focus away from the things he actually wants to get done, which is exactly what the GOP wants so they can paint him as a failure and get a right wing back in the white house.He's carefully avoiding intractable issues like   gun law  , until more pressing and solvable issues are taken care of.For two, capitalizing on knee jerk reactions to further polarize voters it was Republicans who sponsored a bill attempting to reinstate the   assault weapons   ban.Specifically...H.R. 6257: 110th Congress Assault Weapons Ban Reauthorization Act of 2008Rep.
