This argument has a good point.  While the idea of keeping a concealed gun at college may seem like a logical way to protect oneself from assaulters, it is actually true that this is still very dangerous.  As this article discusses, there is a chance that the weapon can be shot accidently or shot while unknowingly still holding ammo.  Even the purchasers of these guns may not be fully aware as to how to use them properly.  The owners of these weapons may be scared young adults choosing to keep one just in case, a desperate way to keep themselves safe which in reality is puts not only jeopardizes their own health, but the health of those around them as well.  These risks are not worth someone's life; as the article clearly states, "If there are no guns on campus, these types of accidents [as in gun shootings] cannot occur."
