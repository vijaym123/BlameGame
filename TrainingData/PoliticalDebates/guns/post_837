Guns rights is in a pretty good position right now. You can own a gun, if proven trustworthy. This is not the case in all states, but it is in most. Some argue that it is dangerous to be giving out guns, but with guns-rights or no gun-rights criminals will still have guns. However, the average person who wants to own a gun for self-defense will be prohibited to without guns-rights. Meanwhile, with gun-rights the average person can own a gun AND protect himself against criminals.
