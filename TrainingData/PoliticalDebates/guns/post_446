There are several statistical problems with the claim that a household with a gun is at added risk. The biggest problem is including households with convicted criminal gun owners in the pool--People who are already breaking existing gun laws.  Being a felon is extremely risky, roughly half of all murder victims are convicted felons.  If you were to separate the law-abiding gun owners from armed criminal households, the numbers would look much different.  It is difficult to determine which homes are truly gun-free--Many people will not admit to having guns, either in fear of prosecution, or fear of theft, so many "nonviolent gun" homes get counted as "nonviolent gun-free".   On the other hand, it is easy to determine that a house where gun violence occurred had a gun in it.
