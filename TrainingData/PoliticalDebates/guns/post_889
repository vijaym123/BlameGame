So let me get this straight... Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff, that means that they are not going to rape your wife and daughter in front of you while you're tied to a chair then kill all 3 of you after they get their kicks then take your stuff? Uh, who's going to collect the insurance? Probably whoever is not at home durring that time I guess, or some other family members currently not living there right?
