I'll assume for arguements sake, that you are correct that Lincoln nationalized the state militias-I would to when these states are about to go to war against the union!  Virginia succeeded just as quickly as the rest of the south except in the western area of Virginia which was anti-slavery and becamed West Virginia in 1863. Not sure what your point was other that you think people have the right to own   guns  ! As a true pacifist, I would be horrified at huge numbers of guns that are sold to people and the carnage from these guns perpetrated onto socieity!  Drive by shootings, school shootings where   kids   are senselessly murdered.  Go to any urban hospital and talk to   doctors   in the emergency rooms, and they will tell you about victims who were shot! Urban warfare exists in many of our cities due in part, to the proliferation of guns and the easy access to get them.  But the NRA has always been against background checks, or any common sense measures to make sure that guns don't get in the wrong hands!  The 2 kids at Columbine High School stole their guns from one of the gunmen's grandfather and then massacred all those innocent people!  Hunters and sportsmen are fine as long as they keep their arsenal secured and out of the reach of minors!  Of course, I still don't think you need a machine gun or a AK-47 to go out and kill bambi either!
