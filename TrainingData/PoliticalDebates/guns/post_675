I dont know if you are aware of the fact that one of the first things hitler did was take away the right to bear arms from the german people. he would send them into battle to die,but you were not allowed to own a firearm. my grandparents were from germany. and propaganda is one of the things that the brady bunch thrives on.  doctors kill untold thousands with their daily meds,alchohol kills around 400,000 people a year,but the brady bunch worries about firearms.  and yes the brady bunch is a subversive ,lying bunch of anti constitution socialists who thinks the government should meddle in every aspect of our lives. grow up! you listen to tv propaganda too much.
