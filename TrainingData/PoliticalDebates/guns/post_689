Private citizens can access the NICS background system if they are a firearms collector, and you can refuse sale to any private person if you have the slightest suspicion they are in anyway dishonest. I have done a number of these 'dastardly private transactions' and I can say with 100% certainty that in my experience, this 'loophole' is non-existent. records are still always kept by both sides, usually a copy of a drivers license at the minimum, and often, if one party has any kind of status to call in background checks they do so on behalf of both parties to keep everyone happy and safe.Further- in many states the private sale of handguns is regulated so that even if you want to sell a firearm privately, you still must do so at the pistol licensing authority, in the local sheriff dept, transferring serial number locks, and other required bits of information. The Brady Campaign completely ignores that fact.  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=licreg  this is a final point about registration. Much of what they propose already happens, and much of what the rest of they propose here is meant to increase the cost of firearm ownership to the point as to price much of the middle class out of the market. (the lower class, as a result of regulations like this have already been priced out in many areas)The Brady Campaign has softened their outward exterior in an attempt to gain favor with the public. They were too extreme with their views in the 90s; however the people have not changed, nor has their mission. They just repackaged themselves in an attempt to confuse and mislead people into following their agenda.sorry it took so long to respond, your arguments are valid and deserved an adequate response.
