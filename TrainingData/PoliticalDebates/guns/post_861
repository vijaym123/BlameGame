Guns play a huge role in intimidation as well. If I am strapped for cash and decide that the only way to make any money would be to rob somebody, I think I'd rather rob a store without a gun than a store with a gun. They can be used for bad things, but legal guns are typically used for good or for protection from illegal guns.
