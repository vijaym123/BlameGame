#originalTopic=Debate:_Right_to_bear_arms_in_the_US
If "bear" was commonly taken in a military sense, "keep" should also be considered in military, collective sense. The right of the people is to "keep and bear arms". It is difficult to separate "keep" and "bear" when they are structured in this way. It would appear that they were meant to be read in the same context. If we conclude that "bear" likely has a military/militia meaning, then it is logical to take "keep" in the same vein. "Keep" would then be considered part of the militia's "keeping" of weapons, rather than in a more individual, home-storage sense.
