In Iraq and Afghanistan every time a US soldier gets killed some civilians join to take his spot. So the army is refueled by the people behind it. In the case that an army is turned on its own people you have the issue of where the new soldiers come from. You could conscript them from the cities you capture, but whats to stop them and their CO's from joining the rebels after you supply them with weapons and armor? And say your tank gets blown up, where are they going to remake it? Artillery is a problem, but will Johny boy shoot at his own home?While the government may try to repress a few rebellious cities with the army, they could not ever win a full blown war with the population.
