I'm sick and tired of seeing the Republican party painted as radical right-wingers on the mainstream   media  , and as protectors of liberty on Fox News.  What a joke!  The Republicans are just as socialist as the Dems, but paint themselves as defenders of the Constitution and promoters of "limited government" (as if such a thing were possible).  The Democrats make the whole thing worse by painting them as radicals, when they are anything but.  Hopefully President Obama screws up quick enough that the people haven't forgotten the miserable failures of Bush, and just decide to get rid of them all.  They keep painting this picture of Red vs. Blue, when really they're just two sides of the same statist coin.  The real conflict in this country is between Statist and Libertarian, but the major political parties obfuscate this point to get away with blatant Statism that would never get by the people honestly.  Hopefully Ol' Barry goes too far and shocks some sense into people.  Historically, high   food   prices has been enough to do the trick, and that's coming quick.
