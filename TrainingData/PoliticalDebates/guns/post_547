Two words: Kennesaw, Georgia. In 1982 they enacted a   law   requiring every head of household to have a gun. They haven't had a   homicide   in twenty years. Show me another town of similar size in the U.S., especially one that bans handguns altogether, that can make that claim. "Still, far fewer people would die given the majority of   deaths   are passion-related - killed by someone you know and/or love."Wrong. The majority of handgun deaths are gang related. You could argue that rival gangs' hatred of each other is "passion" but that's not what the statement implies. Get rid of gangs, and you go a long way toward eliminating handgun violence."except for law enforcement or for personal use to defend against other handguns."So handguns should be eliminated, except for self defense use? I'm confused. Isn't that the major reason   gun rights   advocates are for handguns? It's sure the reason I carry one. And I like how you assert that it's bad to have handguns, but an Uzi is OK. That's rational.
