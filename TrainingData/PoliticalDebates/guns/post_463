Kelly,I forgot to   add   those studies to the bottom of my post that I mentioned earlier. Here is a great collection of gun myths debunked, the   concealed carry   section starts on page 44.  http://gunfacts.info/pdfs/gun-facts/5.1  /gun-facts-5.1-screen.pdfand every claim is given with the proper citation.Here is one international one from Australia that shows you the what happens when   guns   are outlawed and only the criminals have guns.  http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/aus.html  Great Britain is now in teh same boat. After banning all   firearms   knife   crime   went up so much that they are now outlawing any knife over 4 inches. Goes to show you that criminals will still attack and kill no matter what is made illegal. Here is a great one entitled "40 Reasons to support Gun Control" there are actually over 300 reasons but its a good one.   http://www.political-humor.org/40Reasons.shtml  Also look up any work by John Lott Jr. he has done more studies on firearms and their use in crime and who commits those crimes than anyone else.
