Hi LargerHead: I took ur   advice   and looked at 'pocket-pieces' I cud useand which wud fit in my shorts side pockets. The 2 reasons I originallypreferred either an M1 or M94 carbine were: 1. I can hit something far-ther away than with a handgun. 2. I have more chances to keep it/him from getting closer--10/15/30 chances!.. My 3 handgun choices are: 1.Walther PP/PPK German   police   mini-pistol [9mm/.380ACP or 7.65mm/.320ACP]7-8 rounds, each...2. Walther P38/P1/P4 German WW II Army replacement of'08 Lugar Parabellum and post-war Bundeswehr/Landespolizei [9mm/.380ACP]pistol from '57-late 90s...3. S&W 'Lady Smith compact, 5-shot [.38/9mm/.357Mag] FBI/policewomans' piece [easy to conceal/draw...Following uradvice, I wud practice both 'stand-n-extended arm' [match-position] and'crouch-n-point' [FBI/cop-position]. If I had two pistols [one in eachpocket, I cud 'trick-shoot' by firing one, then transferring to the ot-her for 10/13/16 shots--bound to git it/him at least once or twice?.. Iwud keep my trusty carbine nearby, too for 10/15/30 more shots..Aaron..
