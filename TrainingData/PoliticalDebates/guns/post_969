#originalTopic=Gun_Control_For_Or_Against
 While I believe gun control is a good thing (use two hands) creating laws only makes it harder for those who liberals say it's OK to have guns get them.  Gun control laws don't stop bad guys from getting guns.  That's why they're called bad guys.  They don't care about the law.  />   /> I think it should be a law that there is a well maintained firearm in every home in America.  Not for any reason other than to shove my principles down someone else's throat for a change.
