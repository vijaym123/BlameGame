They all got those   guns   from Charles Montgomery. He sometimes works as a   food   prepareer at   schools   or a janitor. He uses different aliases. My scenario is just as made up and unfounded as yours. BTW many prominent government leaders agree with "Only government officials, such as the   police  , should carry guns.", Hilter for example.
