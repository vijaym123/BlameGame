I think if one would look at the laws passed,(and for that matter proposed, one will find that the law abiding citizen is the one impacted by gun control laws. It is a hard thing to deal with the reality that criminals do not buy their guns,they steal them, and then commit crimes. I am wondering where the criminals sense of being law abiding is. As a gun owner, I want more than most to see the crimes committed with a gun to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.I will say it again, in another way, send em to Gitmo. It infuriates me when I behave in a law abiding fashion, and have that behavior threaten my freedoms. As to those who think I should not have a gun just because it scares you, my apologies. You may not , however have my gun(s)
