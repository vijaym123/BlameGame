I realize that you don't much care for the Constitution and the basis for American life over in Australia, but the question is about the USA, and they are an important part of what it means to be Free here.  About the collateral damage, I don't see what you're talking about.  Gang violence is an entirely different beast than the culture of armed, law-abiding citizens.  True American gun culture puts a gun in the hand of a single mother defending her home from an intruder, in the hand of a young woman who would otherwise be raped, in the hands of a minority fending off an angry mob, and in the hands of freedom loving citizen standing in the face of tyranny.  It is this group of gun owners that regulation will harm, not the horrific perversion of gangsters, drug lords, and the disturbed, who generally acquire their guns illegally anyway.  Legal firearms are the best defense against these pervesions, not restrictions that will leave them easy prey.
