even if   guns   were illegal in the US. 99% of the criminals that use them get them illegally and or do not register them. Do you really think if there were   gun laws   the criminals are just going to go "Oh, i guess i wont use guns anymore" NO. We civil people who get our guns legally and registure them will have our guns taken away while crimnals will walk the streets with there black market guns that have not been registered. so the question is "You start walking home from the bar with your wife. A group of men approach you on a dark street. You have your hands. Do you feel safe?" the answer will always be NO. If you dont like the RIGHT we have to bare arms, then you should start learning chinnese because your best bet is to move to China!
