 It really is true that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The US and Canada both have traditions of gun ownership, but very different crime rates.  />   /> In the US each year, there are over 30,000 fatal shootings (1 in 10,000 people).   />   /> In Canada, there are less than 1,000 fatal shootings (1 in 40,000).   />   /> There are only 10 million households in Canada, but 7 million guns! Americans are clearly 4 times more violent than Canadians. Why? Whatever the reason, limiting access to guns probably won't deter all the would-be killers out there.
