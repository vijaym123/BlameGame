 The 2nd amendment which gives us the right to bear arms was for the safety of the people against invaders and if needs be, against the government.  It was initially meant so each state could have their own militia so the federal government didn't end up like the British government was when we fought a revolution against them.    />      In reply to MrFlagg, did you not read the statement?  He said most gun deaths are caused by illegal guns.  You say there need to be stricter gun laws but don't you know anything about human nature?  If something is outlawed people will get it from another source.  It happened with the Prohibition.
