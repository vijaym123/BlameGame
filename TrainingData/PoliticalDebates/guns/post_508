One reason for the lack of enforcement is that there are too many laws now to enforce.  For instance, how many people are aware that a misdemeanor committed thirty or more years ago makes it a felony for the rest of your life, punishable by a mandatory five years in prison, to own so much as a single cartridge of ammunition?  That's only one example of how the 20,000+   gun laws   in this nation can make unknowing criminals of a large segment of our population.  If every current   gun law   was enforced, if every violator was charged, our courts would be backlogged for years, and there would not be enough jails and prisons in the entire country to hold those convicted.
