I think it's funny to suggest that there may be confirmation bias on the part of NRA supporters who call the conclusion of the Hepburn and Hemenway study into question.  One might use the quote: 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.'  One might use this quote as IF the Hepburn and Hemenway study DID find causation, they would AGREE with that causation, which according to their own POV, they WOULD NOT.  May I suggest that the "causation" mentioned is to keep the researchers from having to face endless witch-hunts?  You know, when you disagree, sometimes people tend to get violently 'passionate' with you.Of course when one side uses a document like the Constitution as the basis of their moral arguments, a document written by white slave-owners who imposed martial law to restrict the freedoms of millions... then one will always be correct in their assumptions of safety and freedom behind the barrel and the bullet.
