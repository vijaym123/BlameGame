In modern America, the right to bear arms still helps check government power In the modern day, the importance of checking a tyrannical government remains important and relevant, even if the prospect of a citizen militia overthrowing the United States military is now effectively out of reach. There are numerous ways in which an armed citizen can check government power:
An armed citizen can place a check on abusive police power and the emergence of a police state.
An armed citizenry can ensure that government thinks twice before violating the rights of citizens, or that it considers the potential for violence and bloodshed to be an intolerable risk in the violation of rights.
An armed citizenry empowers citizens to protect themselves, so that a big government doesn't have to.
Finally, the right to bear arms is, in itself, an expression of liberty in the face of government power and control. Upholding this symbol is, perhaps, the most important check that the right to bear arms can place on government power, as it symbolically spills into other fields of individual freedom.
