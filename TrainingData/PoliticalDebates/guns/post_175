"Arms" in the US 2nd Amendment does not exclude personal "arms" While it is possible to argue that the natural interpretation of the language "arms" refers to a military weapon, it is not clear that the framers of the constitution meant for the use of the language "arms" to necessarily exclude an individual right to bear arms.
