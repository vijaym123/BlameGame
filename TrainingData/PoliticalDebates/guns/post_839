We have to look outside the box. Criminals WILL ABSOLUTLEY get a hold of guns whether there is a law banning firearms or not. If you don't believe in guns, then don't buy a damn gun. If you feel safe in your home without a gun, then don't buy a damn gun. If you feel safe walking amongst thieves and murderers with just a can of pepper spray, then....say it with it me.....Don't buy a damn gun. Me? I like the idea that if I have the CHOICE, I could LETHALLY defend me or a loved one. I don't know about you, but I live outside the box. On the outside we don't live in a perfect world where there isn't crime and violence. I'm not a trigger happy fellow either as you might paint us gun rights enthusiasts. I dread the thought of the day I might have to take the life of another human being. You know what though?.....It could be mine that's taken from me if I fail to protect myself. If everyone carried a firearm on them, everywhere they went..... you think Home Invasions, Theft or Murders would occur quite as often? I don't believe so. Half the scum bags would be dead. Take away our weapons.... and you give criminals the chance to flourish.
