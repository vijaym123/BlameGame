South Africa isn't much of a country or a nation ("run by a bunch of buffoons") - when it can't even protect the rights of the individual (life, property, liberty) it cannot begin to say it has its own right as a nation.  There fore, it would be wise for a nation that respects individual rights (at least in theory, maybe not in implementation...ie. USA) to go in and take out those buffoons...and rebuild that country beginning with Individual Rights (this would include the right to have guns to protect life)!  Man...what a mess some of those African countries are in...evil prevails when the good do nothing..... such a shame.
