While I find your argument to be much more logical than most of the "he-man, chest beating" posts about gun ownership, I have a couple of questions for you: 1.  How do you explain the existence of free nations (Canada, the UK, etc) that have strict   gun control   laws? 2.  How do you explain the existence of free nations that have high rates of gun ownership, but low incidences of   gun violence   (ie: Switzerland)?I believe the problem here may not be gun ownership, but the mentality of many people who purchase   guns  . I come from a gun-owning,   hunting   family with several   police   officers in it. My family members who owned guns were responsible, would never have thought to openly carry a loaded weapon (except while ranching, when a loaded rifle was in a carrier in the truck or horse scabbard), and were safe thoughtful people. The mentality of the people in our country seems to be that of provocation and intimidation. I don't think outlawing guns is the answer. We need to do something about the dumbed down, swaggering, spitting, crotch grabbing idiots whose answer to every problem rests in violence. These mass murders of families and random strangers have got to be stopped. I don't feel safe walking our streets any longer. And that isn't the America I knew, and I don't believe it is what the authors of the Constitution intended.
