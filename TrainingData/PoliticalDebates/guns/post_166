Why would the framers be so misleading as to conflate "keep" with "upkeep"? If we are to read "keep" as meaning "upkeep" or maintain in the 2nd Amendment, we are, to some extent, accusing the framers of being highly misleading. The common meaning of "keep" at the time was not "clean" and "maintain", but possess and store. Why would the framers choose to be so misleading? It seems highly unlikely that they would.
