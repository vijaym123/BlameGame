Let's examine this from an historical point of view, rather than as an artificial construction.  From U.S. vs. Miller 1939:"...The Militia which the States were expected to maintain and train is set in contrast with Troops which they were forbidden to keep without the consent of Congress. The sentiment of the time strongly disfavored standing armies; the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time..."From the National Guard Charter:"In addition to the definitions in sections 1-5 of title 1, the    following definitions apply in this title:        (1) "Territory" means any Territory organized after this title      is enacted, so long as it remains a Territory. However, for      purposes of this title and other laws relating to the militia,      the National Guard, the Army National Guard of the United States,      and the Air National Guard of the United States, "Territory"      includes Guam and the Virgin Islands.        (2) "Armed forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine      Corps, and Coast Guard.        (3) "National Guard" means the Army National Guard and the Air      National Guard.        (4) "Army National Guard" means that part of the organized      militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and      the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that -           (A) is a land force;          (B) is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the        sixteenth clause of section 8, article I, of the Constitution;          (C) is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at        Federal expense; and          (D) is federally recognized..."This last means that the Militia are not the National Guard, but that the National Guard will train and equip the members of the militia.  This law changes where the militia acquire military equipment but does not negate both the duty and right to keep and maintain arms "...of the kind in common use at the time..."I don't know if you are familiar with the case or not, but the Supreme Court recently delved in depth with these very subjects: the militia and the individual right to keep and bear arms.

Also, this decision left open the government's power to regulate the right, but not negate it.
