#originalTopic=Debate:_Assault_weapons_ban_in_the_United_States
 An assault weapons ban decreases supply and increases prices, beneficially - While it may be impossible to get rid of all assault weapons, what is possible is to decrease the supply of assault weapons. This makes them more difficult to obtain and drives up their price on the market, which makes them less attractive to prospective buyers. This all generally decreases the presence of assault weapons on the street and in crime.
