You said:"And I disagree that there should be no laws on the books. There should be laws about the ILLEGAL use of   firearms   and consequences for those uses. And those laws should be strictly enforced."But when you look at the actual crimes: assault,   murder  , etc. you see that there are already laws punishing such acts.  Is killing someone with a gun somehow worse than killing them with a rock?  If you ask me, the thought of killing someone by bludgeoning them to a wet and messy death seems far more nefarious and evil than bending a finger at 17 yds. Yet the finger-bending has attached to it a far stiffer sentence.  Yet the opposition calls these laws "common-sense".  And we buy into it? Really?"But, what about acquisition laws for felons or the mentally unstable?" you might ask.I am on the fence here.  I suppose that a person who has been convicted of killing someone else, if they failed rehabilitation, should be barred from gun ownership.  But what about the rehabilitated felon?  Do they deserve to lose constitutionally protected rights?
