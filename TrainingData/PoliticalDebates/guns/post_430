Firstly, about half of all gun deaths are suicides. There are numerous studies that show there is no correlative link between suicide rate and availability of a specific means, let alone a causative one. So we're now down to 15,000 deaths a year, the vast majority of which occur in inner cities where highly invasive gun control laws are the norm. Clearly they are having no effect. In point of fact, there is not a single reliable and valid study out there that shows even a medium correlation between gun control laws and a reduced violence rate.
