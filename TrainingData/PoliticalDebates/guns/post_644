Well it is our right and no one should try to take it away from us.Now I know there are many many idiot's out there who misuse them,but you can't punish everbody cause some guy got shot by some idiot.Guns are a responsibity that should be taken serious, and when not then THE GUITY PERSON SHOULD BE DEALT WITH HARSHLY not everone esle,and folk's this is coming from a guy who has lost someone to a firearm killing!!!!
