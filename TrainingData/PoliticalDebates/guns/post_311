 i believe that as long as criminals roam the streets with   guns   it is our right as   law   abiding citizens to protect ourselves against being made into a victem and as long as someone has something someone else wants the potential of   crime   is real its human nature and has nothing at all to do with living in the states or   china   or the north pole.If every person had a pistol on thier side walking down the street than the crime rates would drop not go up .Why would a criminal attack me for my wallet or kidnap my son if there was 20 guns in his face when he turned around?
