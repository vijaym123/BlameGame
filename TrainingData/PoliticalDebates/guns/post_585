I'm fine with making it harder for people with criminal records to obtain a waepon, I actually think that's an okay idea; however, banning guns altogether is against the US Constitution.  The 2nd amendment states that all citizens have the right to bear arms and that this right shall never be infringed.  The fact that this debate is astonishing to me.Take the peaceful country of Switzerland for example; they boast one of the lowest crime rates in the world (if not the lowest) due to the fact that everyone is armed.  After serving a short term in the army (which I'm not recommending for the US), every man is given a weapon of their choice.  So it's kind of hard to rob a convenience store when the clerk has an AK-47 or a M-16 behind the counter, maybe even a rocket launcher if they want.Guns keep people safe, it's plain and simple.  Like the Swiss have found, it's hard to overpower someone when they're packing a .45 on their hip or purse.  You have the right to defend yourself and guns are one of the best ways to do that.Just remember: 2nd amendment.  Leave the guns alone.
