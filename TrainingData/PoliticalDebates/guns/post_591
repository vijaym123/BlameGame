The issue is that the army would likely split if we all went to extremes.  A serious civil war could occur but I don't believe this will happen.  (I would prefer a civil war to UHC however)Obama was indeed elected by a vast majority... a vast majority of easily convinced sheep people who went along with the trend for various reasons.  This   election   was easily the most intense and divisive I have ever lived through.  Many Americans voted for a socialist president (yes, I can rightly call Obama a socialist) against their true values.  Laziness or hatred of Bush or race caused a lot of people to vote against what they really wanted and valued in our country's leader.  That is why people are starting to go against him now, after following through with a few of his socialist promises (UHC).Personally, I wouldn't say the federal government turned on me. I would say America turned on me.  I am fighting to keep my rights and still people support socialism in America.  If anyone wants socialism, please feel free to move to a country that already has it in place.  Here, socialism is unconstitutional.  Yet I stand by and watch my freedoms disappear.As far as Obama and Pelosi not being out to control the world... why do people pursue   politics  ?  Oh, right. Power.Back to the topic of   guns  , every qualified citizen should own a gun and many should carry them.  This would do little to protect oneself against our overwhelmingly powerful government but it would do a lot to prevent criminals from trying to steal or   murder   or rape because they would be afraid of their own lives.I think the founding fathers would be disappointed with the state of America today.  Already people are eating out of the governments' hands. Literally.
