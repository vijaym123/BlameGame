You've made no arguments. You've simply restated your previous opinions. Your logic is spurious and you evidence anecdotal. You are hip deep in self serving Horatio Alger mythology designed expressly to absolve you of the responsibility of helping your fellow man.May I suggest you start with "A People's History of the United States." by Howard ZinnBesides a   drug war   debate with you in the comments on a gun issue is pointless as you won't be convinced, and very few people interested will see it.Like I said, you shouldn't trust me, go read the relevant studies and history. I know you won't even look you'll just pat yourself on the head and type some more Ad Hominem.Your snide and insulting incredulity at what I know are established well documented facts of history says it all. I will no longer be responding to you, or anyone else on the subject of   drug law   in this thread, we've gone too far off topic already. After decades on the Internet, I know an intractable zealot when I see one.I'm glad you enjoyed writing that post, and if you choose to take the last word and make an argument to which I will not respond I hope you enjoy that as well.
