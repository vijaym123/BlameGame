Sorry but after reading your column which is fraught with a complete lack of facts, I have to wonder about your intelligence. First off it has been proven on many occasions that guns are not the problem and that more guns in the hands of Law Abiding citizens actually deters crime. You don't have to take my word for it, do your due diligence and go no further than the FBI crime statistics and right to carry states.Your fear of guns stems from ignorance of facts which is readily displayed in your column. It would behoove you to actually do some research on the subject at hand before your write something that will be published for public scrutiny.[B]Fact 1[/B]. People will still commit murder and rape, regardless if they have guns or not. People will still kill themselves even without guns.[B]Fact 2[/B]. I refer to actual crime statistics and right to carry comparisons. Every state, county, city that has restrictive gun control has a higher violent crime rate than those that exercise right to carry. And again that is based on facts in evidence from the FBI, not some emotional knee jerk reaction... as 99% of the anti-gun rhetoric is wont to be.[B]Fact 3[/B]. Gun control does not solve the problem, education does.Watch these three clips and begin to understand your stance is one of ignorant fear.-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmrqT9SIkQw   - John Stossel 20/20-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyoLuTjguJA   - Canada's failed gun control-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGVAQOUi6ec   - England's failed gun control|-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkS8mdbml0A&NR=1   Ð Ask Ryan Lee Bergner what she thinks of the idea of disarming the law abiding citizen.-   http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4069761537893819675&p   - Suzanna Gratia Hupp this woman is dead on with her argument[B]Fact 4[/B]. Over 2,000,000 crimes are deterred annually by legally armed citizens. Again these facts can be verified by FBI crime data.I am not going to provide you with the links to the FBI crime data because you can easily find it yourself. Also because you won't pay attention to facts as they are presented. I can pretty much with a 99% certainty guarantee you won't even watch any of the videos provided either No you will continue to cower in fear due to ignorance while good honest law abiding citizens are out there protecting you by exercising their right to carry.The bottom line is you and your agenda are not the solution, you are part of the problem. But you are incapable of admitting or seeing that since you use emotion instead of logic, reason and intelligence guide your through life. Too bad too, you are in a position to actually provide a solution through education, but you chose instead to use fear and ignorance. Just like the last administration did and so the current one will continue to do.Sincerely a law abiding gun owner
