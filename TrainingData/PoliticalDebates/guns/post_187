Since you are using the Roman alphabet and not Chinese calligraphy, then you too are spelling it wrong. Since you are translating from one alphabet to another, there is no "correct" spelling, only "accepted" ones. And both Zedong and Tse Tung are acceptable ones.And as far as "needing" arms to prevent cultural or political change, it depends on which side you're on. If you're the unarmed populace facing a heavily armed and oppressive government regime, you're not going to get the change you want just by wishing it. Even if you say, "Pretty please with sugar on top."
