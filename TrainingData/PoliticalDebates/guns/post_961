#originalTopic=Gun_Control_For_Or_Against
 Gun control laws such as minors can't buy them, criminals can't buy them legally.. Those are good gun control laws. Taking away guns is not going to stop people from killing each other. If I wanted to kill someone, I could stick my pencil alongside their eyeball and they would die. I could put a detonator in a bag of chicken manure and blow up a whole car full of people, should we outlaw chicken manure?
