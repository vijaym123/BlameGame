Never has an anti-gun organization proposed anything that could ever be misconstrued as 'reasonable'Spokeswoman and representative Sarah Brady pushed for the legislation of HR 1022 with the Law Enforcement protection act in 2007 without even knowing what some of the things she was trying to have banned do. This was most emphasized in her video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1fo  She outright lied saying that the original assault weapons ban was a ban on weapons most used to kill our officers when in actuality the weapons banned turned up in less than 2% of all violent crimes involving guns.She also mentioned large capacity clips- which do not exist, but large capacity magazines do.but then when directly asked what barrel shrouds are, and their function, and after 3 unsuccessful dodges, she admitted she had no idea. How could we, the gun community ever expect anything reasonable to come from an organization which has representatives that do not even understand their own position and proposed legislation?Also Paul Helmke, president of the  Brady Campaign, is the same gentleman that started a fundraiser on their website the day after the Virginia Tech Massacre. He is a man of no moral compass who has used tragedy to further his personal agenda and line his own pockets.
