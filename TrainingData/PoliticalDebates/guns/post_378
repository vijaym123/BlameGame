The latest data I can find on this matter is from the CDC using WISQARS tool.  For unintentional (accident) death-by-firearm for year 2005, ages 0 - 18 (not just 'children' but minors) the data show 154 fatalities out of 77,546,344 minors.  Sorry, but that's not very alarming.For suicides during the same year and for the same age range it was 600 even.  Again, that's not very alarming considering the number of minors.How about unintentional drowning?  1,057.  Same year, same age group.  Unintentional poisoning?  456.  Residential fire? 479.  Motor vehicle? 5,870.  My point in all of this is that 'children' die in a variety of ways more frequently than they do at the end of a gun, and stopping some guy at a cash register with another ill concieved law will not make these already low numbers go down.
