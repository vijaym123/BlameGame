These examples do a good job of proving the point that they guns should be aloud on campus, but i can't help but notice that if guns were illegal in the first place then the problem would never had originated. And i just won't except the argument that we need guns to keep us safe from the criminals that will get guns illegally. There has to be a more mature solution then that.
