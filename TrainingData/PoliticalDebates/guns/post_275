Yes I feel safer because I am safer.  I have used my gun on more than one occasion to prevent theft, assault and who knows what else had I not been armed.  In all cases I did nothing to provoke anyone, never fired a shot and no   children   died from my weapon.If you want to make an argument about the human cost of our freedoms then make the same comparison with automobile deaths (USA 155per 1M) and deaths by medical malpractice (Thus, America's   healthcare  -system-induced deaths are the third leading cause of the death in the U.S., after heart disease and   cancer  .    http://www.health-care-reform.net/causedeath.htm  ).  Each of which kill many times more people per annum.28 per million, I'm fine with that.  Would you be more comfortable with only 5?  You are actually ~4 times more likely to die in a car crash in Canada then murdered with a gun in the U.S. of A.
