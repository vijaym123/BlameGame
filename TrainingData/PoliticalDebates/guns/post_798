The issue of   guns   shouldn't even be brought up when talking about   suicide   any more than any other method. Numerous studies (by independant sources) have shown that even when guns are limited, the only thing that goes down is suicide by guns. The over all (successful, not attempted) suicide rate stays exactly the same. So obviously this isn't about guns, it's about suicide. Maybe once we start focusing on the real issue, we might actually be help to help the true victims and fix the problem.
