Betty, you have gotten everything concerning private ownership and the meaning of the Second Amendment so wrong I don't know where to start. However, since you seem so good at lecturing everyone on things you obviously know nothing about let's start with the error that is the easiest to correct.There is no such entity as U.S.S.C. or United States Supreme Court. I think the entity that you meant to refer to is the Supreme Court of the United States or SCOTUS.Now that we have determined that you only think you know what you are talking about and so arrogantly presume to lecture people who actually do know what they are talking about, perhaps you would take the time to actually research your topic prior to making a fool of yourself.This has been covered so thoroughly (even on this web site) that I can't believe the debate even exists. If I have the time I can destroy every argument that you have presented. You might consider reading this:   http://daveinvegasguntalk.blogtownhall.com  /
