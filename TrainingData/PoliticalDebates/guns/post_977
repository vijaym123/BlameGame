 As an American who happens to not like corpses very much, but who does like the Constitution, here is a suggestion:  />   /> 1. Limit private gun ownership to those weapons which would be necessary to defend a home. Handguns and shotguns, I suppose. No full-automatic weapons, no rifles unless homeowner lives in an area where he might encounter a moose in his garage. No weapon sales without accompanying verified property parcel number. It would be a felony to discharge the weapon anywhere other than the registered property or a licensed practice facility. This law would be intended to satisfy the "home defense" freedoms of the Constitution. The "village" itself is supposedly already defended.  />   /> 2. Sporting weapons would be banished to hunting clubs, or for those who could not afford such clubs, the police station. You could still buy them and use them in legal hunting areas, but you could not keep them at home (unless home was in a legal hunting area). This is designed to limit the damage from accidents and acts of rage; in the U.S., at least, most the weaponry used in mass shootings originated in a private gun locker.  />   /> 3. No private ownership of military-style weapons. No full-auto. No specialized ammunition.  />   /> This is just a general idea, not a comprehensive plan.
