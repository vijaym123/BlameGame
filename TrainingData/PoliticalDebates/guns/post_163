The right to keep and bear arms must be an individual right. It is commonplace for people to argue against the individual right concept by separating the two phrases of the Second Amendment so that “the people” can then be interpreted to be some collective group such as a state sponsored and run militia. However, if one reads the Bill of Rights starting with the First Amendment, skips the Second Amendment, and reads the remainder, you will see that all of the rights guaranteed are specifically aimed at preventing abuse of the rights of individuals. It would be quite a stretch to imagine the founding fathers would write a document that starts out defining an individual right to freedom of religion, speech, press and assembly; next defines a right that is only collective to a specific group (the militia) and then reverts back to defining the rights of individuals to not have troops quartered in their homes or be subject to unreasonable search and seizure of property.  Therefore it can only be concluded that the right to keep and bear arms is a right secured to the individual citizen.
