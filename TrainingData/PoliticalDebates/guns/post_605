They said it is the right of the PEOPLE. That infers an individual right. You are attempting to blend two separate statements into a single definition. Typical of the Socialist's and Liberals.As far as taking on the American military, sorry again honey, but a large portion of those serving would not turn their guns on private citizens. You would see a civil war far deadlier than the first one. I was in the military at one time, and I know if I ever got an order to turn on the American people I would have executed my commanders as traitors to the Constitution and the nation. And I wasn't alone in that belief.
