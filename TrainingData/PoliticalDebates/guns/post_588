In the past, on numerous occasions, I have heard the argument presented that we don’t need   firearms   to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government because our government, the federal government of the United States would never turn against us.I have heard it said that gun owners are paranoid to believe that our federal government would turn against us.Well, I have to say that now our so-called paranoia has been justified.I believe it is safe to say that the federal government has officially become the tyrannical government that we warned about.The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis has put out a report, titled "Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment," which, I dare say, defines half of the country as radical extremists whose activity must be monitored to ensure the safety of the country.After all the condemnations from the socialist liberals on the left about government spying on citizens of the United States, these same socialists, now in power, are using that very power to spy on citizens of the United States. And we’re not talking about naturalized people, we’re talking about Americans born and raised here. We’re talking about people who have sacrificed in the military to defend our freedom.We now have the most liberal, socialist person ever in the White House. Congress is controlled by socialist liberals and they intend to make the most of it.If you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States, including the 1st, 2nd and 10th Amendments; if you object to an ever growing out of control government; if you have conservative or libertarian beliefs on certain social issues, you may consider yourself to be a radical extremist.
