You mannaged to find an irresposible parent that owned a gun.First I will give you that the parents were negligent in not securing the firearm in a safe place. That is the only place your opinion is worth reading. A firearm is an inanimate object. Like My Dad,My GrandFather, and my Drill Instructor told me many years ago. A firearm is stupid. It can NOT do anything until a human tells it to do it. I have raised four   children   and I have quite a few   firearms  . I am a Right to Carry Holder and my children have not shot themselves. These parents failed to maintain proper safety, and I feel sorry that this happened, and they will be tormented for the rest of their lives for being stupid about proper safety proceedures. No matter how you slice it ypu can not make stupidity illeagal.
