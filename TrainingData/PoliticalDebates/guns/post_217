Military Soldiers are sworn to protect the Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. If the Commander-In-Cheif or any other disobeys or goes against the U.S. Constitution or the law that are established under the Constitution, that makes him or them an enemy to the U.S. Constitution, therefore an enemy to all U.S. MilitaryTroops Officers and Enlisted. This would place him or her on the wrong side of the U.S. Armed Forces. You ask if the military would turn  their weapons on American People exercising their Constitutional Rights, "No" they would not but, they would certainly turn their weapons on those trying to take away the American Peoples Rights.
