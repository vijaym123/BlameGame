In every sense of the word, guns do make you safer, whether it is at your own home, or at a college campus.  I am highly aware of the fact that many people are afraid of the fact that the wrong kind of people would be allowed to carry, but the essential truth that people forget to see is that there are plenty of responsible people that would utilize the ability to carry in order to protect themselves and others.  It is fact enough that crime rate is lower in right to carry states.
