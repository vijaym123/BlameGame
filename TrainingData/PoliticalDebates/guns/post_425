Are there more guns out there today?  Yes there is....and a lot more.If more guns equal more deaths, why has the death rate decreased about 40% in the governments latest statistics.Japan is a homogenious society that has thousands of years social structure unlike these United States.  Yes they have few guns.  Yes, the suicide rate is much higher than ours.Austrailia, Great Britain, and Canada have greatly restricted or banned most firearms and now are experiencing a huge increase in crime compared to before the restrictions.  Remember when the Bobbies didn't carry firearms?  What has changed?
