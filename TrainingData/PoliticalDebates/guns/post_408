I'm going to go ahead and make a generalization about delinquent gun use, stealing it from home or wherever,     drug     and     alcohol     abuse, low test scores, promiscuous pre-marital sex, etc etc etc. Where are     mom     and dad in all this? Maybe working their butts off to pay the huge mortgage, three cars, and snowmobiles up to their eyes in     debt    . That's just one reason. The home is losing it's place as a priority in peoples lives. Crime goes up, the NEED for a gun to defend yourself also rises too. Why don't we let     guns     alone until we can lower the divorce rate eh?
