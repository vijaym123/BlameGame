Reading these comments makes me happy that there is an 2nd amendment right in the USA to keep and bear arms. Robberies in my neighborhood almost never happen at night. Only in the day when people  are not home, because most people here  have guns and a robbers biggest fear  isn't the police , their biggest fear is an armed citizen.
