#originalTopic=Debate:_Right_to_bear_arms_in_the_US
2nd Amendment rights did not extend to all ethnic groups in terms of initial practice Although the early American documents proclaimed equality for all and a right for all to bear arms, in actuality, this was not the case. Native Americans, African Americans, and other visible minority groups were not given the same rights as those white Americans who immigrated from Europe.  Lynchings and other acts of injustice based upon racial difference occurred well into the twentieth century, so it is a misrepresentation of the facts to say every individual had the right to bear arms for self-defense.  For much of American history, a large segment of the American population did not even have basic human rights, let alone the right to bear arms.
