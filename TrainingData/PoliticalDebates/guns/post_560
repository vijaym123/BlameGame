The right of self means that your body is Yours.  It needn't be specified because it simply Is.  Just because your arms belong to you doesn't mean you can do with them whatever you wish... it means you cannot use them to infringe upon the freedoms of another.  That responsibility is yours.  We know that not all people are responsible enough to keep their hands to themselves.  The   abortion   issue is all junky and cloudy because it deals with the bodily rights and right of self while another person is INSIDE you.  You being a woman... that is.   The greatest responsibility is toward the protection of the self, apparently.   Ugh. If I keep going this will just take me forever because I'll just want to board this beautiful little train of thought. But No! I will not!This is not so junky.  Responsibility is acquired.  Apparently, this nation has a slow acquisition rate. Or just sheer obstinance.
