I do truly wish that was possible!  Unfortunately I am surrounded by brain dead hoplophobes at work.  Of the 60-70 staff in the facility, and about 20 of whom actually have contact with the youths, there are only about 5 of us willing to acknowledge that we even carry for self defense.  So far as I know, I am the only one who willingly challenges the company policy about no weapons on the property, and that is essentially based on the assumption that the contents of my vehicle are my private property, and exempt from company control.  Yes, we have locked boxes in our secure entry area, but I have been personally told by our administrator those may only be used by LEO's in case of emergency, since even they are prohibited from weapons anywhere in the building.  I actually challenged the company policy on the basis that if they prevented the staff from protecting themselves, they should provide security in our parking lot.  This has gone unanswered, and no change in the policy has occurred in the past ten years. I am not in a position where I can financially afford to take the matter to court to change this company policy, or I would have by now. I am hoping Michigan, will pass a parking lot   law   such as have been brought up in other states.  Until then I'll operate on the basis of "better to be tried by twelve, than carried by six".
