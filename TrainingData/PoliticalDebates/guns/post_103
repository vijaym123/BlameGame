Gun prohibition movement has historically failed in the U.S Starting from early 1970s initiatives  for handgun bans started to be struck down as people opposed them .By the 1990s all gun ban laws were struck down even in very leftist cities.This goes to show that history proves the reluctance of people in the US to give up their rights of gun ownership for a public , greater safety goal.
