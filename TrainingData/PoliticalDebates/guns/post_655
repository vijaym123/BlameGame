Sorry Adam, I don't mean to be rude, but since you can't see me or hear me it may come off that way.  The simple fact is that your community doesn't have the right or the moral authority to democratically limit the rights of gun owners in your community.  I know that you said "constitutionally acceptable", but realistically there are only two limitations that you can place on gun ownership that would fit within that description.  Those would be, in a broad sense, the ability to restrict felons and insane persons from owning guns through an instant background check process, and to restrict the use of guns for anything other than their intended purpose (e.g. Self-Defense, target shooting, hunting etc.)  Any other restriction, e.g. the type of firearms or restricting the use of guns or the transportation of guns is all unconstitutional.  One thing you must ALWAYS keep in mind that the people within the Brady Campaign will NEVER tell you is that only people who are generally law abiding will obey the rules you put in place anyway.  That criminals will ALWAYS have guns and will NEVER follow the rules, because they are criminals!  Putting restrictions on guns only limits the people who are willing to follow those laws and puts your average American at a distinct disadvantage.  By the way, the "national organization" only fights to protect the rights of those in the minority who are being demonized, they do not have an agenda to tell people what they can do, unless they are trying to restrict God given, Constitutionally protected rights.  Thank you.  Matt
