Gun owners have compromised away most of our rights. More than 20,000 gun laws nation wide and bad people are still killing innocent people. If we were really allowed to defend ourselves (all things being equal, assuming the use of deadly force to be determined to be lawful and justified) without fear of prosecution and civil suit, perhaps we could reduce the number of criminals, especially those with illegal guns. The fact is, many law-abiding gun owners fear using a gun to defend life and family that they don't do it. Think about your community of criminals KNEW that EVERYONE except them were disarmed. Additionally, WTSHTF and we are faced with TEOTWAWKI and criminals are not detered by the police, we must be our own last line of defense.
