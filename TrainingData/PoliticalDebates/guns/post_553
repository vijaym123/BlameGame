....I don't think people have a "right" to guns.   A natural "right" is the right to eat, breathe, walk about, choose the direction of one's life, reproduce (unfortunately), etc.  Rights Are granted to us by the government.   I, however, don't think that people automatically have "rights" to own guns for it implies that people are automatically responsible.  I would say anyone with a brain should know that, but since the nation's in the middle of a crisis that anyone with a brain should have seen coming, I guess anyone with a brain Should know that... just ignores it or rationalizes it away.
