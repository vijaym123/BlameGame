Should [citizen] guns be banned?- hell no.In an arguement made by T.S. Eggleston, if guns were banned, a black market would arise as well as gun smuggling. This in return would lead to an increase in crime and honestly, who wants more crime? He states that the citizens with no previous criminal records would surrender their guns to officials, leaving them helpless and at a higher risk for being injured.Eggleston further explains that "Criminals will always continue to break the law and prey on the law-abiding but disarmed citizens."For the previous arguements that claim "there are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun."Thats bull. According to Eggleston and other statistics, "every 13 seconds, an American uses a legal firearm in defense against a criminal."So, for self-protection, guns should remain legal. It prevents overcrowding of prisons, riots, and decreases many injuries. In return health costs are not forced to sky-rocket.To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.According to the National Rifle Association (NRAILA), in the state of Texas, an individual does not need a permit to buy a hangun, and they are not required to carry registration or a license.This lack of legislation is one of the main reasons for the decrease in gun safety, so if we fix this, Americans can be on their way to a happy, gun legal society.=]http://www.the-eggman.com/writings/gun_ban.html http://www.the-eggman.com/index.phphttp://crime.about.com/od/gunlawsbystate/a/gunlaws_tx.htm
