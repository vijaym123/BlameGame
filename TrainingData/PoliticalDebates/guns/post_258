How many people get training before buying a gun?   Another issue entirely.    Good for you for having an alarm and a dog and for educating your   children   that   guns   are not toys and on responsible gun ownership.  Thanks.It's problem that a lot people think guns are some kind of magic charm and make you automatically "safe".  It's also a problem that guns are viewed by the   media   and by manufacturers of games and toys as just that - toys and game pieces.    Guns are tools, and weapons.  They can be dangerous, and should be respected for what they can do, both helpful and harmful.    But.  I still don't think they make you safer in this kind of situation unless you have other measures of security.   As I've pointed out - having many guns or a gun won't make you "safer" if someone is in your home and you find yourself eating carpet before you even forget what you were dreaming about.   Nor does having a gun make you safer if someone decides to wallop you a good one and jack your wallet, kick you in the crotch, throw dirt in your eyes and stab you in the kidney... or... something.  The gun in bag won't do you much good because it can't see the future.   But.  Whatever.  I have them.  I kill things.  I eat them.  I rescued the cat from coyotes.  I scared a persistent Jehovah's witness (was't loaded..).      They're locked.  Some aren't even assembled.   I don't feel safer.   Just more prepared in the event of a natural disaster or jump in the price of ground beef.
