I sense that you have never been in a life threating situtation. When the automatic adrenaline reaction begins, most rational thought ends. The fight or flight reaction is about all you are left with and most people are not trained to react on reflex, so they simply freeze. I have been under fire several times and I have seen even trained soldiers freeze their first time under fire. Your assertion of "intellegent response" will get you killed.The majority of carry permit holders train more than the majority of   police   officers and, in my experience, are, by far, more accurate and less likely to endanger bystanders.
