If "bear" has a military-connotation, "keep" can still retain an individual meaning. "Keep and bear arms" could mean that the people have both an individual right to keep arms as well as a collective right to bear them. There is no reason to exclude this option, particularly as reference to "the people" is given in the second clause.
