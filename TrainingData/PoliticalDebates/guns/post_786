The statistics presented may be very true; college aged people may be more irrational or inmature.  College students may be more likely to be influenced by alcohol, drugs, or stress as well.  Personally, those characteristics depend on the person.  However, the more people that have guns, the more people there are that have the means to do damage whether it be accidental or intentional.Guns can misfire.  Someone can accidentally pull the trigger.  Someone may think the gun is not loaded.  A gun could fall into the hands of someone irresponsible. A person influenced by alcohol or drugs may pick up a gun and react to a situation that they would normally ignore.  One way to commit suicide would be easily accessible to those depressed individuals who feel they no longer have a purpose in this world. These are just some of the scenarios that could occur.One could argue that if all the students who were held hostage in that lecture hall on the campus of VT had had guns, someone could have taken down the shooter, but what about all the potential misfired bullets?  What about all the negative situations that could have occurred leading up to that instant and taking place after it? Creating more risk in order to attempt to solve one unfortunate situation is illogical.
