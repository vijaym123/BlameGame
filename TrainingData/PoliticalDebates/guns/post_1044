 .... I think that its no wonder there are so many gun crimes in America for the simple reason you all have "The Right To Bear Arms"  />   /> what you do not know however is that for a good while now, people have been wanting to try and change your constitution, but its just far too difficult for to do this as your procedure is not at all by any means straight forward, i know hunting is a sport or whatever (don't agree to that either but hey) but having guns makes it easier to shoot people and cause many deaths think about that young girl recently who killed people at her school???
