I fail to see how allowing students who have a valid concealed weapons permit and are allowed to carry everywhere else in public(depending on the state laws in movie theaters, restaurants, malls, and even bars in some states) is suddenly so much more likely to be violent on a college campus? Firearms are already on college campuses how would allowing those who actually follow the law to carry increase the danger? These adults already carry everywhere else so why would be allowing them to carry across an imaginary line have any effect on their judgment on a self defense situation. You are correct self defense is one thing, but how is not allowing law abiding citizens their right to use the best tools available to protect themselves safer then allowing an unopposed shooting spree. For your second point how is a 30 year old ex marine (such as the one currently having his rights violated by Western Oregon University) different from a 30 year old teacher. Yet again the people that have concealed weapons permits are adults why is the title of teacher make you any more qualified to defend yourself? It has already proven that criminals don't follow the law and they will carry firearms on to campus no matter what the law says so why not let those law abiding citizens that have the will to defend themselves the legal opportunity to do express their right to do so.
