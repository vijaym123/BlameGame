#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
The DC handgun ban has not really decreased crime and murders in DC. Since the handgun ban was first implemented in 1976, more than 8,400 people have been murdered in the district. This is a fairly dramatic figure and demonstrates that the ban has not had a substantive effect in reducing crime rates.
