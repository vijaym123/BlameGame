So, this "waiting period" stops a guy from murdering his wife how if he already owns guns? And the "waiting period" would certainly not help the wife unless the murderer was nice enough to wait until she got her gun home before he attacked her.This waiting nonsense is another feel good but idiotic idea with no basis in logic or fact. Good people have no desire to harm others. Criminals do not obey laws or care whom they harm - and they don't get their guns from a shop or jump through any of the hoops honest people are forced to put up with.  As the survivor of an attack, I know without any doubt that I would have been dead a long time now if I had not been armed and ready to shoot. I am now a certified NRA instructor for handguns and self defense. I spend a great deal of time helping other women (and men too) understand how to defend themselves, both armed and otherwise. I have no desire to ever harm anyone, but I will never be a helpless victim. My life is worth preserving.
