Until then...You state: "The Court also concludes that the Second Amendment is consistent with laws banning “dangerous and unusual weapons” not “in common use at the time,” such as M-16 rifles and other   firearms   that are most useful in   military   service."Your attempt to spin the opinion has failed here.  It is common knowledge that the 2nd Amendment was specifically designed to include militaristic rifles, for the express purpose of ensuring the ability of the citizenry of throwing the shackles of oppressive Government.  This was the case when the federal government ratified the amendment and also when each state wrote their own constitutions, insofar as similar rights were included.  In claiming that the 2nd Amendment pertains to hunting, the shooting   sports  , and collecting, the anti-gun lobby misframes the entire concept of the amendment and thought-process of the framers when it was ratified.
