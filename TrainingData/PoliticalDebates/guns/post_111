#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
The implications of the DC handgun ban are not supported nationwide. The DC handgun ban case does not have an isolated impact in DC. Rather, it has wide-ranging implications for gun laws across the country. A handgun ban in DC violates the principle of an individual right to bear arms. As such, for those in favor of gun rights, which is a large portion of the country, opposition to the DC handgun is imperative.
