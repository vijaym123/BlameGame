Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap and skeet shooting. Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot distance of 30 yards so they aren't that good of a weapon. Also semi-automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without having to cock the gun. Another point is that a gun is a tool and the person is the one who kills someone not the gun. And it is now required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80% of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI.
