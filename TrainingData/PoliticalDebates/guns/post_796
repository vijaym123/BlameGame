The study that the BC keeps referencing is flawed. I read the study and it asks if the participant has a working gun on campus (illegal in most cases) and also does other illegal things (drugs etc.). Well duh! I'm sure if they aren't listening to the no   guns   policy, they probably don't care about   the law   and therefore won't care about breaking others. I'm also going to make the generalization that if someone cares less about the law they are probably more likely to show violence toward their fellow man (and woman). So I don't think that going from a yes answer to the question "do you have an illegal gun ON campus" should be quoted as "gun owners". Don't twist the facts.
