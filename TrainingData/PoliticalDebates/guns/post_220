Consider:  The Army was used to kill and break up striking coal miners in the early part of last century in Kentucky.!!!These men surely realized it was countrymen they were shooting at, no??  The fact that only a couple were killed may be due to poor shooting? or just shooting near the target to satisfy the Lt they were shooting??At any rate, it would be hard to assume the Army would NOT attack civilians.  It is the Officers that must decide it is wrong to kill fellow countrymen. Any resistence to the government army must be the guerilla type, just like Iraq.
