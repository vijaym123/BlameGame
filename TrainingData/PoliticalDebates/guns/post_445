These may very well be legitimate statistics. However, BLZeebub hasn't provided us with enough information to even know that the 2% if of. All I am asking for is clarification.Is s/he trying to say that 10% of all police fatalities are of innocent victims?that 2% of all fatalities in a residential property are family or friends?And if so, what's the source? I can provide sources for very different statistics and so I'm wondering how they compare. If you want to have your arguments taken seriously you have to provide that much at least. If these are self-reported data from members of the NRA, I'm likely to take them with a grain of salt. If they are data lifted from government crime databases (such as the annual CDC reports) by a nonpartisan group, I'll take them more seriously.
