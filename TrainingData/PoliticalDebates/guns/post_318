The first article is a very good, unbiased presentation of facts about   guns   in general. It does a pretty fair job of just laying out a few facts without trying to push an agenda either way. I have had it bookmarked for quite some time. In it, they use the smallest finding among 9 studies that show at least 764,000 defensive uses of guns per year. It also states that in 1995 there were a total of 1,400 accidental   firearms     deaths   of persons of any age. Now, assuming (incorrectly, but for the sake of argument) that every single one of those accidental deaths was someone being shot with their own gun, that would still mean you were more than 11 times more likely to be killed by someone else than shot with your own gun. And that is all homicides (16,400). 70.3% of all homicides in 2004 were killed with guns (11,529). (See links below)And that is leaving out attempted murders, which you also included. If you want to include attempted murders (described as aggravated assaults by the FBI studies linked below) then you're talking a whole new ball game. Now the number (  murder   + attempted murder) skyrockets to over 870,000, meaning that you are now over 600 times more likely to be killed or have an attempt on your life than to be shot with your own gun (again, assuming that all accidental gun deaths are someone being shot with their own gun).  http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/murder.html    http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/aggravated_assault.html  The second link you provided didn't really address the question, so I won't make any comments one way or the other about the information in it, if that is OK with you.
