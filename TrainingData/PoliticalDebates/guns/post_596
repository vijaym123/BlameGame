The Rhodesian, and the Soviets.All of their positions involved ground troops in prolonged conflict. Now, I don't care what   guns   you've bought, you and two hundred people are not going to storm a US army base and capture it. The army doesn't actually need to be there to kill you--they can shell you from a distance wherever you're holed up. If you want to compare your possible conflict to something, you'd be taking the side of the insurgents in Iraq--well armed, have the lay of the land, etc. Now, certainly Americans are killed by those insurgents. BUT they haven't taken one base, they haven't driven out any occupying forces. If it was policy to hunt down insurgent cells as the primary goal, with the entire armed forces brought to bear (as it certainly would be in a civil war) there would be little doubt who the victor would be.
