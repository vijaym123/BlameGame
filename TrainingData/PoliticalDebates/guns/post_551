"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."This doesn't give the rights to citizens, no matter what the Supreme Court might say.  Anyone who reads it knows that it means the right to keep and bear arms belongs to those who have served in militia.  That's how it was written.  Simply because it has been ignored doesn't mean the words have changed.
