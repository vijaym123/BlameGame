[event]The society with no guns has five members that buy guns from the black market, they take over the society and create a dictatorship where the men are forced into slave labor camps and the women are sold as sex slaves. Meanwhile the other society is fine they have had a few disputes with a bad apple or two but they were both resolved without the collapse of the society.[/event]coming back to the planet earth you must first accept that guns exist. If you ban them there will still be a black market, no matter if they are smuggled or made domestically. So the best solution is to regulate and make sure law abiding citizens can buy guns.
