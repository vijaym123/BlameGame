Let me be brutally honest, I have no respect for anyone attempting to disarm the law-abiding population of this country. Further, I am not a proponent of rational informed discourse, at least not as you see it. I dispise these people. I will no longer tolerate compromise with them or anyone like them. My fight is for liberty and against tyranny. I cannot be courteous to the Brady Bunch (a term I coined, by the way. Arrogant, ain't I?). However, if you decide not to consider my arguement because you consider me to be discourteous that is up to you. The truth about the Brady Bunch is there for you to see. I have come to the conclusion that one cannot change another person's opinion or point of view if there are not open minded in the first place. But, I still feel compelled to set forth my position whether you are convinced or not.The fact remains that these people are deceptive and are determined to disarm us incrementally. Check for yourself. Every time they manage to get some oppressive, Draconian anti-gun law passed, they always say that this is only a first step in removing firearms from private ownership. This must not be allowed to happen.Try this:   http://www.bradycampaign.org/blog  /O bama has not consistantly supported the Second Amendment. Look into his time in the Illinoise State Senate and you see that not to be true. Therefore, Paul Helmke of the Brady Bunch is lying. He is a liar. How can you ever trust anyone who lies?Helmke says: "As Sen. Obama said in his speech accepting the Democratic nomination, "The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don’t tell me we can’t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals."The way they do this is to make semi-auto rifles illegal to own, possess, use, etc.
