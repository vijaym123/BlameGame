I have no idea how many people have had some sort of "fit" and shot a relative.  While you're digging that up look into stabbings as well.  After that you need to find out about people who flipped out a little bit and committed no violence.  (I'll help out, I'm in that group.)  Then you get to compare it with the people who didn't even bother to call the police because they brandished a weapon and the threat made itself scarce.I couldn't begin to tell you what's wrong with the police chiefs, but I can share a couple tidbits of information:  CCW permit holders are five times less likely than the "average" citizen to be involved in a criminal incident.  The places with the most restrictive controls on weapons seem to have the highest crime rates.  Armed citizens have a much better record than the police regarding the accidental shooting of innocent bystanders.Me carrying a pistol would make you safer, especially if you don't know I have it.
