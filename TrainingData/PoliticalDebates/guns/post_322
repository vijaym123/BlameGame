This expert mentions the '97 study "Guns in America", but would rather you don't read it. GOA should certainly not be suggesting that Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig agree with the 4,000 times a day claim. Here is the link:     http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/165476.htm    It is worth reading if you are interested in this issue. If you are impatient here is a relevant paragraph from the conclusions. DGU is Defensive Gun Use.The NSPOF does not provide much evidence on whetherconsumers who buy guns for protection against crimeget their money's worth. The NSPOF-based estimateof millions of DGUs each year greatly exaggeratesthe true number, as do other estimates based onsimilar surveys. Much debated is whether thewidespread ownership of firearms deters crime ormakes it more deadly--or perhaps both--but the DGUestimates are not informative in this regard.
