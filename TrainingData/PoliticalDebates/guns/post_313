But it is no guarantee that you will survive an attack.  Gun ownership, as I see it, creates a false sense of security, regardless.  There is no guarantee that the homeowner with a gun will survive a home invasion, if criminals break into his residence.  Crime rates are far lower in countries that do not allow citizens to own handguns (however, they may own hunting weaponry).  I believe that the rising   crime   rates from   guns   in Canada are the results of organized crime and the increasing   drug trafficking   in that country.  Still, Canada has a far lower per-capita handgun   murder   rate overall than does the United States, since Canadians do not have an automatic guarantee to bear arms.   I do not believe that the writers of our   U.S. Constitution   meant for the Second Amendment to allow anyone unlimited unchecked access to   firearms  , but they did intend for citizens to freely protect themselves during times of war, especially at home.  The numbers of handguns and firearms severely outnumber the entire population of our country, and that's a very chilling thought.  It is time for some kind of change.
