First, I've always wondered how and why the possession of   guns  , protected by the 2nd Amendment, is prohibited on Federal properties.  As DC v Heller made the point, if the 2nd protects anything it protects the right to own   firearms   from Federal infringement.Secondly, the panty-wetters crying in fear at the thought of   law  -abiding citizens possession firearms on federal park land under the exact same laws and regulations as the surrounding state lands are demonstrating a very childish attitude.  They'll "be afraid to visit   national parks   knowing that people can have guns?"  How can they now find the courage to even travel to those parks knowing that they must traverse state lands where people are allowed to carry guns?  How can they manage to control their fear while shopping in local stores, walking local streets, or sitting in local theaters knowing that the state already allows people to have guns.  In my own county in a state which has had   legal   concealed carry for only the past five years, approximately 1.54% of the population has a concealed carry permit.  According to a local deputy, when one subtracts those under age or with criminal records, it's closer to 5% of the eligible population. That means that one out of every twenty adults one meets might be legally carrying a gun.  And no problems are in evidence.  How would that change if the land in nearby national parks is added to the area where those people can carry legally?  And why should it change?
