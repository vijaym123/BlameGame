Health is not natural? Or, lack thereof?  Your health is not within realm of your right to life? It is not your general welfare that is not a right?HAAAAA ha ha.  Mr. Richardson, if you think that handguns are your natural right but your  right to life (which is your very health) is not, then you've issues.Sorry, but it is MEN who give ourselves rights. So far as I know, the "Creator" has yet to come down and write a constitution, or even a manifesto.  MEN write, men create, and until it is proven... there is no such thing as God-given.  There Are natural rights, but as is evident, it was men who wrote the constitution and it is man who maintains those rights.The natural right to a handgun is non-existent.  It is a created right... and as such can be legislated.  It is an absurd idea to say that because a criminal can break the law (there-by a criminal) then there should be no laws to regulate the non-criminals so they can "protect" themselves against the criminals.   What would be the point of laws in the first place?
