Its amazing that when firearm related suicide lethality is compared to other methods, they always leave out hanging...which is MORE lethal than firearms. People that are determined enough to use a gun probably wouldn't be detered by the face that they can't get one...they would find another way.If the Brady Campaign was really interested in lowering the number of suicides on campus, the would focus on eliminating alcohol. No matter the method (OD, Firearm, hanging/strangulation, cutting etc.) many (if not the majority) people attempting suicide are under the influence. But that's not their concern...their concern is to get rid of guns, and they attempt to do so by using scare tactics.
