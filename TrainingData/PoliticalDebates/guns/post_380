I grew up in a house hold around firearms.  I was taught from an early age to respect them and to know what kind of damage they are capable of if misused.  Even with the access I had to them as a child, I never dreamed of using one to solve any altercations I may have encountered.  My heart goes out to those who have lost children because they, as parents were incapable of doing their job and teaching their children to respect them.  A gun is simply a tool, nothing more.  A child could take a sword to school and do as much damage as a gun can.  A kid could take his fork from lunch and stab the person next to him and kill him.  How many children have been killed by rocks?  I am sorry if my chosen past time makes you uncomfortable, I truly am.  I have made offers to many who oppose firearms to come out to my range and allow me to teach them about firearms and operate a few of them in a controlled environment where safety is of the utmost importance.
