Anyone who wants to brin a gun on campus can do so now despite the law. Someone intent on shooting someone cannot be prevented from doing so unless someone else (either the victom or someone nearby) is similarly armed and equiped to shoot the potential murderer.All the anti-gun laws in the world do not disarm criminals or others with evil intent... gun laws do disarm honest, law-abinding people who if allowed to carry weapons could potentially pervent the mayham that is all too common in our schools.Just knowing that some of his classmates couls be armed, may have diisuaded some of the killers and savedd lives. Many of these nut-cases are basically cowards and the possibility that they may be shot as a result of their actions may change their plans.
