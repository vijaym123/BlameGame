I must  be fair- I don't like the use of anecdotes in arguments regarding legislation.  At most they should serve as exclamation points at the end of statistical analysis. If we rely on anecdotes, this argument can go on indefinitely. An easier way to look at this, I think- would be this:If immediate access to guns didn't save lives, we wouldn't arm our police. Sure the counter-argument may be 'but police are trained'. Do not underestimate the vigilance of everyday Citizens to stay sharp and proficient in firearms handling.  Many states require lengthy classes and courses of fire to prove the shooters ability to not only understand the law, but to prove competence.
