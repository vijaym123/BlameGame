Hi Countryboy: I agree that if one is carrying concealed, one's weaponis at hand but when I'm relaxing in parksites I usually have just a T-shirt and shorts [unless it is cold or bugs are hungry]...I'm not muchof a shot with a handgun so an M-1 or M-94* carbine wud be hard to hide.I guess I'd have to sling it over my shoulder or back?..Actually, if the vibes in camp were bad, or a gang of bears approached, making bear-signs, I'd depart pronto...I might pick a campsite close to where therangers' HQ/dispatch point was...The thugs and bears will probably stayaway from that 'hood'?..*=Guess I'd have to keep the .30-30 ammo in asmall   plastic   soap dish or cigarette box as the magazine is permanentlyattached to the Winchester?..Aaron..
