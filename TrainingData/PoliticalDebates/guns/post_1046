 It's because of this law that there are frequent school shootings in America. Like JRCBailey said if we were to completely ban them then the risk of being attacked would greatly reduced anyway. Also if you had one for self-defence then what happens if it enters the wrong hands? You 'defence' ironically becomes the attackers 'offence'. If you want any weapon to be legalised, expect a lot of crime related to the weapon in question.
