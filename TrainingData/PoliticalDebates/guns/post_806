@Nada's Comments- The points that you do present are very valid, concerning both the presented issues of an individual's proficiency in using a concealed firearm, and the issue of accidental shootings in its entirety.@Tenmaster96- With myself being a person who hunts, has hunted forever, and is on a competition trapshooting team, I do, and will forever retain a respect for firearms.  I know their capabilities, and what they can do, but despite everything else, I do agree when it is stated that accidental shooting are rare, and the ability to carry a concealed weapon will most definately be a benefit to students on campus.  In my state, it is a proven statistic that hunting, above all other forms of recreation, have the lowest rate of personal injury, virutally zero.  Hunting is the safest sport of all, oddly enough.  When good citizens that know the parameters of what can happen with a firearm, are able to carry, then they have now become able to protect themselves and others.  God forbid if I was ever faced with a situation such as an intruder in school, I would know that I could defend myself and others.  I do understand Nada's argument of how people who may carry concealed weapons do not have proper expereince with firearms, but with yourself, being a "concealed-carrier", did you have to complete a firearm safety course before being given your permit?  If we think about it, whether you are in an area that allows concealed carrying or not, if things move as to the extreme of guns being banned, all of the law abiding citizens would not be protected, and no matter what the laws were, all the "bad guys" with bad intentions would have thier way no matter what..and this is why it is all the more reasonable that students should be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus.
