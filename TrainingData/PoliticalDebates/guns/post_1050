 Has anyone seen that family guy episode where the characters shoot guns around their house like laser tag. Then one of them gets shot and he acts like he sprained his ankle.  That show is hilarious.  /> I can't believe the backing and support guns get under the rouse of 'civility.'  what kind of nonsense is that?  That's like saying "is the middle finger an effective tool to fight people you don't get along with?"  it might be... But it certainly is in no way similar to any form of civility.  /> The classic argument to this is that the forefathers did not legalize ak-47s... They legalized muskets and such to fight off the government if they tried to take over.  Militiamen are who gun-toters should think of when they argue for guns.  Compare preparing yourself for a British invasion to what modern man uses guns for.  Bloods and crypts cannot be stalled by you and your little pistol buddies.  Osama bin laden is not going to come hopping down the bunny trail.  /> Its also pretty hard for your kids to get into your musket accidentally mixing in gunpowder and shot.  I have no idea what legs you people still have to stand on in support to owning guns.  Rifles are different, not automatic rifles but simple marksman, hunting rifles.  Personally, i think a typical handgun should be the most dangerous gun allowable for things like self defense and whatnot and that there should be allowed one per person.  Then also certain hunting provisions be set in place to orchestrate them and their... "fun."  i don't understand enough about hunting to make that argument, but i do see it's legitimacy.  /> How does guns protecting you from guns make any sense to anybody?  Can you be so egotistical?
