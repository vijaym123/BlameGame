If the government could pass laws that would make it harder for criminals to get guns without negatively affecting the rest of us gun owners.The problem with the types of laws you support, is it makes it harder for EVERYONE to get a gun, not just criminals.  Much like Illegal drugs, people will find ways to get whatever they want, no matter what restrictions you put on those items.That's why I wish groups like yours would take emphasis off of gun restrictions, and focus more on the actual criminals that commit the actual crimes.
