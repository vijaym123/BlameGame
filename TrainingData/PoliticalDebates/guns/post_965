#originalTopic=Gun_Control_For_Or_Against
 I am against using the vague term of "Gun Control" because it is subjective.  /   /> Gun Control means to me:  />   /> -Registering weapons.  /> -Making sure nobody takes registered guns away from citizens.  />   /> The 2nd Amendment states "a well regulated militia" is "necessary to the security of a free State"  />   /> If it's 'regulated' somebody should know.  Black market guns and secret guns aren't regulated.  />   /> In my opinion an unregistered weapon is a serious offense.  Much more offensive would be ignoring constitutional law.
