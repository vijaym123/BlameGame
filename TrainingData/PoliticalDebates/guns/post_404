neither of us have realistic stats- I do think the brady campaign uses questionable (read unethical) methods of persuasion with false claims and exageratted statistics.High capacity rifles aren't used in crimes, and pistols aren't easy to come buy. your asking for impossible to enforce legislation. we have gun laws now, that if enforced, would prevent the crime your referring to.we don't need more laws- we need the government to enable our police to do their jobs, not help some fat politician get re-elected by banning some other thing with lies about its use in crime.
