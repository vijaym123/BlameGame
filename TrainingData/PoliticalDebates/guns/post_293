"As far as I am concerned, people who apply for gun permits - have already failed a psychological stability test, for wanting a gun in the first place."Nothing says reasoned debate like accusing those who disagree with you of being mentally unstable. And as far as   guns   not making you any safer, I believe 1.5 million people per year would disagree with you. That's the number of defensive uses of   firearms   there are. And 99% of them end without a single shot being fired. Can you please explain to me how those people weren't safer with their guns? Can you also explain to the wife of an acquaintance of mine who just last week stopped a guy from carjacking her by pulling her sidearm how she was made LESS safe by having that firearm with her?Are you going to use facts or just unfounded emotion in your arguments? Because if you want to use facts, they are going to work against you in this case.
