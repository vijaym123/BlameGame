The Court limited Miller to the proposition that Òthe Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.Ó  Miller doesn't mention "law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes."  It says weapons "not typically possesed or use by militia".  In other words, if there was testimony that sawed off shotguns were used by the military, (which they are)then they would be covered by the Second Ammendment.The reason that there was no testimony in this regard is that there was no testimony from the defence at all.  Only the government attended the trial.  No one from the other side was there!
