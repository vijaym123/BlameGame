My favorite example of how   murder   rates are culturally-set is the six "Founding Fathers" pictured on US currency.  As with inner city minorities now,  they had a dueling culture.Thus,  ex-US vice   president   Aaron Burr killed  ex US-treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton ($10 bill), in a duel.  Similarly,  US President Andrew Jackson ($20 bill ) killed at least one man in a duel,  perhaps more.  All with   guns  ,  naturally.These days,  high-level US politicians no longer kill each other.  So there is hope for us all yet.
