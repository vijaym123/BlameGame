College students don't drink beer in class and won't kill each other for reaching for a pen.  This is about preventing incidents like Virginia Tech and Columbine.  Had a single person been allowed to defend themselves (or had the cops actually done something) the victims would still be alive.  Keeping   guns   off campus won't prevent these incidents because killers will not follow the rules anyway. "Gun-free Zones" only protect the killers by disarming their prey.  Even if you can prevent people from taking guns to a frat party, there will still be knives, beer bottles, screwdrivers and baseball bats.  The point is that if someone has an intent to harm or kill you, they will find a way to do it.  I have seen someone nearly get stabbed at a party and I have seen a golf club pulled out as a weapon.  Surely nobody wants to ban golf clubs.  It appears your objection lies with   alcohol  , not guns so why don't you advocate a return to Prohibition?  Guns are simply a tool, they are useless lying on the ground.  There have been many women on my own campus that have been sexually assaulted; don't they also deserve the right to defend themselves?  What about preventing a break-in or robbery?  Mass killings are not the only things Concealed Carry can help prevent.
