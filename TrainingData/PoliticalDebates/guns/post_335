I've seen statistics, research, and anecdotes supporting both sides of the debate, so until there's real proof one way or the other, it comes down to what you believe.  I happen to believe that guns do not make us safer, in general, but because the evidence is ambiguous, and because the Constitution protects our right to bear arms, I oppose overly restrictive bans on firearms.Ah, so what do I mean by overly restrictive?  I think a person ought to be able to have a handgun in their homes.  Sports enthusiasts ought to be able to shoot targets at firing ranges.  And hunters ought to be allowed to have rifles and shotguns.But I just don't understand extreme right-wing objections to things like background checks.  Of course we'll never completely prevent criminals from having guns, but at least we can make it hard on them.  We could devote our political energy to a lot more important things if we could just agree on some reasonable compromises here.  All you gun rights supporters, get over your fear that all your rights will be taken away, and accept a few reasonable restrictions.  And all you gun rights opponents, accept that guns in the hands of ordinary citizens aren't going to go away completely, just like drinking didn't go away during Prohibition.  And let's get on with things like, I don't know, figuring out how to reduce the national debt.
