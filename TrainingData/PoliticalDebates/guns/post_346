Accidental injury and/or death from a handgun usually is the result of improper handling.  Quite frankly, if you are handling a firearm and not using the standard safety techniques, you're asking for trouble.The gross majority of legitimate gun owners respect the potential of their weapons, and things like that don't happen.  The few who don't, however, are the ones who make the news for being stupid.  I'd rather not be lumped in with them.  I know what I'm doing with mine.In real life, having a handgun DOES help.  There have been many stories of defense from a handgun that would not be afforded by any other means.  I just read an article about a man who was stalking a woman for over a year.  She bought a gun.  He broke in.  She called 911 and hid in her bedroom, and he broke down the door.  He then tried to strangle her, and then HIS funeral was planned for that weekend.  Without the gun, it would have been hers.As for the right to own a handgun, that will never   change  .  Or, better yet, if it does, it will very literally cause an armed rebellion.  The whole purpose of the   second amendment   was to protect us against the tyranny that government can bring.  It is the last defense of the people against the government.  Take that away, and the second American revolution starts.
