One thing that really peeved me this last   election   is the hunters out there.1. There is no constitutional right to hunt. It's about the right to bear arms in sufficient quantity and firepower that a mass of the people who need to resist tyranny can do so.2. The hunters overwhelmingly voted for Obama because they bought his line about being pro-Second Amendment. They were either ignorant or weren't paying attention, because his hostility to the Constitution is plain to see.The idiocy of this is apparent. "Well, Obama's not going to come after my long gun, and I've got mine and I'm all I care about."There is no country on this earth that banned and confiscated handguns that didn't also ban and confiscate rifles. Hunting came right after, as we're seeing in the UK now.
