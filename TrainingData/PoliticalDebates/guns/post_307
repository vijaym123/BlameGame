The police have no legal obligation to protect you or your loved ones. When the chips are down, you need to protect yourself, or allow yourself to be killed.No one...no one...is going to deprive me of one minute of   existence   on this Earth. No one will take *my* life, or the life of my loved ones.I choose to defend myself with a   firearm  . Let those who would take that away from me to come over to my house and live with me 24x7 and protect me from bad guys...who will *always* have access to   guns  ...even if we rounded up every gun from every household in the USA and dumped them into the ocean. Bad guys will *always* find a way to have guns, and use them against us.
