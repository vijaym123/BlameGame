I have to agree that Michigan has set an example.At the very least, criminal misuse of firearms hasn't increased since the CCW went from "may-issue" to "shall-issue" in 2001. As the news article cited indicates, reported criminal misuse of firearms has decreased marginally.It might be within the region of statistical noise. Or it might not.Apparently, the a statewide increase in concealed-carry-permit-holders hasn't done anything to increase criminal misuse of firearms.However, it is not the guns that make people safe. It is proper use of guns that make people safe.
