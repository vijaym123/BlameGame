Well, I can see both sides trying to justify their position. Here's mine: I cordially invite ANY burgler to come and invade my home. Do I have a gun or not? Enter at your own risk!! Since I'm doing the invitation, you probably think I have a gun/  guns  . Are you willing to RISK YOUR LIFE on that? Are you prepared to meet your maker? You will not get a "stop or I'll shoot" warning. CLICK, BANG. That is all you'll receive. Still wanting to try to enter my home? Enough said. Guns make you safer because CRIMINALS LOVE UNARMED VICTIMS. RESPONSIBLE gun owners dont kill people. They kill criminals, muggers, car jackers, rapists, child molesters and those tryng invading their homes. James Allyn Washingon.
