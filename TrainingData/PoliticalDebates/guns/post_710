when was the last time you played beer pong in class.I want the ability to defend myself in a dangerus situation.right now no one is safe and for some reason the ignorant feel safe.last time I checked this wasnt a debate about gun ownership, its about carrying, im a gun owner already i want the ability to use a gun (a tool) in order to protect myself if i need to.  This is not a debate whatsoever about who can have guns only where they can carrythem
