This question even coming up is just a peculiarity of the system.It's a pointless superfluous question covered by previous debate.The only reason we are asking about   national parks   is because of strategic   legal   influence on the part of the special interests involved combined with a quirk of our political system. Specifically, the lack of requirement of bill amendments to be pertinent to the bill as a whole at certain points during   the law   enactment process.Gun control advocates know that they'll never get   guns   banned en masse, so they'll try first to get them banned in places where they are not likely to be opposed. Classic slippery slope approach.A firearm does not care who owns the land it is on. Nor is safety impacted by such ownership. This is a non-issue, from all logical perspectives. As an important side note...I would like to   add   that the true character of the gun debate is overlooked here as well as virtually everywhere else.We do not have the   second amendment   to defend ourselves from criminals or to hunt.The second amendment is not intended to defend American citizens from hunger or   crime  , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required.Gun control advocates like to talk about the founding fathers thinking the 2nd amendment applied to muskets not M16s and grenades, but keep in mind that the musket was the M16 of the day. "Arms" in the context of constitutional rights means equipment capable of allowing armed insurrection should that become the will of the majority. Put another way "Arms" in this context mean   assault weapons  ,   military   weapons, not hunting or home defense tools.To forget that fact is to invite future oppression and to perpetuate ignorance."But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security."  - The Declaration of Independence
