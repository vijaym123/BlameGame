The most dangerous people are in Washington D. C. our Capitol...They have shown no mercy to other counties why should I trust them to protect my freedoms ??? I get called on the carpet just for using my rear yard as a work place ...Facing a 2 year possible jail sentence ,I had to plea bargain a lesser crime which I really was not guilty of either, in order to get away from excesive injustice at the District Justice, who imposed & advanced a large fine $$$, with an attached aggrivation statementattached to my lesser charge.. After never having a former record & no physical threat or contact...I'm a model citizen all my life & raised a good family, married for 38 years to same woman, and raised 2 honor student girls, pay my taxes & bother no- one..Suddenly I am Criminal for telling a code officer to stay out of my back yard ...So , much for property owner respect & rights ...Yes I need a gun , not for foreign terrorist but my own terroristic neighbors and representatives who abuse their given powers...The police are no friend to me ,they proved themseles unworthy of my respect...I have been fingered for no reason other than They demand I respect a code that I deem ,illegal & unconstutional...PRIVATE property should mean what I think it means & what I was taught from little on up ....I don't need representation that pisses on me & says it's raining for my good....ONLY criminals will have gun if you take the citizens gun...
