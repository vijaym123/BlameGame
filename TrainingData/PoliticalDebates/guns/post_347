I am a   military   man (retired)   guns   have never killed unless used by a person. Outside the line of duty I have used a weapon two times. NEVER fired it, just seeing that the opposition was armed stopped both attempted assaults. I have a half century in military and /or   law   enforcement and strongly favor Americans having and being trained to use   firearms   for self protection.      Please think logically, most LEO's never have to fire their weapons in the line of duty. There is a reason for this, the criminal knows he WILL use the weapon and he will use it fairly well. The average criminal will prefer to surrender when he realizes he is facing someone trained and willing to use lethal force.
