Consider this:It is Midnight.  Your wife and children are at home alone because you are working late.  There is no phone in the bedroom where your wife is sleeping.  Suddenly, she is awakened by the noise of something smashing.  She sneaks quietly to the door of the bedroom which is open.  She looks out and in dim light she can see at least two persons moving through the living room wearing masks.  What should she do?  Try to sneek to a phone?  Remain quiet and hide and hope they do not come for her or the children?  Personal experience says that she is likely in danger.  The answer?  I say the answer is buy her a gun that fits her hand, teach her to use it should she need to.  You will never know what it is actually like to have this happen to you until it does.
