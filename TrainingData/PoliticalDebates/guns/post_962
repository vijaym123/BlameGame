 I agree with cephus. Gun control is a good thing. We do need to know how many guns are in circulation, who has them, how secure are the weapons and how suitable is the gun holder to have guns.  />   /> The issue as I see it is not about more laws making more killing illegal, it is about the control issues I raised above.
