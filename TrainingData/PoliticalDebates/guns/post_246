No, you're not a gun nut.  I have so many   guns   I am not even sure how many anymore.  And so much ammo that it cracked the corner of the foundation in the garage.I love it when people find that out and freak out.  I can only shoot one of them at a time, does it really matter how many I have?  :-P
