I have never understood this argument for taking away guns.  Sure there is some degree of risk involved in owning a firearm, but public safety and health can NEVER be allowed to trump our rights as citizens of these United States.  Otherwise we might as well rename the country "The United Socialist States of America."  Oh, and be prepared to kiss you right to speech against the government and your right to protection from illegal search and seizure to be "temporarily suspended" until they catch all outstanding criminals and hate crime perpetrators.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that even the government recognizes AT LEAST 1.5 million defensive handgun uses per year... that means hundreds of thousands of lives saved, if not millions every year.  Also, check your statistics, because every year more children under the age of 7 drown in toilets and bathtubs than die from firearms.  Why have I not seen an argument entitled "Toilets and Tubs, Are Your Children Safe in Your Own Home?"
