Gun bans are extremel effective in ensuring that people who scrupulously follow   the law   remain unarmed.  Regrettably, gun bans tend not to have much effect on people who don't care to follow the law.  Not surprisingly, the end result is that violent criminals can ply their trade knowing that the full force and majesty of the law is doing its best to guarantee them an ample supply of unarmed victims.  If I were a professional robber, rapist or killer, I would be in favor of   gun control  , as it would be a simple matter of workplace safety for me.
