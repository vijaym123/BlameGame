For a person that has been raised around   guns   and educated about guns, guns can make you safer. But for people that have not been taught the proper respect for guns that just buy a gun to have around for protection. It is the most dangerous thing in the house. I once faced down a street gang that thought I was talking trash about them. If I had had a gun I would have gotten killed.
