All of this is irrelevant because South Africa is completely different from the US. You can't can't take concept that apply to it and try to apply them to the US, it just doesn't work. The criminals there are thugs who have no respect for human life and have no issue with putting a gun to someone's head and pulling the trigger. In the U.S., if you shoot someone in self-defense, it damn well better have been justified or you're going to jail. Criminals aren't willing to make the jump from mugger to murderer so easily. South Africa is the way it is because of a sudden influx of incompetence, corruption and nepotism after leadership changed. This lead, indirectly, to the creation of all these criminals who don't really have any other place to turn. To get to the point where you're forced to mug people to eat is something you have to try to do in America. In S.A., not so much.
