Why is it so hard to understand that criminals couldn't care less more   gun laws  ? The ones we have now don't work effectively, so why   add   more ineffective laws to the list? Case in point:In my home town, we just had a   murder   this past Sunday, where a former'boyfriend' took a 35 year old female hostage and ended up killing her with a handgun.His record showed that he had not one, but two felony convictions, one in the early 90`s and another in 2006.Do you honestly think the thought crossed his mind, 'Oh dear, I'm a convicted felon! I can't carry a gun or I might get into trouble!'OF course not.The only people who actually abide by the laws are the orderly people who want to protect themselves and their families.I have held a concealed carry permit for 20 years. I have never once even considered perpetrating a   crime   with my concealed weapon.
