Australia banned firearms in March of 2000 and guess what happened crime went up. Weird. Here are the stats:  Crime rose after a sweeping ban on private gun ownership. In the first two years after gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms, government statistics show a dramatic increase in criminal activity.353354 In 2001-2002, homicides were up another 20%.according to Australian Institute of Criminology, “Report #46: Homicide in Australia, 2001-2002", April 2003From the inception of firearm confiscation to March 27, 2000, the numbers are:• Gun murders up 19%• Armed robbery up 69%• Home invasions up 21%The sad part is that in the 15 years before national gun confiscation:• Firearm-related homicides dropped nearly 66%.• Firearm-related deaths fell 50%. Gun crimes are rising throughout Australia after guns were banned. In Sydney alone, robbery rates with guns rose 160% in 2001, more in the previous year.according to The Sydney Morning Herald, “Costa targets armed robbers”, April 4, 2002 A ten year study that concluded Australian firearm confiscation had no effect on crime rates.According to "Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?", Dr. Jeanine Baker and Dr. Samara McPhedran, British Journal of Criminology, November 2006.So as you can see we want to ban guns too because it worked out so well in Australia. Also concerning your claim that there are 39892 gun deaths in the US in 1994 according to your 45% of the total stat. According to the FBI website there were only 16,305 murders in 1994. Wow that takes that number down quite a bit, the rest are suicides the estimate from the department of Justice is about 54% that's 21,541 so that leaves 2,046 deaths attributed to unintentional, and undetermined reasons. So taking out just suicides (studies have shown rates don't change with or without guns present so these people would kill themselves anyways), that leaves 18,351 gun deaths in 1994. That's brings it down to 6.55 per 100,000. We can even go lower also according to the FBI in the early 90's approximately 5,000 of the murders a year were committed by people on parole or had an early release for felonies that brings it down to 4.77 because as we all know it is illegal for felons to have guns and as they have proved before they always follow the law not to mention a lot of them got out early and committed another violent crime. Also according to the Department of Justice the homicide rate in 1994 for non-gun deaths was 3.1 wow that still puts us in the top ten on your chart. Also the US isn't even in the Top 10 for homicides in a country according to the UN Office on Drug and Crime from 1998-2000.I could sit on here and give facts and stats all day long but I doubt that would ever change your mind. It all comes down to the fact that more people die from diseases, car wrecks from drunk driving incidents than are killed my guns in a year. Last I checked cancer doesn't save any lives so why not focus the money/time/effort on a bigger problem and leave our one true way to defend ourselves alone.
