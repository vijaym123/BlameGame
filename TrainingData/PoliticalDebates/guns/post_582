 First off, let me say that I come from a family of Law Enforcement Officers. My father was on the LAPD for 7 years and then the BNE for another 30 years. I respect Law Enforcement and applaud the work that they do to keep us safer. Notice I said safer and not safe. It is not the duty of the police to protect individulas. The courts have already ruled on this. So if it is not the job of the police whose job is it? OURS! LEOs run across heavily armed felons and need to be better armed. I wholly agree! These same felons attack civilians in their homes - do not these civilains have the same right to protect themselves?
