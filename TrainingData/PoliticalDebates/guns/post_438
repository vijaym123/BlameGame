The math you have used is all wrong. You multiplied instead of dividing. Using your figure of 5.6 per 100k and assuming that firearm ownership triples the rate, then the rate in homes NOT owning a firearm would be 1/3 of  5.6, which is 1.86 (repeating).But even so, it doesn't work that way, because the figure of 5.6 per 100k is a mathematical average based on national data. It does not reflect the situation in any given household. Its like saying that 45% of Americans own a dog. That does not mean that 45% of every household has a dog (or that every household has 45% of a dog!). To generate meaningful data, you would have to do a study of the homicide rate in households with and without a gun, in a sample population. The data from national   crime   rate reports is too general to draw those kinds of specific conclusions.
