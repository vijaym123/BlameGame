How many gun homicides in the US each year?  A lot How many out of those, were cases for which the victim was known to the assailant?  A lotWhat was the usual cause?  Domestic dispute, somebody picks up the known gun in the house and settles the argument right awayOther common scenarios?  Teen in the house knows where the gun is, gets it out, uses it for his/her means of "problem solving"  99% of   guns   REGISTERED out there might not be used against somebody, but there are an awful lot of guns out there that nobody, um, "took the time" to "register the item with   police  ."  A nurse I knew at I hospital I worked in as a kid carried a gun in her purse.  She felt safe.  An assailant either knew or guessed she was armed, he hid behind a corner near her apartment, hit her over the head as she walked by.  So, the world of criminals added one gun to their stockpile and it's lucky she wasn't killed for God's sake
