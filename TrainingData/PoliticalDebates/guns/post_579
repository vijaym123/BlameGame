It is my belief that by removing the citizens ability to protect themselves, the Mayor and Councilmen of Washington D.C. increased the instances of violent crime and even non-violent crime as the criminals in that city no longer had anything to fear when they were going about their day to day activity's ! If you take an objective look at the crime rates for city and state's that have restrictive gun laws  vs. those having non-restrictive gun laws you will see for yourself that there is a large difference in the numbers and they don't show positively on gun control of any kind.
