"The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. It's documented that they had   guns  . They built the first schoolhouse in 1625. We went about 350 years in this country before there was a   school shooting  . Obviously, guns aren't the problem."--James GregoryMyth: Gun availability is what is causing school shootingsFact: Schoolyard shootings have been occurring since at least 1974, so it is not a new phenomenon due to increases in gun ownership.  Fact: More than ? of these terrorists start thinking about their assaults two or more weeks before the shooting, and ? planned-out their attacks.  Thoughts: In rural areas, guns are everywhere and   children   are taught to shoot at young ages Ð yet these areas are almost devoid of schoolyard shootings. Clearly, availability is not the issue.copied from   http://www.gunfacts.info  /These facts should not be surprising.  Gun-free zones are magnets for killers bent on maximizing their body count. These "Gun-Free Zones are literally "Victim Preserves"!
