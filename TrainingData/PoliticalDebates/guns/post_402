Frankly speaking, I don't have time in my life for people who have the propensity to allow "the greater good" to strip away freedoms.  I have read your arguments and there is no convincing you otherwise, so live your life and I hope that you never come against a criminal with a gun who wants to kill you.  Your position on this issue could be fatal.
