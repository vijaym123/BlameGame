The idea of the potential of gun theft on college campus where concealed carrying is allowed is absolutely absurd.  As "mer" comments previously, an individual would not leave a handgun around like they would a bookbag so that someone else would have the ability to possibly take it from them.  The point of concealed carry is so that others won't be able to see it.  I do not know much about how the actual process works, as far of rules on how you are to carry, but I am sure that the firearm always will be, and has to be on the person in the form of a gun holster or a gun belt.  If a person would be so irresponsible as to not keep track of thier firearm, then they are the type of individual that should not, and does not deserve to carry.  Despite these few people in the population, I do believe that for each person that would do something as stupid as leave their gun behind, there are plenty more law abiding citizens that will utilize their privilege of concealed carrying of a firearm for their own personal protection.
