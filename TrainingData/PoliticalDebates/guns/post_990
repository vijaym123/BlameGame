#originalTopic=Gun_Ownership_Should_Be_Strictly_Controlled
 Guns don't kill people people kill people, I'm sorry but that's just a poor excuse pandered around by the gun  lobby. Sorry guys but guns kill people, a gun is a tool to kill, not protect your family, kill. Stop living in this sugar coated fantasy and wake up all gun ownership should be controlled, and even banned.
