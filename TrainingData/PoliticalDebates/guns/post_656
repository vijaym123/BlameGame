Adam, I understand where you are coming from.  The rub is what's constitutionally acceptable.  I tend to feel that "shall not be infringed" really does mean what it says.Generally, what some forget (or never knew in the first place) is that the bill of rights (and the constitution, generally) is established precisely to limit democratically-elected governments.  It surprises me that Americans think they can legislate various infringments of the first, or second, or fourth amendments simply because the majority of the people want such legislation.  We tend to view democratically-made decisions as the epitome of civilization ... and conveninently forget that "mob rule" is also democratic.  The bill of rights protects those fundamental human rights from democracy ... whether that be a voting electorate or a mob.The very the purpose of these fundamentally basic rights - worship, speech, petitioning the government, gun ownership, etc. - is that they never be infringed democratically.
