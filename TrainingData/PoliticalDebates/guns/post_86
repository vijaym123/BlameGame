The handgun ban prevents law abiding citizens from self defense The present large amount of guns within the US society and the even larger black market of guns provides the proof that inevitably post any banning of guns  they will still be present in society. Their existence will be confined to an illegal paradigm where law abiding citizens will not have access. That will put them at the risk of loosing their lives by being without means of self-protection.
