How about Teachers/Student's can apply for a concealed weapon's license on school grounds from that point they go  through a scanning that checks criminal record, family history, and mental stability. If they pass the screening then they go to a week long   gun control  /safety course. That way it reduces the risk of gang members or mentally insane people being able to carry a gun on campus. Maybe 1/4 of student population and 1/2 of teacher/staff population is able to carry a weapon on campus?
