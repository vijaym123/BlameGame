What backs up LAW in general, is the force behind that law...Did you hear that ??The force...We the people MUST maintain the force, or we are of NO effect...Voice & reason mean nothing to some people ,& of late especially those in power...Those in power have arsenals of far more devistating potential, at their disposal...More power than anything I own...The U.S. Constitution was written by the people ,for the people & the Government is upon the peoples' heads, or in other words, of those representatives of the people...IF that head gets out of control it is the people who must defend their own LAW, as to when the head has breached the (peoples'LAW)....Basicly our fathers did not trust human nature in government or they would not have had to draft & impliment the Constitution....The very foundation & beliefs placed in trust to the citizens, are those presented to our government officials in the form of the U.S. CONSTITUTION...The peoples' intent & the formation of a NEW independant NATION founded on these premises, the right of the individual, sometimes supperceeds ,the right of the majority or that of the "STATE" ....IT is called a REPUBLIC...Pledge alliegence To the flag & to the REPUBLIC for which that flag stands....DO you hear me ????Yes voteing is one form of control but when "tyranny" takes over ,citizens must be in control, to reimpliment the RULE of law,that law being the U.S. CONSTITUTION.....End of story
