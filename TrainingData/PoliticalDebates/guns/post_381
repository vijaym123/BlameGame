If some people are irresponsible and routinely or momentarily fail to prevent small children from having access to their guns, then they should be punished under the appropriate laws (reckless endangerment, involuntary manslaughter, or whatever that may be).  If someone fails to properly keep knives out of reach of a child and that child stabs itself, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of knives.  If some moron buckles their 2 year old into the front seat without a child seat of their car and that child is injured or killed, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of automobiles arguing that public transportation will fulfill our transportation needs.  I know some people are horribly irresponsible.  I've read the horror stories too.  That's why my handgun is in my nightstand inside of a biometric (fingerprint) safe so that my 3 year old son can't get to it, but if the drug dealer that has followed me home twice decides to break in I can keep him from harming my son rather than just calling the police to come put me and my family in body bags.  Some people are stupid and irresponsible.  However, many are very responsible.  When the irresponsible cause others harm they should be punished, but the responsible should not punished due to others' irresponibility or incometence.
