nbkwx55 states in his first paragraph: "The facts are that guns don't prevent crimes in the classic NRA image (a homeowner killing an intruder or a "responsible" vigilante shooting dead a perceived threatening person) at nearly the rate that children, spouses, neighbors, policemen and innocent bystanders are killed by guns. The benefit has never outweighed the costs."Even though I did read further, I didn't have to, you have officially been brainwashed to accept what you hear from Gun Control, Inc. oops, I mean their new name... The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  The fact is that over 1.5 million PEOPLE use guns defensively every year, that was found by the government and in their own words was quite possibly a rather low figure, it may be as much as 2.5 million a year, which some studies by respected people have shown.  That number FAR outweighs the number of deaths per year in America that are caused by guns (I am strictly talking about murders and accidental shootings).  A person has an undeniable human right to protect themselves or their families from a "perceived threat" as you call it.  Guess what?  If no one ever broke into anybody's house, no one would be shot because they broke in.  Stop feeling sorry for criminals... I know you do because you think they are victims, but people come from horrible circumstances every day and make something of themselves.  It's all about personal choice and responsibility for our decisions and actions.
