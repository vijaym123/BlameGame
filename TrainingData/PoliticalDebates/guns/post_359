Although the federal government may not be, i'm a big fan of igilante justice. If someone breaks into your house armed with a gun, your handy bread knife isn't going to be enough to defend yourself from a criminal. Yes, guns are also used in crime, but 9 times out of 10, guns used in criminal acts have been obtained illegally. Criminals will get their guns, one way or another. Why stop innocent civilians from having a right to protect themselves in the case of an emergency?
