If you are so well learned, then why is it you do not understand what the 2nd amendment is about. Have you not read the writings of our founding fathers, you know the ones who wrote the constitution. They are clear in their writings, as the outcome of the court has proven, yes I know it was a 5 to 4 vote, the evidence is well layed out have you even bothered to read the courts findings and reasoning.                                                                               Yes Virginia you are well versed in economics as you say you saw the crisis coming, this is the same thing the politicians are now saying and of course it is also what wall street is saying, if you all seen this coming why did not you do something to stop it,sorry I digress.                                                                                 Where are you coming from, we started out at your support of a total ban on hanguns in D.C. now you appear to be ok with the right to own a "small" gun as long as it fits in your "small" bag. Are you now saying that we the people have the right to own only small handguns that fit into a bag? I'm getting lost.                                                                                           Do you have an issue with the the term "God", well that would be "your Problem.                                                                                         Are you saying that their are no natuarl rights or that we and only "WE" give ourselves rights.                                                                                            My point about wall street and politicians is that I and apparently you know that they cannot be trusted to act in the peoples best interest, why would we give up any more rights.                                                                                             As for my reference to your education level I must apologize, that was un called for. But my reference was to your studying of American History and it's Founding Documents and not meant to be derrogatory toward you.
