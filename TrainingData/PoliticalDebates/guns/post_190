"You start walking home from the bar/restaurant with your wife. A group of men is approaching you on the dark street. You have your hands. Do you feel safe?  Then you remember, you moved to China, you live in Shanghai, a cosmopolitan city with millions of people and no guns. ... You are safe, you're perfectly safe."And how, exactly, does the absence of guns prevent the men from stabbing you, smashing your head in, or threatening to do so unless you give them whatever they demand?  If you are safe walking in China, it is only because violent criminals are rarer there.And if criminals in China don't have guns, it is not because China outlaws them -- after all, we outlaw marijuana.  No, it's because if a criminal is ever caught with a gun he is swiftly put to death.  (That's probably why you are safer in China -- if they're caught using _anything_ to commit robberies, criminals are swiftly put to death.)Of course, if we put criminals to death with as much fervor as the Chinese do, we could be safe in the streets even _without_ controlling firearm possession.As an aside, I don't think "Do guns make you safer?" is the relevant question.  I don't _want_ to be robbed on the street more safely.  I want not to be robbed on the street -- PERIOD!  In _our_ society, letting lots of people carry guns and use them to shoot down robbers seems to be more effective in suppressing abductions, muggings, and carjackings than anything we can expect from the police.
