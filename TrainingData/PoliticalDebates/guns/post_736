You, as one who believes there is no place for physical violence in a civilized culture, may go ahead and use your stun guns, tasers, pepper sprays, etc.  The world could use a few less of your kind.  As someone who looks to the example of those who came before him, however, I see that there are plenty of places for physical violence in civilized culture.  Rome, the antiquity's archetype of civilization, was built on violence.  The Pax Romana, the closest our species has come to world peace, was achieved through war, conquest, intimidation, assassination, and crucifiction.  As a person who believes that physical violence is a necessary part of civilized society, will keep my guns, and woul kindly request that you let me bring them to school with me to protect myself and those I love.  President Theodore Roosevelt once said, "Talk softly but carry a big stick."  You don't even have to use that stick, you just have to let them know it's there.  Nobody is going to attempt armed robbery when there is a good chance of armed resistance.  No terrorist would have tried anything with box cutters (or anything else) if they knew a couple of people on that flight are packing heat.  I just don't see pepper spray having the same effect.
