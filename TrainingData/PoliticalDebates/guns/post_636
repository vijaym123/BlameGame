I find it so absurd to think that we need to have 10 times more   guns   and rifles than the rest of the world!  Where did this fanaticism to own so many guns originally start?  Why do people need an AK-47 rifle or machine gun to go   hunting   for deer?  Its absurd!  The NRA is so far outside the mainstream now and cares nothing about being more reasonable and pragmatic!  They are so extreme in their thinking, that Pres George Herbert Walker Bush, a life-long member of the NRA, terminated his membership when they refused to agree to any sensible   gun control   measure including the Brady Bill!  We need to place strong controls on how many weapons can be manufactured and ration the number that anyone person can have!  Nobody needs more than 2 guns! Fines should be stiffened if not obeyed and if these fanatical gun owners don't like it who cares!  The government knows whats best for the American people when it comes to owning guns!
