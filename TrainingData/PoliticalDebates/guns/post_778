I say I'm moving back home to Utah. What does not allowing them on   campus   say to the gun owners? "Although you're old enough for the government to allow you to have   guns   you can't have them here because there's people." And out in the street there aren't? People in Utah are not that different from the rest of the country. Those committed enough to complete the course and pass all the checks required to get a concealed carry permit should be allowed to carry it wherever. There should be no double standard. "Just because allowing students to carry concealed weapons works in Utah doesn't mean it's going to work in every other state."Sorry. I think it does. A crazy person won't be stopped from a shooting okay fine. Someone who is after someone is not going to barge into one of his classes to take them out if they know some other students in the room could take them down first. People who take guns against those without them are cowards by nature. Confronted with equal or greater force makes them show their true yellow.
