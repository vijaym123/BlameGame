Yes guns should be banned in America. In the UK, deaths by guns are a lot lower. The reason is that it's still harder for the average man in the street to obtain a gun. The American Constitution states "The right to bear arms" and the Americans seem to feel really strongly about protecting this right. Obviosly the constitution is held in high esteem to the Americans, based on their history and pride of independence. However you can't hold onto values and laws that have lost their importance or value. At the time of the American Declaration of Independance, which, I imagine would have led to the drawing up of the rules in the constitution, life and times were completely different. Shootings and murder were everywhere, and if I was George Washington writing a proclamation for a new world, then it makes perfect sense to give the citizens of this new world, the right to defend their land, property, and life. And for this reasons Americans have guns. But, if you can't get hold of one, you can't kill someone with it. It's a simple argument really, guns kill.
