Yo. Law abiding citizens should be allowed to have guns, not convicted criminals. If someone plans to buy a gun, the shop owner should have to do a background check on the customer. That way, law abiding citizens can be the ones with guns, that they'll only use for protection against intruders. I mean, come on. If you think that gun control will help this country, you are sorely mistaken. Criminals aren't stupid. They'll keep their guns while the law-abiding citizens while fork 'em over to the government. I think you see where I'm going with this. Every citizen law abiding citizen has the right to bear arms.
