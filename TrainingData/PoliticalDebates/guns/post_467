There are over 40 states that allow handgun carry.  In any store, business, street corner, highway, or sidewalk you may be near a person with a handgun, concealed or not.These people are honest   law   abiding citizens that have proven themselves as such.For what reason should they be stopped from carrying in National Parks.  There is   crime   there just like everyplace else.  Handgun carriers are not there to go hunting and all arguments that they will shoot wildlife are absurd.Failure to allow self protection in our parks is just another way to restrict people and violate the Second Amendment.
