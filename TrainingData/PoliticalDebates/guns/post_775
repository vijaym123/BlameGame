1. It is already illegal for those that have a mental illness to poses a handgun and they would not in any state be able to obtain a concealed weapons permit so your first point is a complete non-issue. 2. What does this have to do with allowing licensed concealed weapon permit holders to carry on campus? You have to be 21 in most states to get a permit and we are talking about colleges it is against federal law to carry into to a K-12 school. 3. Just about every party I have been too has been off campus so how would allowing permit holders on campus have any effect on this. Permit holders go to parties off campus all the times I have yet to hear any stories from anywhere in the country where a permit holder got drunk and did something. Also no permit holder would carry and then drink it is already illegal and they would have their permit revoked if they got caught.
