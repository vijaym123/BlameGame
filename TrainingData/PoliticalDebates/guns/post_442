It is a sad fact that some do harm themselves and loved ones with guns.  They also do it more often with automobiles but I digress.  To blame the availability of a thing is to miss the point entirely.  It's a lazy dodge to blame the inanimate object for the foibles of humanity.  It's not unlike blaming the alcoholic for having a mouth in which to pour the source of their affliction.  We tried prohibition and you see what that got us; rum runners, gang wars, criminalizing the average citizen, etc.  Your suppositions hold as much water as a colander.  In the latest data which was done in 2006, the percentage of ALL gun deaths in the home where either a family member or acquaintance was killed equaled 2%.  Agreed, that’s too many.  BUT, for the same period involving ALL gun deaths via police on innocents, try 10%!  So, if we’re to bandy stats for the sake of argument, where do you have a better chance of getting whacked?  Excuse me, but I’ll think I’ll stay home tonight… with my guns.
