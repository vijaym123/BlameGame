"If government can't protect you, you should have the right to protect yourself," said Republican state Sen. Michael Waddoups."I completely agree with Senator Waddoups.Some people think the police are there to protect them.  Not so.  The police have no   legal   duty to protect anyone.  They are there to enforce   the law  .  That's it.  If you think that is not true, read the book "Dial 911 and Die".  It has been out for a long time and the book is as true today as it was when written.
