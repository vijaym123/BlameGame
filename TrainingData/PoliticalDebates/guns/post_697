There is a difference between a gun death and a gun crime.  If an innocent woman is raped, there is neither gun death nor gun crime.  If an innocent woman defends herself from a would-be rapist with a firearm, you have a gun death, but not a gun crime.  If a gangbanger shoots somebody for their shoes, you now have a gun death and a gun crime.  Gun deaths are not a good way to show the "collateral damage" of the evil "American gun culture," because, quite frankly, I don't care if a rapist gets shot.  In fact, it makes me glad to know that he is not going to hurt anyone else.  It would be interesting to see a similar study on gun crime, as opposed to gun deaths, and also on crime in general.  There is not better reason not to break into a house than that the owner could be home and armed.
