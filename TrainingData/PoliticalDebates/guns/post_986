 Bad ppl are going to get guns regardless and stricter laws are not going to change that.  /   /> Let's think this through.  By making gun control law tougher you are restricting hunters and good people from getting them.  Criminal will still get them by breaking into houses, stealing them or other bad ways.  You now have bad people with guns and good people with no way to defend themselves.   Do you know anyone who hunts?  Think first.
