I don't want to live in a land where only criminals and political folks decide who can have a gun, too many politically inclined people turn out to be criminals also.   Speaking of guns and bigger bangs...  If McCain had associated with unrepentant abortion clinic bombers would anyone at all vote for him?   If not, why is anyone at all voting for Obama?
