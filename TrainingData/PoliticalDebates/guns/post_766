Here in Arizona, and I'm sure, many other states, most high schools have several police officers assigned to their schools. This is to show a law enforcement presence to protect against gang violence and, possibly, against terrorist attacks.But what about colleges and universities? Arizona State University, for example, has their own police force; but they can't be everywhere at once. And college students are all, legally, adults. Granted, most are not legally able to bear arms, but those who are are far beyond puberty and (usually) are not subject to impulsive reactions. What also needs to be considered, is that those who are of legal age to carry a gun, are protect by the second amendment. So why should our personal liberties be thrown away?
