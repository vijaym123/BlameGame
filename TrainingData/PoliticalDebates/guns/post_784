Concealed carry is currently allowed at 11 colleges. None of these schools have had a single incident of gun violence, gun theft, or gun related accidents. This same argument (that more guns will cause more violence) was made whenever people were pushing for general concealed carry. Unfortunately for the Brady Campaign, violent crime decreased dramatically in states that allowed law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons.
