Was there another point that you wanted to make?  Yes 8400 deaths anually by   guns   in US but 46500 by auto.  So what, I already stated that is an acceptable number.  We also have a higher   murder   rate per capita total with or without guns.  All the more reason to own one.  And the freedom I was speaking of was my freedom to own a gun, which you other nations have lost.  Which seems to have done you no good there in Australia.  I guess since self-defence is not accepted as a reason for issuing a licence to own a gun there -  http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_tot_cri_vic-crime-total-victims  You are #1 just above the UK and Canada.
