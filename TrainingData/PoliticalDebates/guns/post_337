Some of your examples make perfect sense. Banning barrel shrouds seems excessive. Perhaps you are not a gun extremist, after all, just a reasonable gun enthusiast.  But what about one of the more key provisions of the lapsed 1994 federal assault weapons ban - what's so wrong about banning private use of clips with more than 10 rounds?  And with respect to gun shows, it's true that licensed dealers at gun shows must conduct background checks, but individuals not routinely involved in the gun trade ARE allowed to sell their guns without conducting background checks.  It is certainly possible to place additional restrictions on private sellers at gun shows, and thereby to reduce the availability of guns to criminals, etc., without invading private homes.  Yes, illegal gun sales would still occur, but it would be harder.You say you only oppose stupid stuff, and I applaud you for that.  But there are plenty of advocates who oppose all restrictions on gun ownership, just in principle.  That stifles healthy debate, just as much as those who support every restriction they see without thinking about whether it's stupid.
