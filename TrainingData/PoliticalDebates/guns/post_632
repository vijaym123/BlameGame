Well I do not know about you but when the majority of people read the second amendment, Supreme Court,President Obama,Eric Holder,all the Harvard Law reviews,Yale and etc. they all conclude it to an individual right not given by the second amendment but guarrenteed. Of course like most people who are blind to the truth, they will not be told otherwise even when the evidence is abundant. Let them live in their fairy tale,Those of us who know the truth and seek the truth should join with organizations that support our rights. The largest is the National Rifle Association, that will get a rise out of some, but think about it why do you really suppose the NRA is so successful, they try to deal with the facts, hence they are very susscesful.
