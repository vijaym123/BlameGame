UrsrMajor: Thank you for your explanation of the arms lockers at yourplace of employment. A few years ago I wrote to NRA and proposed a pos-sible answer to the problem faced by   law   and company rules-abiding em-ployees who need to keep arms in their private vehicles when at work be-cause they hunt or proficiency-shoot before or after work and [due todistance] cannot 'double back' to drop or pick up their arms at home...Understadably, most managements have a 'no weapons on company property'rule as they fear a disturbed employee may report to work and shoot theother people there. My idea was to offer employees an 'agreement' inwhich they wud:1. Apply for and agree with the rules regarding arms-in-parking lot.2. Never remove a locked-up arm from their vehicle, carry it into any      building onsite, or 'show it to others' [prospective buyers, etc.]3. Park in a reserved part of the lot that is lit up and watched by se-      curity CCTV cameras [to protect the vehicles from break-in as       well as any sign of agreement-violation. The employee shud al-      ways park there [closer to bldgs?] whether they happen to have      their arms aboard--or not. No one need know and it shudn't be an      issue...4. Any violation of the agreement wud result it loss of the agreement      up to termination...I hoped that such an agreement wud satisfy the arm-owning employees and nervous management. Also, I felt [and still believe] that this lotrule wud be something all cud accept. Want to go   hunting  ,   shooting  , orto show an arm to a fellow employee who is interested in buying it? Gooffsite after work to a lawful place [range, gunshop, private property,etc.] and shoot/demo your arms properly...Aaron Allen..
