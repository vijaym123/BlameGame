 Everyones argument for them seems to be that they need them for self defense out of fear of being attacked by other gun owners.  Well if they were illegalised and strictly enforced, that fear should be eliminated, or at the very least, greatly reduced.  Thus removing the need for guns in the mainstream!  />   /> Of course, there will be the odd mentally unstable person who will want to get hold of a gun to shoot a few tens of people for no reason, other than he's depressed.  But you could make the effort, illegalize them, and make it more difficult for him to obtain his weapon of choice, and in the process save a few lives!
