The numbers of   guns   in the United States vastly outnumber the population of the country (300 million).  I am shocked to read news   headlines   mentioning the incidents involving young people and handguns. Nowadays it's not uncommon to read about   teens   killing other teens and adults in gang shootings, robberies gone bad, carjackings, or botched drug deals.   The recent-history murders of   church   officials around the country and   college  -campus massacres of innocent people should serve as a reminder that gun violence in the hands of unstable people has gone too far, and government must do something to at least cut back on this pandemic before it consumes all of us.  I believe that the Second Amendment of the   U.S. Constitution   is not a carte blanche to allow anyone uncontrolled access and use to   firearms  , but rather is a protective measure to ensure the protection of citizens during times of war at home.  In other words, I do not believe that the Constitution writers would have allowed unstable or questionable persons to have access to these weapons of mass destruction.  And neither should we.
