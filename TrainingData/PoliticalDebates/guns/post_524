Some people are afraid of   firearms  . Firearms are as safe as cars, power saws, electricity and many other things in every day life.I read a story about people that were afraid to go to a National Park because they would run into people carry firearms. And the problem is what? 48 states have concealed carry laws. You have been around prople carrying firearms and didn't know it. There are millions of us.We look just like everyone else. We are factory workers,   doctors  , farmers, lawyers, nurses, store clerks and house wifes. You have been next to us in super markets, malls, banks and on the street.We are trained, licensed   law   abiding citizens that carry a firearm for personal protection. Are we suddenly going to go crazy just because we are in a National Park and start killing people? The only ones who have to fear us are rapists, robbers, and other assorted criminals that wish to harm us.Quit worrying about us the next time you go to a park, and have a great time!
