#originalTopic=Gun_Control_Should_Be_Made_Stricter_In_America
 We have too many gun laws now as it is. Criminals do not walk into gun shops and purchase guns. Do stricter laws stop dope from being used and sold? The solution to the gun problem is harher penalties for illegal gun use. If a person commits a crime with a gun, they go to jail for life without the possibility of parole. The more people carrying legal firearms, actually lowers crime rates. The criminals do not know who is armed and who is not.
