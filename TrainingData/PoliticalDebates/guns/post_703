You have made an interesting argument, but you haven't backed it up with any credible source. Remember that the US is not the only multicultural country. But let's say your figures were right, and 86% of the people were responsible for half the gun deaths. That still wouldn't bring down the non-black US gun death rate to the gun death rate of Northern Ireland. So even if your figures were right, and you have supplied no evidence to show that they are right, they don't explain away the statistics.
