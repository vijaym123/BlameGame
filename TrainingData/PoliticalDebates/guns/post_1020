 I own guns, I hunt w/ guns and I will protect myself and my family if need be. I have a permit to carry, and I do. It's a right of Americans.. If you take away the guns from teh public the only ones who will have them are cops, military and crooks. Get out of my gun cabinet.. It's law that I can have my gun.
