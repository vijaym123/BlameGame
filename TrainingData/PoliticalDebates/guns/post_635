You know I grew up with   guns   and guess what not once did I play with them.  The were under my Dad's bed or in his night stand by the bed. Why do   kids   find it facinating to play with something that can hurt them.  Easy their parents haven't taken them out to show them how a gun works and what it's used for.  Once a child is educated and taught respect for things that aren't theirs to play with we would be a lot better off in   society  .
