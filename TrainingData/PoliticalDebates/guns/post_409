The most violent, tragic school tragedy in American History was the Bath School Disaster of 1927. 45 were killed and 58 wounded, most of which were children younger than 6th grade.It was perpetrated by Andrew Kehoe, A school board member who was upset over a property tax increase. He used a series of explosions to carry out his deadly deed.Don't talk about ease of committing terrible atrocities without reviewing, mourning, and respecting the most tragic one of its kind to occur in our nation. Do not imply that the tragic events of school shootings are limited to teen perpetrators- that is false. Do not say teens commonly experiment with drugs and alcohol, and then making a suggestive statement like teens often think of suicide. Those things may all be true- but are not all true of each other. Your mixing a series of different studies from different samples and presenting a picture that is not representative of American Culture.Of course the presence of a gun would increase the likelihood of injury in those circumstances- your talking about a suicidal, homicidal, drug addicted, intoxicated, mentally unstable, depressed person. The presence of a shoe string would increase that person's likelihood of injury.your taking the most extreme, hypothetical, deranged situation- stripping inconvenient facts- and trying to present it as some form of reality. thats not debating- its generating  a fiction.
