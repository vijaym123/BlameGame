"[T]his is what happens more often than not." Can you provide proof of this? This "you are more likely to kill a loved one than a burglar" myth is nonsense. There aren't nearly enough accidental shootings in this country to support that statistic. And given the absurd support alarm companies give to their equipment, I think I'll pass. But don't take my word for it. Call the alarm company and ask them how long they warranty their equipment (3 months for the   big three   lettered one). After that, ask them whose responsibility it is to fix it? It's yours, by the way. And as for a dog, if they're so vicious that they'll attack a burglar, I don't think I want them near my   kids  . And I'd rather not pay the thousands of dollars and the years of training to get a dog that is properly trained.I think I'll keep my perfectly   legal     guns  .
