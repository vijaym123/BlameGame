As an Australian, I have to correct your generalisation that there has been a huge increase in   crime  . This is for the most part, factually untrue. If you look at the links below, you will see that property crime has been trending downwards in the last few years (  http://www.aic.gov.au/topics/property/stats  /), while only Assault has risen among violent crimes (  http://www.aic.gov.au/topics/violence/stats  /). Irrespective of the statistical aspects, the fact remains that gun related violence is really very rare in Australia. When people do commit violent crimes, they use   firearms   in only around 15% of cases (  http://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/keyFacts_handguns.html  ). In any case, even before the bans of 1996 and 2001 (which applied to automatics, semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and high capacity semi-automatic pistols),  there has never been a   law   permitting private citizens to carry firearms of any sort on their person for any reason, so it isn't as if people stopped carrying   guns   or keeping them in their homes to not having them at all.
