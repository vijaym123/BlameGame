You make a good point, but I can't say I totally agree with it. I can see both sides of this argument. The problem I see is that addicts will still engage in illegal behavior to obtain their drugs. On the other hand, they're only that expensive because they're illegal. On the other hand, Portugal still made it illegal to sell, so the prices won't necessarily drop because there is still risk in selling them. I personally have never partaken in the use of illegal drugs, and I am against them because of what they do to people's lives, and more importantly, what they do to the lives of their families, especially   children  . But if you want to engage in self-destructive behavior and ruin your own life, that just makes more room for the rest of us. Of course, then we will end up paying to fix your screwed up life in the form of higher   taxes  . Because you know once the government advocates   drug use  , they will be responsible for treating you as a result of your inability to control your own life.
