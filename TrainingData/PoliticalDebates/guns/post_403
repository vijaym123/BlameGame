You shouldn't have the personal freedom to own a product whose only purpose is killing multiple people. If we banned most guns, I'd be much less worried about a criminal with a gun who wants to kill me.Is the US in a situation where 1.5m to 2.5m times every year, someone has to show a gun to stop a crime, and yet so many crimes still get committed (174 victims per 1,000 citizens age 12 and over in 2006, per the Dept of Justice's summary NCVS (    http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm    #summary)? If you add up both categories (committed and "stopped" crimes), we're living in a war zone. Statistically speaking, you have a 50+% chance of having to show your gun once every 5 years to stop a crime just to keep the defensive gun stats up, and you'll still be a victim of a crime once every 3 years. Does that seem to match up with your experience?Unless, of course, the defensive gun use statistics are exaggerated. And guns are really enabling crimes at a rate on par to that with which they are preventing crime. And it's all part of a broader problem of a mis-perception of the high risk of crime and the need to keep guns on the street to prevent them. Which situation seems more likely - the war zone or the false perception?The assumption that gun possession keeps you safer is just false. The gun you own is more likely to be used to kill you, your spouse or an innocent person than to kill an attacker. The perception that armed attackers lurk around every dark corner is also false. The perceived need for guns keeps them on the street. The actual experience is that they are not effective crime deterrents, their easy access means criminals have easy access to guns and the average person on the street is not safer as a result.Many dangerous weapons can only be possessed and used legally by the government. It's time we made handguns and most high capacity rifles part of that category.
