Wait Brady...Arent these students advocating the right to carry on campus, since they ALREADY carry virtuallyy everywhere else  ??Why would opening the campus to Concealed Carry change any of these factors/variables ???We dont hear about alcohol being a problem with these folks that are carry "concealed" in their everyday life, what makes you think allowing these LICENSED students to carry in class would change anything that happens outside of class (the drinking and parties) ???
