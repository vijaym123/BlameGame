Why is the fact they are students change anything? They still have to be over 21 pass a background check that includes a mental health check and in most states take a firearm class. Carrying a concealed handgun is not paranoia it is the acceptance of responsibility for your own personal protection. Yet again as I have said on here many times what makes a college campus any different from mall, grocery stores, bowling alleys, movie theaters, restaurants or any other place adults with concealed weapons permits can carry. You don't here about a CWP holder going off and shooting unarmed people in those places what makes a college so different. Your second paragraph completely contradicts itself. We aren't saying we are going to go out and arm everyone we are just going to allow those already legally able to carry their firearms everywhere else to be able to defend themselves on college campuses. The way the current laws are written only criminals can carry on campus because they don't follow the laws anyways, those that get CWP's are law abiding citizens that are currently defenseless.
