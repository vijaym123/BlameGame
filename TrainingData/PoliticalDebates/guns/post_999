 This is one of the few areas where I think America has got it right. In fact, I would say there are too many restrictions on gun ownership in America. Widespread gun ownership does not necessarily equal a large number of deaths through random acts of violence. The opposite could just as well be argued. Look at Switzerland. There is very little crime there. Yet virtually every Swiss male is in possession of an assault rifle. Every Swiss male is inducted into the military and upon induction is given an assault rifle and told to keep it in his home for use in case the country is ever invaded. This service as a soldier in the military reserve is essentially lifelong.   />   /> Watching the BBC, they endlessly harp on this gun ownership issue when covering the US every time there is a massacre.   />   /> America was, to a large extent, populated by criminals. Those criminal genes don't go away. That explains why there's lots of gun crime in the US, not the lax gun laws.
