While I agree that the Brady Campaign is anti-  constitution  , at least when it comes to the 2nd Amendment, I think it's a stretch to call them anti-American. I am a   legal   carry permit holder, so I staunchly defend my 2nd Amendment right to bear arms and defend myself anywhere and everywhere. However, one of this country's greatest traits is the right to disagree with the government openly with no consequence (as long as you keep it peaceful, of course). I will therefore counter their rhetoric with facts all day long, but I wouldn't call them unAmerican no matter how loony they get.
