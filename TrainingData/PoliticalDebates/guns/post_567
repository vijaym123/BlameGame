2.>>>>>>> Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in anymanner whatsoever and for whatever purpose:<<<<<<< For example, concealedweapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendmentor state analogues. The CourtÕs opinion should not be taken to castdoubt on longstanding ****prohibitions on the possession of firearms byfelons and the mentally ill***, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearmsin sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, *****orlaws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale ofarms.******Which is, essentially, what I came up with.  But the right to legislate these restrictions is left to the state.   D.C. isn't a state.   So...  This is my limit.  I don't know know enough about the government workings of D.C. (choo choo, all aboard that curiousity train)  If there is a ban, there's a ban.  Perhaps it would simply better to be a criminal in this case...  if you really feel that you cannot protect yourself without a handgun, practise civil disobedience responsibly.   Again, I don't see the need for handguns unless you're a police officer... .   I have rifles and shotguns, these are adequate protection in my home, and they are the last things I list in home protection (since the best protection is prevention).
