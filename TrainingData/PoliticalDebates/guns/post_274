Why does every political figure in the world surround themselves with firearms, and with armed guards?Answer - because guns make them safer.  They don't just make them feel safer, they make them safer in an undeniable, concrete way.  You can even ask Barack Obama this question.  The only HONEST answer he could give to explain his belief - that he should have guns but everyone else should not - is that his life is more important than are the lives of the rest of us.  About the only people who feel less safe around guns are those who are afraid of guns.  Fear hyperbole rules their views on this issue.
