arrw said "I can't think of many troops who enlisted to defend this country and it's people suddenly turning around and start killing said people."That may be true...I hope so.  But troops have often turned against citizens (not on a large scale in this country yet) when they have been convinced that a certain internal group is a threat to the nation they are sworn to protect.  Not to belittle the issue, but have you seen "Revenge of the Sith"? Its a wonderful parable about the suicide of liberty in response to an exaggerated internal threat.  I hope everyone was paying attention to the not-too-subliminal messages that were deliberately put into that movie. No one in the Old Republic (U.S.?) realized they were slitting their own throats until it was too late.  That's how it could happen here.  Its already happening here with the "War on Terror".  Warrantless wire tapping, secret courts, prisoners without due process, etc.  But most of us think this is all fine.  After all, our government is protecting us from bad guys, right?  Well, I'm more afraid of my own government than of Bin Laden (as much of a threat as he really is).  And it doesn't matter if its the Democrats or Republican in power.  Its power AS SUCH that scares me.  I'm still trying to fix this through the ballot box, and availing myself of the First Amendment (as I am here).  But at least I still have my guns...just in case!
