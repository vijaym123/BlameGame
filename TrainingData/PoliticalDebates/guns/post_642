I thought state rights and slavery were the primary causes of the Civil War-not the abolishment of a militia!  You got me there!  I thought militias were replaced over time by the state national guard?  The people were encouraged during the Revolutionary War to volunteer and help fight against the British.  The   congress   which is the people's house, made a decision after we won our independence to abolish the militia!  You conservatives are always railing against the government-but if any of your cherished benefits are cut you people are the first to complain!  The government has done an incredible job in taking care of us over the years!  The Tennessee Valley Authority brought   jobs   and electricity to the south during the Depression and helped improve these people's standard of living!  Worker's safety,   food   safety, the National Cancer Institute, the US Post Office, AMTRACK, and The Deal, during Roosevelt's time, are just few examples that government got it right! I was probably overboard in my comments about   gun control   but I get so fed up by all these lunatics on the right who always criticize the government but never have any feasible alternatives!  I'm not calling you a lunatic mike1948!  I guess   guns   are a unique, sacred right here and nowhere else!
