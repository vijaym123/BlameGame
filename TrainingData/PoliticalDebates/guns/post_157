 The US Constitution recognizes the militia only as an organization of the state The Second Amendment is not the only part of the Constitution that speaks of the militia and its place in America. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Constitution are: "To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress." In 1965, in Maryland v. United States, 381 U.S. 41 (1965), the need for a definition of the militia arose when an airliner collided with a National Guard jet. In this ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote, "The National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution." The militia is "well regulated" by the state in modern America. There is no longer a right to form an independent militia to combat the state.
