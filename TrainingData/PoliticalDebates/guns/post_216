MilitiaJim makes an interesting point when he points out that soldiers are sworn to protect the Constitution, not the members of our government. The President also swears an oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution".  But what happens when the government, or the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces specifically, begin to violate the Constitution? What do the armed forces do when they have to choose between protecting the Constitution and obeying the Commander-in-Chief, who is presumably sworn to protect it?  I don't fault our soldiers in either case.  It would be a difficult choice.  But in the meantime, citizens could find themselves at the wrong end the U.S armed forces.  Sid
