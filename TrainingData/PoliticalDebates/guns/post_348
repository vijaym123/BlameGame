 When I go to   church   there are more gun toting mama's and papa's there and I cant tell you one thing it does make me feel safer. These are responsible people by the way, not druggies or crazies, just God fearing, country loving, family protecting good ole folks. Maybe I will get a gun. No I think I ll just hang with those who have them instead.
