The question itself is biased.  The proper question is whether   law  -abiding citizens should be forced to disarm whenever they are going into National Park Service controlled property.  Or "Should the ban on lawful   firearms   in National Parks be repealed?"  Asking whether   guns   should be allowed in National Parks puts the burden of proof on gunowners when it rightly belongs on those who wish to continue forcing us to disarm.  Criminals are going to ignore the policy and continue to do what criminals do.  Only law-abiding citizens try to obey this silly ban.  The ban is patently unconstitutional and is actually in conflict with federal law.  It's way past time for the ban to go away.  Guns are not banned in National Forests and there isn't a problem with people legally carrying guns causing problems on those lands so why is it assumed that people will be less responsible in National Parks?
