So Brady...At ALL 9 Public Universities in Utah, as well as Colorado State University and Blue Ridge Community College in Virginia there has NEVER been a gun theft on campus. And as you know, all of these places currently allow LICENSED students to carry on campus.These 21+ year olds are not the students living in dorms, or on campus.. Most Universities wont allow students that have over 60 hours (19-20 years old) to live on campus.It's not "increasing gun ownership", these students are ALREADY licensed to carry virtually EVERYWHERE else. They already have the licenses, and they already have the firearms (and there havent been any problems).When will the Brady Campaign stop the LIES ???
