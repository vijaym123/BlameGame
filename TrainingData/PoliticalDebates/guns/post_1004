 I am licensed to carry and conceal.... My father teaches the course for the NRA. I don't think EVERYONE  should have it but if those who are law abiding citizens had them.. I bet  all the money I have that violent crimes (especially towards women) would go down. The requirements to qualify should be extremely strict. I have been through a lot in the past 15 years and I know none of it would have happened had I been packing heat back then! If we outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.
