I always find it amazining that some people have to tell us what a phrase means, because when we disagree with their interpetation they say that only they can know what was really meant by a phrase that is to simple for the average "citizen" to truly comprehend. Bulls**t. This is why a decent education in the history of this country must be a mandatory part of ones learning process. As is evidenced by the fact that our rights, although not wholly uninfringed, are still protected by this great document. In the first place it dosen't give us our rights it merely says the goverment shall not infringe our rights. Some people refuse to look at the evidence and wholly rely on their emotional intellect in viewing this issue.
