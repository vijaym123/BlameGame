You must be a card carrying member of the NRA because thats the line they always use that if there is any type of   gun control   whatsoever, than other freedoms will be lost!  How absurd! The government is the people and I stand by my facts which comes from published sources!  We have by far, my   guns   than anybody else!  Our founding fathers never intended for us to own so many weapons-it was for a militia in the states!  There should be restrictions, background checks, and a major tax on all weapons sold here to discourage the sale of   firearms  -like   cigarettes  !  When guns get too expensive for these people, that will have the desired effect!
