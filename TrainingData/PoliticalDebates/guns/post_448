Maybe it's because suicidal people don't run when a gun is pointed at them.  Bearing in mind that criminals are a small subset of people as a whole, as are suicidal persons, it's a safe bet that people who put the barrel to their temple are more likely to get hit than those who duck and run.  Also, the law-abiding citizens of the world generally don't fire on the ones who run away, because they are no longer a threat.  We also don't fire on the ones who surrender, because they're no longer a threat.  If we fire, it's because the attack continued after the gun was presented, which is an overwhelming minority of cases.
