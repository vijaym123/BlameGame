Hunting isn't allowed in   national parks  , so that's not it.  I think the reason people want to be able to carry loaded   guns   in national parks is because they think it's their "  god  "-given right to carry a loaded gun at any time, anywhere.Needed? No.Allowed? How come?  And please don't tell me it's your right to carry a loaded gun, we already know that.  REALLY answer the question: how come you feel the need to have a loaded gun by your side all the time?  Are you that fearful for your well-being?  If so, how come?I'm a single woman who lives alone in a large metropolitan area.  I don't own or carry a gun, and I don't feel the need to do so.  I guess I just don't afraid.  If someone wants to kill me or break into my home, they're going to do so whether or not I have a gun.  So what's the point of me having a gun?  Please, somebody convince me that it would be wise for me to have a gun.
