Banning guns wouldn't bring down gun violence significantly because people who are committing gun crimes are getting their guns illegally in the first place. And other countries that have banned guns have alot more variables to consider besides just banning guns alone. most other countries have a much tighter justice system that doesn't give any wiggle room for crimes in general let alone gun crimes.
