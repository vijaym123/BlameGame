For too long, people who have been safely and responsibly carrying   firearms   for personal protection in states containing   national parks   have been required to surrender that right at the park borders.  The newly enacted Coburn amendment allows carrying on national park lands only under the same laws and restrictions as are currently in force in surrounding state lands.  There is absolutely no reason or evidence to expect   law  -abiding gun-carrying people to suddenly become crazed killers or poachers simply because they cross an invisible, imaginary boundary line.  On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that   the law  -breaking people who currently carry illegally off of park lands will give a bit more thought before committing crimes on park lands now that potential victims have the potential of fighting back. If the National Park Rangers truly believe that self defense is not an issue in national parks, why is every Ranger I've met armed?  I know the answer to that and so do the people from Freedom States Alliance.  The only Rangers who opposed the Coburn Amendment were the politically appointed management wonks in Washington, DC.   Two national parks are within an hour's drive from my front door.  I regularly come into contact with Park Service rangers and speak with them on a personal, unofficial basis.  And everyone of the men and women on the ground was and is in favor of the Coburn Amendment because they are the first to admit that bad things can happen to good unarmed people.
