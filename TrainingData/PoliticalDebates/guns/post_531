This chart is out of date and woefully bereft of any meaningful data.  It's like saying that more cars lead to more deaths in cars.  Well, duh!  So it gives an incomplete assessment.  It's like an old electrician used to say, "More people die from 110 volt household current because that's what most voltage is!"
