Hope to not offend my fellow Americans, but you developed a culture of hysteria in the past...Spying on anyone... permitted. Taking figerprints when entering the country... permitted. Holding hostile combatants without a trial... well... ok... overlooked...All this shows, something terribly bad happens to you and you throw all the liberties, for which you used to be a worldwide role model for centuries, overboard. Rather hysteric, dont you think? So why care about one more liberty (which in my opinion is the most dangerous liberty of all American liberties) lost?I wish I could understand this reasoning...
