That should have read that Canada's "violent   crime  " rate, not   homicide   rate, was double that of the U.S. (Juristat: Crime Statistics in Canada, 2004 and FBI Uniform Crime Statistics online).You are also correct that freedom doesn't stop at the U.S. border. But the U.S. has enjoyed being one of the most free nations in history. It has a long and proud history of preferring to err in favor of personal freedoms. However, this is beginning to change. And it is not a good thing. This is a perfect example. The right to bear arms is guaranteed in the Constitution. And the only reason Brady and their buddies are trying to change that is because they have severe hoplophobia. They believe that either 1) my gun is going to jump out of its holster and begin firing randomly into crowds of little old ladies and   children   or 2) that as soon as I touch a firearm I will lose all ability to form rational thoughts and perceive every word and action as a deadly threat and attempt to neutralize said threat using deadly force. Both are completely ridiculous of course, but Brady and VPC, etc. don't believe that I can be trusted with   guns  . Well I don't believe people who refuse to look at facts and think rationally can be trusted with my rights.
