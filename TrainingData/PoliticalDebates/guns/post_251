Not that this is any surprise, but you obviously don't read things fully, nor very well.What good is your gun going to do you when there's already someone in your house with a gun pointing at your head?   How are you going to get your gun then, sugar pants? I have   guns  .... do you think they magically appear in my hands whenever I want them to?  Do yours?  The whole point is that guns do not make you safer.  They are not magic charms that will prevent people from doing harm to you.  They do not tell you the future.   They are a measure of protection that only works IN CONJUNCTION with other things.  With out those other things, your chances of actually getting to your gun go down significantly.  My dog (passed away last winter) never attacked anyone at all.   But he barked at unfamiliar   cars   and people .....   and coyotes....    Dogs don't have to be vicious to alert you to the presence or an about-to-be-presence of a stranger in your home or yard.   Also.  It's not that cool to recommend yourself.
