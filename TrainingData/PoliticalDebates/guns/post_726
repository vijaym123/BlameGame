Trying to "neutralize" someone who is trying to kill you without hurting them is idiotic, and so is advocating it.Think of it this way: You're sitting in a classroom, or office, or cubicle, whatever you'd like to imagine. Someone walks in with a gun and starts shooting people. Which of these would you want to have in your pocket? A gun, a Taser (keep in mind, the types that actually shoot out electrodes often cost more than a quality handgun), or pepper spray? Obviously, two of these aren't guaranteed to work and one of them requires you to carefully aim at someone who's probably 20 or so feet away. Assuming you have the Taser that shoots electrodes, you have one, or sometimes two, shots before you reload. A Glock 19 will give you 15 shots and nobody can shake off new holes being put in them.Keep in mind, this guy will kill you unless you intervene. The idea of concealed carrying is that you're only going to use it if you think someone is going to kill you. When someone is trying to kill you, you don't want to mess around with Tasers or pepper spray - you want to kill him. Saying "well, I don't want to hurt anyone!" is nice on paper, but you don't want to fuck around if somebody is shooting at you.
