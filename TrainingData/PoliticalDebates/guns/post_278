Michael, you just named 3 countries that don't have the right to bear arms. How exactly did the maintain their freedoms?And you're only talking about accidental shootings. Since   firearms   are illegal in those countries, the shootings that take place tend to be of the less accidental persuasion. I'm not sure what English speaking has to do with   gun control   or the right to bear arms, but there is sufficient evidence that gun control does not equate to less gun violence/  crime  . Take Mexico for example. They have extremely restrictive   gun laws  , and very high gun deaths. And what about Scotland? English speaking yet have the highest assault rate in the "developed world." (Scotland tops list of world's most violent countries, The Times, September 19, 2005) And according to a 2001 study by the Dutch Ministry of Justice, Australia has the highest contact crime rate per capita of the 17 top industrialized nations. In 2003 Canada's   homicide   rate was double that of the U.S. despite massive gun control efforts (Juristat: Crime Statistics in Canada, 2004 and FBI Uniform Crime Statistics online.)So while more firearms necessarily equates to more accidental shootings, it also serves as a deterrent against crime, as numerous studies have shown and none that I have seen so far refute.
