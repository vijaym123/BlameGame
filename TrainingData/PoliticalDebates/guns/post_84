 Gun bans only disarm citizens that are not inclined to commit crimes Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776[8] - "Laws that forbid the carrying of arms. . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."
