Please review the following.   http://www.gunfacts.info/pdfs/gun-facts/5.1  /gun-facts-5.1-screen.pdfLook particularly at the "Guns and Crime Prevention" portion where it mentions that there are 2.5 million defensive uses of   guns   every year in the U.S., far more than gun   deaths  . I would further encourage you to read the whole thing. So much of the gun-control lobby's position is filled with fluff and outright B.S. that it's actually insulting that we even have to have this discussion. And remember, very few countries have a drug problem that mirrors that in the U.S. And as a result, the majority of gun   crime   in this country is gang related. So should I lose my right to own and carry a gun because some other jackass can't get a real job? In the same way I shouldn't be robbed of the privilege (not right) of driving a car because some idiots can't seem to get slobbery drunk and not drive their   cars  , that argument makes no sense.
