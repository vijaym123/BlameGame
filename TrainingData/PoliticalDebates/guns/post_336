Dmonasgevery gun purchased in the US from a gun dealer or gunshow has a background check associated with it through the FBI NICS background check and a form 4473. What we the gun extremists, disagree with is increasing the national debt to fund programs that have never lead to a conviction and have cost nearly half a billion dollars, like oh, say, ballistic fingerprinting. nearly 500 million dollars- to show . . . .nothing. That could have funded a lot of schools to save some of those people from a life of crime they failed to prosecute with that waste. we don't oppose reasonable things- we oppose stupid things, and unfortunately- thats all that has been put forth. Stupid stuff- like a ban on barrel shrouds, proposed by Sarah Brady. You know what a barrel shroud does? it acts like a heat sink- just like on the processor of your computer. it helps cool things down. Gun powder burns hot (big surprise there I know)why ban something that provides such a function? the answer is stupidity. Many politicians try to play on the lack of information of non-gun owners, make false statements and create straw man arguments to things that aren't a problem.Gun control is very rarely about guns, and far more often about control.
