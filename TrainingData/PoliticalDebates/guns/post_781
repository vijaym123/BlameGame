The national group Students for Concealed Carry on Campus now has over 36,000 members. Also we don't advocate giving every college student a permit we only wish to allow those who already have a permit to be able to protect themselves on campus as they do everywhere else. What makes a college campus so special? Obviously after Vtech we know that there isn't some invisible force field around colleges that keep evil people out. Criminals don't follow the law so as it sits right now only criminals can carry on college campuses. Why does it matter if they drink on the weekends as long as they aren't carrying I could care less. Last time I checked having some drinks on the weekend doesn't qualify you to be a psycho that wants to shoot up a school.
