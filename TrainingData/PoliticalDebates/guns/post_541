"Gun-free zones" are some of the most dangerous areas in the country. Does one really think that criminally minded individuals will NOT carry there because of   the law  ? Such laws only keep   law  -abiding citizens from carrying there and it makes all of us easy targets and easy victims, but then the government wants us to be. They project their own victim mentality upon us all, denying the truth in favor of their own prejudices and misguided beliefs."No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms."---Thomas Jefferson: Draft Virginia Constitution, 1776.We are to be free, not slaves who have no right to defend themselves, which by the way is the formal and official opinion of the UN, that "no human has a right to self-defense". Jefferson also said, "Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."  Here! Here Mr. Jefferson.
