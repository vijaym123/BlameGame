So I'm sitting here in class (was a student, now a teacher), some kid pulls a gun on me. I'm a law-abiding, qualified citizen. What am I to do? Option A), I don't have the ability to carry a handgun and get my butt blown off the face of the earth because I'm defenseless.Option B), I have a weapon that I only intend to use in dire emergencies and can defend myself when I need to. I have a better chance at survival. Hmmm...seems like a no-brainer to me.
