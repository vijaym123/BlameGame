We have a winner folks! Jeff hit the nail on the head. Law-abiding citizens are just that. It's the thugs and scum that you have to worry about. Not the legally armed citizens of our country. Wake up people. You're not going to keep   guns   out of the hands of criminals by taking them out of mine. Just like you haven't kept drugs off the streets of America. Narcotics are absolutely illegal to use without a doctor's prescription, everywhere, all the time. And what effect have laws against them had? None. So what makes you think that guns will be any different? The answer: ignorance. Actually, I don't even believe that is true. Deep down you know it's true, but you refuse to acknowledge it. Well, it's time to do so America. The 2nd Amendment is not going away, and neither are the legally armed citizens of this country.Let's put a little more emphasis on putting criminals behind bars and keeping them there and little less on criminalizing   legal   behavior.
