Please explain how having the tools, skills, and will to stop this incident before it ever became a horrible ordeal could have possibly made it worse?When I lived in that great gun-ban paradise Chicago, I was raped.  Not only did the police fail to act on my prior reports of stalking and harassment, but thanks to the rapist's shall-we-say connections he was never arrested or prosecuted.I now live in a state where I can own and carry a gun for personal defense.  My training includes gun handling and safety control under stress, combat marksmanship, the judicious use of deadly force, weapon retention, and force-on-force (actual combat using non-lethal Simuntion marking cartridges or Airsoft guns).  How does this preparation render me less safe than being helpless?
