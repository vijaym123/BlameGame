It's 3am. You're done going out for the night, and say goodbye to your friends. You start walking home from the bar/restaurant with your wife. A group of men is approaching you on the dark street. You have your hands. Do you feel safe?Then you remember, you moved to China, you live in Shanghai, a cosmopolitan city with millions of people and no   guns  . Not even the police have guns. Then you realize that the men approaching know you don't have a gun. They rob you and rape your wife, and you were not able to defend yourself. Happens all the time in shanghai, I've been there and witnessesd it. Don't believe the PRC propaganda, it could get you killed.
