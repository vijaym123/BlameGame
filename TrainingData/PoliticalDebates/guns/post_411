lets talk about those school shootingsthose 'no guns allowed' signs don't seem to be working from the mass murderers standpoint, so maybe we should try a new approach, like right to self defense. Why shouldn't I, a PhD student, legal to carry every but campus, be afforded the same protection of my rights? why not my professors? faculty? staff?the one consistent thing about school shootings, all the honest and good people listened. Not one honest, good, person was armed- because they listened to those signs. Unfortunately, homicidal, deranged killers, ignored them- and people were slaughtered.Kids don't need to go through metal detectors cause of fa 'need' to keep guns on the street- don't make such statements. Kids go through those metal detectors to appease higher ups that their signs just need one more step to work. First we hang a no gun sign, then metal detectors, then searches, then cops in buildings. How much money, and how many lives, need to be thrown at this problem to realize WE NEED A NEW APPROACH.Columbine was committed by 2 crazy people who broke 22+ gun laws- just gun laws. we don't need more gun laws. we need to strip away the crap ones, stop new crap ones from being written, and give money to our police to do their job. How much money was wasted on those things that don't work?Most people are good and smart- and will make good, smart choices. They will do the same regarding defense of their own lives. Trust them.
