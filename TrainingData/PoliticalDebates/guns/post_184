this is the most ridiculous argument i have ever heard. drugs are illegal in the US. I can find someone selling drugs in maybe 10 minutes. those men in Shanghai? they can kill you in plenty of ways without a gun. unless knives are also banned in China, they can probably kill you with one of those. Also I'm curious, are you posting from China?
