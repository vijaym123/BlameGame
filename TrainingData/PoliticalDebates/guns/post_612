I served my three years in Israel, so I don't know how the states's armies work but this seems to me a logical difficulty. A militia should be under government control--if it's just a bunch of people getting together without government oversight, it's probably not a militia. It's a bunch of armed people. And I'm fine with militias, but it seems like an awful lot of people on here--and maybe this is a poor extrapolation, but possibly an awful lot of gun owners--take a lot of pride in the fact that the reason they own   guns   is to..destroy the government if need be. So can those people be members of a militia? Are they just lone nuts--or a large collection of lone nuts? Mob nuts? Has the US government just done an incredibly poor job vetting?
