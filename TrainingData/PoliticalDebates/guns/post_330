Here in Texas if you have your concealed handgun license, you can buy a hand gun with no waiting period. The reason for the waiting period is so some guy all pissed off at his woman has time to cool down before he blows her brains out in a fit of rage. I like the waiting period, I believe it prevents such things from happening. I know, if he wanted to he could beat her brains out with a baseball bat, but that's not as easy as just pointing, and pulling a trigger.
