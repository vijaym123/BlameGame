I have is that you have any say in what is reasonable.  You and your ilk for far too long have espoused the extremist views that any law will prevent anything.  Joel, you have yet to meet a gun-control law or proposal that you did not think was reasonable.  That is the problem.  Your reasonable is my "what?, are you crazy!"  Further, if no gun law is unreasonable, pretty soon no guns, a total ban by any other name is still a total ban, will be achieved, to your delight and my families nightmare and, most likely, soon to be death.  So you will forgive me if I don't want you or your ilk anywhere near this debate.  You have one purpose in life, dressed up any way you want, of removing guns from the USA.  We will have to continue to agree to disagree.
