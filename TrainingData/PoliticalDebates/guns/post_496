Our national park rangers now are trained in   law  -enforcement tacticsand procedures as they now must deal with armed idiots and outrightbadguys [dope-growers, smugglers, thieves]...To allow everyone to car-ry loaded   firearms   in the   national parks   will not improve the 'ambience'as the impaired or evil gun-toters threaten everyone else...Persons with firearms permits and hunting licenses [in those few locations where hunting is allowed] shud be able to keep locked, unloaded arms invehicles for proper usage only...
