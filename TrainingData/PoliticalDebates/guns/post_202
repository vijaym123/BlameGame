Guns in the hands of everyone creates the great equalization of those who would seek to harm others. Consider for yourself if you were on a New York subway and knew that most likely 50% of the people on the subway were carrying a gun, would you not be safer should some idiot think he or she was going to rob you or someone else? Criminals will always be able to get a gun if they are h*ll bent on doing so; equalizing the playing field is what will make them think twice before attempting to use it.
