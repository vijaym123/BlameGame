#originalTopic=Should_guns_be_banned_in_America
we would gain nothing from banning guns in america. guns are dangerous when people illegally use them why would we ban guns in america? to stop the violence and all the killings linked to them correct? and if killing people is already illegal what good is it going to do to make guns illegal. If you are willing to kill some one you probably don't care what you are killing then with is legal or not. The only people banning guns in america would hurt are the people that are defending there homes, business's, families. Since guns are already a lucrative black market making them illegal would make it worst. just like banning alcohol did to this nation. look how much money that made the mob it brought them into power. what do you guys think a black market surplus do?
