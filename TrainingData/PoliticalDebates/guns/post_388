Do a search to find some child gun death stories, then search on names in the story to find followup details.  In almost all of these stories you'll find obvious risk factors in the household--drugs, felons, gangs, previous abuse, an unemployed boyfriend babysitting children from another man, often several factors at once.  You will usually find evidence that the presence of the gun was already against the law.  You will also find that most of these stories are of fairly young children.  To find the teens you will need to search for something like "gang shooting"You aren't likely to find ordinary law-abiding middle class households with "child gun deaths".  After you ask the policeman if he wants *everyone* armed, ask his opinion on licensed concealed carry, an entirely different question.  You will find that street cops have a good opinion of license holders--They understand we are allies, not enemies.  Look up the percentage of criminal convictions among license holders--You'll find that we are many times more law-abiding than the general population, and slightly more law abiding than police.  Fistfights don't turn into gunfights but rather are avoided entirely--The kind of people who get into fistfights rarely get licenses. Take a look at the malls, schools and churches where gun wielding maniacs show up--you will find that "no guns allowed" areas account for a vastly disproportionate number of these cases.  Even the insane can understand they can kill more people if they have the only guns until the police show up.  Luckily these shooters are rare--in a year they don't have as many victims as a single day of traffic fatalities.
