The Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment confer only individual rights, not collective rights. There is no such thing is a collective right to bear arms? How would it be excercised and upheld? Moreover, this notion that the Second Amendment confers only a collective, not an individual right, is entirely contrary to the purpose of the Bill of Rights, which confers only individual rights. Certainly, these individual rights may be shared universally, but they cannot be divided from the individual.
