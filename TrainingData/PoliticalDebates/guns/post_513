The NRA does not advocate any   firearms   bans. They advocate safe and responsible ownership of all types of arms and   education   and training to utilize them safely and effectively.And I disagree that there should be no laws on the books. There should be laws about the ILLEGAL use of firearms and consequences for those uses. And those laws should be strictly enforced.
