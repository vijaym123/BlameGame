"That's why it's the last line of defense."That's exactly my point.  A firearm is and should be your last line of defense.  Say you have an alarm, and they get through without tripping it, which really isn't as hard as it sounds, the dog starts barking, so they shoot it, so you pick up the phone to dial 9-11, to find that they've cut the phone line, and now you're up there with no way to defend yourself and the knowledge that someone down there has a gun.  That dog barking would have been enough to alert you to the presence of an intruder, allowed you to open your double locked safes and closets, which to me seems a bit excessive, but I digress, and taken care of the problem.  If someone is good enough to get past the dog, you are screwed, plain and simple, but I don't think even a ninja could get past the dog without making some noise.  Like I said before, there is nothing wrong with having an alarm, a dog, and a gun.Also, you have mentioned yourself that you hunt.  That is a measure of safety.  If a natural disaster were to strike, and you were placed in a New Orleans type situation, you have the tools to acquire food and defend your home from looters.  That is a part of safety.
