Your argument is so poorly presented that it is close to not making sense at all.  Obviously just a passionately heated pile of rhetoric not based on sound research or truth.I am not worried about some keg pary where someone might be carrying a gun.  These parties are completely unregulated and have nothing to do with the argument.  The point is protecting our youth while they are attending classes.  Something that our police and security systems have largeley failed to do.Why not arm our youth?  We send them overseas to fight and die.  At 18 we are considered adults but most of the people I know who carry have been inculcated since a young age about the responsibilities related to firearms.  "An armed society is a polite society."
