Sure, I guess what you are saying is possible.  If I have a gun and I stick it in the perp's face, he may think he is being threatened and react violently.But that would be the last violent reaction he would ever make.What?  Am I supposed to just cower in a corner and let the perp do whatever he wants to do to me and my family?Hell NO!
