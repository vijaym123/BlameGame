Whether one agrees with the right to own guns or not, it is highly hypocritical of the States United to Prevent Gun Violence to dismiss the NRA's argument as invalid, due to problems in causal relationships, and then go on to commit its own similar arguments. The Hepburn and Hemenway document that was referred to is not without faults, and it actually works in neither the SUPG or the NRA's favor to cite it. The bipartisan fact checking website, Factcheck.org, provides a valuable article regarding this question and the topic at hand at   http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/are_violent_crimes_more_or_less_common.html  .Of important note is the following:"It found that studies of the United States or U.S. cities, states and regions 'generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence-homicide association.' ...So where there are guns, there is likely a higher rate of murders committed with guns in particular. However, the report noted, 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.' In fact, major studies on this issue have not shown cause-and-effect Ð that the presence of guns causes more murders to occur (or crime in general) Ð which is certainly a more difficult hypothesis to test."Though I personally am a strong supporter of gun ownership and do believe that widespread gun ownership is safer than none, the argument for it (or against it), when it comes to causation of crime and murder, is not as simple as the NRA or the the States United to Prevent Gun Violence suggests. It is a very difficult thing to measure and quite often goes far beyond inanimate objects themselves.
