While you might be correct that   guns   will be banned, though I certainly hope not, to say we will get rid of guns is misguided and ignorant. If you, for one second think that criminals will be denied guns just because they are legally banned, you are not in touch with reality. Look at the   drug war  . Cocaine is illegal today for use by anyone, but you don't see that slowing down the use of it, do you?And thank you so very much for resorting no name calling and insults. It only serves to validate my point and paint you as an extremist who cannot be swayed by facts or logic. You're making the job of those who need to "evolve" much easier. And maybe when YOU grow up, you'll see what I mean.
