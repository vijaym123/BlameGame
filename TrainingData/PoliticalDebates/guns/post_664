I can't imagine that the American founding fathers intended that the United States would end up with more gun violence than comparable countries. However, that is what has happened. In other countries there are tight restrictions on guns and there are many fewer gun deaths. It therefore makes sense for Americans to find ways of reducing gun violence within the constitutional limits that are imposed.
