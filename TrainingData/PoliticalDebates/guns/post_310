Safer from criminals or safer in protecting our freedoms? In plain and simple words, the Second Amendment allows American citizens the option of overthrowing a corrupt government if the need ever arises. The Founding Fathers saw how England tried to disarm the Colonials in order to control them. The wanted to ensure that American citizens would always have the right to own and bare arms, thus the words, "..shall not be infringed". The government should always fear the people, not the other way around. Other checks and balances were written in the Constitution for the people to use, but the Founding Fathers knew from experience that only citizens with   firearms   could truely be free. There are many elected people today that would have been hung for treason in the late 1700's. Many citizens today are fed up with the government restricting their freedoms. Treaties being made that are not in accord with our Bill of Rights and laws create "permits" and "licenses" to exercise our Rights go against preserving our freedoms. Laws are needed to punish citizens who abuse their Rights. Not laws that punish citizens for exercising their Rights. We've seen a great increase in firearm and ammuniton purchases. I don't believe that people are in fear of   crime   as much as loosing their freedom. I honestly believe that any new laws that restrict or limit the Right to bare arms will cause a second Revolutionary War. These anti-Second Amendment people know not what they do.
