You are obviously informed of your "opinion" based on buzz words and statements repeatedly given credibility that have a political agenda.Did you know that it is a criminal offense in and of itself to consume   alcohol   and carry?  The person or student that does has not gone through concealed weapons training and therefore not legal.  We are talking legal law abiding students that should be allowed to protect themselves and others should they need to.People of your mindset do not find the common denominator in Virginia Tech, Colorado Springs, Mumbai or even the holocaust to name a few.  The criminal, and in the one case a government, has found the common denominator.  Why do you think the psycho's don't choose our local rod and gun clubs for their killing sprees.CWC permit holders have a grave responsibility whether a student or citizen.  Not only do they put their lives in danger they better be trained and skillful so no harm comes to innocents.  The biggest responsibility? If there is reason to pull it you use it and the one to go home to his family is you.  There is no such thing as a fair fight.  If it is fair the tactics need to be rethought.What isn't fair is a   college   campus full of innocents being defenselessly gunned down and their   parents   with empty beds from lack of one person on the right side of the law not being able to carry.
