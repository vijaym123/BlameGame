Show me where I said a 12 year old should be able to drive a car. For that matter, show me anywhere in the   constitution   where it guarantees a 12 year old, a 20 year old, or a 100 year old the right to drive a car at all. Since that right is not guaranteed in the constitution, it can, and should be infringed, or at least limited. The constitution does guarantee the right to own weapons. The Supreme Court has even stated as much in Heller and other rulings. They have reviewed other writings of our founding fathers and determined that their intent was not limited to the militia or any government body. Also, can you show me where I said anyone should be able to buy a gun? I don't believe I said that. But as long as you meet the criteria that have been established by most states, I don't believe the government should have any say in it. I haven't been convicted of any crimes, I have not been adjudicated as mentally unstable, and I have met all the requirements my state has set forth. Further, there is no proof that taking away my   guns   will make anyone safer. None, nada, zip, zilch. There is plenty of proof to the contrary, however.
