My US Senator voted no to allowing concealed weapons in   national parks  . I proposed a wager to her that if by the end of her term as Senator, there were NO incidents involving conceal weapons, that she resign and not run for re-  election  . If on the other hand, it is proven that there is a statistical correlation that having allowed conceal carry in the national parks made them more dangerous, I would donate $1000.00 to her favorite anti-gun organization in her name. She declined.
