Yes, owning a gun kills   children  .  So does owning a car. But if everyone drove their   cars   responsibly, according to all applicable laws, this wouldn't be true.So does buying a plane ticket. But if planes were perfectly maintained and there were no extenuating circumstances like weather, this wouldn't be true.So does walking across the street. But if parents always looked both ways, and nobody ever ran red lights and always yielded to pedestrians this wouldn't be true.While some of the above examples are a bit ridiculous, so are all the arguments presented by the anti-gun agenda. The fact is, some people are irresponsible. Whether you're talking about   guns  , driving, taking   medication  , paying their bills; whatever. You CANNOT change the behavior of irresponsible people.However, if you look at the number of   legal   gun owners in the U.S. vs. the number of violent crimes and accidents attributed to them, you will see they are among the safest group, statistically. While the story above is tragic, it was the result of irresponsible parents. Parents who would leave a loaded gun so obviously accessible to a 3 year old child, probably leave poisonous   chemicals   like bleach within easy reach as well. But where is the anti-bleach agenda in this country? Another thing the author forgets to mention is the myriad other ways children die in this country at much higher rates than gun accidents, most of which are also preventable.
