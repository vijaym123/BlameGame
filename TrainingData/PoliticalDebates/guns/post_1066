 Guns shouldn't be illegal. I know its a huge problem in the U.S, but in some nations, such as Canada, there are barley any gun related crimes involving homicide.  Perhaps getting a gun should just become harder, even though i think that's not possible. I really think the U.S should make gun control one of their main priorities so they can redeem themselves for their notorious criminal reputation.
