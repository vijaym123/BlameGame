#originalTopic=Debate:_DC_handgun_ban
 Handguns should be banned due to their uniquely dangerous concealability. Hand guns are concealable as well as portable. This makes them ideal for criminals and murders that seek to be mobile with these weapons and surprise their victims without detection. Rifle's and shotguns do not share this characteristic of portability and so are less dangerous.
