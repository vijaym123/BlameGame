Well it is already illegal to carry a firearm will under the influence so those LAW ABIDING citizens who have permits wouldn't be carrying while intoxicated anyways. I have numerous firearms in my apartment, so do many of my friends and I am aware of at least one fraternity who has multiple gun safes in their house. I have yet to hear of an incident in at my college campus. No to mention how many students do you know that come to class drunk? Most of the parties I am aware of are off campus where guns are already present so how would allowing them on campus by licensed individuals to and from class make it any more dangerous? Also you don't need 9 months of training to know how to use a firearm for self defense. Most self defense situations occur at less than 12 feet and last mere seconds. You like many of those against this concealed carry on this forum forget that these college students are adults that carry everywhere else why does a college campus automatically make someone prone to violence?
