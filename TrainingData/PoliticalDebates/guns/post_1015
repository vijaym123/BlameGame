 The statement said EVERYONE should have a gun, which I am interpriting as ALL PEOPLE should have a gun.  But NOT ALL PEOPLE are fit for guns. (ex - kids, crazy people, convicted violent criminals)  Also the gang violence would increase because they can just walk with guns and cause gang wars to solve problems and the hate groups would use the guns for their own needs.
