Access to guns may increase the likelihood that a committed suicidal person will choose that method over another, but it does not affect the suicide rate over all.  An example is Japan, where the rate of gun ownership is less than 1% but the suicide rate per 100,000 population in 2005 was more than double that of the US.Source:  World Health Organization    http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/country_reports/en/index.html
