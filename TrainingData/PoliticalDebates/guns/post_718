First off their are no kids involved only adults.second those adults already carry everywhere else in life without a drunken incident.you may also wish to concider the type of student that would go threw the time to get training.  the cost of a weapon, holster, the cost of training, the fees to the state for the permit, the hoops they have to jump thew to be in compliance with the law, the finger printing and backround checks.i dont have to tell you that those individuals are not the regular old pot head binge drinker steriotype you make all students out to be.---another thing to think about is students that are unable to defend themselfs agianst attack.  people like disabled students, women, and anyone else that is either to small or weak to be effective in their defence.but i guess its better to just get rid of the idea because one person may be irresponsible, even though to date it has never happend anywhere campus carry is allowd.
