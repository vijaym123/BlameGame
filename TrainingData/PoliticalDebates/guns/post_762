Let's just get this straight. CCL holders don't carry because they're "paranoid", they carry because they're responsible citizens. Everyone that I know, including myself, takes pride in the fact that they've undergone extensive training, through both professional and personal avenues, to make sure that they're intimately knowledgeable about their   firearms   and as prepared as a person can be for a life or death situation. We're not a bunch of gun-toting nutjobs, and we're sure as hell not paranoid.Cars kill many more people per year than   guns  . You probably won't get pulled over everyday, but you carry your license everyday just in case. Same with responsible CCL holders. Even though the chance of use is slight, we still carry just in case.
