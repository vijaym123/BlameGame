Think about it. Criminals will always have ways to get guns. So what other viable option will level the playing field 100% of the time? A gun.  And as far as accidental deaths are concerned, other inventions we made kill people. Take cars for example. I know cars have an adverse effect on the environment, but do you really propose banning cars? If this was the Medieval times, we would be having this debate about bows and swords. Guns are just another tool on the list that people can die by, but that doesn't mean we should get rid of them.
