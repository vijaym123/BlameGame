Having an armed guard means he will be the first to go. If someone wants to do serious damage, they either do it in a place where they will meet no resistance, or they are doing it in a place where they can control the enviornment by eliminating the only knwon threat. By allowing CCW or CHP holders (usually 21 and older, not students) to carry at school, you do two things. 1 - you eliminate the safe zone that would have otherwise existed FOR the bad guy. 2 - You take his control of the situation away, by eliminating his knowlege of those that could resist and end his rampage earlier than expected. Although an armed guard is better than nothing, having armed and trained individuals is the better choice.
