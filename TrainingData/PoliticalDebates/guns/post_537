In response to Marloma - a gun wouldn't necessarily have made a difference, but it *could* have made a difference, and an individual has the right to choose whether he/she has the means to defend themselves and make a difference where their personal safety is concerned.  Yes, the women survived, but at what cost?   Would you choose to be raped for 14 hours straight or would you choose to arm yourself and increase your odds of not being raped?  Why do you say "More than likely they would have been less safe"?  Every day, ordinary Americans defend themselves from criminal attack through the display or use of a firearm.  It's a fact that if a criminal knows his prey is armed, he moves on and looks for easier prey.  It's another fact that if you ban guns, only the criminals will have guns.   And another thought in closing - when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.   Wake up, buy a gun and take responsibility for your own personal safety.
