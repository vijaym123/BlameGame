This is true, but not just for women.  In the case of a felonious attack by an armed assailant, a man is just as vulnerable as a woman.  I would also have to say that the victim deserves more than an "equalizer," and in fact should have an advantage.  Most of these attacks happen outside the home; in dark parking lots, and other lonely, empty places.  How about let's change the rules?  How about handgun ownership automatically comes with a CCW (concealed carry permit)?  But it also comes with the responsibilities - that is, a handgun owner must receive extensive training - and I'm not talking about a couple of sessions at the local range - training in small arms for self-defense and situational awareness.  Ultimately, human life is at stake, and surely none of us wants a passerby hurt.  Imagine then how many criminals would consider a robbery in your local Mom & Pop, with the possibility of several armed and trained citizens inside.
