Congressman Young Shares a Message with Alaska this Memorial Day
Memorial Day serves as a specific remembrance of our fallen soldiers and a day for all Americans to convey a deep appreciation to the service members and their families that made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation and preserve our freedoms. Our nation owes a great debt to our fallen heroes and their families that simply can never be repaid.
Without the selfless sacrifices of our men and women in arms, our nation would be a fragment of what it is today.
No other group in our nations history has embodied the lofty ideal of the American Spirit more selflessly than these individuals.
I compel all those living in our great state to take time this Memorial Day weekend to remember the contributions our fallen men and woman in uniform have made for this great nation and the sacrifices they endured.
In addition to honoring those who will never again share the embrace of their loved ones, I would also like to offer my sincere gratitude and thanks to our nations veterans and those who currently serve to protect our nations freedoms.
May God continue to bless this great nation whose birth would not have been possible without the sacrifice and determination of our military heroes, and may you all have a safe Memorial Day.
