Rubio Comments On President
Obamas Immigration Executive
Orders
Marco issued the following statement
regarding President Obamas
executive orders on immigration:
We need immigration reform.
But the right way to do it is to first
bring illegal immigration under control
by securing the borders and enforcing
the laws, then modernizing our legal
immigration system. After we do these
things, we will eventually have to deal
with those here illegally in a
reasonable but responsible way. The
Presidents actions now make all
of this harder and are unfair to people
in our immigration system who are doing
things the right way.
In
an
August letter to the President , Rubio
highlighted the adverse impact unilateral
action will have on any progress toward
real reform, and laid out the steps
necessary to achieve immigration
reform.
Rubio, Colleagues Introduce Ebola
Visa Ban Legislation
On Thursday, Marco introduced the
Keeping America Safe from Ebola Act
of 2014
, legislation to impose common sense
travel restrictions by creating a
temporary visa ban for nationals who are
habitual residents of a country that the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has
designated as a country with
widespread transmission of
Ebola. Aid workers and foreign
military who must travel to the United
States would be exempted.
Co-sponsors of the bill include
Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Pat
Roberts (R-KS), John Thune (R-SD) and
Mark Kirk (R-IL).
Imposing travel restrictions
is a common sense approach to
protecting Americans from Ebola,
said Rubio . Over the past
few months, weve seen
Ebolas deadly reach, and air
travel has proven to be its gateway to
the United States.
A temporary visa ban aims to
limit the spread of Ebola by placing
strict limitations on travel to the
U.S. from Ebola-affected countries and
protect Americans from any potential
threats of an outbreak, but it does not
mean that our efforts to combat the
virus will stop there,
added Rubio . America must
remain committed to this international
challenge by addressing it at its
source and increasing our assistance to
countries that continue struggling to
contain this deadly outbreak. America
will not be completely safe from Ebola
until the virus is contained at its
source.
Rubio Secures Administrations
Support For Venezuela Sanctions, But
Questions Remain About Policy Toward
Colombia And Cuba
During a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing, Marco questioned
President Obamas deputy secretary
of state nominee, Antony Blinken,
regarding U.S. policy toward Venezuela,
Colombia and Cuba.
In his testimony, Blinken announced
that the Obama Administration now
supports the
Venezuela Defense of
Human Rights and Civil Society Act of
2014 , a bill sponsored by Marco
authorizing sanctions on individuals
involved in serious human rights
violations against peaceful demonstrators
in Venezuela.
Regarding U.S. policy with respect to
Colombia, Marco asked whether the Obama
Administration would ever consider
commuting the sentences of Colombian drug
traffickers currently imprisoned in the
U.S.. Although the nominee pledged to
consult closely with Rubio and the
committee on such a policy, he did not
categorically rule out the
possibility.
Lastly, Marco questioned Blinken about
any future unilateral changes to
U.S.-Cuba policy absent democratic
reforms on the island nation. When given
several opportunities to categorically
rule out the possibility of unilateral
changes to Cuba policy, Blinken
demurred.
Following the hearing, Marco issued
this statement:
I am encouraged that the
Obama Administration finally announced
its support for legislation pending
before the Senate that would impose
visa and financial sanctions on
individuals committing human rights
abuses in Venezuela. In addition to the
visa freezes the administration is
already implementing against such
individuals, they should immediately
freeze the financial assets of these
individuals. With respect to Colombia,
it is important that the U.S. make
clear that Colombian drug traffickers
serving in U.S. prisons will serve out
their sentences, regardless of what
demands may be made in negotiations
with the FARC. On Cuba, I am very
concerned that President Obamas
nominee to be John Kerrys deputy
at the Department of State passed up
several opportunities today to
categorically rule out the possibility
of unilateral changes to U.S. policy
towards Cuba. Unless Cuba begins an
irreversible democratic transformation,
the U.S. should not reward the Castro
regime with unilateral concessions from
us that enrich the regime and help it
repress millions of Cubans.

Marco also weighed in on the Colombian
governments decision to suspend

Forces of Colombia (FARC), following the
guerilla groups kidnapping of a
Colombian general. Read his statement

Constituent Casework Corner
Paul is a veteran residing in North
Florida. He filed a claim with the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in
2010, which was denied. He filed an
appeal, but he filed for bankruptcy in
2013. Paul contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance, and
a member of the Senators staff
contacted the VA to request his appeal be
expedited due to his financial distress.
Recently, the VA overturned the denial
and granted him an increase in
entitlement. As a result of the new
rating, Paul received a retroactive check
from the VA.In addition, his
monthly disability payment was increased
on November 1st.

Agency Updates
Scam Phone Calls Continue; IRS
Unveils New Video to Warn Taxpayers
IRS YouTube Video:
Tax Scams:
English
As incidents of an aggressive
telephone scam continue across the
country, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) unveiled a new YouTube video with a
renewed warning to taxpayers not to be
fooled by imposters posing as tax agency
representatives.
The new Tax Scams video describes some
basic tips to help protect taxpayers from
tax scams.
These callers may demand money or may
say you have a refund due and try to
trick you into sharing private
information. Here are five things the
scammers often do but the IRS will not
do. Any one of these five things is a
tell-tale sign of a scam. The IRS will
never:
Call to demand immediate payment,
nor will the agency call about taxes
owed without first having mailed you a
bill.
Demand that you pay taxes without
giving you the opportunity to question
or appeal the amount they say you
owe.
Require you to use a specific
payment method for your taxes, such as
a prepaid debit card.
Ask for credit or debit card
numbers over the phone.
Threaten to bring in local police
or other law-enforcement groups to have
you arrested for not paying.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS and asking
for money, heres what you should
do:
If you know you owe taxes or think
you might owe, call the IRS at
1.800.829.1040. The IRS workers can
help you with a payment issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to believe that
you do, report the incident to the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA) at
1.800.366.4484 or at
www.tigta.gov .
If youve been targeted by
this scam, also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their
FTC Complaint Assistant
at FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
Remember, too, the IRS does not use
email, text messages or any social media
to discuss your personal tax issue. For
more information on reporting tax scams,
go to
www.irs.gov
and type
scam in the search box.
Additional information about tax scams
is available on IRS social media sites,
including YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/user/irsvideos
and Tumblr
http://internalrevenueservice.tumblr.com ,
where people can search
scam to find all the
scam-related posts.
