President Speaks - Farm Bill Passes - Propane Skyrockets
Dear Friend,
While the President was delivering a powerful and positive State of the
Union address focusing on jobs, the economy, and problem-solving last
week, thousands of Minnesotans were every bit as concerned with heating
their homes and businesses as propane supplies dwindled and prices
skyrocketed. Thankfully, by week's end, we had secured an extra $15.8
million for Minnesotans in need of help to pay for fuel under the Low
Income Housing Assistance Program (LIHEAP).
Meanwhile, the House passed the long-awaited Farm Bill, including
important reforms for commodity programs, crop insurance, forestry,
organic agriculture, energy programs, new conservation measures, and an
agreement of an $8-billion cut to food stamps (SNAP), which is more
than the $4 billion the Senate had voted for, but far less than the
$40-billion cut the House had previously approved. More on the Farm
Bill's provisions below.
By Thursday morning, I was back home for meetings and events in Grand
Rapids and Hibbing. It's all here in your Monday Report. Thanks for
taking the time to catch up with me, and have a great week.
Sincerely,
signature

As Propane Crisis Worsens, We Stand Ready to Help
The propane shortage was top of mind for many during my visit to Grand
Rapids last week. Click on the logo above for some of the Grand Rapids
Herald coverage.
Whether you're an individual or family, a small business owner, farmer
or community leader, I hope you will make my Duluth office your first
call at (218) 464-5095 for emergency propane assistance during this
record cold winter. We are in touch with suppliers on a daily basis,
and can provide you with help and information to get you through a
shortage experts say could last through March. More importantly, we are
working to find the cause of these excessive price hikes, and to fix
it. People cannot afford these high prices.
On Friday, the Obama Administration - at my request, along with
Governor Dayton and other members of the Minnesota Congressional
delegation - released an extra $15.8 million in federal emergency
assistance for Minnesotans under the Low Income Housing Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP). We can help you determine whether or not
you're eligible for help under LIHEAP, and also steer you to other
forms of assistance through local banks, utility companies and state
agencies. Governor Dayton's declaration of a state emergency over
rising prices and dwindling supplies of propane has also temporarily
removed a number of regulatory barriers in order to speed deliveries.
Over the longer term, Congress and the Administration must determine
exactly why this shortage happened, and fix the problem. We are on the
case, and I will keep you posted. Meanwhile, all the resources of my
office are available to you. If you need help, please call.

"Take Action," President Tells Congress, in State of the Union
On FOX9 News early Wednesday morning to discuss the President's speech
from the night before.
It's clear from the speech that the President is determined to get
things done for the American people - and make 2014 a year of action
and accomplishment. As I listened last week from the House floor, I
heard him challenge Congress to put aside partisan politics and be a
partner - not a barrier - in rebuilding the middle class, creating new
jobs, and stimulating our economy by raising the minimum wage and
reinvesting in America - with an emphasis on job training, education,
college affordability, high tech manufacturing, rural development and
retirement security.
I'm ready to work with him - and give it everything I've got - to turn
our attention homeward, away from wars of choice and nation-building
abroad where it is neither wanted nor needed, and back to the
priorities and values that make America the greatest nation in the
world.
Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Band Leaders Join Me
at State of the Union Address
On my way to the State of the Union address with Melanie Benjamin of
the Mille Lacs Band
and Carri Jones of the Leech Lake Band.
I am proud to represent 5 of the 6 Minnesota Ojibwe tribes, and was so
honored to have Melanie Benjamin, Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs
Band, and Carri Jones, Tribal Chair of the Leech Lake Band, with me as
my guests for the President's the State of the Union address. The
Ojibwe Nation contributes so much to our northern Minnesota history,
culture, economy and way of life, and the presence of two of their
great leaders at what is traditionally the President's most important
speech of the year symbolizes our commitment to continue to work
together for the benefit of all.
Finally - A Farm Bill The Farm Bill the House passed last week
represents the kind of productive and positive result we can achieve
when we put aside partisanship and focus on issues we can agree on.
Despite the gridlock of the past year, urban and rural interests in
Congress came together to take a huge, positive step forward to provide
both rural farming communities and families in need with a good measure
of certainty and stability. Despite the disappointing cuts to SNAP (the
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) which I opposed, the bill
contains vital reforms for dairy farmers in Minnesota's 8th that will
work to prevent a sharp rise in milk prices. The bill also includes
important reforms for crop insurance - eliminating direct payments to
farmers and instead expanding crop insurance so farmers have security
during difficult seasons. Click to read more about the Farm Bill.

Home on the Range - Talking Jobs, Business,
and "Make It In America"
Jobs, business and the Range economy were front and center during my
presentations to the Hibbing Chamber of Commerce and the Range
Association of Municipalities and Schools (RAMS) last week. Click on
the front page above for more news coverage.
Minnesota Diversified Industries (MDI) Provides Jobs & Opportunities
Across the Range
With President and CEO of MDI, Peter McDermott, Nolan field staff and
former State Rep., Tom Rukavina, MDI employee Gary Slesland, State
Senator David Tomassoni, and MDI employee Rod Wood.
Our "Make it in America" tour took us to Minnesota Diversified
Industries (MDI) in Hibbing last week for an inspiring look at how this
50-year-old company hires people with disabilities to manufacture
world-class corrugated plastics products for the U.S. Postal Service
and so many other enterprises across our state and nation. MDI's unique
"Partners 2" program also provides specialized job training and help
for people with special challenges seeking to enter or re-enter the
work force. In addition to the Hibbing operation we visited, MDI also
has facilities in nearby Grand Rapids, Deer River, and in Saint Paul.

The Week in Pictures
At the Range Association of Municipalities and Schools (RAMS) annual
dinner last week, sharing a laugh with my intrepid field staffer and
former state Representative, Tom Rukavina, and RAMS Executive Director
and former Iron Range State Senator Ron Dicklich. The RAMS organization
brings locally elected officials together to help build Range
communities and advance common-sense public policies to benefit
businesses and build our educational system.
It was great to catch up Aurora City Counselor Dave Lislegard (left)
and Virginia City Councilor Charlie Baribeau at the RAMS annual dinner.
We talked jobs, economic development, and, of course, mining.
My visit to Grand Rapids included a meeting with Mayor Dale Adams,
Councilor Barb Sanderson, Bud Storm from the Grand Rapids Chamber of
Commerce, and representatives from Grand Rapids Independent School
District 318. While some states get back $4 to $5 dollars for every
federal tax dollar they pay, Minnesota gets back only about 65 cents. I
am working closely with communities like Grand Rapids to bring money
Congress has authorized for local projects home to Minnesota's 8th
District, so we can continue to improve our schools, roads, bridges,
airports, harbors, parks, and public buildings.

Last Week in Washington
In a short but really busy week, I:
.
Joined the Sustainable Energy and Environment Caucus (SEEC)
- dedicated to advancing policies that promote clean energy technology
innovation and domestic manufacturing, creating green-collar jobs,
fight against global warming, and protect our nation's clean air,
water, and environment. For more, visit http://seec-israel.house.gov/
.
.
Cosponsored the TEACH ACT (H.R.3505) - to develop
accessibility guidelines for electronic instructional materials (the
kind you see accompanying textbooks in colleges and universities).
.
Met with and discussed a range of policy issues from health
care to small business tax reform - including how to attract quality
dentists to rural communities - with Dr. Zak Zakula, a Hibbing-area
orthodontist in town with fellow members of the American Association of
Orthodontists.
.
Became a cosponsor of the High School Data Transparency Act,
which works to further equality among high school athletic programs by
requiring schools to submit yearly reports.
Coming Up This Week
We've got a full week in D.C. coming up, with possible consideration of
H.R.3590, the Sportsmen's Heritage And Recreational Enhancement Act. As
a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I'll be giving this
my full attention, as it has important ramifications for hunting and
fishing, as well as northern Minnesota's multi-billion-dollar tourism
industry.
On Tuesday, I will meet with President Obama, Members of his Cabinet,
and fellow House Members at the White House, to discuss the coming
year's legislative priorities.
The Senate is expected to take up and pass the Farm Bill passed by the
House last week - if that happens, the bill will make its way to the
President's desk to become law.

Finally...
Congrats to Beargrease Winner Nathan Schroeder!
Chisholm's Nathan Schroeder with his winning team, first to cross the
finish line
of the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon.
We certainly did not lack for snow or the cold during this year's John
Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon - and a hearty congrats to Nathan
Schroeder of Chisholm on his third win of what is no doubt an
exhausting and thrilling 374 miles of mushing. Schroeder now turns his
attention to Alaska's famed Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which begins
on March 1st. Best of luck to you, Nathan - you're the 8th District's
top dog once again.

Meanwhile,
the

passed
the
long-awaited
Farm

including
important
reforms for
commodity
programs, crop
insurance,
forestry,
organic
agriculture,
energy
programs,
new
conservation
measures,
and
an
agreement
of
an
$8-billion
cut
to
food

(SNAP),
which
is
more
than
the
$4

for,
but
far
less
than
the
$40-billion
cut
the
House
had
previously
approved. More

the Farm
Bill's
provisions

By
Thursday
morning,
I
was
back
home
for
meetings
and
events
in
Grand

and
Hibbing .
It&#8217;s
all
here
in
your
Monday

Thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
catch
up
with
me,
and
have
a
great
week.
Sincerely,
As
Propane
Crisis
Worsens,
We
Stand
Ready
to
Help
The
propane
shortage
was
top
of
mind
for
many
during
my
visit
to
Grand
Rapids
last
week.

Whether
you're
an
individual
or
family,
a
small
business
owner,
farmer
or
community
leader,
I
hope
you
will
make
my
Duluth
office
your
first
call
at
(218)
464-5095
for
emergency
propane
assistance
during
this
record
cold
winter.
We
are
in
touch
with
suppliers
on
a
daily
basis,
and
can
provide
you
with
help
and
information
to
get
you
through
a
shortage
experts
say
could
last
through
March.
More
importantly,
we
are
working
to
find
the
cause
of
these
excessive
price
hikes ,
and
to
fix
it.
People
cannot
afford
these
high
prices.
On
Friday,
the
Obama
Administration
-
at
my
request,
along
with
Governor
Dayton
and
other
members
of
the
Minnesota
Congressional
delegation
-
released
an
extra
$15.8
million
in
federal
emergency
assistance
for
Minnesotans
under
the
Low
Income
Housing
Energy
Assistance
Program
(LIHEAP).
We
can
help
you
determine
whether
or
not
you're
eligible
for
help
under
LIHEAP,
and
also
steer
you
to
other
forms
of
assistance
through
local
banks,
utility
companies
and
state
agencies.
Governor
Dayton's
declaration
of
a
state
emergency
over
rising
prices
and
dwindling
supplies
of
propane
has
also
temporarily
removed
a
number
of
regulatory
barriers
in
order
to
speed
deliveries.
Over
the
longer
term,
Congress
and
the
Administration
must
determine
exactly
why
this

happened,
and
fix
the
problem .
We
are
on
the
case,
and
I
will
keep
you
posted.

all
the
resources
of
my

are
available
to
you.
If
you
need
help,
please
call.

As
I
listened
last

positive
result
we

achieve
when
we
put

focus
on
issues
we
can
agree
on.
Despite
the
gridlock
of
the
past
year,
urban

came

to
take
a
huge,
positive
step

provide
both

with
a
good
measure
of
certainty
and
stability.
Despite
the
disappointing
cuts
to
SNAP
(the
Supplemental
Nutritional
Assistance

the
bill
contains
vital
reforms
for
dairy
farmers
in
Minnesota&#8217;s
