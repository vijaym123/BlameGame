WOW! Boehner is facing an epic collapse. TUESDAY:
Boehner bragged that Republicans would win a &ldquo;big victory&rdquo; on Election Day. YESTERDAY:
Boehner&rsquo;s hopes came crashing down.
[Fox News Poll] Democrats 45%
-
Republicans 44%
TODAY:
USA Today confirms that Republicans are tanking just days before the Election!
Democrats 43%
-
Republicans 42%
This is EXACTLY what we were hoping for! Now, we just have to get-out-the-vote.
David -- our final monthly fundraising deadline of the election is tonight at MIDNIGHT.
If we can fully fund our get-out-the-vote program, we can win shocking upsets over Boehner's Republicans. Just 6 donations from the 60659 zip code to go. Can you chip in something right now?
