Fighting for our Veterans
Welcoming home troops in Clermont County
In my new role as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I'll be working extensively on veterans issues including transition, education, housing, and employment programs and opportunities.
I recently introduced legislation to improve education and housing programs available for veterans, including within the GI Bill. Read more on the three bills below:
The GI Bill Quality Enhancement Act
( H.R. 476 )
GI Bill Processing Improvement Act
( H.R. 475 )
Homeless Veteran Reintegration Program (HVRP) Clarification and Reauthorization Bill
( H.R. 474 )
Our responsibility doesn't end here. My aim is to ensure our veterans' programs are working as intended. With input from veterans and educational institutions, these bills make needed corrections to existing programs.
On the House Floor:
Saying Yes to Energy
Our nation, especially in Ohio, is experiencing an energy revolution. Removing the federal government's inefficient barriers to our energy development means
more jobs
and increased
energy independence .
Recently, the House passed with bipartisan support :
LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act : Expedites the approval process of liquefied natural gas export permits.
(Passed January 28, 2015)
Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act :
M odernizes the review process for natural gas pipeline applications.
(Passed January 21, 2015)
This week, the House took action to fight back against human trafficking.
We passed a dozen bipartisan bills to stop these heinous crimes and protect survivors.
Our founders declared inherent and inalienable the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Human trafficking violates these rights.

my remarks
on Fighting Trafficking
I am leading the fight to ensure cleanup efforts at the Piketon site are fully funded.
This month, I led an Ohio delegation letter urging Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan
to fully fu nd
D&amp;D operations
at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon as they plan their Fiscal Year 2016 budget.
As a lifelong Ohioan, I understand the importance of cleaning up the Portsmouth Plant and will continue to urge the administration to keep the D&amp;D project funded and on schedule.
