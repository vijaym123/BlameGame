Photo of the Week:
During Thursday's
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Hearing on Ebola, I had the
opportunity to hear first hand from many representatives and health
agencies directly involved in combatting this disease. This hearing allowed
for me to express my concerns about the response and preparedness
efforts of health agencies both at home and abroad. I will continue to
make this a top priority of mine and ensure Americans are
safe.
Even though the beginning of this
week started in the district, including a trip to Dart Corporation in
Randleman and the "Life in Lee County" luncheon in Sanford, I've
maintained my focus on the Ebola outbreak. I returned to Washington to
participate in a
hearing Thursday in the Energy and Commerce Oversight and
Investigations Subcommittee, where we took time examining the U.S. Public
Health response to the Ebola crisis. The more I learn about our
government's response, the more concerned and the less confident I am in
many of those whose job it is to protect us from this
epidemic.

to view an excerpt in which I question
Dr. Tom Frieden, the
director of the CDC.

full hearing which the

Following the hearing I did several interviews on the unfolding Ebola
situation, speaking on Lou Dobbs Tonight, CNN Tonight, and The
Steve Malzberg Show on Newsmax.
For more information about my position and
the work I am doing on this issue, please
read my
op-ed in
U.S. News &amp; World Report .
Be sure to
let me know what you think about the U.S. response to the Ebola
outbreak by taking my survey at the end of this
newsletter.
In another op-ed this week , I spoke about the work that
Republicans are doing in the areas mattering most to women and their
families
the economy, education and jobs. As women are 52 percent of the
United States' voting electorate, I discussed ways the Republican
Party could better reach and engage women in the political system.
It is my honor
to represent the Second District and serve you in
Congress. Please let me know if there is
anything that I, or a member of my staff, can do for you. As always,
feel free to contact my office in Asheboro, Dunn, or Washington if we can
be of assistance.
Visiting Dart
Corporation:
It was a pleasure
visiting Dart Container Corporation in Randleman this week. Dart is known
for manufacturing a wide array of single-use products for the food
service industry, including foam cups and other items.
I was
honored to accept the National Association of Manufacturers' Award from
Mike Martinez, who is with Dart's corporate office in Atlanta. The
NAM Award was presented to me for my voting record supporting the
manufacturing
industry.
Discussing the Need for Travel Restrictions:
I did several interviews this week
regarding the Ebola outbreak and the hearing held by the Energy &amp;
Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. This photo was
snapped right before we aired live on Fox
News.
Radio Interview with WPTF in
Raleigh:
Last week, I was on the radio show "The Morning
Drive" with Doug Kellett. I spoke about my letter to the CDC requesting
the creation of new airport screening guidelines and the need for
establishing an emergency quarantine protocol for airports with connecting
flights from Africa into the United States.

interview.
