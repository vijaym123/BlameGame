Dear friend,
New Hampshire has a
strong tradition of military service and as the wife, daughter and
mother-in-law of veterans, I understand the sacrifice that comes with
service and our solemn duty to honor that sacrifice. Our veterans have
earned the right to know that when they come home, they will be taken
care of with timely and accessible health care. But the findings of
gross mismanagement at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities
across the country are unacceptable and hurting veterans in New
Hampshire.
This week we made significant progress in the Senate to
improve health care accessibility for veterans in New Hampshire and
address underlying problems at the VA. Senator Ayotte and I were able to
successfully include
language in a bipartisan
bill
that will help improve New Hampshire veterans access to care. This
is great news for many New Hampshire veterans who have had to put up
with long drives to VA facilities in Boston or White River
Junction.
We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the men and women
who have served to protect our freedoms and with this bill, along with
the establishment of the VAs
Keene Outreach
Clinic
and approval for VA clinics in
Berlin and
Colebrook , we are making good progress. Theres more to do and I will
continue to work across the aisle to make certain we deliver on the
promise weve made to our veterans.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
