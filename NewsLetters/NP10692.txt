Dear Friends,
Tomorrow, Tuesday, is the
deadline to file your Federal taxes. Each year millions of Americans
flee to accountants or software programs to file their yearly taxes.
For many, tax season may be a time of stress and confusion. After all,
we don't want to make mistakes that will have Uncle Sam knocking at our
doors. We can all agree that tax documents and regulations can be
confusing at best. Our current tax code is 70,000 pages long so its no
wonder why Americans spend over $160 billion a year to comply with our
tax laws.
Our nation's tax system is totally flawed and in
need of considerable reform. The last major reform of the tax code took
place over a quarter century ago in 1986 and, while far from perfect,
it helped reduce the harm inflicted on the economy in many
ways.
But today, businesses need a stable and uncomplicated tax
code to help them make decisions about hiring and expanding. We need to
simplify our tax code, remove loopholes, lower tax rates, improve
competitiveness for American job creators, and develop a fairer, flatter
tax system for all Americans. The current system leads to disputes with
the IRS that are hugely expensive for small businesses
the very
ones that have limited resources to either fight off frivolous IRS claims
or grow their business.
Unfortunately, filing taxes has
become so complex that it takes about 6 billion hours a year for Americans
to comply with the convoluted tax code. Not only do families bear the
cost of complying with this overcomplicated and burdensome tax code
but we also spend hours trying to make sure all of our records are in
compliance with IRS tax codes. It is totally unacceptable to require
already stressed families to give up their time and a portion of their
income to prop up an expanding federal bureaucracy while everyone else
is making significant sacrifices.
The chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee recently announced a plan that would help
alleviate the tax burden American families and businesses face, the Tax
Reform Act. This plan would help boost the economy and increase wages
for American workers.
The Tax Reform Act is not the first
time Congress attempted to work toward a reform. In 2001, my
colleagues and I also pushed for, and achieved, substantial tax relief for
working Americans. That tax relief included lower tax rates, an enhanced
child tax credit and relief from the marriage penalty, just to name a
few provisions.
Tax season reminds us all that the time to
reform our tax code is now. We must fix a system whose high tax rates
has harmed Americas competitiveness. I will continue to work in a
bipartisan manner to reach the goal of a simplified tax code that would
promote economic growth and create jobs.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
