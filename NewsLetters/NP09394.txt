Memorial Day is a time for every American to reflect on the past and renew our commitment to the future. Today, though
most importantly - we remember our Fallen Heroes.
Click on the picture for a short Memorial Day message.
On this Memorial Day, we resolve to honor the ultimate sacrifice made by many, to keep America free and strong. As you gather with friends and family today to enjoy a hotdog or hamburger, please remember that Memorial Day is about more than just a picnic, backyard barbecues, or a day off. Rather, its the time to reflect and commemorate our brave service men and women who paid the ultimate price so that we may remain free.
Have a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day. May God bless you, our Fallen, and this great United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
