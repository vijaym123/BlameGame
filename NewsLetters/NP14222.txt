Heller Announces Support for
Gillibrands Military Sexual Assault
Legislation
(Washington, D.C.)
Today,
U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) announced
support for Senator Kirsten
Gillibrands (D-NY) bipartisan
Military Justice
Improvement Act (S. 967) . Heller and
Gillibrand joined numerous Senators, as
well as victims of military sexual assault,
for a media event urging the Senate to pass
the legislation earlier today.
"After much deliberation, and after
extensive conversations with victims and
Senators from both sides of the issue, I
believe that the Military Justice
Improvement Act is the best path forward.
From Senator Rand Paul to Senator Barbara
Boxer, this legislation transcends party
lines. Ensuring victims are confident in
reporting crimes and protecting them from
retaliation must be a top priority,
said Senator
Dean Heller . Our
military is the greatest fighting force the
world has ever known. The Gillibrand
amendment makes it even better.
The Military Justice Improvement
Act:
Moves the decision whether to
prosecute any crime punishable by one
year or more in confinement to
independent, trained, professional
military prosecutors, with the exception
of crimes that are uniquely military in
nature, such as disobeying orders or
going Absent Without Leave.
Provides the offices of the military
chiefs of staff with the authority and
discretion to establish courts, empanel
juries, and choose judges to hear cases
(i.e. convening authority).
Does not amend Article 15. Commanding
officers will still be able to order
non-judicial punishment for lesser
offenses not directed to trial by the
prosecutors.
Allows professional military
prosecutors who are trained legal experts
to handle sexual assault cases.
Frees up commanders to focus on the
mission and preparedness of the unit,
rather than guiding a complex legal case
through the militarys justice
system.
Strikes the UCMJs Article 60
so that the convening authority may not
(a) set aside a guilty finding or (b)
change a finding of guilty to a lesser
included offense.
