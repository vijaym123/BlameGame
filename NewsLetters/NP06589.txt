Dear Neighbor,
This week the bipartisan
House Manufacturing Caucus
will convene to look for ways to help match up district manufacturers with local veterans looking for work. Manufacturing Caucus Co-Chair Tim Ryan (D-OH) and I will meet Wednesday with panelists including district manufacturer Nucor, the VFW and job training centers to talk about ways to place veterans in jobs.
Our goal is to better prepare veterans for the work environment and also see that the work environment is prepared for our veterans. We can all help to serve and care for veterans better by listening to these experts and pool resources to put our nation&rsquo;s heroes back to work.
PROTECTING OUR NATION'S WATERS FROM OVER REGULATION
Regulating our nation&rsquo;s waters must be done in an environmentally responsible way, while making sure there isn&rsquo;t unnecessary and costly expansion of the federal government. That&rsquo;s why we co-sponsored the bipartisan
Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act ,
which would uphold the federal-state partnership to regulate the nation&rsquo;s waters by preserving existing rights and responsibilities. We need to make sure local control is maintained by the people on the ground, who know best &ndash; not the bureaucrats in DC.
HONORING OUR HEROS
Presenting Henry and his wife Anna with a flown flag.
Last week we
presented
Bath resident, Henry Coil a flag flown over the Capitol on his 95th birthday, in recognition of his service to our country in World War II and Korea.
Presenting Mrs. Trentanelli with a flown flag in honor of her late husband.
It was an honor to
present
Mrs. Ann Trentanelli with a flag flown over the Capitol in honor of her late husband, John Trentanelli, who passed away recently at the age of 83. Mr. Trantanelli was a Korean War Veteran and a lifelong resident of Hornell.
NEVER FORGET
We&rsquo;d like to pause and take a moment, to recall the events of September 11 th .
To the all of the lives lost on September 11, we will never forget. To the emergency first responders, and those in uniform, who fell the day of those attacks, we will never forget.
We will never forget the bravery and selfless sacrifice on that day and in the days that immediately followed. And as we pause, we remind ourselves that America does not bend to those who rule by repression, violence and fear, and that will never change.
WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?
Today we'll be attending a Ways &amp; Means roundtable, meeting with companies and organizations from the district, and voting on
H.R. 5078 &ndash; Waters of the U.S. Regulatory Overreach Protection Act
and
H.Res. 644.
Tomorrow we'll be hosting Manufacturing Caucus panel &ldquo;Putting Our Veterans to Work in Manufacturing.&rdquo;
P.S. We&rsquo;ve got
office hours !
Best, Tom
