Recently, the House of Representatives considered The Jobs for America Act, which is a package of bills supporting job creation through streamlining regulations, encouraging the hiring of American veterans, and providing relief for small businesses from Obamacare.
Some of the bills included are The REINS Act, ( H.R. 367 ), which ensures that Congress votes on all new major regulations before they are enforced on citizens and businesses; The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, ( H.R. 3086 ), which protects internet access for all Americans and fosters growth in the digital economy; and the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act, ( H.R. 4457 ), which ensures small businesses have the certainty they need to grow their businesses and create jobs.
Government should be an enabler of economic growth, not a barrier.
Yours in service,
Randy
