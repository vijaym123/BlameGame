Dear David,
This week, I've been
working in Washington and in New Mexico...
Debt
Limit
This week, I voted against the proposal to extend the
debt ceiling.
Deficits in the level that were
experiencing threaten the stability of the dollar, curb the vitality of an
economy and depress job growth. Raising our debt ceiling without taking
steps to bring our budget under control is not the solution to our fiscal
problem. Our challenge is to redesign government so that it becomes
more effective while simultaneously becoming more
efficient.
In New Mexico
Later in the week, I enjoyed
spending time with New Mexicans, answering questions in meetings and
over the radio.
I will be spending more time around the state in
the week ahead, so call 855-4-PEARCE or watch my
facebook page
to find out when I'll be in your
area!
Staff Office Hours
Did you know that my staff
routinely holds
mobile office hours
around
southern New Mexico to answer your questions, hear your ideas, or help you
with federal agencies? This week, staff will be in Artesia on

And remember, we have full-time staffed offices in
Socorro, Roswell, and Las Cruces.
It was great
visiting with New Mexicans and taking callers' questions from around
the state on the radio this week
Have you heard "Congressional Review" this
week?
Every weekend, I'm on the radio across New Mexico discussing
important legislation, events in New Mexico, and my work in
Congress.
Be sure to tune in!
If you haven't heard the show, call
your local radio station to ask when Congressional Review is on the air
in your hometown! ?xml:namespace prefix = o

Remember, I always
look forward to hearing your thoughts on how to help job growth,
veterans, and other issues important to New Mexicans.

ideas, suggestions, or concerns, you can contact my office
