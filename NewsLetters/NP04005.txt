Dear Friend,
Each month, I record a video address
that recaps what we've been working on the
previous month. Video and text of
November's Monthly Video Address are
available below. You may view the video by

Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address. Today, I am at the Pittsylvania
County courthouse here in the Town of
Chatham -- my hometown. As a young boy
growing up in Chatham, I sold the
Star-Tribune newspaper here to courthouse
customers. After returning to Chatham after
law school, I practiced law in the
courtroom here, and this is where my family
and I live now. It is always nice to be
home with family and friends during this
season of Thanksgiving.
Likewise, it is an honor, once again to
be given the opportunity to serve the fine
people of Virginia's Fifth District for the
next two years. I thank you for the faith
you have placed in me, and I look forward
to continuing our fight for a brighter
future for our children and
grandchildren.
As we come to the close of November, I
also appreciate the opportunity to share
with you some of what we have been working
on during the past month.
As we returned to Washington after the
election, we in the House of
Representatives continued our efforts to
promote pro-growth legislation that will
lead to job creation for the people of
Virginia's Fifth District and across
America. The most important action we took
was to pass a bipartisan bill that would
authorize the construction and operation of
the Keystone Pipeline. For the past six
years, President Obama's administration has
used a variety of tactics to delay the
project's progress, despite numerous
reviews that have been completed to ensure
public safety and environmental protection.
The bill received strong, bipartisan
support for passage in the House; however,
I was disappointed that the bill failed by
one vote in the Senate. I will continue to
work with my colleagues to support the
Keystone Pipeline as an important step in
implementing a robust domestic energy
strategy that will lower energy prices,
create new American jobs, and reduce our
dependence on foreign oil -- indeed, a
strategy that takes a positive step toward
making it easier for our Main Street
businesses, our family farms, and all
working Americans to be successful.
In addition, this month, President Obama
addressed the nation and announced the
issuance of executive orders to effectively
grant legal status to nearly five million
illegal immigrants.
I
am very disappointed
by the
Presidents decision to defy the
Constitution and American law by issuing
these overreaching executive orders. I
believe that his action will only compound
serious immigration problems our nation
already faces by inviting more illegal
border crossings. Unfortunately, the
President has chosen political expediency
over working together with a newly-elected
House and Senate to fix our broken
immigration system. I will continue to work
with my colleagues in Congress to stop
this
affront to our Constitution , to
strengthen the security at our borders, and
to implement an immigration policy that is
rooted in the rule of law.
As we reflect this month on the
blessings of American freedom, it strikes
me as fitting that we remember our
veterans. On November 11, the nation came
together to observe Veterans Day and to
recognize those who have honorably served
our country. This year, I attended a
Veterans
Day ceremony at Hampden-Sydney College
and the
American
Legion Post 74s Veterans Day
ceremony
in Charlottesville. In
addition to being reminded of the
tremendous sacrifices that these brave men
and women have made in the cause of
liberty, I was also reminded, once again,
of our profound responsibility to ensure
that we take care of those who have taken
care of us.
Finally, this month, we gather as a
nation to celebrate Thanksgiving. It is an
opportunity for Americans to join together
to give thanks for the blessings of
American freedom and opportunity. I am
reminded that our important Thanksgiving
tradition originated here in Virginia at
Berkeley Plantation in 1619 -- after a
group of English settlers issued a charter
giving thanks to the Almighty for
delivering them safely to Virginia and
stating that such a gathering should be
observed annually as a day of
thanksgiving. It is my I hope that
you and your family enjoyed a Happy
Thanksgiving.
In closing, I thank you again for the
opportunity to represent you in the House
of Representatives, and I look forward to
continuing our work to promote a brighter
future for our children and our
grandchildren. If you would like to learn

monthly video address.
