Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.
It is an honor to represent
Virginias Fifth District, and I
appreciate the opportunity to share with
you some of what we have been working on
during the month of August. Today,
were at Hart Hudsons
beautiful farm just outside of South Hill
in Brunswick County, where he grows
tobacco, corn, soybeans, barley, oats,
cotton, and wheat. The Hudson family has
been involved in the tobacco farming for
over 6 generations, and Hart has worked on
the farm his father started for nearly his
whole life. Today, he owns the farm with
his wife of 60 years, Catherine. Their two
sons, daughter, and son-in-law work
directly on the farm and on the business
side, continuing to make this a true family
farm.
Hearing the concerns of those living and
working in Virginias Fifth District
continues to be my greatest resource as I
serve you. The legislation I have
introduced throughout my time in Congress
has come straight from the concerns
discussed during my travels throughout the
Fifth District with the people whom I
represent.
Agriculture is the backbone of our rural
economy in the Fifth District and
represents the largest sector of
Virginias economy, with the annual
economic impact of 52 billion dollars.
Preserving and fostering our great legacy
of family farming is vital to our economy
and remains one of my top priorities. In
speaking with these members of the ag
community, it remains as clear as ever that
the federal government is out of touch with
the needs of our family farmers.
During this past month, we took a Fifth
District Farm Tour which carried us from
the top of the our district in Fauquier
County to the southern border of Virginia
-- winding up here in Brunswick County. It
was an opportunity for me to see what the
producers are doing and exactly what
challenges they face. As I spoke with
constituents throughout the district this
month, the common theme, as I have heard so
many times before, is the need for Congress
to pass jobs bills to promote economic
growth in our communities. I couldnt
agree more and that is why the House has
been laser-focused during this Congress to
enact pro-growth policies that will spur
job creation and provide more opportunities
for hardworking families. The House has
passed dozens of jobs bills that would
increase our energy independence, cut
unnecessary red tape, improve educational
opportunities, and reduce federal
spending.
Unfortunately, the Senate continues to
block over 40 of these jobs bills that
would provide common sense solutions. I
introduced one such bill, the Small
Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act, that passed the House
with bipartisan support to rein in red tape
that hurts small business investment in our
communities. When Congress returns in
September, I hope that our colleagues in
the Senate will take up these jobs bills to
advance pro-growth solutions to provide a
stronger economic recovery and create jobs
for hardworking Americans.
Once again, I thank you for the
opportunity to represent you in Congress,
and I look forward to continuing our work
to promote a brighter future for our
children and grandchildren. As we close, I
encourage you to sign up for updates at our
website at

social
media pages . Thank you for tuning in to
our monthly video address.
Sincerely,
