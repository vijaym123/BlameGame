Dear Friend:
Over 4,000 American heroes paid the ultimate sacrifice during Operation
Iraqi Freedom. Despite the hard-fought victories gained by our brave
service members, Iraq is spiraling into chaos as violent extremists
continue their march toward Baghdad.
With the President considering a potential military response to the
deteriorating situation in Iraq, please take a brief moment to answer
the following question so I can hear from you on this critical national
security issue and share with you my opinion in our next newsletter.
How do you think the President should respond to the current crisis in
Iraq?
Send a large ground contingent of American troops back into Iraq
Send smaller special forces units to Iraq to secure the American
embassy
Authorize targeted air strikes
Provide non-military aid to the Iraqi government
Explore diplomatic avenues with foreign allies
Do not get involved in anyway
