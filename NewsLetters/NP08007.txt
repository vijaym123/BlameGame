Celebrating America's Independence
Dear Friends,
Happy Independence Day!
Today, we celebrate the birth of our nation and the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We also call to mind the generations of brave Americans who have served and sacrificed to secure our freedom. It's because of them that America remains a shining beacon of freedom in the world.
I look forward to participating in Independence Day celebrations today in Amherst and Merrimack. And I know that all across New Hampshire, residents and visitors alike will enjoy our state's many natural treasures.
Whether you're celebrating at a parade, with a backyard BBQ, or going out to see the fireworks, I hope you'll find time to celebrate America's independence - and our cherished freedoms - with friends and family.
Stay safe this holiday weekend.
And may God bless America!
Warm Regards,
Kelly Ayotte
United States Senator
