Just wanted to send you a quick reminder
about the
Montgomery County Townhall
I'm having on
Thursday
evening. Here are the
details:
Date:
Thursday, August 28
Time:
6:30 - 8:00 pm
Location:
Lone Star College Montgomery Campus, 3200 College Park Drive, The
Woodlands
So far this August,
I've met with folks in towns like
Bedias, Madisonville,
Plantersville, Navasota, Huntsville, and Tomball , listening to
your many concerns about this country and our communities.
If I haven't had the chance to hear
from you yet, I hope you'll come to the
Montgomery County Townhall .
We're also having additional Townhalls on Tuesday, September 2. The
first is in
Lovelady
at 12:00 pm
at the Lovelady Old Gym. The second is in
Centerville
at Woody's Smokehouse Northbound location,
starting at 3:30 pm.
You
can find a
list of all of this month's
townhalls on my website as well ,
and if you have any questions, please give my Conroe
office a call at 936-441-5700.
See you tomorrow evening!
P.S.
If you missed the great conversation I had with
Sam Malone on AM1070 The Answer
about this
month's Townhalls and the border crisis and what the U.S. House is doing to
help Texas secure the border, you can listen by clicking
