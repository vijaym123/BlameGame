Miller Veterans Day Message
November 11, 2014
Theres a very simple reason why Americans pause each November to honor the service and sacrifice of those who have worn our Nations uniform: our veterans have earned it. If it wasnt for these heroes, who have fought the forces of tyranny in every corner of world and continue to do so to this day, our Nation would be a very different, unrecognizable place. The brave men and women who have stepped forth to serve America have left an indelible mark on history, securing our Nations independence, protecting millions around the globe from the forces of tyranny and defeating our enemies wherever they may lurk. The courage, heroism and ingenuity of our veterans provide more than just strength for our military, they provide strength and motivation for our entire country. Thats why veterans deserve our utmost gratitude and support today and every day of the year.
