CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER ON FOX NEWS:
WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA END
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AT UNITED
NATIONS?
Were you watching Fox News on Thursday evening?
Shortly after 7
p.m., I joined Greta Van Susteren to discuss
reports the Obama
Administration might end long-standing American support for Israel at
the United Nations .
Israel is America's
strongest ally and the only stable democracy in the Middle
East.
In contrast, the Palestinians recently dedicated a monument
in honor of a terrorist who murdered more than 30 Israelis in the
1970s.
We need a resolution at the UN
compelling the Palestinians to denounce Hamas.
That's the real
concern America should be addressing at the United Nations, not
seeking to put Israel in a position where it can't defend its own
country.

full interview with Fox News Channel's Greta Van
Susteren.
Greta also asked me about
President Obama's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, which has been strained by Prime Minister Netanyahu's strong
conviction about the threat of Iran and President Obama's lack of
understanding about that threat.
As part of my
Congressional visit to Israel in February, I examined one of the thousands of
terrorist rockets fired into Israel.

Having
just visited Israel myself , I suggest President Obama go
visit the Golan Heights, and the Gaza border, and meet with the young
officers who manage the Iron Dome missile defense system.
They see the thousands of Hamas terror rockets, funded by Iran, which
are fired into Israel, and they have a first-hand understanding of the
threat.
If you don't live with that reality on a daily
basis, it's easy to be distant and dismissive , not fully
appreciating the threat Israel lives under.
The same
terrorists who seek to destroy Israel also despise America and our
way of life.
As Chairman of the Congressional Task Force
on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I'm actively working to
strengthen relationships with important allies in the fight against radical
Islamist terrorism, leading efforts to target the operational funding
for terrorist organizations, and providing resources so ordinary
Americans can take prudent steps to prepare their home, family, and
business for potential terrorist attacks.

CIA DIRECTOR WOOLSEY AND HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY CHERTOFF REACT
TO LAUNCH OF PrepareNow.com: Thoughtful and Prudent Preparation is the
Key
Earlier this week, former CIA
Director James Woolsey and former Homeland Security Secretary Michael
Chertoff shared their thoughts on the launch of
PrepareNow.com , my terrorism preparedness manual
for families and small businesses, and the need for Americans to
take common sense steps to prepare for a potential terrorist
attack.
Click
here to download
the Terrorism Preparedness
Manual.
ISIS, Iran, al Qaeda, and other
terrorist organizations are focused on destroying our way of
life , said former Director of the CIA James Woolsey. We should all
recognize their unrelenting focus and determined intent to attack
America.
Making common sense preparations for a possible attack
on our Homeland should be a consideration for all
Americans .
America faces serious and multiplying challenges from our
adversaries, including Islamist extremists and terrorist sponsoring nations,
said former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. Our
nation must also contend with natural disasters and the globalized threat
of pandemic disease.
As we face these threats to our security
and safety, thoughtful and prudent preparation is the key to
protecting our families and
communities .
Director Woolsey and Secretary Chertoff serve as references
for
PrepareNow.com
and
the
Preparing Your Home, Family,
and Business for Terrorist Attacks
preparedness manual, which I
developed as Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism
and Unconventional Warfare. The goal with this manual was to provide a
resource for ordinary Americans seeking common sense suggestions on
mitigating the impact of potential terrorist
attacks.

Terrorist Attacks preparedness manual is available for free download
