David -- Last night, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling won his GOP primary. Now, we&rsquo;ll face off in the November general election.
We&rsquo;ve got a big, expensive battle ahead of us -- last time our race collectively cost over $14 million! But I can&rsquo;t wait to hit the campaign trail and tell voters about the stark differences between us.
When Mr. Schilling was in office, he walked out on Illinois workers, voted for Paul Ryan&rsquo;s radical budget (twice!), and signed his name next to Todd Akin on a radical bill to redefine rape.
I&rsquo;m fighting everyday to represent Illinois families to the best of my ability. If Bobby Schilling gets back in office, he could derail all of our progress. To get ahead, it&rsquo;s absolutely critical that we hit our March fundraising goal.
March 31st marks our first Federal Election Commission deadline since Mr. Schilling officially became our opponent, and we can&rsquo;t come up short. Will you step up? David -- will you donate $8 or whatever you can to help us fight back against Bobby Schilling and his radical agenda?

Ex-Congressman Schilling never represented the values of the 17th district. Let&rsquo;s make sure we&rsquo;re able to fight back when he hits the airwaves with deceitful ads. Stand with me and help stop Bobby Schilling before his campaign gets off the ground. Chip in right now:
