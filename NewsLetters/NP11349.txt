The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Tuesday, I spoke at the International Bridge, Tunnel, and Turnpike Association (IBTTA) Summit on Legislation, Policy and Infrastructure Finance in Washington. Infrastructure is a critical economic pillar that provides the foundation for growth, development, and job creation. As a member of the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee, I provided an update on the work we are doing in Congress to strengthen our economy and create jobs by providing a solid infrastructure system.

As spring break approaches, many individuals, families, and groups travel up to Washington to visit our Nations Capital. Last week, Mariah Szpunar, a constituent from Orlando, stopped by my office to say hello after we provided her with tour of the Capitol Building earlier in the week. If you are ever interested in visiting Washington, my staff would be happy to provide assistance in facilitating tour requests for many of the popular and historic sites. For more information, you can
visit my website
or contact my tour coordinator at
Scott.Johnson@mail.house.gov
or 202.225.2176.

During a meeting with a group of young people from the Florida Gubernatorial Fellows Roundtable Delegation last week, I discussed principles of leadership that are central to both personal and professional success. America is the land of opportunity, where we are free to think big thoughts and aspire to great accomplishments both personally and professionally. I encouraged the fellows to achieve great success as they pursue their dreams and remain committed to enhancing the lives of those around them.

It was a pleasure to meet with local leaders representing Central Florida's interests with the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) and the Association of American Railroads. Representatives from the Florida Municipal Power Agency also came to my office last week to discuss utility issues that impact Central Florida's access to affordable and reliable power.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
After filing a claim for veteran widows benefits with the Pension Management Center (PMC), a constituent from Eustis became concerned with what she felt was a delay in receiving an answer. The constituent contacted my office and we submitted a Congressional inquiry on her behalf. PMC responded to her shortly thereafter to let the widow know that her claim for benefits had been granted, and that a retroactive check for the intervening time was on its way.
Constituent Services is a critical element to the work that my office provides on a local level. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need help navigating its bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Last week marked 2,000 days since the Keystone XL Pipeline application was submitted to the State Department for approval and that the Obama Administration has delayed thousands of sorely needed jobs and increased energy independence from abroad.
Do you believe the President should allow this project to move forward without any further delay?
Yes
No
I don't know

Response from the
previous survey question : "Do you think the White House should be required to at least notify Congress of its intention to stop enforcing existing law and explain why?" Yes - 88%
No - 11%
I don't know - 1%
Legislative Update:
Be it immigration law, Obamacare or enforcing work requirements for welfare recipients, the Obama Administration has routinely and unilaterally decided to delay, ignore, or disregard current law.
In an effort to rein in this unconstitutional overreach, I supported two bills that the House of Representatives passed last week with bipartisan support to restrain the Presidents autonomous executive decisions. H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014, requires that every federal officer who decides not enforce a law notify Congress of their intention and reasoning for not doing so. The second bill, H.R. 4138, the Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act of 2014, grants Congress additional power to require the President to enforce laws and adhere to the Oath of Office to uphold the Constitution and dutifully enforce the laws of the land.
Our country was founded on the rule of law, and it is unconstitutional for the Executive Branch to not faithfully execute duly passed laws. The Constitution is clear: the President must enforce duly passed laws - whether he likes them or not and regardless of political convenience.
