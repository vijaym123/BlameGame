Dear Friend,
The final Senate race of 2014 will be decided this Saturday in Louisiana. Senator Mary Landrieu&rsquo;s reelection campaign is going to a runoff on December 6th, and I&rsquo;m joining with some of my Democratic colleagues to help her get out the vote. Please, if you can, give $5 or more to help Mary&rsquo;s team win on December 6th.
No one expects Mary&rsquo;s race to be easy. What you can expect is that Mary is fighting hard every day to keep her seat blue. Republicans are putting all their resources behind their single remaining candidate. They are flooding the airwaves with third party advertisements in an effort to move this seat into the Republican column. Mary&rsquo;s best hope is a strong GOTV effort, and that requires our help.
Special interests dumped $13.3 million on Mary&rsquo;s race before November 4th, and they smell blood now. They&rsquo;re pressing the attack, and Mary needs our help to fight back. There are only 3 days left to make a difference in this year&rsquo;s elections. Pitch in $5, $10, or more, and help Mary Landrieu stave off the special interests that want to buy Louisiana&rsquo;s Senate seat.
Thanks for helping my friend Mary.
