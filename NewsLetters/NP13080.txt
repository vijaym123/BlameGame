Dear Neighbor,
Below is a brief update:
Telephone Town Hall Meetings
This past week,
I hosted the first telephone town hall meeting of 2014 . Im thankful for the opportunity to host these telephone town hall meetings when Im in Washington, D.C. voting so that I can hear from central Floridians on important issues of the day.
If you'd like to participate in a future one, please contact my office
(863-644-8215 or 813-752-4790).
Met with students from Hillsborough Community College Student Government
Bipartisan Agreement
to Fund Federal Government
While this bipartisan agreement is not perfect, it takes a step toward fiscal responsibility and returns us to regular order.
For the fourth year in a row, we are cutting discretionary spending which hasn't happened since the Korean War.
This bill provides
funding to reduce the processing backlog for Veterans Disability Claims
and provides $20 million in
funding to protect our groves from the deadly disease of citrus greening , which is threatening to destroy the entire citrus industry and its impact on our local economy.
While we are still working hard to ensure that all members of the military receive the Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) that they are due, this bill takes a step toward that goal and ensures that 63,000
medically retired members of the military and their survivors receive a full COLA . Since amendments were restricted, my
colleagues and I have already joined together to introduce legislation to prevent any reductions to the COLA attached to all military retirees . We are urging our colleagues to take up this important legislation immediately.
I voted for this agreement because it is our last chance to prevent the full impact of the national security-threatening sequester cuts that would harm our safety and the well-being of our men and women serving in areas of conflict across the globe. It would also reduce the deficit by more than $20 billion and will help prevent a government shutdown in the future.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
