Dear David,
The current federal minimum
wage is $7.25 per hour. President Obama recently signed an Executive
Order raising the federal minimum wage for federal contract employees
to $10.10 per hour. He has also asked Congress to pass legislation
raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 for all other covered
employees.
Although there are some exceptions, almost all employees
in California must be paid the minimum wage as required by state law.
Effective July 1, 2014, the minimum wage in California will be $9.00
per hour. Effective January 1, 2016, the minimum wage in California
will be $10.00 per hour.
Do
You Support Raising the Federal Minimum Wage? Yes, Congress should pass legislation raising
it to $10.10 per hour. Yes, it should be raised, but not as high as proposed by the
President. No, it should not be
raised. The federal minimum should be kept at the current $7.25 per
hour. No, the federal
minimum wage should be eliminated. Other *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my
