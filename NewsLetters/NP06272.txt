Dear Friend,
Earlier this spring, I wrote
to you about the tours that my office can help organize for Utahns
who are planning a visit to Washington, D.C. With fall holidays and
school breaks approaching, I wanted to remind you of these
opportunities.
My staff can help arrange visits to some of the most
popular federal attractions in our nations capitalwhether you're coming on
a short business trip or an extended family vacation. They can help
you book tours of the White House, U.S. Capitol, Pentagon, State
Department, Supreme Court, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the Library
of Congress.
If you are planning a visit to Washington,
D.C., start by
filling out this form . After
sending your tour request, you can expect to hear from my staff within a
couple of days and they will work with you to reserve the tours you
selected.
These tours are an excellent way to see all that the
nation's capital has to offer and are of no charge to you. All tickets
are provided to my constituents on a first-come, first-served basis.
Tours fill quickly, so please request them as early as possible in
order to maximize your chances.
Of course, there are many other
places in Washington, D.C. that you and your family may be interested
in visiting. The links below have information on some of the other
popular sites located throughout the capital.
