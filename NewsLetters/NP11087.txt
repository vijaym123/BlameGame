Rep. Miller Visits Head Start Students at New Haven Elementary School
Harrison Township, MI &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after visiting New Haven Elementary School to meet with the students enrolled in the Macomb County Head Start Program:
&#8220;It was such a pleasure to spend time with the bright students at New Haven Elementary today.
As a mother and a grandmother, I know how important early childhood education is to a child&#8217;s development and ability to succeed.
Today&#8217;s
visit serves as further testament to how valuable programs like Head Start are to children and their community.&#8221;
An advocate for early childhood education, Miller recently cosponsored legislation, the
Strong Start for America&#8217;s Children Act (H.R. 3461), that would help expand access to the current preschool Head Start program for low income families and advance Early Head Start and child care programs for infants and toddlers through federal and state
partnerships.
About Head Start:
The Head Start Program is a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The program's
services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children's physical and emotional well-being, and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. Head Start programs in Michigan also receive support in the form
of training and advocacy from the Michigan Head Start Association. For more information about Michigan programs, please visit the Michigan Head Start Association online:
