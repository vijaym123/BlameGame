NOT A SUBSCRIBER?
Dear Constituents,
For as long as the
Internet has existed, it has thrived as a free and open platform of
information, some leveraged for business, some for entertainment, and some for
social change. Recently, new traffic rules for the Internet were
proposed that threaten the way we access and use
information.
The proposed rules, as described by the Chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), could leave the door open for Internet
service providers to carve up the Internet into fast and slow lanes by
permitting commercially reasonable agreements with online content
companies like Netflix and Hulu. For companies that can afford it, their
customers would have Internet fast lanes; for those that cant afford to
pay, such as start-ups, theyd be relegated to slow lanes.
Ultimately, consumers would foot the bill and face a degraded Internet
experience.
Like many Internet users, these proposed rules concern
me deeply. As a net neutrality advocate and as Ranking Member of the
Communications and Technology Subcommittee which oversees Internet
policy, Im hosting a Google Hangout to discuss and weigh the proposed
rules before the full FCC votes to approve them on May
15th.
On Wednesday, May 7th at 6:30 p.m. EST/3:30 p.m. PST, I
invite you to tune in to a Google Hangout that Ill be hosting on my
website .
Ill be joined by a panel of
Internet users, activists and legal experts to discuss what these proposed
rules mean for the Internet and the importance of effective and
enforceable net neutrality rules to the future of the
Internet.
In advance of the Hangout, the public is invited to pose questions to
the panel via Twitter to
@RepAnnaEshoo
using
#netneutrality or using the Google+ Q&amp;A app on the
event page .
Fundamentally, consumers and businesses must
be protected from actions by online gatekeepers that threaten free
speech, harm competition or diminish the continued openness of the
Internet.
Whether you share my view or not, I encourage you to
pose questions and tune in to this public discussion.
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
