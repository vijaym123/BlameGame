David --
The Republicans have gone too far.
Right now, they&rsquo;re airing TV attacks exploiting fears about terrorism to win this election. It&rsquo;s fear mongering at its very worst.
We&rsquo;re calling on John Boehner to denounce Republican candidates who use deceptive scare tactics.
1OO,OOO Signatures Needed Add Your Name &gt;&gt;
One GOP candidate even tried to tie his Democratic opponent to terrorist beheadings. That&rsquo;s going too far.
The Republican Party has decided to be the Party of Fear -- but that doesn't mean we have to accept their reprehensible tactics. We need 1OO,OOO people to take a stand now.
