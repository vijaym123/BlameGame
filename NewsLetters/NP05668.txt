I wanted to share
this article
with you. The Associated Press is reporting that the Homeland Security Department privately acknowledged
roughly 70% of immigrant families
who are caught illegally crossing the Mexican border and released into the United States with instructions to report back to immigration authorities
have failed to report back to federal immigration agents .
This shouldnt come as a surprise. It is a direct consequence of the Administrations failure to enforce our current immigration laws, and of prioritizing talks of amnesty over border security. My position remains clear: No amnesty. Period. You can learn more about my work opposing amnesty of any form,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Recently, the Department of Defense
announced
that illegal immigrants who have been granted deferral from deportation and also possess certain skills (like language expertise) will now be eligible to join the military. Do you support allowing select illegal immigrants to enlist in the military? Weigh in on our weekly poll,
here .
