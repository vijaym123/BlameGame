The 6th District
No Bailouts for the Insurance
Industry
Dear
Friends:
This week, I introduced H.R. 3812, the
No Bailouts for Insurance
Industry Act of 2014 , that will amend the Affordable Care
Act, better known as Obamacare, to prohibit a potential bailout for the
insurance industry that is currently authorized under Section 1341 and
Section 1342 of the Affordable Care
Act.
The American people have had enough of
big bailouts for big business and its time for this culture of
corporate cronyism, that has become a dominant part of Washington, DC, to
stop.
My
legislation would amend the Affordable Care Act to repeal Section 1341, the
reinsurance fund, and Section 1342, the risk corridor
provision.
Together, both could provide for a massive taxpayer bailout to
cover the losses of a large insurance
company.
Im concerned that Obamacare is
based on signing up a sufficient number of younger, healthier people for
insurance through the exchanges - at a much higher premium cost - in
order to shift the cost away from an older population that is expected
to sign up for health insurance through the exchanges.
If the
young dont sign up in sufficient numbers, and I dont think they will,
then the cost of Obamacare will spiral out of control and the
insurance industry will suffer significant
losses.
The taxpayers should not be on the hook
for the failures of Obamacare.
Any reasonable person can see
that this scheme isnt going to work and taxpayers should not be forced
to bail it out once it fails.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S.
Representative

Coffman helps veterans in
Paralympics
Highlands Ranch Herald

Published January 8,
2014
The U.S. House of
Representatives recently passed Rep. Mike Coffmans Veterans Paralympics Act,
authorizing the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to operate its
adaptive sports program through 2015.
This is about more than simply giving
veterans a chance to play sports, said Coffman, R-Aurora. Its about
giving them the chance to regain a small part of what they sacrificed on
the battlefield.
Currently, the VA operates this program in a partnership with the U.S.
Olympic Committee that funds grants to a host of adaptive sports
programs for disabled veterans across the
country.
Evan Stratton, who went to Littleton and
Heritage high schools, is one of those veterans. In July 2009,
Stratton was deployed in Iraq when enemy forces using grenades ambushed him
and his team. Stratton was struck by shrapnel, suffered a traumatic
brain injury and had his spinal accessory nerve severed, leaving his
upper left arm and shoulder paralyzed.
He participated in the Warrior Games in May at the
U.S. Olympic Training Center and the Air Force Academy in Colorado
Springs. Competing in both swimming and track, Stratton came home with six
medals and world records in three swimming events. He said the
Paralympics gave him a chance to experience the brotherhood and camaraderie
so key to a soldiers existence.
Being a veteran and not really having those
connections, that day-in and day-out contact, its really fun to be around
Marines, he said. You meet some really amazing
people.
In addition to rediscovering
camaraderie, participation in sports can help speed the rehabilitation
process for disabled veterans. Coffman says his bill helps increase access
at the community level, providing a path for athletes like Stratton to
progress to elite levels of competition such as the
Paralympics.
Currently, there are
dozens of partnership organizations in Colorado and over 300 nationwide
that are helping our veterans with their rehabilitation through
adaptive sports. The U.S. Olympic Committees Paralympics Chief Charlie
Huebner said hes seen the results of the program firsthand and is proud
to support its reauthorization.
The USOC, and more importantly the hundreds of adaptive
sport organizations that are delivering the grassroots programs, are
proud to stand with Congressmen Coffman in support of a bill that
allows for experienced adaptive sport entities to partner with the VA,
Huebner said.

U.S. Rep.
Mike Coffman , R-Aurora, used a pre-session legislators
breakfast at the Community College of Aurora to talk about how the city could
be affected by upcoming military base
closures.
This district is inevitably going to have a
Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC), he said. We know
the last time we went through that process, we lost two military bases
here in Aurora. Lowry and Fitzsimons.
Coffman said he is
working on a law that would
change the BRAC process. He said right now it only considers bases
inside the U.S. and not international closures.
I think we have bases outside of the
continental United States that should be a part of that process, he said,
pointing to military bases in Europe and South Korea as
examples.
Coffman also urged Aurora
legislators to fund a study that would quantify the economic impact of
Colorados military.
There is no such study that exists today. It is very important that we
have one, he said.
