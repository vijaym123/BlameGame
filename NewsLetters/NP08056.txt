David --
The Supreme Court severely rolled back women&rsquo;s healthcare rights last Monday -- giving their bosses authority to reject contraceptive coverage.
Brad&rsquo;s firmly pro-choice. He opposes this latest attack on women&rsquo;s rights, and he&rsquo;ll fight day and night to protect their rights.
That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s joining his colleagues to denounce the Supreme Court's latest decision. Will you join him? Just click here to automatically add your name to our petition and denounce the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
