Friend,
I hope you are well and had a safe and joyous holiday season.
Two years ago I was sworn into the 113th Congress and it was one of the most memorable days of my life. As I stood on the House floor, I looked up in the seats and saw my father, a first generation immigrant, watching his son join the 113th Congress and I was reminded that anything is possible.
Yesterday as I was sworn into the 114th Congress, I relived that moment.
I know that I did not get here by myself and I am committed to ensuring everyone is afforded the opportunity to succeed- that is the American dream and it is worth fighting for.
Thank you again for the faith you have placed in me. It has been an honor serving you and I&#39;m looking forward to representing you for another two years.
Be well,
