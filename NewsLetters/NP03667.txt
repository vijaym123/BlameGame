DAVID
Every year, we take the time to thank our familes and friends
for all of the love and support they've shown us over the
year.
I suggest we do the same of our first responders throughout the
district.
Men and women in uniform work around the clock to ensure
our safety here in #AZ06!
Forward
this email if you support our heroes in uniform, protecting us
throughout the holidays.
