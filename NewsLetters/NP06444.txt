Dear Friend,
Thirteen years ago today, 19 men boarded commercial airplanes with box cutters, and nearly 3,000 innocent Americans lost their lives.
It was a day that altered the course of our history and shaped the American conscience forever.
With the recent state of events in Iraq and Syria, we are reminded yet again that the threat of terrorism is real and spreading.
In fact, our country faces a greater number and a wider array of threats to our security today than ever before.
The news headlines of today, not to mention our history books, also remind us that we can never afford to pretend that conflicts overseas do not affect us here at home.
Last night the President spoke of his plan to deal with the terrorist group, ISIL.
While the President sounded more resolute than in the past, we cannot defeat ISIL and other terrorists with a speech.
It takes action, and it takes perseverance.
With the large number and diversity of threats, it is now more critical than ever that we maintain the strongest, best-equipped, and best-trained military in the world.
In many ways we are far better prepared than we were pre-9/11.
But in my opinion, after the defense cuts and intelligence disclosures of the last few years, we are not as well positioned to prevent terrorist attacks as we were three to four years ago.
To keep Americans safe and maintain global leadership, Congress and President Obama must work together to develop a long-term national security strategy and then stick with it.
Now is the time to allow the lessons of the past to shape our present and future.
9/11 is, and ought to be, a day of remembrance for the victims, of honor for those who have fought the terrorists over the last 13 years, and also a day that reminds us of how important it is that we commit to defeating terrorism together.
May God bless you and may He continue to bless America.
Sincerely,
