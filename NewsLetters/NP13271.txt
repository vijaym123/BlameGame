News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
For those of you who saw this newsletter before the holiday, this first
little part if this week's report will be a bit of a repeat.
But for
those who didn't see it, I wanted to explain the budget deal that
passed, why I opposed it, and what's happening now to undo part of it.
In short, one of the central cost-saving components of the budget deal
was a proposal to cut the annual cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) for
military retirees under age 62.
The new plan would call for a revised
COLA formula of inflation minus one percent.
The whole point of a cost
of living adjustment is to keep up with inflation.
The budget says
that military families will never again have their retirement benefits
keep up with that inflation.
Each year, they will lose more and more
and more.
The plan is made all the more insidious, in my opinion, because it also
goes after military personnel who were forced to retire due to a
service-connected medical problem.
This is not the way that we thank
those who have volunteered to serve this country - who have spent vast
amounts of time away from their families and who have risked life and
limb so that the rest of us could enjoy our many freedoms at home and
in safety.
I voted against the budget deal - despite its bipartisan nature,
despite its fixing the military sequestration cuts that are crippling
our readiness, and despite the recognition that our federal government
desperately needs a mutually agreed upon budget document.
I voted
against it because in my opinion, the absolute last things you cut are
those that would affect our troops' safety, their readiness, and their
families back home.
We don't start paying down our debt by taking
money out of the pockets of those who have given everything for this
country.
That's just my belief.
It turns out that a lot of my colleagues who overwhelming passed the
budget deal are now having the same reservation - albeit a bit late.
I
frankly don't understand why the provision was in the budget in the
first place.
I don't understand why Congress - both parties in both
the House and the Senate - would sign on so overwhelming to a proposal
and then turn right around the next week and try to repeal a
fundamental part of it.
I suppose that given the alternative of
allowing the new system to be enacted, quickly passing a bill to remedy
the situation is the best thing.
But I am reminded yet again of the
perils of leaving legislation until the last possible second, rushing
it through, and then waking up the next day realizing you've passed
something you wish you hadn't.
I don't understand a lot of things
about Washington.
This is definitely one of them.
In any case, there are now a number of pieces of legislation being
floated to undo the military retiree cuts.
When Congress adjourned
before Christmas, many of them were still being pulled and rewritten
because, again, in a rush, the drafters realized that they had left
things out - like surviving spouses, for instance.
When the bills are
completed, I will certainly be cosponsoring one of them.
I believe
this was a serious mistake that Congress made and I am going to try to
do everything possible to help see it fixed.
That's all I have for now.
Congress will return to Washington again on
Tuesday.
For now, I hope you all had a very Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year and I will be in touch with an update again next week.
And as always, if anything comes up in the meantime, just let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
For
those
of
you
who
saw
this
newsletter
before
the
holiday,
this
first
little
part
if
this
week&#8217;s
report
will
be
a
bit
of
a
repeat.
But
for
those
who
didn&#8217;t
see
it,
I
wanted
to
explain
the
budget
deal
that
passed,
why
I
opposed
it,
and
what&#8217;s
happening
now
to
undo
part
of
it.
In
short,
one
of
the
central
cost-saving
components
of
the
budget
deal
was
a
proposal
to
cut
the
annual
cost-of-living-adjustment
(COLA)
for
military
retirees
under
age
62.
The
new
plan
would
call
for
a
revised
COLA
formula
of
inflation
minus
one
percent.
The
whole
point
of
a
cost
of
living
adjustment
is
to
keep
up
with
inflation.
The
budget
says
that
military
families
will
never
again
have
their
retirement
benefits
keep
up
with
that
inflation.
Each
year,
they
will
lose
more
and
more
and
more.
The
plan
is
made
all
the
more
insidious,
in
my
opinion,
because
it
also
goes
after
military
personnel
who
were
forced
to
retire
due
to
a
service-connected
medical
problem.
This
is
not
the
way
that
we
thank
those
who
have
volunteered
to
serve
this
country
&#8211;
who
have
spent
vast
amounts
of
time
away
from
their
families
and
who
have
risked
life
and
limb
so
that
the
rest
of
us
could
enjoy
our
many
freedoms
at
home
and
in
safety.
I
voted
against
the
budget
deal
-
despite
its
bipartisan
nature,
despite
its
fixing
the
military
sequestration
cuts
that
are
crippling
our
readiness,
and
despite
the
recognition
that
our
federal
government
desperately
needs
a
mutually
agreed
upon
budget
document.
I
voted
against
it
because
in
my
opinion,
the
absolute
last
things
you
cut
are
those
that
would
affect
our
troops&#8217;
safety,
their
readiness,
and
their
families
back
home.
We
don&#8217;t
start
paying
down
our
debt
by
taking
money
out
of
the
pockets
of
those
who
have
given
everything
for
this
country.
That&#8217;s
just
my
belief.
It
turns
out
that
a
lot
of
my
colleagues
who
overwhelming
passed
the
budget
deal
are
now
having
the
same
reservation
&#8211;
albeit
a
bit
late.
I
frankly
don&#8217;t
understand
why
the
provision
was
in
the
budget
in
the
first
place.
I
don&#8217;t
understand
why
Congress
&#8211;
both
parties
in
both
the
House
and
the
Senate
&#8211;
would
sign
on
so
overwhelming
to
a
proposal
and
then
turn
right
around
the
next
week
and
try
to
repeal
a
fundamental
part
of
it.
I
suppose
that
given
the
alternative
of
allowing
the
new
system
to
be
enacted,
quickly
passing
a
bill
to
remedy
the
situation
is
the
best
thing.
But
I
am
reminded
yet
again
of
the
perils
of
leaving
legislation
until
the
last
possible
second,
rushing
it
through,
and
then
waking
up
the
next
day
realizing
you&#8217;ve
passed
something
you
wish
you
hadn&#8217;t.
I
don&#8217;t
understand
a
lot
of
things
about
Washington.
This
is
definitely
one
of
them.
In
any
case,
there
are
now
a
number
of
pieces
of
legislation
being
floated
to
undo
the
military
retiree
cuts.
When
Congress
adjourned
before
Christmas,
many
of
them
were
still
being
pulled

rewritten
because,
again,
in
a

the

&#8211;
like
surviving
spouses,
for
instance.
When
the

I
will
certainly
be

one
of
them.
I
believe
this
was
a
serious
mistake
that
Congress
made
and
I

see
it
fixed.
That&#8217;s
all
I
have
for
now.
Congress
will
return
to
Washington
again
on
Tuesday.
For
now,
I
hope
you
all
had
a
very
Merry
Christmas
and
a
Happy
New
Year
and
I
will
be
in
touch
with
an
update
again
next
week.
And
as
always,
if
anything
comes
up
in
the
meantime,
just
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.

Nugent Member
