Veterans Job Training
Tomorrow's veterans' workshop at Trident Technical College in North
Charleston will conclude the first part of my veteran job training
initiative, and I am looking forward to meeting with veterans there. We
have had a great reaction from veterans and the community so far to
these workshops. I am hopeful that the events were useful for those who
have served our nation and are looking to transition back into civilian
work.
Here
is more information about the workshops that
took place across the state over the past week, as well as on tomorrow's
event.

Continuing our commitment to serve and support those who have defended
our nation, we will have another set of workshops on different topics
in December, as well as veterans job and resource fairs in early 2015,
so stay tuned for those!
Celebrating South Carolina's Businesses
South Carolina is leading the nation's manufacturing renaissance and I'm
proud that businesses - large and small - are continuing to select
South Carolina to open and expand their businesses because of our
pro-business, pro-growth approach
to growing our economy. I was
pleased to receive the NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative
Excellence
because it is truly a testament to
our well trained workforce and commitment to workforce development and
job training that lead to good paying jobs in the manufacturing
industry.
Because several key components of my SKILLS Act are now law, South
Carolinians wanting to move into today's in demand jobs, like
manufacturing, have an easier time accessing the workforce development
system, an important step to ensuring our nation remains competitive in
the global 21st century economy.
Opportunity Agenda
In case you haven't seen my Opportunity Agenda
, here are 10 important facts about it.
1.Significant parts of my SKILLS Act
were signed into law this year, working
to make job training more efficient and better tied to local needs.
2. The
CHOICE Act
puts education back in the hands of
parents, and out of the hands of bureaucrats in Washington.
3. The
LEAP Act
enjoys bipartisan support, and makes
South Carolina's successful apprenticeship program a national model.
4. The SEA Jobs Act
calls for using sound science to
determine our coastal resources, and could create up to 280,000 jobs.
5. The CHOICE Act helps kids with special needs have access to the
education they deserve. I have had the honor of meeting Ms. Rachel
Lewis of Greenville who benefitted from a similar program, and talked
about her story here
.
6. My Opportunity Agenda was inspired in part by my grandfather. I
talked about his life and what he means to me here
.
7. The LEAP
Act would help fill our nation's 4
million vacant jobs, and is paid for by cutting wasteful government
printing.
8. The SEA Jobs Act
would both help veterans with job
training and emphasize STEM education at colleges, universities and
HBCUs.
9. The CHOICE Act
expands educational options for
200,000 children living on domestic military installations.
10. I'll announce multiple new initiatives in the coming months to help
ensure all Americans have the chance to succeed! Learn more at

I am honored to serve as your U.S. Senator. Please don't hesitate to

be of service to you.
