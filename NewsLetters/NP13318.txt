Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Iowans getting up and working difficult full-time jobs shouldn't come
home to find themselves and their families living in poverty.
But since 1968, Iowans who make the minimum wage have seen their real
incomes fall by more than 30 percent. This means a parent with one
child working 40 hours at a minimum wage job is living in poverty.
I believe it's time we restore the minimum wage to a living wage, and
I'm supporting a proposal to restore it to $10.10 an hour.
Do you agree? Click here to take my quick poll and let me know if you
think we should raise the minimum wage.
Today, about 25,000 Iowans work minimum wage jobs and another 21,000
work jobs paying below the minimum wage.
A raise in the minimum wage would mean a pay increase for over 300,000
Iowans who are struggling in a tough economic environment.
It's time to the level the playing field for all Iowans.
Feel free to take my short poll and let me know if you believe we
should raise the minimum wage:

I look forward to your input and reading your replies.
All the best,
Bruce
