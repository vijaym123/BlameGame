Freedom is Not Free
Faith, Family, Freedom Three words that represent all that we stand for and all that we hold dear in the United States of America.
As citizens of this country we are fortunate to live in the greatest nation in the world, one where we are afforded many rights and privileges. But all of this would not be possible without one more word sacrifice. On Memorial Day, we recognize and honor those who have sacrificed their lives for our country so that we may continue to live by these values and principles upon which our nation was founded.
As we are reminded on this day, freedom isnt free.
Many brave men and women have paid the ultimate price to protect their fellow man, and for that I am eternally grateful.
We must also remember to keep the mothers, fathers, children, and other family members behind each service member in our prayers, for they too sacrifice greatly.
I hope you will take time this Memorial Day to express gratitude and pay respect to our fallen soldiers.
Also thank our men and women in uniform who continue to put their lives on the line each day so that we may live in a nation dedicated to faith, freedom, and family values.
God Bless our troops and their families.
And God Bless the United States of America.
In your service,
Steven M.
