Dear David,
Just last month, we broke
ground on a new train station, were ready to move on a new veterans
outpatient clinic to serve our areas 70,000 veterans, and of course, we
broke ground on the redevelopment of the Inner Loop!
Not only will this reinvigorate downtown
Rochester, reconnect communities, and create over 3,000 permanent jobs
and 1,000 local construction jobs, it will save us $34 million by not
having to manage upkeep of the bridges and boundary wallsit makes
good sense all
around.
Dreamed up in the
1940s, planned in the 1950s, and built in the 1960s, the Inner Loop is
overdue for an overhaul. Ten years ago, it became clear to me that the
Inner Loop needed to be addressed, and Im proud to have helped
secure the first round of funding of $2.4 million to reconstruct the
eastern portion of the Inner Loop. Then-Mayor Bill Johnson and I hoped that
we could integrate residents back into downtown to restore our city,
but that was just the first step.
Furthering that vision, in 2006, I secured an additional $1.92
million for design and environmental work from Clinton Ave. to East Main
Street, which also funded a study of how the Inner Loop was faring in
the decades after it was built. Rochester and the United States have
changed since the 1960s, and its important for our infrastructure to
keep up.
That study showed us that the Inner Loop was doing more
harm than good: it was disconnecting neighborhoods and making it harder
for Rochester to thrive. It became clear that the Inner Loop needed a
big change.
In pursuit of
that goal, in August of last year, I was able to secure $17.7 million
through the U.S. Department of Transportations TIGER grant. The
automatic spending cuts known as the sequester trimmed some of that funding,
but that couldnt stop us.
My
hope for this project has been the same since 2004: connect our
neighborhoods and unify our community.
Streets like Monroe and East
Avenue will get a major face-lift and space that was unusable will be
opened up for more businesses, along the East Ave corridor. The
development opportunities are truly endless here.
For our city to thrive, we must be unified. Projects
like this are popping up across the nation. Our nations
infrastructure is crumbling. For goods to cross our state, for people to get to
work, for kids to get to school, its essential that our roads and
bridges are in tip top shape: and that includes the Inner Loop.
Ten years ago, the seed was planted. Ten
years ago, we saw the potential for this project. Ten years ago, we
began this project.
This is the
best of what government service looks like: dogged determination toward
a goal for the public good, and Im happy to be a part of that
goal.
Heres to more
building!
Best,
Louise
