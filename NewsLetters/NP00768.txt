The
USDA
Rural Development Community Facility Loan Program
for Fiscal
Year 2014 has an abundance of low interest loan money available

funding will continue in Fiscal Year 2015.
Under the CF Program
loans/grants can be made to public bodies and non- profit organizations,
located in areas with a population of 20,000 or less.
The program
helps communities provide vital services and amenities for their
residents and visitors.
This includes fire and rescue support services
(such as fire halls, fire trucks, ambulances, and equipment), town
halls, town barns, libraries, health care (hospitals, clinics, medical
office buildings), museums, and schools.
