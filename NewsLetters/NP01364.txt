A Nuclear Iran?
At the beginning of April, Secretary of State Kerry and the Obama Administration announced the framework of a negotiated treaty with Iran regarding their nuclear enrichment activities. This announcement comes at a time when Iran is sowing chaos in the region, from backing rebels who have overrun Yemen to supporting Hezbollah, a sworn enemy of Israel.
Congress has a role, and this week the Senate is considering legislation to allow Congress time to review any final agreement reached, passing unanimously out of the Foreign Relations Committee
I expect the House of Representatives to have a say in this deal. Specifically, to address the current sanctions imposed on Iran and their ability to further enrich uranium for nuclear armament. I am concerned that lifting sanctions would remove the incentives to stop Irans production of weapons-level enrichment. I also feel that lifting sanctions will enhance funding for Irans terror-related activities around the globe.
Excerpt from
Congressional letter
to President Obama
A nuclear Iran would further feed the instability in the Middle East. Other countries in the region, like Saudi Arabia, will engage in this arms race to also pursue nuclear weapons after seeing no consequences imposed on their neighbor, Iran.
The House of Representatives sent a letter to President Obama expressing these concerns and Congresss role in this process. I was one of 367 cosigners, a huge bipartisan coalition. It reads in part:
The United States has had a longstanding interest in preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability.
Over the last twenty years, Congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation imposing sanctions on Iran to prevent that outcome, ultimately forcing Iran into negotiations.
Should an agreement with Iran be reached, permanent sanctions relief from congressionally-mandated sanctions would require new legislation.
In reviewing such an agreement, Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief.
Resolving the nuclear crisis with Iran remains of grave importance to our nations security.
As the Administration continues to negotiate with Iran, we are prepared to evaluate any agreement to determine its long-term impact on the United States and our allies.
We remain hopeful that a diplomatic solution preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon may yet be reached, and we want to work with you to assure such a result.

I want to hear what you think:
Do you approve of
the Obama Administrations negotiations
with Iran on nuclear enrichment?
