Congressional Report -- Week of May 26-30: Visited U.S. Troops
in Afghanistan on Memorial Day
Hello Friend,
Each Memorial Day, I've made it a point to spend time with U.S. troops
in Afghanistan. I want them to know that their service and sacrifice
are appreciated. This was my second visit. I landed in Kabul on
Saturday, May 24, and came back on Wednesday, May 28. After several
days of session, I headed home to Texas on Friday. This weekend, I am
spending some time on the Devil's River with my son and also spending
time in San Antonio meeting with constituents and attending events.
Field Representatives were also busy during the week. They visited
Marfa, Monahans, Grandfalls, Terlingua, Presidio, Del Rio, Crystal
City, Brackettville, Eagle Pass, Somerset, Lytle, Uvalde and north and
southside San Antonio.

Visiting U.S. Troops in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan, I hung out with the troops and spent time in briefings
with senior U.S. military and diplomatic officials. We discussed the
way forward in Afghanistan. I am pleased that our service men and women
will soon be returning home.
Visiting our troops over Memorial Day allows me to reinforce to them
that the American people - and Texans in particular - have their back.
And, it allows me to learn firsthand about the morale, mission, and
status of our men and women in uniform.
As a parent who happens to serve on the House Armed Services Committee,
I know what a special responsibility it is to ensure that our nation's
sons and daughters have the support, training, and equipment they need.
I spend a lot of time with our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines -
and I know that members of Congress must show the same commitment to
public service that these men and women demonstrate every day. For more

Increasing Funding for Domestic Violence Programs Passes House
Too many times, family violence shelters in rural areas are on the
verge of closing. Their resources are limited. On Thursday, I
introduced a bipartisan amendment to add an additional $5 million for
rural domestic violence programs as part of the Fiscal Year 2015
Commerce, Justice Science Appropriations Bill.
The amendment includes an additional $2.5 million for the Office of
Violence Against Women-Prevention and Prosecution and an additional
$2.5 million to the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement
program.
I've long been an advocate for crime victims and their families. While
our system focuses on a defendant, a victim is often left behind. For
victims of family violence, a shelter is critical; and for shelters
across the 23rd District of Texas, grants are critical for survival.
The parent and former prosecutor in me also understands that,
regardless of where they live, both children and adults must be able to
resources, like counseling and healthcare, to overcome any type of
violence or stalking. My amendment helped domestic violence programs in
rural areas where other resources are often scarce. For more on this
amendment, click here

Meeting with U.S. troops in Afghanistan over Memorial Day Weekend.
Preserving Texas History for Future Generations
May is Preservation Month. It's a fitting time to highlight some of the
many historical buildings in the 23rd District of Texas. While in the
Texas House of Representatives, I authored the bill creating the
Courthouse Restoration Program at the Texas Historical Commission. The
idea for the bill came when the roof of the Val Verde Courthouse caved
in - and the county didn't have funds to repair their historic
courthouse.
Passing the bill was a challenge. No precedent existed in Texas for
such a program. I worked closely with several of Texas' iconic leaders,
then-Governor George W. Bush, Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock and
Speaker Pete Laney to pass the bill and put the program into place.
To my knowledge, Texas has more majestic courthouses than any other
state. These courthouses are an integral part of our history. I am
fortunate to represent several of them, including historic courthouses
in Presidio, Hudspeth, La Salle, Jeff Davis and Maverick counties - all
which participated in the Courthouse Restoration Program. For more on
Preservation Month, click here

Mayor Castro Nominated to Federal Post
Last week, I congratulated San Antonio Mayor Julin Castro - one of the
Lone Star State's shining stars. Mayor Castro was nominated by the
President to serve as our next Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development. As mayor, he has been practical and has always put
principle before party.
Frankly, I always root for my fellow Texans. When one of us does well,
we all do well. San Antonio will miss Mayor Castro - but our loss is
the nation's gain. I wish the Secretary-designate well in the upcoming
confirmation process. I have no doubt he'll be an outstanding member of
the President's cabinet.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your representative and voice in
Washington. If I can help you with a federal agency or issue, please
call on any of our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed
below. I've never been a big fan of politics - people are my favorite
part of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
