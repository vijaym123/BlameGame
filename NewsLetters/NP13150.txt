Congressman Andrews Calls on Congress To Extend Unemployment Benefits
for South Jersey Families
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Andrews urged leaders of the
House of Representatives to extend federal emergency unemployment
benefits.
According to the New Jersey Department of Labor and
Workforce Development, over 10,000 unemployed people in Camden,
Gloucester and Burlington Counties saw their unemployment benefits end
at the end of last month and were left with no reasonable prospect of
income to take its place.
Without extending these benefits, these
10,000 South Jerseyans are at risk of losing their homes, apartments,
or the ability to feed their families.
Congressman Andrews voted for
the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program in 2008 to
provide crucial support to the economy and to millions of Americans who
lost jobs through no fault of their own during the height of the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression.
The Congressman has urged
his colleagues to come together once again to help those in need.

Andrews Announces Over $46M for Military Construction Projects at
Joint Base MDL
WASHINGTON, DC - Last week Congressman Andrews announced that $46
million in military construction projects have been authorized for
South Jersey's South Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. The funding was
included in the Fiscal Year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act,
which passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly with 350 votes
and was signed into law by President Obama on December 26th. The bill
authorizes approximately $632.8 billion in budget authority for
national defense programs of the Department of Defense (DOD), the
national security programs of the Department of Energy (DOE), and to
wind down the war in Afghanistan. The agreement is based primarily on
earlier authorization legislation that the House approved in June of
this year, which Congressman Andrews helped craft as a member of the
Armed Services Committee.
