Greetings from Washington D.C.,
It has been a pleasure to spend time with my constituents following a lot of activity in Washington, where I'm fighting to make our communities safer and to end the war in Afghanistan.
Please take a few minutes to catch up on happenings in the district and my updates from Congress:
