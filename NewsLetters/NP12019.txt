House to Act on Regulatory
Accountability
In our previous newsletter, I
wrote briefly about efforts underway in the House of Representatives
to ensure that your government acts with greater transparency and
accountability.
To that end, the House Ways &amp; Means Committee --
of which I am a member -- two weeks ago, approved H.R. 3865, the Stop
Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014.
This is a
bill to stop the egregious political targeting we've seen by the
IRS.
I'm pleased to report that this legislation will be coming to
the floor this week for a vote by the full House of
Representatives.
In addition, we will be putting
forward several other pieces of legislation aimed at making sure
Washington treats all Americans fairly and meets its obligation to be
forthright about how, when, where and why taxpayer dollars are being
spent.
When your federal government decides to regulate, the process
must be open and transparent.
We know that undue and burdensome
regulations can stifle economic
opportunity.
Holding Washington accountable and weeding out the waste
and inefficiencies in government is an ongoing project -- one we
remain committed to achieving.
Milton High
School
Last week, I had the privilege of visiting with
several different groups in the district.
While in Milton on
Thursday, I had the opportunity to chat with students at Milton High
School.
It is always very encouraging to see so many young people
taking an interest in their nations history and government.
