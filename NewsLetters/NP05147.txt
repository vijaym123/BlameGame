Dear Friend &ndash;
When you&rsquo;re 16 years old, you think you&rsquo;re invincible.
But the reality is that motor vehicle crashes remain the number one killer of teenagers ages 15 to 20. Mile for mile, teenagers are involved in three times as many fatal crashes as all other drivers.
Fortunately, accidents caused by drunk driving, distracted driving and speeding can all be prevented.
This week is National Teen Driver Safety Week, when we work to get the word out about how we can increase safety for everyone who shares the road including teens, adults, law enforcement and first responders.
I hope you&rsquo;ll take the time to visit

and learn what you can do to help promote teen driver safety.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
