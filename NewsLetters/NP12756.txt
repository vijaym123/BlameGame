Commissaries are a vital recruitment and retention tool, essential to maintaining our all-volunteer military. Even more than that, though, commissaries represent a part of our commitment to taking care of our servicemembers during and after their time of service to the United States of America. Not only are they beneficial to active duty and retirees, but also to their families, who sacrifice so much for our nation. While military members are deployed for long stretches of time, their loved ones back home can still enjoy the services that the commissaries and exchanges provide. Click below to watch
the speech
I gave on the House Floor, opposing any efforts to close down our commissaries.
The men and women who volunteer to serve our nation are not the cause of our current fiscal crisis. Proposals asking them to carry the weight of solving it are unacceptable.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I am also strongly opposed to any changes to military compensation that would break-faith with the men and women who wear the uniform of this nation. Thats why I cosponsored
H.R. 3790 , bipartisan legislation to restore the full cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees. I also supported
H.R.3547 , which was signed into law earlier this month.
It exempts all veterans who medically retire, those who receive Combat Related Specialty Compensation, those who receive Concurrent Receipt Pay, and surviving spouses in receipt of payments under the Survivor Benefit Program from the COLA adjustments. Additionally, while no changes will take effect until 2015, it is my hope that Congress will act quickly to pass both these bills and honor our servicemembers by ensuring they receive the benefits they deserve.
