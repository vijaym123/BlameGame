Friends,
Americans across the nation went to the polls this
month and weighed in on the current state of our country.
The
Presidents policies were resoundingly rejected, sending a strong signal
to Congress and the White House that
it is time to chart a new
course.
After the
election, the President acknowledged the countrys disapproval,
telling the nation,
To everyone who voted, I want you to know, I
hear you.
Hearing your concerns about the economy and
the lack of good-paying jobs, my colleagues and I are determined to make
this Lame Duck Session (the time after an election before the new
congress begins) useful.
The House last week passed legislation approving the Keystone
Pipeline, sending the proposal to the Senate for consideration again.
The Senate has indicated it will take up the Keystone bill this
week.
A new energy pipeline would create thousands of jobs
and give our economy the much needed boost voters demanded on
Election
Day.
Contrary to his statements after the election,
the President has
signaled he will continue business as usual.
When asked
about the Keystone Pipeline bill likely headed to the Presidents desk,
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, The
Administration, as you know, has taken a dim view of these kinds of legislative
proposals in the past.
Earnest said he hasn't reviewed the
specifics of what's before Congress now, but added, "I think it's fair to
say that our dim view of these kinds of proposals has not
changed."
Sadly, this is not the only
business as usual action the President has hinted at taking.
The media is reporting this week President Obama plans to take
executive action and grant amnesty to five million illegal immigrants.
While the President does have limited authority to issue
executive orders, granting
executive amnesty to
millions of people
is not in his purviewsomething he has even
acknowledged himself.
With
respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through
executive order, that is just not the case, President Obama has said.
There are laws on the books that Congress has
passed.
The President has a pattern of
disregard for our Constitution, which is why I drafted the Stop This
Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution last year.
This resolution
calls for legal action against the President for his abuses of power,
and this summer, the House passed a similar resolution to initiate
legal action.
Should the President choose abuse his power and grant executive amnesty,
the House will not stand by silently.
Speaker Boehner
has said that he is willing to do whatever it takes to stop the
President from ignoring our nations laws, even if this means shutting down
the federal government. Our goal here is to stop the president
from violating his own oath of office and violating the constitution.
Its not to shut down the government, Speaker Boehner has
said.
I am hopeful
the President will change his mind and come to Congress to work on the
big issues facing our country.
I am also hopeful that
he will go through proper legislative process to reform to our nations
laws.
The President has accurately stated, We are a nation of
laws that is part of our tradition.
Rest assured the House of
Representatives plans to do whatever it takes to keep this tradition
alive.
I would
like to know what you think about the Presidents recent actions.
Please take the poll below.
Do you think the President should grant executive amnesty to illegal
immigrants?
Yes, he
has waited long enough for Congress to act.
No, he should he work with Congress to reform
our countrys immigration laws.
I do not know. I would rather not say.
