Friend,
You&#39;re always there when I need you. When you heard about the $8 million dollars (which is now $10 million dollars!) worth of outside money being spent against me, you responded by helping us exceed our emergency goal.
Then, when you heard yesterday that Doug Ose just invested $700,000 of his own money, you stepped up again.
Because of you, my team and I are able to fight back.
Make no mistake - the 18 days between now and Election Day will be tough.
They&#39;re going to continue coming at us from all sides. But we have a plan - we&#39;ll work hard, stay focused, and channel all our resources towards what matters most - ensuring that the truth of our message is heard.
If we focus - we will win. 18 more days. The home stretch. Let&#39;s do this.
Thank you.
Be well,
