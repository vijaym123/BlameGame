Meeting with Students at Southwest High School in San Antonio
Interview with Telemundo
Dear Friend,
Congress reconvened last week. Just before recess, Congress passed the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The budget act was critical to taking
care of our active-duty military and providing them relief from
mindless automatic across-the-board cuts required by the "sequester."
The sequester hurts our troops, our national security and our nation's
economy-a bad combination.
This budget bill was not perfect. No bill is. Ensuring our sons and
daughters in uniform get what they need was a good reason to support
the budget deal. But, in doing active-duty troops immediate good, it
also changed cost-of-living (COLA) adjustments on military retirement
pensions for certain veterans.
>From the beginning, I've been working to fix this.
(1) Only days after the budget deal, I joined 95 other members of
Congress to introduce legislation eliminating these COLA reductions on
working-age retirees. This legislation is spearheaded by Congressman
Jeff Miller, a Republican and chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee.
(2) Congress' first week back in session, I asked the Speaker of the
House
to bring the legislation I and others sponsored to the House floor
for a vote. Once the legislation is allowed on the floor, it is certain
to pass.
(3) I also wrote to key negotiators currently working on the
appropriations bills
that fund all government
agencies and programs. I asked that the appropriators make no cuts to
the pensions in question but instead keep the necessary funding to
maintain the pension funds at their current level and that no changes
be made to the current system.
My father was a veteran, and I know how much our service members and
their families sacrifice for our country. For me, taking care of our
vets is a no-brainer.
I will continue to press leaders of both parties to fix this issue. I
came to Congress knowing there would be difficult decisions to make.
Taking meaningful steps to stop the cuts to our active duty men and
women was absolutely necessary.
Now, we must work to keep the promise
to our vets.
I take heat for working side by side with Democrats and Republicans,
conservatives and progressives, to advance the interests of our kids,
our country and our future. Mine isn't a partisan voting record. In
fact, it's one of the most bipartisan records in Congress. That's what
happens when you call them as you see them.
Thank you for allowing me to represent and work for you. If I can be of
assistance, please contact any of our offices. The addresses and phone
numbers are below.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

Dear
Friend,
Congress
reconvened last
week. Just
before
recess,
Congress
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013. The
budget
act
was
critical
to
taking
care
of
our
active-duty
military
and
providing
them
relief
from
mindless
automatic
across-the-board
cuts
required
by
the
"sequester." The
sequester
hurts
our
troops,
our
national
security
and
our
nation's
economy &#8211; a
bad
combination.
This
budget
bill
was
not
perfect. No
bill
is. Ensuring
our
sons
and
daughters
in
uniform
get
what
they
need
was
a
good
reason
to
support
the
budget
deal. But,
in
doing
active-duty
troops immediate
good,
it
also
changed
cost-of-living
(COLA)
adjustments
on
military
retirement
pensions
for
certain
veterans.
From
the
beginning,
I've
been
working
to
fix
this.
(1) Only
days
after
the
budget
deal,
I
joined
95
other
members
of
Congress
to
introduce
legislation
eliminating
these
COLA

on
working-age
retirees.
This
legislation
is
spearheaded
by
Congressman
Jeff
Miller,
a
Republican
and
chairman
of
the
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee.
(2) Congress'
first
week
back
in
session,
I
asked
the
Speaker
of
the
House
to
bring
the
legislation
I
and
others
sponsored
to
the
House
floor
for
a
vote . Once
the
legislation
is
allowed
on
the
floor,
it
is
certain
to
pass.
(3)
I
also
wrote
to
key
negotiators
currently
working
on
the
appropriations
bills
that
fund
all
government
agencies
and
programs . I
asked
that
the
appropriators
make
no
cuts
to
the
pensions
in
question
but
instead
keep
the
necessary
funding
to
maintain
the
pension
funds
at
their
current
level
and
that
no
changes
be
made
to
the
current
system.
My
father
was
a
veteran,
and
I
know
how
much
our
service
members
and
their
families
sacrifice
for
our
country. For
me,
taking

of
our

is
a

I
will
continue
to

of

I

there
would
