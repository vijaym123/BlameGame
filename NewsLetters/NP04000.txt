Lummis Fights Executive Amnesty
Dear Friends,
Last night I voted against the funding bill. The House passed it and chose to fully fund the government through October except funding for the Department of Homeland Security which will end in February.
I voted no because I do not agree with President Obamas decision to unilaterally grant amnesty to the millions of illegal immigrants who have flooded our porous borders.
He tries to justify his actions by saying Congress didnt act.
We did act.
We passed legislation last summer.
Hes not just asking us to pass a bill; hes demanding that we pass the Senates gang-of-eight bill, which is unacceptable and would leave our country vulnerable.
In the funding bill I think we should have included restrictions and limitations that would have blocked the Presidents executive action.
He has a history of distorting the laws and thats why we shouldnt give him any wiggle room with the purse strings.
I look forward to taking the fight to him next year when Republicans will control the Senate.
Thank you for all your input on these and other issues during this Congress.
