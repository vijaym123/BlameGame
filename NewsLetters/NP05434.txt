I just did some back of the envelope math. It&rsquo;s.. well, just look for yourself:
$3,300,000 reserved by Boehner
+ $1,610,000 spent by outside groups
= $4,910,000 on ads against me
David, it&rsquo;s enough cash to make your head spin.
But here&rsquo;s the thing: even after millions and millions of dollars spent against me, our race is still tied.
How? Because of you, David. Your $5 and $10 gifts add up- and they give us the resources to fight back against Republican attacks.
So naturally, David, I have to ask again. Will you pitch in before tomorrow&rsquo;s big deadline? It&rsquo;s the last one we&rsquo;ve got. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thank you so much,
B. Schneider
p.s. One more thing. We&rsquo;re almost at $100,000 online for the first half of October. Yes - that would
definitely
be a new record.
Help us do it.
