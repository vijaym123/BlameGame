Constitution Day Correspondence
Dear Friend,
Every year, in honor of Constitution Day (observed on September 17th) I send a letter to all elementary and middle schools in Georgia's 10th Congressional District encouraging teachers to take a moment out of their school day to educate students on the importance of the U.S. Constitution. I also ask that students write to me on why the Constitution is important to them and what they have learned about our nation's most important document. I was delighted to hear from several young students, and would like to share a response with you:
Lily Frisch from Eatonton, GA
In addition to hearing from students by mail, I also had the pleasure of visiting a classroom in order to meet with students and discuss the importance of the U.S. Constitution and constitutionally-limited government. Mr. Dustin Davis' 8th grade class at Westside Middle School was kind enough to host me at the school to discuss the Constitution and the critical role it plays in safeguarding our liberty and freedom.
Speaking to Students at Westside Middle School

Mr. Davis' students asked some great questions about our nation's founding document, the legislative branch, and current events. I was grateful for their well-thought questions and encouraged by their participation on these important topics.
