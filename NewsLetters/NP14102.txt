Honoring New Hampshire Law
Enforcement
(11/15/13 Concord, NH - Congressional Law
Enforcement Awards)
Dear Friend,
Last week I was proud
to honor members of New Hampshires law enforcement community at the
annual Congressional Law Enforcement Awards in Concord. Along with our
entire delegation, we honored those who put their lives on the line
every day to protect us and keep our communities safe and reflected on
the amazing work that New Hampshire law enforcement and other first
responders do every year.
The ceremony was inspiring,
particularly when I heard about all the selfless acts of bravery and heroism
performed by our men and women in uniform, whether responding to an
accident, a domestic disturbance, a violent crime, or simply patrolling
our streets. The law enforcement community always puts the publics
welfare before their own.
We all owe New Hampshires law
enforcement community a tremendous amount of gratitude. It was an
honor to be a part of this wonderful tribute and I hope you all will join
me to thank these brave men and women for all the do every
day.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
