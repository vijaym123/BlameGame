Honoring the Fallen
Dear Friend,
On Wednesday I was on C-SPAN discussing a variety of topics being debated in Congress, including multinational trade deal (TPP) and lifting the Cuban embargo. Click below to watch.
This week together with Rep. Glenn Thompson, we introduced the Veterans E-Health &amp; Telemedicine Support Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill aimed at increasing veterans' access to healthcare across states. Veterans will no longer be required to travel to a VA facility, but rather can receive telemedicine treatment from anywhere, including their home or a community center.

Memorial Day is a day of reflection. As a Korean War veteran who was wounded in battle, I know firsthand the sacrifices our troops make for America. This weekend we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending the freedoms we enjoy here at home. On Memorial Day at 12:01 pm, I will pause for a moment of silence in remembrance of the fallen. I hope you will join me in paying tribute to those who have given their lives in service to our great country.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
Meet Larry Walker, My Shadow
This week I participated in Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day by hosting Larry Walker from New York. I hope he was inspired to dream big.
