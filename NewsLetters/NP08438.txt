A Kick in the Teeth to
our First Amendment Rights
What is the difference between a taxidermist and a tax collector? Mark
Twain once asked.
The taxidermist takes only your
skin.
In recent months, the mood in
Washington has given us few reasons to think otherwise.
Last year, we
learned that law-abiding Americans were being bullied by the IRS due
to their political leanings.
At the expense of our First
Amendment Rights, bureaucrats were working to silence conservative
individuals and organizations around the country.
Whether it is the IRS,
EPA, or Department of Education, our government is becoming bigger and
more aggressive each day.
Who
was really behind the IRS scheme?
This is a question Congress
has been trying to find out, but all along the way, the Obama
Administration has stonewalled Congress.
Worst of all, Lois Lerner, one of
the directors at the IRS, refused to answer questions when she was
called to Capitol Hill.
Last month, with my support the House of
Representatives held Lerner in contempt of Congress for her
conduct.
Making matters worse, Congress
recently learned that the IRS lost several years worth of Lerners
e-mails.
The IRS claims that this was a mishap due to a computer
crash.
Making things even harder to believe, we find out that
e-mails from six other individuals being investigated have also
vanished.
The writing is on the
wall.
It is appearing more and more that the American people and Congress
have been lied to by our government.
The IRS has been turned
into another government bully used to silence the Presidents
critics.
With this kick in the teeth to our First Amendment rights, the
President and his Administration have seriously violated our
trust.
Rest assured, Congress will do
everything in its power to bring Lois Lerner and the IRS to
justice.
What they have done is un-American, and it has no place in our
government.
Sincerely,
Sam
Graves
