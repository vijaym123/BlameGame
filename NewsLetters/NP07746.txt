Week in
Review
Thanks to all of
the Arkansans who visited my office while in Washington this week
including, the Trenary family from Bella Vista, Randy Veach with the Farm
Bureau, the Cash family from Harrison, Johnny Dillard from Lowell,
Kristi Nichols and Luis Manzanares from Heber Springs, Teri and Kathleen
Wright from West Fork, the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of
America, and Flannery Wasson from Fort Smith.
I was especially
glad to have my dear friend, Mrs. Hunt and her family, in D.C. I hope
all have safe trips back to Arkansas!
I participated in a
press conference with House Republican leaders on Tuesday morning.
At the press conference, I discussed the dozens of jobs bills the
House has passed that
if taken up by the Senate
would create jobs and
opportunity in America. Good-paying jobs and expanded opportunities
are the foundation of an America that works. Unfortunately, mandates and
red tape from Washington are making life more difficult in the
hospital, the classroom, and the job market. That's why House Republicans
will continue working to create jobs, grow the economy, and help
hardworking Americans take home more of their paychecks. You can watch
my remarks here
and
the entire press
conference here .
On Tuesday
afternoon, the House passed
H.R. 3086 , the
Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA), and
H.R.
5021 , the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of
2014.
PITFA
prohibits taxation for sheer usage of the Internet and its services, and I
was proud to cosponsor and support the bill. But its important to
remember that while Internet-usage is free of tax, purchases made online
are not
consumers are personally responsible for calculating and
remitting sales and use taxes on them in 46 states.
I urge my
colleagues in the House to take up the Senate-passed Marketplace Fairness
Act, which eases the burden on consumers and grants states the authority
to enforce their existing tax laws and collect their due
not new
sales tax revenue.
H.R. 5021
passed by a vote of 228
195 and extends the
programmatic authority and expenditure authority of the Highway Trust Fund
through May 31, 2015. This legislations offsets for the transfer of
funds from the Treasury Departments General Fund come from two sources,
both of which have received bipartisan and bicameral support in the
past: pension smoothing, which would provide a total of $6.4 billion in
deficit reduction; and customs user fees, which would provide $3.5
billion in offsetting receipts. While I supported H.R. 5021, I believe
Congress must have serious conversations about how our country is going
to finance transportation infrastructure projects in the future. But
in the interim, we must give our state and local authorities the
certainty they need to plan for critical maintenance and improvements of
our highways.
Without it, states such as Arkansas will have to put
necessary projects on the backburner.
On Wednesday, the House completed consideration of, and
passed,
H.R. 5016 , the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG)
Appropriations Act, 2015. H.R. 5016 provides funding for the Treasury
Department, the Judiciary, the Small Business Administration, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Executive Office of the President,
and other agencies.
This legislation provides a total of $21.3
billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2015, which
is $566 million (2.6 percent) below the fiscal year 2014 discretionary
allocation and $2.26 billion (9.6 percent) below the Administrations
request.
Earlier in the week,
I went down to the House
floor to speak in support of the FSGG bill . From enforcing our
laws to assisting entrepreneurs, agencies funded in this bill provide
essential services to the American people.
But the federal
government should not be able to use taxpayers own dollars to target them
based on their political beliefs or violate their trust.
As members
of Congress, it is our obligation to provide the necessary oversight
and safeguards to ensure it does not, and
as a member of the
Appropriations FSGG Subcommittee
I am proud of this bill, which takes
important steps to increase accountability and
transparency.
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 4719 , the America Gives More Act of 2014. H.R. 4719
includes a package of five bipartisan bills reported by the Ways and Means
Committee that would improve and make permanent a number of tax rules
governing charitable donations and charitable organizations.
This package includes provisions which make permanent the enhanced
deduction for contributions of food inventory by any type of business,
allow tax-free distributions from IRAs for charitable purposes, the
temporary deduction for contributions of conservation easements, and
individual taxpayer deductions for charitable contributions made after
the close of the tax year but before the due date of the return, and
amend the Internal Revenue Code to set the excise tax rate on net
investment income of private foundations at one
percent.
Next week, in addition to suspensions, the House will consider the
Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act of 2013
(H.R. 3136), the Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial
Counseling Act (H.R. 4984), the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act
(H.R. 3393), the Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 (H.R. 4935),
and legislation aimed at reducing human
trafficking.
