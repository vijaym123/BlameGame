Dear Friend,
When you decide to open up a campaign office, it means only one thing --
you think you&rsquo;ve got a chance to win, and you&rsquo;re going to try to capitalize.
That&rsquo;s why the GOP has opened offices outside Boston. That&rsquo;s why my opponent is headquartered out of those offices --
they think they can win in November. The Republicans are getting ready for a fight this fall. We have to hit our fundraising goals so we&rsquo;ll have the resources to beat them. Give $5 and help us reach our $55,000 August goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5

Or donate another amount.
This year&rsquo;s races will determine control of the Senate. Everyone is counting on us to hold down the fort here in Massachusetts.
This time around, they only need to pick up six seats to win the Senate.
We simply can&rsquo;t let Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat fall into Republican hands. Help me keep fighting as our election heats up. Chip in $5 today.
Thanks,
Ed
