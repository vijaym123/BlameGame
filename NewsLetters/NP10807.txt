Dear Friend:
To honor the legacy
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the day marking his tragic
assassination in 1968, I marched at a rally on Friday to demand fairness
and justice for airport workers. In Congress, I've been working hard to
advance Dr. King's vision of a world without prejudice and poverty.
Together, we can overcome the challenges in making the American Dream a
reality and build ladders of opportunity for
everyone.
Affordable Care Act:
We did it! I was proud to
join President Obama at the White House on April 1st to celebrate the
huge success of The Affordable Care Act. As the sponsor of the bill,
I could not be more happy that over seven million people nationwide,
including more than 865,000 New Yorkers selected a health plan through
the health insurance marketplace. Despite Republican obstruction, the
Affordable Care Act is delivering on the promise of quality,
affordable coverage and helping slow the growth of health care costs for
everyone -- businesses, consumers, and the government. Now is the time to
celebrate the victories of the Affordable Care Act, to strengthen it for
the years to come, and to maintain healthcare as a right, not a
privilege, for all Americans.
Ryan Republican
Budget:
The Department of Labor announced that our economy
added 192,000 jobs in March, which shows that that our progressive
agenda is working.
However, instead of joining us to extend
unemployment insurance, raise the federal minimum wage, and pass comprehensive
immigration reform, Republicans unveiled another heartless budget
protecting loopholes for the wealthy and corporations shipping jobs
overseas. The budget is a recipe for recession that will hurt seniors,
students, workers, immigrants, and middle class families. As always, Ill
fight to protect the most
vulnerable.
Sickle Cell Caucus:
I'm pleased to have launched the
Congressional Sickle Cell Caucus along with Rep. Danny Davis and Senator Tim
Scott. The Sickle Cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell
disorders which affects an estimated 100,000 individuals in the United
States and millions globally. This is an issue that has affected and
impacted many of my constituents, yet unfortunately many people do not
know about or are misinformed about the disease. Throughout my tenure in
Congress I've worked hard to improve the healthcare for all Americans
and I'll continue supporting the issues surrounding Sickle Cell and
the many people who are impacted by the disease.
