Thune Applauds Passage of Bill to
Increase Mental Health Resources for Veterans
On February
3, 2015, the Senate passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for
American Veterans (SAV) Act. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) supported this
legislation, which is designed to improve Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
mental health support services and reduce the tragic number of veteran
suicides by providing increased counseling and programs for veterans.
The bill aims to address the unique needs of Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans, as well as older generations of veterans within the VA, and
builds off the mental health provisions of the Thune-backed Veterans
Choice Act that was enacted last
year.
The Clay Hunt SAV Act will evaluate and centralize VA mental
health resources, as well as establish a pilot program for educational
loan repayment for individuals who commit to working in mental health
fields for the VA. Another pilot will assist veterans transitioning from
active duty to veteran status. The bill will also extend for one year
certain combat veterans' eligibility for VA hospital care, medical
services, and nursing home care. The president is expected to sign the
bill into law later this
week.
The legislation is named to honor Marine Corporal Clay Hunt, a combat
veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who committed suicide at the age of
28 in 2011. Hunt, a Purple Heart recipient, was an active advocate for
veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder.
