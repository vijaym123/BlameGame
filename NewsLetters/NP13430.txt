Time To Vote on Comprehensive Immigration Reform
In Washington I tell my colleagues often that there is no district that more clearly shows the economic contributions of immigrants than our own. It is a perfect example of what happens when instead of forcing people to live in the shadows, you welcome immigrants, allowing them to work and become valued members of the community.
Coming from a family of immigrants, it is for this reason I care deeply about passing comprehensive immigration reform (CIR) and understand firsthand the immense opportunities that will come from it.
I met with several of the immigration leaders of Fast 4 Families to discuss the critical need to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the House of Representatives. I also hosted a Special Order highlighting the great sacrifices and dedicated efforts of these brave men and women who stand in solidarity in the fight for immigration reform.
Since introducing H.R. 15, the House comprehensive immigration reform bill, in October, my bill has received bipartisan support from 193 members of the House. And while the legislative year may have ended, I am committed to reigniting the conversation once Congress reconvenes in 2014, and doing everything I can to bring this to the floor for a vote. I am confident that we have enough votes to pass a bill that will provide expanded opportunities for the hardworking immigrants in our country who are Americans in every way but on paper.
It is time for Speaker Boehner to do what I believe is right by the American people and allow a vote on H.R. 15 so that we secure our economic future and finally fix our broken immigration system.

Putting Our Veterans Back to Work
In honor of Veterans Day, I introduced the Veterans Conservation Corps Act of 2013, a companion bill that was also introduced in the Senate by my colleague Senator Bill Nelson. Because our veterans have sacrificed so much to protect us, it is important to do everything we can to ease their transition as they return home.
My bill addresses large veteran unemployment rates by creating a national conservation corps that will provide employment for veterans, leveraging the skills they developed in the military, in areas that will restore and protect our national parks and lands.
This bill is just one way to honor our nations servicemen and women after so bravely serving our country.
Technology Meets Immigration Reform
Since my last newsletter, I hosted the first ever bipartisan Google+ hangout (We made Google history!).
Alongside my friend, and colleague, Congressman Jeff Denham (R-CA), we spoke with constituents and immigration activists across the country about the need to move immigration reform forward.

Dear Friend,
As my first year in office comes to a conclusion, I want to update you on the work I am doing, both in the district, and in Washington, to make our district a better place to live, work and visit.
Over the last month, my staff and I have continued working diligently to make sure your voice is heard
Weve led the efforts in pushing for comprehensive immigration reform, including hosting a Special Order in honor of the Fast 4 Families leaders and other immigration reform advocates; have worked closely with FEMA and other agencies to ensure we do all we can to keep flood insurance rates low; sponsored legislation to get our veterans back to work; met with several leaders including Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos; and most recently, joined forces with NOAA, and other federal agencies, in an effort to help the stranded pilot whales in the Florida Bay.
Below you will find a more in-depth look into some of these issues.
To keep up to date on my work in Washington please "like" my

Best wishes to you, your family and loved ones for a wonderful holiday season and a happy new year. I look forward to hearing from you!
Joe Garcia, U.S. House Representative (FL-26)
