Rep. Garrett meets with World War II veteran
Stanley Berenzweig of Wyckoff and his family.
Dear Friend,
As your Congressman, it is my duty and my esteemed honor to ensure that my constituents who have fought for our country receive the honors and the benefits that they have earned.
Unfortunately, managing the bureaucracy at the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs can oftentimes be confusing and difficult. Please allow me to help. I have dedicated professional staff in both of my New Jersey offices that are experts in handling issues for both active-duty military and veterans.
I recently had an opportunity to present medals that were lost or never awarded to a number of New Jersey residents or their families.
I also met with an impressive gentleman, Mr. Stanley Berenzweig of Wyckoff, to discuss an issue our office helped to resolve and his service in the 101st Airborne Division "Screaming Eagles" during World War II.
If you or someone in your family needs help with the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense, please contact my office in
Newton
at 973-300-2000 or
Glen Rock
at 201-444-5454.
It is an honor to serve those who have served us.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
