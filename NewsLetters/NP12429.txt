Standing For Justice
Watch my remarks on the Senate floor
Recently, President Obama nominated Mr. Debo Adegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. I oppose this nomination.
Mr. Adegbile volunteered to represent Mumia Abu-Jamal, who murdered Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in December 1981. As Officer Faulkner's widow explained, Adegbile was part of a legal team that extended her grief for 32 years, spreading misinformation about the crime and falsely proclaiming Abu-Jamal's innocence.
Officer Faulkner can no longer speak for himself. We speak for him now. Therefore, I will continue to urge my colleagues to oppose Mr. Adegbile's nomination and defeat it on the Senate floor.
Protecting Schoolchildren From Sexual Predators
Watch my remarks on the Senate floor
This week on the Senate floor, I spoke about my
bipartisan Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act . My bill requires schools to perform background checks on all new and existing employees. It also bans schools from helping a child molester find a new teaching job.
The
tragic story of Jeremy Bell
was my inspiration for introducing this bill. As the father of three young children, I cannot imagine the suffering of a parent whose child is sexually assaulted. No family should endure such a tragedy.
Keeping children safe is not a partisan issue, and I am proud to have the support of Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane and State Senator Anthony Hardy Williams in this effort. ( Read more in the
Philadelphia Public Record .)
Obamacare Discouraging Work
Watch video of my questioning
Work is a source of dignity. It's how people get ahead. I was disappointed when a recent government report showed that Obamacare discourages work and reduces economic growth. Please take a moment to watch this video where I discuss with the Congressional Budget Office director his report detailing the harmful impacts caused by the President's health care law.
