Dear Friend:
I had the wonderful opportunity this
week to speak to a group of opinion leaders at
the Reagan Ranch Center in Santa Barbara,
California. It was especially meaningful
for me to be able to tour President
Reagans home, which became known during
his presidency as the Western White
House, and later use that special venue to
articulate a positive vision for our nation
rooted in enduring constitutional principles.
Now is the time
for Republicans to tell America how we will solve
the problems President Obama has for too long
ignored. Republicans have an opportunity to
present a positive, reform-oriented agenda that
will show the American people that we are the
party of solutions, the party that can bring our
nation out of its current malaise and restore it
to growth and prestige and prosperity.
My speech outlined
five key priorities where Republicans must offer
solutions: health care, tax reform, regulatory
relief, innovation and tech policy, and a social
mobility agenda.
I believe governments role is not to
provide universal social and economic support,
but rather to create opportunities and remove
obstacles. A vigorous, dynamic
constitutional conservatism will return
government to its proper role that of
supporter, not director. By keeping the
Constitution as our guide and working to conserve
our founding principles, we can offer a hopeful,
reform-oriented agenda that will unite the
conservative movement and win the hearts and
minds of a broad majority of Americans looking
for change.
I would invite you to read the full speech
here:
Thank
you for your interest, and as always I appreciate
any feedback, ideas, or comments you would like
to share with me at
Email-Orrin.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
