Dear
Friend,
Weve all
heard about the tragic crash of a Germanwings airliner in the French
Alps last Tuesday. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the
150 who lost their lives in the crash.
With recent
attention focused on the pilot of the plane, it may be of interest to note a
provision I authored in the 2001 Transportation Security Act.
In
addition to existing US rules requiring another crewmember in the
cockpit, the provision provides immunity for airlines and their personnel
who report suspicious or questionable behavior by pilots or aviation
personnel.
That law has since been tested and
challenged.
On January 27, 2014 the US Supreme Court upheld my
provision in Air Wisconsin v. Hoeper. As author of the provision, I provided
support briefs through years of court challenges.
Click

to view the amicus brief I submitted to the
Supreme Court in defense of the provision.
With my
regards and best wishes, I
remain,
Sincerely,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
