This School Year, a Fresh Start for North Dakota's Kids
As a parent of two children, I could always tell that my kids enjoyed
the beginning of a new school year because it meant a fresh start,
complete with new teachers, reconnecting with friends and making some
new ones, and exciting opportunities awaiting them. As our kids start
this school year, they must have welcoming school environments where
they can grow and excel.
Making sure kids eat healthy school meals is key to that growth. They
help kids study and perform better in class, help them retain more
information, and help bring down childhood obesity rates. North Dakota
schools have been leading the way in meeting updated school nutrition
standards which help our kids eat better food, more whole grains, and
more fruits and vegetables, but they and other schools around the
country still need more support and resources to effectively implement
these standards. In fact, Pew Charitable Trusts found:
*
74 percent of North Dakota school districts need new or
improved kitchen equipment to better serve healthy meals;
*
The median cost for this equipment is $18,000 per school in
North Dakota, totaling more than $28 million statewide; and
*
37 percent of North Dakota school districts need upgrades and
improvements to kitchen infrastructure, such as more physical space,
electrical capacity, and ventilation.
The bipartisan bill I introduced earlier this year with Republican
Senator Susan Collins from Maine - the School Food Modernization Act
- would help schools get the equipment and training they need to
meet the nation's updated meal standards, all at no additional cost to
taxpayers. I've heard from school administrators about kitchen
equipment that hasn't been updated for two decades, which can make it
difficult to properly store and prepare healthy meals. We have to
continue to make sure North Dakota's students are on a healthy path so
they can succeed both in and outside the classroom.
I hope you will help me keep fighting to make sure schools have the
tools they need to give every student a nutritous meal. With a solid
education and wholesome nutrition, kids from Wahpeton to Williston will
have the energy and knowledge they need to grow and become successful
parts of North Dakota's future.

This
School
Year,
a
Fresh
Start
for
North
Dakota's
Kids
As
a
parent
of
two
children,
I
could
always
tell
that
my
kids
enjoyed
the
beginning
of
a
new
school
year
because
it
meant
a
fresh
start,
complete
with
new
teachers,
reconnecting
with
friends
and
making
some
new
ones,
and
exciting
opportunities
awaiting
them.
As
our
kids
start
this
school
year,
they
must
have
welcoming
school
environments
where
they
can
grow
and
excel.
Making
sure
kids
eat
healthy
school
meals
is
key
to
that
growth.
They
help
kids
study
and
perform
better
in
class,
help
them
retain
more
information,
and
help
bring
down
childhood
obesity
rates.
North
Dakota
schools
have
been
leading
the
way
in
meeting
updated
school
nutrition
standards
which
help
our
kids
eat
better
food,
more
whole
grains,
and
more
fruits
and
vegetables,
but
they
and
other
schools
around
the
country
still
need
more
support
and
resources
to
effectively
implement
these
standards.
In
fact,
Pew
Charitable
Trusts
found: 74
percent
of
North
Dakota
school
districts
need
new
or
improved
kitchen
equipment
to
better
serve
healthy
meals; The
median
cost
for
this
equipment
is
$18,000
per
school
in
North
Dakota ,
totaling
more
than
$28
million
statewide;
and 37
percent
of
North
Dakota
school
districts
need
upgrades
and
improvements
to
kitchen
infrastructure,
such
as
more
physical
space,
electrical
capacity,
and
ventilation.
The
bipartisan
bill
I
introduced

this
year
with
Republican
Senator
Susan
Collins
from
Maine
-
the
School
Food
Modernization
Act
-
would
help

the
equipment
and
training
they
need
to
meet
the
nation's
updated
meal
standards,
all
at
no
additional

to

I've
heard
from
school
administrators
about
kitchen
equipment
that
hasn't
been
updated
for
two
decades,
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
properly
store
and
prepare
healthy
meals.
We
have
to
continue
to
make
sure
North
Dakota's
students
are
on
a
healthy
path
so
they
can
succeed
both
in
and
outside
the
classroom.
I
hope
you
will
help
me
keep
fighting
to
make

schools
have
the
tools
they
need
to

a
