As the 114 th
Congress begins, we must focus on American priorities and earnestly seek solutions to the problems facing our fellow citizens every day.
Toward that end, this session of Congress is beginning by sending the President commonsense bills with the broad support of our fellow citizens to help grow the economy and create a more prosperous America for everyone.
H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act of 2015Repeals Obamacares 30-hour definition of full-time employment and restores the 40-hour workweek.
H.R. 22, the Hire More Heroes ActEncourages businesses to hire more American veterans.
H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline ActAuthorizes construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which will create 42,100 jobs according to the
State Departments Impact Statement
and will help to reduce our nations dependence on foreign oil.
H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability ActRequires the Administration to adopt the least costly method to write regulations and implement the law. The costs of these regulations are then passed on to American families; in total, this regulatory burden equals
$15,000 per household .
These bills are just the beginning and these bills deal with our legislative responsibility.
In addition, we simply must work harder to earn the trust of the people for whom we work by providing oversight, accountability, and consequences for conduct that does not meet the lofty standards of Americans.
In this regard, all four of the Committees I will serve on have this fundamental responsibility of accountability to the people: Judiciary, Oversight and Government Reform, Ethics, and the Select Committee on Benghazi.
It is an honor to represent the people of the Upstate of South Carolina.
