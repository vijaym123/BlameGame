Wicker: Trade Agreements Promise
More
Jobs, Economic
Growth
Congress Should Pass
Legislation to Streamline Approval Process
Trade is
important to Mississippis economy, boosting job creation and expanding
access to new markets.
Last year, our state produced $11.4 billion in
exports, contributing to record-setting levels for the United States
overall.
According to the International Trade Administration, a
sizable portion of these goods went to countries seeking to
participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive trade agreement
still under negotiation.
Democrats
Obstruct Key Trade Legislation
Congress has an
opportunity to help these negotiations with legislation that would
fast-track trade agreements, also known as trade promotion authority
(TPA).
Under TPA, lawmakers would be able to set clear
objectives for a trade deal and approve or reject the final agreement.
Streamlining the approval process would also strengthen the United
States hand at the negotiating table as it works to ensure fair and high
standards from other TPP countries.
Republicans and the
White House have found common ground on trade policy, but some
Democrats continue to obstruct TPA legislation, despite its impact on our
countrys economic security.
Some of the worlds
fasting-growing economies would be part of the TPP.
Moreover, 95 percent of
all consumers live outside of the United States.
Trade
agreements with countries in Asia and the Pacific, as well as the European
Union, would help U.S. workers and businesses stay competitive,
offering a level playing field for Made in America goods.
Mississippians Depend on Trade-Related
Jobs
A pro-growth approach to trade would also
support millions of high-paying jobs here at home.
According to the
Business Roundtable, an association of leaders from some of Americas
top companies, more than 335,000 jobs in Mississippi depend on
international trade.
Additionally, a vast majority of our states
exporters are small- to medium-size businesses
the primary drivers of
job creation.
Modern
Ports Play Vital Role in Commerce
In addition to
TPA, there are other important ways to promote trade.
Maintaining infrastructure for the smooth and efficient transit of goods is
integral to Americas competitiveness in global markets.
Our ports
are especially critical as gateways to these markets.
Last
years passage of a new Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) was a
significant advancement in assisting ports with dredging needs.
Many
of Americas ports are in desperate need of maintenance and therefore
severely underutilized.
Even the busiest ports are able to
operate at full capacity less than 35 percent of the
time.
The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was established for port improvements,
and WRDA increases the amount of these funds available for needed
dredging.
My amendment to the recent Senate budget resolution
reiterated the importance of using Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund revenues
for their intended purpose.
Without proper navigation channels,
vessels with U.S. goods cannot get to market, driving up costs.
As we saw with recent labor disputes on the West Coast, port
disruptions can cost billions of dollars and threaten tens of thousands of
jobs.
With so many benefits at stake
from higher wages to
more affordable goods
trade opportunities should not be missed.
Americas future prosperity depends on keeping commerce vibrant and
upholding our proud reputation as the best place in the world to do
business.
