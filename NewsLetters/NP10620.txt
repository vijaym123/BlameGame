7th DISTRICT
April 11, 2014
Dear
Friends:
Yesterday, the House
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, of which I am a senior Member
with Chairman Darrell Issa, passed a resolution to hold Lois Lerner,
former Director for Exempt Organizations at the IRS, in contempt of
Congress. Our vote holds her accountable to explain the role she played
in the political targeting of conservative organizations. This
resolution will now be sent to the floor for a vote by the full House of
Representatives. If Ms. Lerner is ultimately found in contempt of Congress,
she could face a fine or penalty under
law.
Rep John Mica (FL07) statement at House
Oversight
and Government Reform Hearing
The U.S. House
Committee on Ways and Means voted on Wednesday, April 9th to criminally refer
Ms. Lerner to the Department of Justice for prosecution after the
Committee believed she was dishonest with Congressional investigators and
may have released confidential tax
information.
In May 2013 and in March 2014, Lois Lerner appeared
before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and each time
took the Fifth Amendment. To date, 39 witnesses have been interviewed
and nearly all of them pointed to Ms. Lerner as responsible for
coordinating this effort to have the IRS target conservative groups. The IRS
continues to refuse to produce key documents of Ms. Lerner and other
top IRS officials.
I
believe that Ms. Lerners actions were a blatant attempt to gag and hogtie
conservative groups and further, a Broadway-like production to divert
responsibility to Cincinnati's lower level IRS staff prior to the
issuance of the IRS Inspector Generals report on March 14, 2013. Although
she was given the opportunity to testify, she has refused multiple
times and her noncompliance continues to this
day.
Our panel, which is the primary investigative Committee
in Congress, has the obligation, on behalf of the American people, to
hold federal public officials responsible. Please be assured that we
will continue to pursue this and hold all those accountable for
improper actions by the IRS.
Most
respectfully,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
