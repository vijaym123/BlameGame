Marching for Justice
Friends,
Earlier this week, we paused to remember the man who, fifty years ago, led Americans of every age, color and creed on a historic march on Washington in his quest for equality and justice for all. Today in Washington, hundreds of thousands will gather for another march for equality and justice: the March for Life.
This diverse group of Americans have been gathering on the National Mall for the last 40 years on the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court abortion ruling. This year, protesters will continue to stand up for equal protection for the unborn, encourage courageous mothers to choose life, and advocate for adoption. They will also speak out against ObamaCare's contraception mandate.
As a father of three, I feel strongly about these issues, and I know many of you do as well. In fact, more than one hundred local activists and youth with the Biloxi Diocese will be attending today's rally. While you may not be able to join them in person, you can learn more about the movement and watch highlights from previous rallies by clicking the photo below.
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
