Dear Friend,
I led several efforts this week to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse
within the bloated federal bureaucracy. Specifically, I wrote five
letters to the Committee on Appropriations requesting that they target
precise areas of waste and abuse that occurred previously in order to
prohibit their reoccurrence.
For starters, members of Congress shouldn't be able to fly first class
on the taxpayer's dime, which is why the first letter
I wrote this week requested that loophole be closed. It's absolutely
wasteful and completely unacceptable that members of Congress -
servants of the people - are currently allowed to fly first class using
hard-earned taxpayer money, especially at a time when our ballooning
national debt threatens the fiscal security of generations to come.

The second letter
I wrote this week dealt with scrims, which are large
canvases that cover scaffolding in order to hide ongoing repair work on
buildings. The language in that letter would prohibit federal funds
from being used for scrims with wasteful and unnecessary photos printed
on them. The Supreme Court's faade was recently repaired and a scrim
with a life-size photograph of the Court printed on it was wrapped
around the scaffolding. Hard-working taxpayers paid $139,000 total for
that scrim, with $37,000 alone going towards the printing of the
full-size photographic image.

was printed to hide scaffolding; photo courtesy of

The language in my third letter
would
prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from giving bonuses to
its senior executives. As of December 2013, almost 400,000 veterans
were still trapped in the VA's backlog of claims older than 125 days.
Some have been waiting to get their claims processed for years. Even
though the VA has failed to process claims in a timely manner, senior
executives have continued to receive bonuses. The VA should focus their
efforts on services for our veterans and reducing the backlog, not
rewarding under-performing bureaucrats.
One of my top priorities is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse within
the bloated federal bureaucracy. The practice of good governance
requires us to periodically evaluate federal programs so that we can
make sure they are necessary, efficient and constitutional. You deserve
accountability from your government and oversight on how it spends your
money. That's why I've led these efforts this week and why I will
continue to do so. Click HERE
to read about my
other efforts to cut waste, fraud and abuse this week.
Fighting for Arizona Jobs
I also led an effort this week to bring 6,500 jobs to Arizona. I wrote
a letter
to Tesla's CEO, Elon
Musk, asking that he locate the company's proposed Gigafactory in
Arizona. Arizona's entire House delegation joined me in this letter.
Such overwhelming bipartisan support by the Arizona delegation
demonstrates that, when it's crucial to Arizona, the delegation can act
as a team to get things done.
At every level of government, we've worked hard to create one of the
best business environments in the country by removing obstacles that
stifle job creation and economic growth. I will continue fighting to
bring high-quality, good-paying jobs to Arizona. Click HERE

What's on the Horizon?
I enjoyed my interview with Ted Simons on Channel 8's Arizona Horizon
on Wednesday night. We discussed pressing issues in Congress, from
cutting waste, fraud and abuse to the situation in Ukraine. Click HERE
or below to watch it.
No Welfare for Weed
I wrote an op-ed this week for the Prescott Daily Courier about my new
legislation, the No Welfare for Weed Act. People shouldn't be able to
get high using hard-earned taxpayer money. The sole purpose of this
bill is to prohibit marijuana from being purchased with federal welfare
benefits. Federal welfare programs are meant to provide subsidies for
food and other basic living essentials for the neediest families and
this bill protects those programs so that they will be available for
the people who actually need them. Click HERE
to read the op-ed.
Long Past Time to Resign
>From Fast & Furious to his speech telling state attorneys general not
to enforce laws they disagree with, Attorney General Eric Holder's list
of transgressions is long. It's long past time for him to resign.
Lawless Administration
The federal government is out of control. We have a lawless Justice

Dear
Friend,
I
led
several efforts
this
week to
eliminate
waste,
fraud
and

within
the bloated
federal
bureaucracy.
Specifically,
I

letters
to

which
is why
the

week
requested
that

It's
absolutely
wasteful
and
completely
unacceptable
that
members
of
Congress
-
servants
of
the
people
-
are
currently
allowed
to
fly
first
class
using
hard-earned
taxpayer
money,
especially
at
a
time

our

week
dealt

which
are

that

The
language
in
that

would
prohibit
federal

from
being
used
for
scrims
with

The
Supreme
Court's
fa&#231;ade
was recently
repaired
and
a
scrim
with
a
life-size photograph of
the
Court
printed
on
it was
wrapped
around
the
scaffolding.
Hard-working
taxpayers
paid
$139,000
total
for
that
scrim,
with
$37,000
alone
going
towards
the
printing
of
the
full-size
photographic
image.

The
language
in my third
letter
would
prohibit
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
from
giving bonuses to
its senior
executives.
As
of
December
2013,
almost
400,000
veterans
were
still
trapped
in
the
VA&#8217;s
backlog
of
claims
older
than
125
days.
Some
have
been
waiting
to
get
their
claims
processed
for
years.
Even
though
the
VA
has
failed
to
process
claims
in
a
timely
manner,
senior
executives
have
continued
to
receive
bonuses.
The
VA
should
focus
their
efforts
on
services
for
our
veterans
and
reducing
the
backlog,
not
rewarding
under-performing
bureaucrats.
One
of
my
top
priorities
is
eliminating
waste,
fraud
and
abuse
within
the
bloated
federal
bureaucracy.
The
practice
of
good
governance
requires
us
to periodically
evaluate federal

that

can make

they
are
necessary,
efficient
and constitutional.
You
deserve
accountability
from
your
government
and
oversight
on
how
it
spends your
money.
That's
why
I've
led
these
efforts
this
week
and
why
I
will
continue
to
do
so.

Fighting
for
Arizona
Jobs
I
also
led
an
effort
this
week
to
bring
6,500
jobs
to
Arizona.
I
wrote
a
letter
to
Tesla's
CEO,
Elon
Musk,
asking
that
he
locate
the
company's
proposed
Gigafactory
in
Arizona. Arizona's
entire House
delegation joined
me
in
this
letter.
Such
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
by
the
Arizona
delegation
demonstrates
that,
when
it's
crucial
to
Arizona,
the
delegation
can
act
as
a
team
to
get
things
done.
At
every
level
of
government,
we've
worked
hard
to
create
one
of
the
best
business
environments
in
the
country
by
removing
obstacles
that
stifle
job
creation
and
economic
growth.
