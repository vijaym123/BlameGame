Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you several updates during my work week in Washington, D.C.
Webb County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Seminar
The Affordable Care Act is about allowing Americans to take personal responsibility for the costs of their health care as well as providing universal access to quality and affordable health insurance.
The 28 th
District includes counties that have the highest rate of uninsured Americans in the country. This is why I hosted a Health Insurance Marketplace Community Seminar today for Webb and La Salle Counties at Laredo Community College with local agencies and organizations.
Congressman Cuellar announces the Webb County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop with (L:R) Laredo Community College President, Dr. Juan L. Maldonado, City of Laredo Health Department Director Dr. Hector Gonzalez, and Executive Director of the Mid Rio Grande Border Area Health Education Center, Julie Bazan.
I would like to thank the organizations that worked to make this event possible:
Laredo Community College
City of Laredo Health Department
Webb County Indigent Health Services
Enroll America
Young Invincibles
Doctors Hospital of Laredo
Gateway Community Health Center
Mercy Ministries of Laredo
Laredo Medical Center
Centro Aztlan
Texas A&amp;M International University
UT Health Science Center at San Antonio
United Independent School District
Laredo Independent School District
Webb Consolidated School District
Schools also have a vital role to play in ensuring that Americans receive accurate information about the Affordable Care Act and understand how it affects them. From pre-school to high school, students are better prepared to succeed when they have the health care services they need. This week, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services provided
10 ways
schools can help to promote new health insurance opportunities .

Ensuring Federal Resources Address Pressing Local Needs
One of my most important concerns is to improve the economy and quality of life of South Texans. For that reason, attracting more federal funds to our district and region has been a top priority during my tenure in Congress.
Federal grants
-
a term for funds awarded by the United States government - provide organizations with the ability carry out projects or provide services that they otherwise would not be able to perform.

Who do grants help?
Federal grants can be awarded to educational institutions, government organizations, public housing organizations, non-profits, small businesses, and even individuals.
Where can you find help to apply?
I invite you to visit my updated
grants resource website . On the website, grant seekers have access to information that will help them find grant opportunities and develop strong federal proposals.
I know that the federal grants process can be daunting. Therefore, Im happy to provide this site to facilitate attracting funds for projects that make our region one of best and most vibrant places to live in the nation.
If I can be of any additional help, please contact me

or call my office directly.
Outreach Events throughout District 28
My Chief of Staff, Cynthia Gaona, presented a certificate to former Hidalgo County Judge and former Administrator for the General Services Administration Greater Southwest Region, Juan "JD" Salinas and wife Rhonda Salinas on the opening of a new office for their business, Maroon Consultants.
Congratulations, JD and Rhonda, and best of luck!

Project South Texas Update
In 2015, a new university will be launched in Starr County as part of the unification of the University of Texas Pan-American and the University of Texas-Brownsville.
The new college will offer courses in criminal justice, in addition to the ones currently offered in education.
This merger will have a profound economic impact on the Rio Grande Valley and I applaud the efforts of both university systems to move the project forward.
Last night, my Starr County Outreach Coordinator, Nichole Hernandez, joined UTPA President Robert Nelsen and community leaders from across the Rio Grande Valley to update alumni of both schools about the status of the merger.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Meeting
In the previous week, my staff, Alexis Gallegos and Nichole Hernandez, met with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Harlingen Field Office Director, Antonio Lopez and Congressional Liaison, Laura Zepeda, to discuss updates on the USCIS process.
I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Lopez and Mrs. Zepeda for their collaborative effort in resolving USCIS's pending matters throughout the Rio Grande Valley.
