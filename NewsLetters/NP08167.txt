Celebrating our National Independence
Dear Friend:
This Friday, we join together with family, friends, and neighbors in celebration of Independence Day and the enduring power of the principles upon which our great nation was founded:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
It is a time for celebration and partaking in time-honored American traditions with our loved ones
watching the community parade, spending an afternoon at the ballpark, relaxing at the lake, barbequing in the backyard, or sitting on a blanket under a breathtaking fireworks display. They are the experiences that are passed down from one generation to the next, creating memories that will be cherished a lifetime. And no matter how we celebrate, we are reminded that we are all united as one because we are Americans.
As we celebrate the 238 th
anniversary of our independence, we also continue to keep in mind the heroic sacrifices made by the brave members of our Armed Forces, our veterans, and their families.
We are so proud of their service to keep our nation safe and secure.
For those actively deployed, we pray for their safety and await their return home.
We also owe it to our veterans to ensure that they receive the best resources and quality care when they return home. We will never forget that the freedoms and security we all enjoy come from those who serve.
Wishing you and your loved ones a safe and happy Independence Day. May God continue to bless the United States of America.
God bless,
Fred Upton
