Judiciary Committee Approves
USA FREEDOM
Act
After months of
oversight and collaboration between members from both sides of the aisle, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation to address concerns
surrounding our nation&rsquo;s intelligence-gathering programs this week. The bipartisan
USA FREEDOM Act
(H.R. 3361), which was unanimously approved by
a vote of 32-0, would reform certain national security programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA, over which the
Judiciary Committee has primary jurisdiction.
For nearly a year, the Judiciary Committee has examined our nation&rsquo;s intelligence-gathering programs operated under
FISA. We have found a solution that includes real protections for Americans&rsquo; civil liberties, robust oversight, and additional transparency. The
strong, bipartisan vote by the House Judiciary Committee takes us one step closer to ending the government's bulk collection of data once and for all.

House Approves Select Committee on Benghazi
Since the deadly terrorist attack in
Benghazi
nearly 20 months ago, the American people have asked for
the truth. Truth about what really happened, truth about events leading up to the attack, and truth about the Obama Administration&rsquo;s actions in
the aftermath. In the search for more answers, Congress has actively investigated this attack, reviewing hundreds of pages of documents, conducting
interviews, and holding congressional hearings. However, the Administration&rsquo;s continued stonewalling, coupled with new revelations of withheld
documents, has made it clear that the next appropriate step in this investigation is a Select Committee to focus solely on this issue. The American
people have waited for answers far too long.
China Waives Virginia Poultry
Ban
Good news for the Virginia poultry industry! China recently decided to lift the ban on
imports of Virginia poultry and poultry products. Agriculture is the largest industry in Virginia and employs thousands of workers in the Sixth
District alone. China&rsquo;s reversal of the ban is long overdue. Since the inception of the ban in July 2007, I have pressured China to reconsider
this policy that has cost the Commonwealth millions of dollars in lost export opportunities and countless jobs across the industry. American
agriculture is dependent on access to global markets and a vibrant trade policy. I hope that lifting this ban will help the Commonwealth to build
additional trade opportunities for more of Virginia&rsquo;s finest products. Happy Mother's Day to my wife, Maryellen, and all of the mothers,
grandmothers, and women who have shaped our lives!
