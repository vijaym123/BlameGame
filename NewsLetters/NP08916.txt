Senator Johnson Introduces Budget Transparency
Bill
On Thursday, Sen. Johnson introduced the
Truth in Obamacare Accounting Act that would require the Congressional
Budget Office to provide, on an ongoing basis, a full and complete
accounting of the costs and revenues associated with Obamacare. He
initially proposed this in March 2013 as an amendment in the Senate Budget
Committee that was adopted with bipartisan support and included in the
budget that passed the Senate on March 23, 2013. Read

Senator Johnson Comments on General Shinseki
Resignation
"Although I have never met
Gen. Shinseki, his many honors and support within the military and
veteran communities lead me to believe he is an honorable man.
But
he was tasked with an almost impossible mission.
As far as I am
concerned, his resignation as secretary of Veterans Affairs was a
decision made appropriately between him and President Obama." Read

Ron's Blog
Does Clinton actually believe her own
book?
Hillary Clinton is still trying to
litigate the low point of her failed tenure as Secretary of State, the
debacle in Benghazi, this time through a forthcoming
book.
According to an article in Politico, which was
given a sneak peek, Clinton devotes an entire chapter to spinning her
dereliction of duty in Benghazi. She addresses her infamous loss of
temper in a Senate hearing, one prompted by my question about why she
and her staff apparently didnt bother figuring out the truth about what
resulted in the fatal attack on our diplomats before telling the
American people a falsehood... Read more
