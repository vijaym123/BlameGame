Dear Friend:
During the month of June, we celebrate LGBT Americans - and reflect on the progress we have made and the challenges we still face in achieving full equality for all Americans.
Just in the last year alone, it is truly amazing to think about the advances made in the fight for marriage equality. I cannot think of a year that brought more rapid progress in our ongoing struggle for justice and equality.
Many of us will never forget the day the U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate Proposition 8 and struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. One of my proudest votes as a U.S. Senator was being one of only 14 to oppose DOMA in 1996, and I was overjoyed when this discriminatory law was finally gutted by the Court.
That extraordinary milestone last June brought our laws closer to our nation's ideals, but the journey is far from over.
The Obama Administration has been able to swiftly extend family and spousal benefits in areas such as immigration, federal taxation, and Social Security, but we cannot rest until all legally married couples have equal access to federal benefits regardless of where they live. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex couples to marry, but we cannot rest until marriage equality is the law of the land nationwide. We have made immeasurable progress toward eradicating discrimination, but we cannot and will not rest until all of our brothers and sisters are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
