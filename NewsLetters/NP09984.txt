Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
I have often said that education has been the
great equalizer in my life. As a young man growing up in Searchlight,
I knew my future depended on getting a quality education. My parents
supported me in my school work, but they did not have the academic
background to do much else. If not for teachers like Mike O Callaghan
who took an active interest in my development, I would not be where I am
today.
I appreciate and admire Nevadas teachers for the
impact they have on our children and the future of our state. In the
wake of crippling state budget cuts and increasing class sizes, Nevadas
teachers have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide
quality instruction for the future leaders of our state. I understand the
role teachers play, and to help them improve student performance, I
will continue working to help our education system have the resources it
needs to recruit teachers, improve training, reward effectiveness, and
embrace innovation.
Thank you for taking the time to read
this email. For information on my work on behalf of Nevada or to
