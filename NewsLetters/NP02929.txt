Recent
reports
of an outbreak of over 100 cases of the measles across the United States have
sparked controversy
over whether measles vaccines should be mandatory by law, or whether parents should retain the choice to vaccinate their young children against infectious diseases, like the measles.
During 2014, the United States experienced the greatest number of cases since the measles virus was declared to be eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. Many have linked the growing number of cases, as well as the current outbreak, to a decline in vaccination levels. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the White House have
urged
parents to vaccinate themselves and their children against the virus, renewing the debate over how much discretion parents should have over the vaccination of their children for highly contagious diseases.
Proponents argue that mandatory vaccinations against the measles or other infectious diseases are necessary for public health and safety, since unvaccinated children put others at risk. Currently, all 50 states have
laws
in place requiring certain vaccinations for students.
Those who oppose making vaccines mandatory believe that it is a parents prerogative to maintain a measure of discretion over the choice to vaccinate their child, and, under current law, many states grant certain religious and philosophical exemptions for vaccinations on the grounds of personal, moral, or other beliefs.
