Putting Families First
There are many pressing issues that
deserve our attention and require action
so many in fact that it
can sometimes be difficult to keep them straight.
But as I
see it there is
one
issue
one challenge facing the American
people today
that rises above the rest in its complexity, its
magnitude, and the reach of its consequences. Directly or indirectly it affects
nearly every other public issue you can think of, and should
therefore be placed squarely at the center of our reform
agenda.
That issue is the family
its increasing importance and its declining
stability
and I believe it may be the single defining challenge of
our time.
The family is the first and most important
institution of our society
and the foundation of American
exceptionalism.
If the conservative movement
and the new majority in the
114 th
Congress
truly want to be pro-growth and
pro-opportunity, our agenda must first and foremost be
pro-family .
The American family is always changing, but our nations dependence
on the family never will. Families are what make us good and make us
great.
The heart of American exceptionalism is not bankers
in a boardroom or politicians at a podium, but parents helping their
kids with homework after dinner at the kitchen table. In the battle of
ideas, its easy to forget
what
were really fighting for
and
who .
Washington too often forgets the family. We
forget that economic growth and a strong national defense are not ends
in themselves, but the means to the happiness of the
people.
The real work of America is not the projection of power or the
accumulation of wealth, but the humble heroism of story time, soccer games,
and visits to grandmas.
We must remember that the most
audacious entrepreneurs in America are not the high-tech CEOs in Silicon
Valley... theyre a young couple at an altar, saying I
do.
And the most important investments in our nations future are not
issued on Wall Street... but are sleeping in their mothers arms at the
maternity unit of their local hospital.
Building a new
conservative agenda of reform around these moms and dads and kids
remembering Americas forgotten families
is the path to restoring the
greatness of our nation.
I delivered a speech
last week to outline several of the proposals
that could remove
the stresses put on the family.
Many of these stresses are the
product of sclerotic government policies that are imposed on the American
people by politicians who respond to change by doubling down on
status quo policies we already know dont work.
This is
not how a government
of ,
by , and
for
the people is
supposed to conduct itself. Our economy and society are constantly
changing. The governments job
isnt
to micromanage or resist
those changes, but to remove any barriers facing the American people as
they adapt to them.
You can read the
rest
of the speech here .
I look forward to discussing these ideas
and others in my first Tele-townhall of the new year on Wednesday,
January 21 at 7:00 p.m. MT.
