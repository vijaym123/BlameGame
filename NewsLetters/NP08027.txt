The Scalise
Capitol Report
Friday, July 4,
2014
Today we celebrate the birth of the United
States of America. When our Founding Fathers declared their
independence in 1776, they risked their fortunes and their sacred honor in the
hope that they could create a different kind of nation where freedom and
liberty would be granted to all, not from men but from God, and
unlimited opportunity would be our birthright. Despite all of our current
challenges, America is still the greatest nation in the history of the
world.
Lets reflect upon
the freedoms which our great nation was founded as we proudly
celebrate our independence. When we gather with family and friends, around the
grill, under the fireworks, and in our homes, we remember the
countless struggles and obstacles that our nation has overcome to fulfill
those dreams and promises of our Founding
Fathers.
Words cannot express how truly blessed we are to
live in the greatest nation in the world.
Jennifer and I wish you and your family a safe and
meaningful Fourth of July as you celebrate 238 years of our nation's
independence!
God bless you and God bless America,
Steve
