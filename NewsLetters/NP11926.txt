I wanted to share with you a recent appearance I did on Bloomberg News, discussing the damage to our national security done by further reckless cuts to our military. There is no more important responsibility than ensuring that our men and women in uniform receive every resource available to execute their missions.

HASC Leaders Speak Out on Obama Budget to Shrink Military to Pre-WWII Levels
Chairman McKeon and Rep. Forbes warn against harmful budget cuts to national security
"This is not new news. I've been saying this for three years. The cuts we established in the budget agreement, we cut 487 billion out of defense, with sequestration we cut another 500 billion... This is the result of cutting one trillion dollars out of our defense. We've done this before - never as steep and never during wartime."
- Chairman Buck McKeon (R-CA) on The Kelly File on Fox News. Video

"We simply can't do what we need to do in the world with the numbers we have now... Nobody in the Pentagon has done the analysis and said this is the force structure we need.. If you simply ask what do we need to defend the United States of America, we can never justify these budget numbers we have right now."
- Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) on Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg TV. Video
