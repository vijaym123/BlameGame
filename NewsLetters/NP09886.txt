Dear Friend,
On Mother's Day we celebrate the glory of our moms who give us the gift
of unconditional love every day. On this occasion they deserve lots of
hugs and beautiful flowers. With that said, what moms really want is
equal pay for women.
Times Are Changing
Things have changed a great deal over the decades - one major
difference is that a growing number of women are the main bread winners
of the family. Fifty years ago, about half of all married mothers were
"stay-at-home" moms. Today, only one-fifth of married moms stay at
home, and a greater share of all mothers are unmarried and in the labor
force.
Unfortunately, our nation's policies have not evolved over the last
several decades to reflect this new reality.
Nationally, women still
earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by their male colleagues.
These disparities persist across all occupations and educational
levels. The wage gap costs women from $400,000 to $2 million in lost
wages over their careers, the Institute of Women's Policy Research
found.
According to The National Partnership for Women and Families, a woman
in Florida is paid an average of $34,202 per year for full time work,
while a man is paid $40,889.
The gap in Florida is less than it is
nationally (84 cents for every dollar), but it is still a substantial
difference in salary.
It's All About Family
Equal pay is not simply a women's issue - it's a family issue. Families
increasingly rely on women's wages to make ends meet.
When women bring
home less money each day, it means they have less for the everyday
needs of their families - groceries, rent, child care, doctors' visits.
What Can Be Done?
The Paycheck Fairness Act would provide effective remedies to women who
are not being paid equal wages for doing the same work.
It would also
prohibit companies from retaliating against workers who discuss salary
information. Finally, the law would require employers to prove any pay
discrepancies among workers are the result of factors unrelated to
gender.
If the wage gap was eliminated, on average, a working woman in Florida
would have enough money for approximately:
*	56 more weeks of food for her family
*	Five more months of mortgage and utilities payments
*	Seven more months of rent
*	Over 1,900 additional gallons of gas
All Women Are Affected
This should be a bipartisan issue - it affects women no matter their
beliefs. The fact that it is 2014 and we are still dealing with this
issue is embarrassing.
While we honor our mothers today, Congress must act soon to honor them
on each and every work day as well.
Fairness is the best gift we can
give to our hard-working mothers in the workplace.

Resources Date,
2013 Dear
Friend,
On
Mother&#8217;s
Day
we
celebrate
the
glory
of
our
moms
who
give
us
the
gift
of
unconditional
love
every
day. On
this
occasion
they
deserve
lots
of
hugs
and
beautiful flowers.
With
that
said,
what
moms
really
want
is
equal
pay
for
women.
Times
Are
Changing
Things
have
changed
a
great
deal
over
the
decades
-
one
major
difference
is
that
a
growing
number
of
women
are
the
main
bread
winners
of
the
family.
Fifty
years
ago,
about
half
of
all
married
mothers
were
&#8220;stay-at-home&#8221;
moms.
Today,
only
one-fifth
of
married
moms
stay
at
home,
and
a
greater
share
of
all
mothers
are
unmarried
and
in
the
labor
force.
Unfortunately,
our
nation&#8217;s
policies
have
not
evolved
over
the
last
several
decades
to
reflect
this
new
reality.
Nationally,
women
still
earn
only
77
cents
for
every
dollar
earned
by
their
male
colleagues.
These
disparities
persist
across
all
occupations
and
educational
levels.
The
wage
gap
costs
women
from
$400,000
to
$2
million
in
lost
wages
over
their
careers,
the
Institute
of
Women&#8217;s
Policy
Research
found.
According
to
The
National
Partnership
for
Women
and
Families,
a
woman
in
Florida
is
paid
an
average
of
$34,202
per
year
for
full
time
work,
while
a
man
is
paid
$40,889.
The
gap
in
Florida
is
less
than
it
is
nationally
(84
cents
for
every
dollar),
but
it
is
still
a
substantial
difference
in
salary.
It&#8217;s
All
About
Family
Equal
pay
is
not
simply
a
women&#8217;s
issue
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
a
family
issue.
Families
increasingly
rely
on
women&#8217;s
wages
to
make
ends
meet.
When
women
bring
home
less
money
each
day,
it
means
they
have
less
for
the
everyday
needs
of
their
families
&#8211;
groceries,
rent,
child
care,
doctors&#8217;
visits.
What
Can
Be
Done?
The
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
would
provide
effective
remedies
to
women
who
are
not
being
paid
equal
wages
for
doing
the
same
work.
It
would
also
prohibit
companies
from
retaliating
against
workers
who
discuss
salary
information.
Finally,
the
law
would
require
employers
to
prove
any
pay
discrepancies
among
workers
are
the
result
of
factors
unrelated
to
gender.
If
the
wage
gap
was
eliminated,
on
average,
a
working
woman
in
Florida
would
have
enough
money
for
approximately: 56
more
weeks
of
food
for
her
family Five
more
months
of
mortgage
and
utilities
payments Seven
more
months
of
rent Over
1,900
additional
gallons
of
gas
All
Women
Are
Affected
This
should
be
a
bipartisan
issue
&#8211;
it
affects
women
no
matter
their
beliefs.
The
fact
that
it
is
2014
and
we
are
still
dealing
with
this
issue
is
embarrassing. While
we
honor
our
mothers
today,
Congress
must
act
soon
to
honor
them
on
each
and
every
work
day
as
well.
Fairness
is
the
best
gift
we
can
give
to
our
hard-working
mothers
in
the
workplace.
