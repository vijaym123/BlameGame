Helping
American Families Save for Higher
Education
Dear Friend,
As students across Virginias
Fifth District have settled into the school
routine, many high school seniors are
preparing to apply for college. These
preparations include more than achieving
good grades and completing applications.
The rising cost of higher education
requires families to start planning for
college years in advance, especially to pay
for ever increasing tuition and other
costs.
Over the past 36 years, the cost of a
higher education
has
increased 13 fold . That means college
tuition expenses have jumped
1,225%
since 1978 ; thats four times the
rate of inflation and food costs.
Ensuring that young adults have access
to higher education means they will be able
to help build a stronger economy. A
well-educated, well-trained workforce is
essential to maintaining a competitive
economy. Therefore, it is vital that
hardworking American families have access
to financial planning programs that help
them prepare for the rapidly rising costs
of college.
Virginia, along with several other
states throughout the country, offers 529
plans, which are innovative avenues for
families to plan for the costs of their
childrens higher education over
time. These plans, including the prepaid
plans, provide tax-advantaged options, but
because of their classification, they are
unable to invest in ways to maximize
returns and meet the obligations to those
who participate in their plans.
I
introduced
H.R. 3029,
the
College Savings Enhancement Act , a
bipartisan bill to update current laws to
allow state-run prepaid college savings
plans the freedom to invest more broadly,
enhancing their ability to meet their
obligations to the families purchasing
their plans. This bipartisan legislation
provides a commonsense update to our laws,
allowing families who invest in these
prepaid college savings plans to get the
most return on their investments.
This is not the only bill dedicated to
making higher education more accessible. Of
the hundreds of House-passed bills, three
directly pertain to improving access to our
nation's higher education system. From
providing students new opportunities to
receive a quality education in a way that
best serves their financial needs, to
helping students gain access to the facts
they need to make an informed decision
about their education, to streamlining
existing education tax credits to make it
easier for families to plan, save, and
invest in education, the House has passed
legislation aimed at helping create
opportunities for Americans to further
their education. We have passed these
bills, but they cannot provide greater
opportunities to deserving Americans until
the Senate acts.
Providing information and opportunities
for Fifth District families to save and
plan for higher education expenses are
critical to ensuring individuals the
ability to further their education. I look
forward to the Financial Services
Committees consideration of
H.R.
3029
and pursuing new avenues to ensure
that families are able to efficiently
invest in their childrens
futures.
