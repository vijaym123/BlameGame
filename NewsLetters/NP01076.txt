Greetings,
Our Founding Fathers envisioned an America
that stood as a beacon of hope for the world, one
that would enable all to pursue happiness.
President Reagan described our great nation as a
shining city on a hill, a nod to one of the
leading founders of Americas first major
settlement. Innovative minds and entrepreneurial
spirits gathered to help our nation become an
economic powerhouse.
Thomas Jefferson, whose memorial is pictured
here during Aprils Cherry Blossom
Festival, enshrined the pursuit of happiness as
the inalienable right of all people
I strive every day to advance legislation that
upholds and strengthens this great tradition.
Ours is a nation that seeks out challenges and
arrives at real solutions based on consensus and
hard work. And the news shows that the Senate is
finally on track to provide those solutions. The
Wall
Street Journal noticed that "signs of comity are
mounting in the Senate .
US News and World Report
reports that
Congress
really is working more . The Washington
Post has declared,
it
is obvious that the Senate is working better than
it has in recent years .
Trade Promotion AuthorityCreating
Jobs Through Trade
Iworked with SenatorRon Wyden and
House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan,
to
develop a historic deal
establishing Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation that will
boost American exports, creating new economic
opportunities and better jobs around the
country.
This legislation willbe a particular
boon forUtahseconomy.
According to the Department of Commerces
International Trade Administration, Utah exported
$12.3 billion worth of exports in 2014, with most
recent data showing that
goods exports supported an estimated 61,000
Utah jobs . The boost in exports that will
come as a result of TPAis likely to create
new jobs and economic opportunities for Utah
entrepreneurs, manufacturers, farmers, and
ranchers.
The President and many of my Democrat and
Republican colleagues have voiced support for our
efforts and I look forward to working with them
to address concerns and pass a strong bill with
broad, bipartisan support.The
Wall Street Journal wrotethat
the bill
deserves
Congresss approval .
National Review
explained the
legislation would give Congress real leverage
over the executive, urging conservatives
to support it. You can watch my interviews
with
ABC
4
and
Fox
13 to learn more about how TPA will
benefit Utah.
Fixing Medicares Sustainable Growth
RateA Fiscally-Responsible Down Payment
on Entitlement Reform
Weve faced a long-term problem of
Medicares Sustainable Growth Rate, an
outdated formula that threatened to cut payments
for doctors treating patients under Medicare.
Time after time, Congress kicked the can down the
road by passing Doc Fixes,
temporary measures that couldnt last and
that threatened the certainty both doctors and
patients need.
No more. As Chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, I have fought for lasting reforms of
our crucial entitlement programs. We
just
passed a landmark compromise
based on a bill
that I introduced in 2013 with Senator Max
Baucus. It was deemed a lost cause at the
time,because the President had repeatedly
stated that he would not consider any changes to
our safety-net programs without massive tax
hikes. This agreement is, by all accounts, a
tremendous win.
I
spoke
on the Senate Floor about how this
is the first real entitlement reform in years,
and it marks the first step toward putting
Medicare on sound fiscal footing for future
generations.I look forward to using this as
a springboard to more ambitious reform in the
future.
As Senate President Pro Tempore,I got
to sign our successful new reform of
Medicare
High-Skilled Immigration
Immigrant entrepreneurs have started
successful companies in the United States,
creating jobs and economic opportunities in our
communities. They demonstrate the very notion
that ours is a land of opportunity.
Unfortunately, many of these entrepreneurs and
their businesses have run into trouble because of
our antiquated visa system. The brilliant
students that graduate from our universities
every year cant even stay to help our
economy grow, simply because they were born
elsewhere. This isnt an approach that will
make America strong.
I met with some of these entrepreneurs who
were visiting Washington to meet with legislators
about my Immigration Innovation, or
I-Squared, Act, a bill that would
spur innovation by modernizing our high-skilled
immigration system.
I was joined by 15 immigrant entrepreneurs
this week to discuss high-skilled immigration
reform
America needs to maintain its competitive
edge, and that means empowering the private
sector to grow. As chairman of the Senate
Republican High-Tech Task Force,Iled
a meeting between ten senators and the 30 CEOs
and senior executives who make up TechNet,
a preeminent bipartisan political network that
promotes the growth of technology-led innovation.
Among other important topicsincluding
patent trolls, trade,and tax reform
we discussed the urgent need for
high-skilled immigration reform.
John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, and Safra Catz,
CEO of Oracle, participated in our
discussion
You dont need to look far to find how
this legislation would help Utah. Consider
University of Utah s cutting-edge video game
design program. The Princeton Review has named
the program #1 in the nation, and it often places
graduates at Salt Lake Citys Disney
Interactive. According to the
Salt
Lake Tribune , 40 percent of the students
in this program are international.
We train and educate talented individuals from
around the world,butthenour
outdated immigration laws force them to leave,
taking their talents to our competitor nations.
Students like these should be able to stay in
Utah, create jobs, support our economy, and
enrich our state.
Weve made a great deal of progress this
month in strengthening Americas
prosperity. I will continue to push forward,
finding real solutions to the challenges we all
face.
Sincerely,
Orrin G. Hatch
