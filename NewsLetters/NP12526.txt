Udall, Heller Introduce Bill to Improve
Health Care for Rural Veterans
Rural Veterans Improvement Act would
improve access to care by expanding
transportation options, recruiting and
retaining doctors, and prioritizing
improvements at rural clinics
(Washington, D.C.)
Yesterday,
U.S. Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.)
and
Dean Heller (R-Nev.)
introduced a
bill to address some of the biggest
barriers to health care for veterans in
rural communities.
More than 6 million veterans, including
a third of all Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans, live in rural communities. But as
many as half of those veterans may be going
without care from the VA. Rural veterans
too often struggle to access quality care
because it isnt available locally.
For some, traveling to and from an
appointment can take all day. Veterans who
cant drive must rely on neighbors or
volunteers to get to appointments, and many
simply go without adequate care.
Udall and Hellers Rural
Veterans Improvement Act takes a
four-pronged approach to improve and help
veterans access care by:
-Enhancing mental health care options by
allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) to work with nonVA mental health
providers in rural communities.
-Building on the VAs
transportation program to ensure more
veterans living in rural areas have a way
to get to doctors' appointments.
-Creating programs and incentives to
attract and retain doctors and nurses to
rural VA health care facilities.
-Requiring the VA to conduct a full
assessment of its community-based
outpatient clinics (CBOCs) to determine
what improvements are needed and prioritize
those projects.
Ive met with veterans
across New Mexico, some of whom have to
drive four hours or more to get to a VA
hospital. Many rural veterans are also
frustrated with the lack of health care
options and the frequent turnover among
staff at their local clinics. Rural
veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan suffering
from TBI and PTSD also often dont
have adequate access to mental health care
in their communities,
Udall said.
"I'm pleased to join
Senator Heller in introducing this
bipartisan bill to help address these
challenges and enable veterans to get
better quality and access to care where and
when they need it.
Our brave men and women have
sacrificed a great deal to safeguard our
freedoms, and it is imperative that
Congress meets their needs, no matter where
they live. By guaranteeing availability of
mental health professionals, increasing
access to efficient transportation options,
and enhancing our rural VA facilities, we
can ensure rural veterans receive the same
level of care that veterans in urban areas
receive. It is an honor to partner with
Senator Udall in a bipartisan effort to
provide veterans with the benefits they
earned,
said Heller.
More detail on the bill's provisions
follows:
Mental Health Care Enhancement:
Too
many veterans are suffering from PTSD, TBI,
and other service connected mental health
issues without access to the care that they
deserve. Veterans who are not able to
access adequate mental health care are also
at a higher risk of committing suicide.
Many veterans do not respond to traditional
forms of therapy for their service
connected disability and options for
alternative and complementary medicine are
not widely available to veterans living in
rural and highly rural areas. This bill
address this gap in care by:
-Making fee-for-service available to
veterans suffering from PTSD, TBI, or other
service connected mental health issues
under certain conditions where treatment at
a clinic serving rural veterans is not
available or where treatment options such
as complementary or alternative medicine,
including traditional Native American
healing methods are not
available.
Improving Transportation in Rural
Areas:
For a veteran living in rural
areas, getting to appointments at larger
VHA medical facilities for more than basic
care can be a major logistical challenge.
Older veterans who are unable to travel
without support may put off needed
treatments because of the distance. The
bill attempts to address this issue by
building on the current grant program to
support veterans in highly rural areas.
It:
-Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to establish a grant program to
provide options to provide innovative
transportation options to veterans in rural
areas.
-Does not require matching funds for
grants up to $100,000 max.
Retaining and Training Health Care
Professionals:
Rural and highly rural
veterans struggle with high turnover among
the doctors and staff at rural clinics.
This bill addresses the issue of staff
retention by:
-Creating a pilot program that would
offer financial incentives to reduce
turnover among rural clinic staff.
-Working with university medical
programs to create curriculum for rural
health care training to better prepare
doctors and nurses for work in rural
communities.
-Streamlining the hiring of military
medical professionals into the Veterans
Health Care system.
Rural Veterans Affairs Facilities
Improvement:
To help prioritize repairs
and expansions, the bill would require a
full assessment of VA CBOCs. With tight
budgets, this will help save money and
improve care for vets.
-The bill also requires a report to
Congress on the feasibility and
advisability of expanding Polytrauma
Rehabilitation Centers or Polytrauma
Network sites, which treat victims of
multiple traumatic injuries, such as
serious head injuries and burns.
