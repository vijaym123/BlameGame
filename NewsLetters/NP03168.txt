Happy New Year! I hope that 2015 brings you and yours health, happiness and good fortune.
For me, the new year brings a new Congressional session and some legislative changes, including new committee assignments.
As many of you know, I have spent the last 12 years on the House Intelligence Committee
&#8211; which is a committee record &#8211; including the last four as the Ranking Member. The security of our nation will always be my passion as well as an important economic engine in our district. I look forward to continuing my leadership in the intelligence arena,
however, I will now be doing that from a seat on the Appropriations Committee.
As the committee that
allocates billions of federal dollars, this is good news for Maryland and for our community. I will now have a greater opportunity to weigh in on more domestic issues and encourage my colleagues in Congress to renew our focus on the basics of good government,
like quality schools, safe streets and more jobs.
Our country will continue to face economic challenges over the
next two years and all members of the Appropriations Committee share a tremendous responsibility to allocate precious tax dollars as efficiently as possible. This is a responsibility I take seriously.
Finally, my Timonium office
is hosting an Open House for community leaders in the Second District on April 25 from 10 a.m. until noon. If you are active within a community or homeowners association in the Second District, please join us and RSVP to Michael Baker at
