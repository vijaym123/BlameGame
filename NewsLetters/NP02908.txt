President Obama deserves our thanks.

Last month, Cheri urged President Obama to stand with seniors and reject cuts to Social Security in his new budget proposal. He heard our concerns. The President&rsquo;s new budget protects Social Security benefits for seniors in Illinois and around the country. Will you join us in thanking President Obama for protecting Social Security?
