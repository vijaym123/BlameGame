Congressman Lamborn Accepting Applications for the Congressional Leadership
Program
3/19/14
Dear
friend,
I am now accepting applications for this summers
Congressional Leadership Program (CLP) in Washington, D.C. The
program, now in its fifth year, offers college students and recent graduates
an opportunity to work in a Congressional office and experience
firsthand the heritage of our nations capital. To qualify, applicants must
be attending college or its equivalent and have strong ties to the
5 th
Congressional district.
CLP associates will be assigned challenging responsibilities in
a dynamic Congressional office, will receive training in current
legislative and political affairs and will grow in leadership skills.
Associates will participate in substantive legislative duties including,
but not limited to, attending congressional hearings, assisting in
policy research, engaging in constituent communication and participating
in media outreach.
For more
information on the program and how to apply, please click here or go to
my website at Lamborn.House.gov and look under Constituent
Services.
Please share this email with
any young person you know or who may be
interested.
It is an honor to serve you in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Doug
Lamborn
