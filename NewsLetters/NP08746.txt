Dear Friend,
Every day
we do not improve our outdated system of taxation, we put our country
at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. A more
transparent, modern, and simpler tax code would boost our economy and
increase confidence within our system.
A few weeks ago, I
sent out an e-newsletter asking constituents which tax breaks should stay
in the tax code, and which ones should be eliminated in an effort to
lower overall tax rates and modernize our outdated tax code. I
received hundreds of responses to that request, and I wanted to share the
results with you.
The following is a partial list of current
tax breaks, the amount of annual lost tax revenue that each tax break
represents, and the percentages of respondents who wanted to keep or
eliminate the tax break, listed from the most popular to the least
popular in my survey results:
