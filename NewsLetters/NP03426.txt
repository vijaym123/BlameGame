LEGISLATION
January 11, 2015
Dear David,
Tuesday
marked the beginning of the 114 th
Congress, and I was honored
and humbled to renew my commitment to serving Californias 1st
District in our nations Capitol.
This past week I spoke in the
House of Representatives at length regarding our priorities for the North
State as we head into the new Congress. We are blessed to have a
beautiful district with rich natural resources, and it is imperative that
we manage those resources we have been given wisely. In addition to
addressing our water crisis, I remain committed to fighting for policies
that represent our values and priorities, such as cutting federal
spending and reining in executive overreach. These measures are just the
beginning of what I hope we accomplish in this upcoming Congressional
session.
We have hit the ground running as we put forward
solutions Americans need now. Below are some of the immediate steps we
have taken in our first week. To learn what I am up to throughout the
week, please visit my
website.
and stay in touch
with me on
my Facebook
page as
well!
Sincerely,

Our immediate priority this past week was
alleviating the economic damage that Obamacare has inflicted upon small
businesses and American workers. I supported two common sense measures
to remove the ACAs regulatory burdens.
H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act of 2015 , would return the
legal definition of full-time employment to the traditional 40 hours
per week, removing the previous arbitrary definition that has
disproportionately harmed low-income workers by slashing their work and wages.
The second,
H.R. 22, the Hire More
Heroes Act , simply exempts veterans from Obamacares costly
employer mandate and allows more private sector employers the opportunity to
hire more of our nations qualified and well-trained heroes. Repealing
Obamacarein its totalityremains my priority. It harms our
businesses, provides subpar healthcare to Americans, and infringes on the
individual freedom and responsibility that defines our nation. While we
work to erase ObamaCare, these measures provide needed relief, but they
are just the beginning.
Rep. LaMalfa, joined by his family,
is sworn into his second term representing California's first district
as the 114th Congress begins on January 6th, 2015.

behavior, the researchers concluded monkeys share our unfounded belief in
winning and losing
streaks.
