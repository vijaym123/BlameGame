Rubio: It Is Time For Obama,
Administration To Level With
Taxpayers
On Wednesday, Marco testified at a House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee
hearing entitled, ObamaCare: Why the
Need for an Insurance Company
Bailout? Marco focused on provisions
of ObamaCare that are increasing premiums
for consumers outside of the exchanges and
putting taxpayers at risk for an uncapped
bailout of insurance companies
participating in ObamaCare over the next
three years.
Rubio: The bottom line is that
it is not right to allow a powerful
industry to use its influence here in
Washington to protect itself from the
consequences of ObamaCare. And it is not
right that hard working Americans are
forced to pay for it.

Rubio, Warren Introduce Legislation To
Protect Veterans From Financial Scams
Marco, along with Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-MA), introduced bipartisan
legislation that would help protect older
veterans from financial scams. The bill
directs the Department of Veterans Affairs
to work with other federal agencies and
states to crack down on scam artists who
are diverting federal funds intended to
support low-income older veterans. The
legislation was previously introduced by
Marco and Warren as an amendment to the
National Defense Authorization Act.
Our veterans have courageously
defended our country and protected our
freedoms, and they deserve the utmost
respect after their service,
said
Rubio. Thats why
it is necessary to stop older veterans
from being the target of scams and
predatory practices. These heroes deserve
better, and we will always appreciate
their brave service and
sacrifice.
Rubio Calls On Reid To Allow A Senate
Vote On Iran Sanctions
On Thursday, Marco called on Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to allow
a vote on imposing additional sanctions on
Iran for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
During a Senate floor speech, Rubio
expressed his concern about the
administrations deal with Iran and
the delay in Senate consideration of
additional sanctions, condemning
Reids unprecedented actions to block
a vote with such significant, long-term
implications for our nations
security.
It is ideal to reach
anegotiated solution with
Iran,but we have to be wise. We
haveto learn the lessons of
history,and we have to understand
humannature,
Rubio said . This
administration in Iran,this regime,
they want a nuclear weapon because it
gives themsupremacy in the region
and itmakes them, they believe,
immuneto outside pressure and
interference in their internal
affairs.They are headed for a
weapon. They are using these negotiations
to buy time.
The speech can be watched
here
.
In
a letter sent to
Reid
, Marco and 41 other Republican
senators highlighted the overwhelming
bipartisan support for legislation that
aims to prevent Iran from ever developing
nuclear weapons, while calling on Reid to
schedule a vote for the measure
immediately.

Constituent Casework Corner
Luis was diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic
Leukemia in September 2012.He needed
a stem cell transplant and his children
were tested, but did not match.They
checked the National and International
registries and no matches were
found.In addition, the process of
using his bone marrow, after being put
through a cleaning process, was not a
viable option. Since he exhausted all
options in Florida, his brother in Cuba was
tested and was found to be a viable match.
However, when the brother applied for a
visa, his application was denied by the
U.S. Interests Section. Consequently, Luis
contacted Senator Rubios office for
assistance. A member of the staff contacted
the agency and provided all the
documentation from the hospital with a
request that they reconsider the visa
application. Based on the dire medical
situation, they reviewed the application
and the visa the subsequently approved.
