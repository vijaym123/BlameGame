Our heads are still spinning. It finally happened.
The Senate advanced the Constitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United .
But tomorrow, Boehner&rsquo;s Tea Party House will vote.
If Boehner has his way, he will step in on behalf of the Koch Brothers and kill the bill. LET&rsquo;S SHOW BOEHNER THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT FOR SALE.
To do that, we need 25,000 grassroots donors to put pressure on
Citizens United -backing Republicans before the vote.
Do you want a handful of billionaires to control our political process?
