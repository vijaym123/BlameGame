Dear Friend,
After a year of dysfunction in Washington, some signs of progress
emerged as we approach the New Year.
As you likely recall, in October the federal government shut down, and
for 16 days, critical government resources were cut off for families
and businesses, while nearly 800,000 federal employees were furloughed.
But despite that gridlock of just a few months ago, the U.S. House of
Representatives last Thursday overwhelmingly passed a bi-partisan
budget agreement. I supported this budget compromise because it will
fund the government for the next two years and will help avert yet
another avoidable crisis.
This deal is far from perfect, but it does mitigate the
across-the-board sequester cuts that have been harming our economy and
hurting job creation. Perhaps most importantly, it provides businesses
across the nation with the level of certainty they have needed for
several years. That certainty will help our economy continue to grow as
our nation's businesses can now more confidently hire workers, secure
loans to expand, and develop the longer-term business plans they need
to succeed.
I remain deeply concerned that this budget deal fails to extend federal
unemployment insurance, leaving millions looking for work left out in
the cold. It is shameful that because of Congress' inaction, 1.3
million Americans will be cut off in the middle of the holidays, with
another 1.9 million cut off during the first half of next year.
That
is why I joined with 173 of my House Democratic colleagues last week in
calling on Speaker Boehner to address this looming expiration before we
adjourned for the year. Since that did not happen, I will continue to
push for an extension as we move into the next year.
As always I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up-to-date on the latest news from Washington and in the district.
Also, you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can
read my positions and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about the issues that matter
most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to share this email with
your friends, family, and neighbors so that they too can be a part of
this important dialogue.
Sincerely,
Diana DeGette

Contact Dear
Friend,
After
a
year
of
dysfunction
in
Washington,
some
signs
of
progress
emerged
as
we
approach
the
New
Year.
As
you
likely
recall,
in
October
the
federal
government
shut
down,
and
for
16
days,
critical
government
resources
were
cut
off
for
families
and
businesses,
while
nearly
800,000
federal
employees
were
furloughed.
But
despite
that
gridlock
of
just
a
few
months
ago,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
last
Thursday
overwhelmingly
passed
a
bi-partisan
budget
agreement.
I
supported
this
budget
compromise
because
it
will
fund
the
government
for
the
next
two
years
and
will
help
avert
yet
another
avoidable
crisis.
This
deal
is
far
from
perfect,
but
it
does
mitigate
the
across-the-board
sequester
cuts
that
have
been
harming
our
economy
and
hurting
job
creation.
Perhaps
most
importantly,
it
provides
businesses
across
the
nation
with
the
level
of
certainty
they
have
needed
for
several
years.
That
certainty
will
help
our
economy
continue
to
grow
as
our
nation&#8217;s
businesses
can
now
more
confidently
hire
workers,
secure
loans
to
expand,
and
develop
the
longer-term
business
plans
they
need
to
succeed.
I
remain
deeply
concerned
that
this
budget
deal
fails
to
extend
federal
unemployment
insurance,
leaving
millions
looking
for
work
left
out
in
the
cold.
It
is
shameful
that
because
of
Congress&#8217;
inaction,
1.3
million
Americans
will
be
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
the
holidays,
with
another
1.9
million
cut
off
during
the
first
half
of
next
year.
That
is
why
I
joined
with
173
of
my
House
Democratic
colleagues
last
week
in
calling
on
Speaker
Boehner
to
address
this
looming
expiration
before
we
adjourned
for
the
year.
Since
that
did
not
happen,
I
will
continue
to
push
for
an
extension
as
we
move
into
the
next
year.
As
always
I

you

me
