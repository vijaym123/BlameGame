Thank you for Joining Me:
Thank you to everyone who came to the "Coffee with Your Congressman"
event last Wednesday in Forsyth.
I thought we had a great discussion
on some of the most pressing issues facing our country today, and I was
happy to answer some of your questions on what I am doing in
Washington, D.C. on behalf of the Eighth Congressional District of
Georgia.
Eighth District Visits:
In addition to meeting with constituents, I had several great tours of
Eighth District businesses last week.
In Forsyth, I stopped by the
Truck Driver Institute, an industry leading training facility that has
served the area for over 15 years, and Encore Industries where they
make 1-5 gallon buckets.
I was also able to visit Hardy Farms in
Hawkinsville to learn about their custom racking process for roasted
and boiled peanuts.
Last Tuesday, I was honored to be a part of the groundbreaking ceremony
for the Georgia Military Academic Training Center.
The state of
Georgia, and the Eighth District in particular, contributes a great
deal to our national defense, and it is important to help our military
men and women with their transition in to the workforce after their
military careers.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
