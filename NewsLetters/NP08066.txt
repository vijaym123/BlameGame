Dear
Friends:
You will be pleased to learn that
significant progress has been made in getting the Veterans
Administration (VA) to commit to a decision on keeping the Baldwin Park VA Clinic
and vacant VA beds open for our
veterans.
After months of delay and with the help of VA Acting
Secretary Sloan Gibson, the VA has agreed to finalize a decision on the
future of that medical complex by Sept 1st. In a conversation today
with Region 8 Director Joleen Clark, meetings to plan the future use for
veterans medical services will commence this week. She has been
tasked with resolving the matter and is a proponent for reuse of the
valuable VA assets.

Thank you and all who have urged the VA to keep the clinic
open and fill the vacated 120-bed nursing care and 60-bed domiciliary
medical care units.
With my regards
and best wishes, I remain
Most
respectfully,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
