West Virginias Next Generation
of Leaders
On the 70 th
anniversary
of Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, I had the honor to visit Parkersburg
High School and congratulate three students who will join the Class of
2019 at our distinguished Military Service Academies.
Hannah
Hill of Parkersburg will attend the Merchant Marine Academy in the
fall.
Hunter Hill, Hannahs
sister, will head to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He will be
joining his sister, Madison, Class of 2016.
Nicholas Cheuvront will head off to Colorado to become a
Cadet at the Air Force Academy at the end of the summer.
One of the best parts of my job is
nominating candidates to our service academies. You can find the nomination
form on our webpage
here .
Helping Our Economy Take-Off
During a visit to
the Wheeling-Ohio Airport this week, I sat down with local aviation
leaders to discuss the future of the airport. The airport can be an
important job creator in the Wheeling area and there is a vital role for
further investment here.

What About Indoor Air Quality?
Last week, I
challenged my colleagues to ask about indoor air quality. Too often,
the EPA and environmentalists focus on closing coal power plants,
arguing it will make our air even cleaner. They even go so far as to say
power plants are causing asthma and other respiratory problems for
children.
But this is the wrong question. Why arent we worried
about our indoor air quality
where we spend most of our time? Watch

West Virginias World War Two Veterans
In
commemoration of V-E Day, the Charleston Daily Mail has a great piece
about our veterans and the services they still need. There is a special
need for volunteers to help these 90-year-olds reach the VA hospital.

On the National
Mall, the Arsenal of Democracy Flyover took place on Friday at noon.
The flyover included dozens of World War II aircraft flying in 15
historically sequenced warbird formations overhead. The formations
represented the Wars major battles, from Pearl Harbor through the final air
assault on Japan, and concluding with a missing man formation to
Taps.

Have a
great weekend,
