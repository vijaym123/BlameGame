Broun to Host Town Hall Meeting on Veterans Day
Dear Friend,
This Veterans Day, I will be hosting a Veterans Town Hall at the Barrett-Davis-Watson American Legion Post 233 in Loganville, GA. I am inviting all District 10 veterans and their families to join me at 6 PM on Monday for this opportunity to ask questions and speak their mind. It is an honor to be able to host this event for the brave men and women who have served our country and I hope all attendees will feel welcome to join in on the conversation. Additionally, my
constituent service representatives will be in attendance to meet with veterans and their families who may need help obtaining
benefits, service awards, or any other issues they may be facing. If you have any questions about this free event, please contact my Athens office at (706) 549-9588.

President Obama promised Americans that they would be able to keep their doctor and health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Now that Obamacare has started to go into effect, millions of Americans have received or are expected to receive notices saying they can no longer keep their current plan. I want to know what you think:
Did Obama misled the American people when he told them they could keep their doctor or plan if they liked them?
