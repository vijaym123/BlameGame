Dynasty
Watch video
This week, I visited Happy Valley to present the
Penn State women's volleyball
team with a Senate resolution honoring the team's NCAA title run. The bipartisan
resolution , which Sen. Bob Casey and I introduced together, was unanimously approved by the Senate in February.
Penn State's women's volleyball program is a dynasty. It takes remarkable dedication, coaching, and leadership to win a National Championship, let alone five in seven years.
Congratulations to Coach Rose, his team, and Penn State University on this terrific achievement.
Helping Families Care For Disabled Loved Ones
I am working to improve care for persons with disabilities by expanding tax-preferred savings accounts.
This week, I joined Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) in supporting the bipartisan
Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act , a bill which makes it easier for families to save for their loved ones' future care.
The ABLE Act is a smart, commonsense way of ensuring that families and people with disabilities have a way to set aside funds to maintain health, independence, and quality of life for their loved ones. It's a simple but significant step to support the dignity of persons living with disabilities.

Talking Tax Reform
April 15 - Tax Day - is barely a week away. For so many Pennsylvania families and businesses taxes are just too heavy a burden.
I have long fought for real reform that fixes our broken tax system, eliminates the special interest giveaways, and makes it fairer and less burdensome for all Americans. If done properly, it can boost economic growth, spur job creation, and increase opportunity and prosperity for our nation's middle class. I hope you'll take a moment to
read my thoughts
on how we can achieve this important goal.
Discussing Obamacare With Philly's Dom Giordano
Listen .
The president's healthcare law is hurting our economy, threatening Pennsylvania jobs, and undermining the quality of care Pennsylvanians need. I
spoke with Philly's Dom Giordano
about this on his program this week. I hope you'll take a moment to listen.
