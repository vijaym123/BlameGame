Preparing for Hurricane Season
Dear Friend,
Arthur. That's the first named storm of 2014. Even though it hasn't formed yet, it already has a name well in advance. Below are several resources that will help you make a plan and stay informed for this hurricane season.
Create emergency kits with medical supplies, radio, batteries, water and more.
Make an evacuation plan in case local officials order an evacuation.
Sign up for severe weather and emergency alerts from local officials.
This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it's a start that can make a big difference for you and your family. Together, we can prepare and ensure that we remain safe this hurricane season.
Share this picture to spread the word and make sure your friends and family are prepared.
