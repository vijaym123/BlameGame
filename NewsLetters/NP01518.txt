Conaway Chronicle: Supporting U.S. Oil and Gas Development, Visiting Jane Long Elementary School, Changing the Narrative in Afghanistan, Fred Gipson's Literary Contributions
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Supporting U.S. Oil and Gas Development
This week, I signed on to a letter to Secretary Sally Jewell led by House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Lisa Murkowski encouraging greater development of our nation's energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Obama Administration has continually tried to limit OCS oil and gas leases through new regulations and restrictions on development. Providing a stable energy future for our nation must be a priority, and oil and gas development is a key piece of that.
President Obama and his Administration recently placed restrictions on several areas that were previously available for oil and gas development leases. Currently, 85 percent of the OCS is off limits to domestic energy development. These restrictions are counterproductive to our efforts to create jobs and boost the nation's economy. Energy development literally keeps our country moving, but burdensome regulations from the President and his friends are preventing our nation from advancing.
Visiting Jane Long Elementary School
I was able to join Jane Long Elementary school in Midland, Texas, for breakfast this week. After breakfast, I met with Midland ISD's Director of Child Nutrition to discuss some of the challenges the school system faces. I particularly enjoyed talking to the students about what they liked, and didn't like, about the meals served at school. Thanks to all the students, teachers and administrators who took the time to share their thoughts with me.
Changing the Narrative in Afghanistan
A lot has changed in Afghanistan over the last 15 years, but sometimes it can be hard for us to see all the progress that has been made. At a recent House Armed Services Committee meeting, General John Campbell presented a slideshow with facts about life in Afghanistan in 2001 vs. life in Afghanistan now.
Some of the facts are particularly remarkable- for instance, in 2001 there were no women in Parliament and today, women make up 28% of the National Parliament. Life expectancy has gone from 43 to 64, and internet is now accessible to over 6 million people. I've
posted the slideshow on my website
and I'd encourage you to take a look.
Fred Gipson's Literary Contributions
Fred Gipson, author of Old Yeller, was born in 1908 on a farm near Mason, Texas. The book won the Newbery honor, a distinction reserved for authors who have made a distinguished contribution to American literature for children. Mr. Gipson attended Mason High School and eventually left the 11th district to pursue a degree at The University of Texas at Austin. Disney later turned Old Yeller into a movie, as well as the sequel to Old Yeller, Savage Sam. I am proud to represent the hometown of this great American author.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
