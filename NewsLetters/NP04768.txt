Dear Friends,
I am writing to alert you to federal grant and loan opportunities that have recently been made available or updated, with deadlines from December 1 through March 31, 2014. Your creativity, initiative, and hard work help make the San Francisco Bay Area a global beacon for innovation. I am pleased to provide this newsletter as a service to you and your organization.
Under November 2014 at the Grant Opportunities page on my website, you can find 182 opportunities sorted by category and listed within the following PDFs:
Education
(13)
Energy &amp; Environment
(24)
Health &amp; Human Services
(121)
Humanities
(6)
Science &amp; Technology
(98)
Please note that since not all federal agencies list grant and loan opportunities each month, I encourage you and your colleagues to visit Grants.gov, the federal website that allows you to electronically find and apply for competitive grant opportunities from all federal grant-making agencies. You may input the Funding Opportunity Number listed in the PDF entries into Grants.gov to search for any of the grants listed. You may also sign up for email updates here to receive new grant postings as soon as they become available.
To successfully apply for a grant, individuals or organizations must be registered at Grants.gov, a process that can take anywhere between three business days and several weeks. Therefore I encourage you to register online at least four weeks in advance to ensure your application is processed in a timely manner. Application deadlines and guidelines may change; please check the website given and consult with the awarding agency before starting the application process.
My Congressional office has no role in selecting grant recipients or applying on your behalf. However, to assist you with applications, we have created this outline which gives you an overview of the registration process for organizations. If you are applying for a grant opportunity as an individual, please use this link.
If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact my District office in San Mateo at 650-342-0300, or visit the Grant Opportunities page on my website. I wish you the best of luck, and hope to continue to hear great things from your work in our communities!
All the best,
