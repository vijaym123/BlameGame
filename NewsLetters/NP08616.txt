The Scalise Capitol Report
Monday, June 16,
2014
Reaffirming the importance of the First Amendment
Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of
the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
The
resounding words of the First Amendment are a beacon of light and freedom
for our great nation.
Adopted on December 15, 1791, it protects
the American people from government overreach, and it is vital to our
democracy because it gives all Americans the freedom to express their
views.
But, some Senate Democrats want to amend this
constitutionally guaranteed right.
The First Amendment should not be
tampered with or rewritten.
Doing so would stifle free speech, limit
active participation in our democracy, and poses a dangerous step
toward tyranny.
To protect this bulwark of freedom, I introduced a
free
speech
resolution with my
colleague Congressman Ted Poe of Texas.

what Senate Democrats are doing to gut the First
Amendment:
Serving our
community
Its an honor that we are here to serve our
country, state and community, and I believe community involvement is a
long-term solution to reducing poverty.
I, along with nearly two
dozen of my Republican Study Committee (RSC) colleagues across the
country, participated in an RSC Day of Service last week.
As part
of the RSCs Anti-Poverty Initiative, the Day of Service was an ideal
opportunity for us to learn about the vital work that
charitable organizations are doing to strengthen families and
communities all across this nation.
I am delighted that my
colleagues joined me by visiting local charities, which was such a
rewarding experience for us all.
Announcing the 2014 Congressional Art Competition
winner
Im proud to announce
the winner of the 2014 Scalise Art Competition is Kelli Laderer, for
her work titled,
Louisiana River Boat on the Mississippi River.
This is a great way to showcase the talents of high school
artists from Louisiana's First Congressional District, and Id like to
thank each artist who participated.
The artwork submitted truly
depicted Louisianas unique culture and vibrant landscape.
Kellis piece especially, as it captures a peaceful riverboat ride down the
mighty Mississippi River.
You cant help but think of the
sights and sounds of Louisiana when you view the artwork.
Im proud
this piece will hang in the U.S. Capitol as a showcase of Louisiana
life through her eyes.
Kellis work will be displayed for one year
in the U.S. Capitol, and the three other finalists will have the
opportunity to have their work displayed in one of my district
offices.
Boosting American
manufacturing
The
Promoting New Manufacturing Act, a bill I recently introduced, passed the
committee last week and could inject $115 billion in new investment
into the economy.
H.R. 4795 will increase investment in American
manufacturing and create new jobs by reducing costly permitting
delays.
By increasing transparency and holding the EPA accountable, we
can jump start a broken permitting process that is holding back our
economy, which is good news for hard-working taxpayers.
The men
and women who have to live with these radical EPA regulations have been
asking for guidance to show them how to come into compliance.
If
these rules and standards are as good as the EPA says they are, why
wont the agency be transparent and prove how they can be
implemented?
Instead of arbitrary regulations that will force jobs and higher
emissions to countries like China, this bill holds the EPA
accountable and provides industry a roadmap as to how to achieve the highest
standards through the use of the best commercially available science and
technology.
Click on the photo below to learn how this bill
takes critical steps towards cutting red tape, reviving our countrys
manufacturing base, and creating tens of thousands of high-paying jobs
for hard-working Americans:
It is an honor to
represent you in Congress.
