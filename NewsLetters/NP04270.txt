Kansas Common Sense
November 24, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Giving Thanks for Blessings as Kansans, Americans
As Americans celebrate Thanksgiving this week, families and friends
come together to reflect, give thanks and enjoy a traditional
Thanksgiving feast. However, millions - in fact, one in six Americans -
struggle each day to even get enough food to eat. The unfortunate
reality is that food insecurity exists in every community in our nation.
Living in the breadbasket of America, it can sometimes be difficult to
comprehend the prevalence of hunger at home and around the world. Yet,
hunger is real - it threatens the future of millions every day. Hunger
creates political instability, stunts economic growth, and robs
individuals of their dignity and self-potential.
This Thanksgiving, I hope you will consider supporting or volunteering
at an organization in your community. Just a few hours of your time
giving back can help make this holiday a memorable one for you, your
family and for those in need.
Robba and I join all Kansans in celebrating Thanksgiving with family
and friends, and giving thanks for our blessings. I am especially
grateful for the service and charitable organizations that support our
communities and those in need. I hope you and your families also enjoy
time together and have the chance to reflect on all we have to be
thankful for - both as Kansans and Americans.
Opposing President Obama's Irresponsible Amnesty Plan
On Thursday night, President Obama announced his plan to issue an
executive order on immigration. I oppose the President offering amnesty
to millions of individuals who have entered the country illegally. The
President is aware that he is overstepping his bounds - and has
explained at least 22 times that he does not have the authority to
unilaterally alter immigration laws. President Obama should not act
alone on an issue of such importance. The President is choosing to
allow 5 million people to jump the line in front of those who have
followed the rules and are waiting to come to our country legally. This
irresponsible decision encourages and incentivizes illegal activity -
it will increase the number of people illegally entering the United
States, while making it more difficult for Congress to address the
problems of our immigration system.
President Obama declared his policies were under referendum on Election
Day. He was correct, and on November 4, the American people voted to
take our country in a different direction. I look forward to when the
Senate returns to a functioning body and I commit to Kansans I will
work in the new Congress to prohibit any funding from being available
to implement the President's action.
Serving Veterans - Compassionate Care and Suicide Prevention
On Wednesday, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing
regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) ability to support
veterans who suffer from mental health conditions that for too many
veterans' leads to ending their lives. According to the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, more than 50 percent of
service members returning from tours overseas seek mental health
treatment, and the VA estimates that 22 veterans take their lives each
day. While holding this committee hearing helps conduct oversight of
the VA's willingness and capability to support these veterans, it is
imperative that the VA follow through on its commitments so the
families who have suffered can take comfort in knowing the VA's work
will result in suicide prevention.
As a sponsor of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, it was moving to
hear from Clay's mom, Susan Selke, who testified before the committee.
Susan shared her son's story of reliving the traumatic experiences of
war and his disappointment when the VA failed to offer the care he
needed to treat his despair. We listened to Valerie Pallotta bravely
tell the story of her son Josh who took his own life just six weeks
ago. Josh suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), yet he
could not get treatment he needed due to VA bureaucracy and trouble
navigating the broken system. We ought not allow this cumbersome system
to fail one more veteran in need of help.
The lack of mental health care professionals in the VA is profound and,
for a decade, I've been pressing the VA to utilize Community Mental
Health Centers (CMHC), which offer 24/7 help and are located in every
county throughout Kansas. The VA has two specific programs that could
incorporate CMHC's and bring care closer to home for veterans - the
Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) program and the Veterans Access,
Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA). The VA owes me answers
from multiple requests related to the VACAA, particularly how the VA
defines a facility according to the 40 mile eligibility criteria. Forty
miles from a facility is different than 40 miles from a facility that
provides the services that a veteran needs. Rural veterans in Kansas
deserve far better than the misinformation and misinterpretation of
this important law and should not be disqualified from accessing mental
health care because of where they live.
In addition, I challenged the VA on their lack of hiring capable
Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) and Licensed Professional Mental
Health Counselors (LPMHCs), which are certified counselors who make up
only .04 percent of the total mental health professional workforce in
the VA. I intend to continue this conversation when I receive the
specific name of the individual who is responsible for their hiring as
I requested in the hearing. I will keep working on finding solutions
and holding the VA accountable when it comes to providing our nation's
veterans with the timely, high quality and specialized care they
earned. Click here

hearing.
Keystone XL Falls Short in Senate
The Senate failed to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline in a 59-41 vote
this past Tuesday. The Keystone XL Pipeline should have been approved
years ago, and while I am disappointed it failed by a single vote last
week, it is only a matter of time before it is passed in the next
Congress by the new Republican majority and sent to President Obama's
desk. At that time, the President will finally be forced to decide
whether increases in energy security and American jobs trump special
interest politics. I look forward to the Senate joining the House in
approving the Keystone XL Pipeline in the very near future. This is
merely the first of many issues to finally receive the Senate's
attention after years of being denied votes. Click here
to read more about the Keystone XL pipeline.
The Keystone XL Pipeline is an additional phase to the original
Keystone Pipeline that currently moves crude oil from Steele City,
Nebraska, through Kansas to the processing facility in Cushing,
Oklahoma. The pipeline expansion would link the existing Keystone
infrastructure already operating in Nebraska and Kansas to the oil-rich
Bakken granting greater accessibility to domestic natural resources.
Unfortunately, the White House has refused to approve the permit
application for the remaining 1,200 miles of pipeline to be built
despite President Obama's own State Department's view that this project
can move forward. The Administration's delays have prevented the
creation of new well-paying jobs and economic growth for Americans.
International Negotiators Extend P5+1 Nuclear Talks with Iran
Today international negotiators announced a seven month extension of
diplomatic negotiations with regarding their nuclear development
program. Given the President's worrisome admission that the past year
of dialogue failed to bridge the 'significant' gaps between P5+1
negotiators and Iran, I am skeptical of what this extension can
accomplish. As negotiations carry on, Congress must continue to demand
terms that secure lasting and verifiable dismantlement of Iran's
illicit nuclear program. Any sanctions relief must be dependent on
evident compliance by Iran. The world has too much at stake to accept a
dangerous deal that disregards the concerns of Congress and the
American people.
If international negotiators fail to reach an agreement that prescribes
lasting and verifiable, the United States should immediately reinstate
and augment financial sanctions to further force the issue of Iran's
economic fate into their country's nuclear calculations. 42 of my
Republican colleagues and I expressed these and other concerns to
President Obama this week. Click here
to read the full letter.
Letter to USDA on Beef Checkoff Proposal
This week I sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack
expressing my concerns with his plan to administratively establish a
new, separate beef check-off. Under the Secretary's proposal, this new
check-off would operate parallel to the current Beef Checkoff Program
that has been in place since 1985. Cattle producers from across Kansas
and the country have been loud and clear in their objections to this
plan.
I am concerned that a separate check-off would add administrative costs
and red tape to the current successful system. It is also important to
remember the beef checkoff is funded by beef producers. Thus, common
sense would dictate that any changes to the checkoff should rest in the
hands of those producers, not the federal government. It is important
for Secretary Vilsack to listen to cattle producers who are insisting
USDA to not move forward with this plan to create a new, separate
checkoff. Click here
to read my letter to Sec. Vilsack.
Deadly Attacks in Jerusalem
I was disgusted and saddened by the attacks in Jerusalem last week that
took the lives of three American-Israelis while they were at prayer at
a Jewish synagogue. Two of the victims, Rabbi Kalman Levine and Rabbi
Mosheh Twersky, had close ties to Kansas and have family in our
community. In the face of such gross violence, we must continue to
advocate for a world where people of all faiths can attend places of
worship without threat of danger. My family is keeping the friends and
loved ones of those lost in our thoughts and prayers as they mourn
during this most difficult time.
Kansas Home Care Association's 2014 Legislator of the Year
I am honored to have recently received the 2014 Legislator of the Year
Award from the Kansas Home Care Association (KHCA). KHCA is a member
organization of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice and
was established in 1973 to provide leadership, support, and services to
the home care industry in Kansas. Access to quality, affordable health
care determines whether Kansans can remain in their homes and
communities as they grow older. My parents were married for 73 years
and were able to live independently in my hometown of Plainville for
their entire lives because they had the loving support of their friends
and neighbors. This support embodies the special way of life we live in
Kansas, a way of life we cherish deeply. This way of life would not be
possible without access to the types of care home health practitioners
and others provide to Kansans in their own communities. Home health
care is a cost-efficient alternative to other forms of care, especially
in rural areas where patients tend to be older, sicker, and more
geographically dispersed. Furthermore, Medicare patients in rural areas
often lack alternative care options within their own communities. I
will continue working to see that federal policies reflect the value of
home care in Kansas communities, and I am grateful to partner with KHCA
in this effort.
Celebrating National Entrepreneurs' Day
Entrepreneurs have long been vital to the economic health and growth of
America. Research from the Kauffman Foundation shows that new
businesses accounted for nearly all net new jobs between 1980 and 2005.
In fact, entrepreneurs and the businesses they start create 3 million
jobs annually. On Tuesday, Senator Cory Booker and I introduced a
Senate resolution to celebrate the contributions of American
entrepreneurs and officially establish National Entrepreneurs' Day as a
federally recognized observance day. The Moran-Booker Senate resolution
aims to have Congress recognize the third Tuesday of every November as
National Entrepreneurs' Day. This year, National Entrepreneurs' Day is
celebrated today, November 18. Devoting one day a year to celebrating
the important role entrepreneurs play is a small step toward
encouraging more Americans to be entrepreneurial and securing future
economic success.
National Entrepreneurs' Day was established in 2010 by David Hauser and
Siamak Taghaddos, co-founders of Grasshopper, an organization that
helps entrepreneurs to establish a phone system for their businesses,
and Amir Tehrani, entrepreneur and co-founder of The Legacy Foundation,
a non-partisan educational organization that promotes free enterprise.
The group successfully petitioned President Obama to proclaim National
Entrepreneurs' Day as a holiday in 2010 and each year since. Please

Congress Passes Moran-Jenkins Rural Health Legislation
On Thursday evening, the Senate passed H.R. 4067, legislation to
prevent the federal government's enforcement of unreasonable and
inflexible direct supervision rules for outpatient therapy services in
Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and other small, rural hospitals in
2014. I introduced the original version of this bill, S. 1954, and it
passed the Senate on February 10. Congresswoman Jenkins introduced an
identical version of the bill in the House of Representatives and she
advanced it to passage in the House on September 9. While this one-year
enforcement delay is a positive development, I plan to introduce an
updated version of the Protecting Access to Rural Therapy Services
(PARTS) Act next year in the new Congress. The PARTS Act would address
the therapy supervision issue on a permanent basis.
In 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) - the
federal agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid - unexpectedly
mandated new rules for "direct supervision" of outpatient therapeutic
services, which include services such as drug infusions, blood
transfusions, outpatient psychiatric services, wound debridement, and
cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. These new rules require that a
supervising physician be physically present in the hospital department
at all times when Medicare beneficiaries receive outpatient therapy
services. Imposing an unrealistic and clinically unnecessary
supervision policy jeopardizes patients' access to important therapy
services in their own communities. Many Kansas hospitals have had to
consider cutting services for their patients or limiting hours of
operation in order to comply with this inflexible regulation. H.R. 4067
prevents CMS' enforcement of these rules so that a reasonable policy
can be implemented that more adequately reflects the realities of
providing care in rural areas. Click here
to read more about this legislation.
Celebrating National Rural Health Day
Thursday was National Rural Health Day - a day to honor the
community-minded spirit and dedication that prevails in Kansas and
other parts of rural America. It also gives us a chance to recognize
the unique health care challenges that rural Americans face, and to
celebrate the individuals who rise to meet these challenges every day.
In February, I introduced a bipartisan Senate resolution (S. Res. 26)
recognizing the importance of access to health care in rural areas in
Kansas and throughout our nation. Last week, I introduced an updated
version of this resolution (S. Res. 588), which passed the Senate on
National Rural Health Day. Click here
to read more about this resolution.
Rural communities must deal with a number of health care challenges,
including caring effectively for an aging population across wide areas,
addressing medical workforce shortages, and covering high proportions
of uninsured and underinsured patients. Due in large part to the
effort, cooperation, and commitment it takes to confront such
challenges, it is the selfless, resilient doctors, nurses,
administrators, and other rural health providers that make up the
foundation of these towns. In addition to the care these providers
furnish to residents, they are also vital to their local economies as
large employers in rural areas.
I commend the men and women working in these health care facilities for
their tireless effort and dedication to the people they serve. We are
grateful to you and your fellow health professionals who care for the
62 million individuals that call rural America home.
Welcoming New FHSU President
There is no more important decision for the future of Western Kansas
than who leads Fort Hays State University. It was a real honor to
attend the inauguration of their new President Dr. Mirta Martin at
Gross Memorial Coliseum on Friday. Also in attendance were a number of
state and local officials, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and
community members who all came to celebrate the transition in
leadership. Dr. Martin has made quite an impression on the FHSU
community, and my expectation is her vision, charisma and experience
will lead FHSU to many future successes and achievements.
My wife and Kansas Board of Regents Member, Robba, served on the
selection committee and I was glad to join her in Hays to congratulate
and support President Martin. Welcome "home" President Martin. And go
Tigers!

in

Please

Giving
Thanks
for
Blessings
as
Kansans,
Americans
As
Americans
celebrate
Thanksgiving
this
week,
families
and
friends
come
together
to
reflect,
give
thanks
and
enjoy
a
traditional
Thanksgiving
feast.
However,
millions
&#8211;
in
fact,
one
in
six
Americans
&#8211;
struggle
each
day
to
even
get
enough
food
to
eat.
The
unfortunate
reality
is
that
food
insecurity
exists
in
every
community
in
our
nation.
Living
in
the
breadbasket
of
America,
it
can
sometimes
be
difficult
to
comprehend
the
prevalence
of
hunger
at
home
and
around
the
world.
Yet,
hunger
is
real
&#8211;
it
threatens
the
future
of
millions
every
day.
Hunger
creates
political
instability,
stunts
economic
growth,
and
robs
individuals
of
their
dignity
and
self-potential.
This
Thanksgiving,
I
hope
you
will
consider
supporting
or

at
an
organization
in
your
community.
Just
a
few
hours
of
your
time
giving

can
help
make
this

Robba
and
I
join
all
Kansans
in
celebrating
Thanksgiving
with
family
and

for
our

I
am
especially
grateful
for
the

that
support

I

also
enjoy

Opposing
President
Obama&#8217;s
Irresponsible
Amnesty
Plan On
Thursday
night,
President
Obama
announced
his
plan
to
issue
an
executive
order
on
immigration.
I
oppose
the
President
offering
amnesty
to
millions
of
individuals
who
have
entered
the
country
illegally.
The
President
is
aware
that
he
is
overstepping
his
bounds
&#8211;
and
has
explained
at
least
22
times
that
he
does
not
have
the
authority
to
unilaterally
alter
immigration
laws.
President
Obama
should
not
act
alone
on
an
issue
of
such
importance.
The
President
is
choosing
to
allow
5
million
people
to
jump
the
line
in
front
of
those
who
have
followed
the
rules
and
are
waiting
to
come
to
our
country
legally.
This
irresponsible
decision
encourages
and
incentivizes
illegal
activity
&#8211;
it
will
increase
the
number
of
people
illegally
entering
the
United
States,
while
making
it
more
difficult
for
Congress
to
address
the
problems
of
our
immigration
system.
President
Obama
declared
his
policies
were
under
referendum
on
Election
Day.
He
was
correct,
and
on
November
4,
the
American
people
voted
to
take
our
country
in
a
different
direction.
I
look
forward
to
when
the
Senate
returns
to
a
functioning
body
and
I
commit
to
Kansans
I
will
work
in
the
new
Congress
to
prohibit
any
funding
from
being
available
to
implement
the
President&#8217;s
action.
Serving
Veterans
-
Compassionate
Care
and
Suicide
Prevention On
Wednesday,
the
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
held
a
hearing
regarding
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs&#8217;
(VA)
ability
to
support
veterans
who
suffer
from
mental
health
conditions
that
for
too
many
veterans&#8217;
leads
to
ending
their
lives.
According
to
the
Substance
Abuse
and
Mental
Health
Services
Administration,
more
than
50
percent
of
service
members
returning
from
tours
overseas
seek
mental
health
treatment,
and
the
VA
estimates
that
22
veterans
take
their
lives
each
day.
While
holding
this
committee
hearing
helps
conduct
oversight
of
the
VA&#8217;s
willingness
and
capability
to
support
these
veterans,
it
is
imperative
that
the
VA
follow
through
on
its
commitments
so
the
families
who
have
suffered
can
take
comfort
in
knowing
the
VA&#8217;s
work
will
result
in
suicide
prevention.
As
a
sponsor
of
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act ,
it
was
moving
to
hear
from
Clay&#8217;s
mom,
Susan
Selke,
who
testified
before
the
committee.
Susan
shared
her
son&#8217;s
story
of
reliving
the
traumatic
experiences
of
war
and
his
disappointment
when
the
VA
failed
to
offer
the
care
he
needed
to
treat
his
despair.
We
listened
to
Valerie
Pallotta
bravely
tell
the
story
of
her
son
Josh
who
took
his
own
life
just
six
weeks
ago.
Josh
suffered
from
Post-Traumatic
Stress
Disorder
(PTSD),
yet
he
could
not
get
treatment
he
needed
due
to
VA
bureaucracy
and
trouble
navigating
the
broken
system.
We
ought
not
allow
this
cumbersome
system
to
fail
one
more
veteran
in
need
of
help.
The
lack
of
mental
health
care
professionals
in
the
VA
is
profound
and,
for
a
decade,
I&#8217;ve
been
pressing
the
VA
to
utilize
Community
Mental
Health
Centers
(CMHC),
which
offer
24/7
help
and
are
located
in
every
county
throughout
Kansas.
The
VA
has
two
specific
programs
that
could
incorporate
CMHC&#8217;s
and
bring
care
closer
to
home
for
veterans
&#8211;
the
Access
Received
Closer
to
Home
(ARCH)
program
and
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(VACAA).
The
VA
owes
me
answers
from
multiple
requests
related
to
the
VACAA,
particularly
how
the
VA
defines
a
facility
according
to
the
40
mile
eligibility
criteria.
Forty
miles
from
a
facility
is
different
than
40
miles
from
a
facility
that
provides
the
services
that
a
veteran
needs.
Rural
veterans
in
Kansas
deserve
far
better
than
the
misinformation
and
misinterpretation
of
this
important
law
and
should
not
be
disqualified
from
accessing
mental
health
care
because
of
where
they
live.
In
addition,
I
challenged
the
VA
on
their
lack
of
hiring
capable
Marriage
and
Family
Therapists
(MFTs)
and
Licensed
Professional
Mental
Health
Counselors
(LPMHCs),
which
are
certified
counselors
who
make
up
only
04
percent
of
the
total
mental
health
professional

Keystone
XL
Falls
Short
in
Senate The
Senate
failed
to
approve
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
in
a
59-41
vote
this
past
Tuesday.
The
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
should
have
been
approved
years
ago,
and
while
I
am
disappointed
it
failed
by
a
single
vote
last
week,
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
is
passed
in
the
next
Congress
by
the
new
Republican
majority
and
sent
to
President
Obama&#8217;s
desk.
At
that
time,
the
President
will
finally
be
forced
to
decide
whether
increases
in
energy
security
and
American
jobs
trump
special
interest
politics.
I
look
forward
to
the
Senate
joining
the
House
in
approving
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
in
the
very
near
future.
This
is
merely
the
first
of
many
issues
to
finally
receive
the
Senate&#8217;s
attention
after
years
of
being
denied
votes.

more
about
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline.
The
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
is
an
additional
phase
to
the
original
Keystone
Pipeline
that
currently
moves
crude
oil
from
Steele
City,
Nebraska,
through
Kansas
to
the
processing
facility
in
Cushing,
Oklahoma.
The
pipeline
expansion
would
link
the
existing
Keystone
infrastructure
already
operating
in
Nebraska
and
Kansas
to
the
oil-rich
Bakken
granting
greater
accessibility
to
domestic
natural
resources.
Unfortunately,
the
White
House
has
refused
to
approve
the
permit
application
for
the
remaining
1,200
miles
of
pipeline
to
be
built
despite
President
Obama&#8217;s
own
State
Department&#8217;s
view
that
this
project
can
move
forward.
The
Administration&#8217;s
delays
have
prevented
the
creation
of
new
well-paying
jobs
and
economic
growth
for
Americans.
International
Negotiators
Extend
P5+1
Nuclear
Talks
with
Iran Today
international
negotiators
announced
a
seven
month
extension
of
diplomatic
negotiations
with
regarding
their
nuclear
development
program.
Given
the
President&#8217;s
worrisome
admission
that
the
past
year
of
dialogue
failed
to
bridge
the
&#8216;significant&#8217;
gaps
between
P5+1
negotiators
and
Iran,
I
am
skeptical
of
what
this
extension
can
accomplish.
As
negotiations
carry
on,
Congress
must
continue
to
demand
terms
that
secure
lasting
and
verifiable
dismantlement
of
Iran&#8217;s
illicit
nuclear
program.
Any
sanctions
relief
must
be
dependent
on
evident
compliance
by
Iran.
The
world
has
too
much
at
stake
to
accept
a
dangerous
deal
that
disregards
the
concerns
of
Congress
and
the
American
people.
If
international
negotiators
fail
to
reach
an
agreement
that
prescribes
lasting
and
verifiable,
the
United
States
should
immediately
reinstate
and
augment
financial
sanctions
to
further
force
the
issue
of
Iran&#8217;s
economic
fate
into
their
country&#8217;s
nuclear
calculations.

Letter
to
USDA
on
Beef
Checkoff
Proposal This
week
I
sent
a
letter
to
U.S.
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
expressing
my
concerns
with
his
plan
to
administratively
establish
a
new,
separate
beef
check-off.
Under
the
Secretary&#8217;s
proposal,
this
new
check-off
would
operate
parallel
to
the
current
Beef
Checkoff
Program
that
has
been
in
place
since
1985.
Cattle
producers
from
across
Kansas
and
the
country
have
been
loud
and
clear
in
their
objections
to
this
plan.
I
am
concerned
that
a
separate
check-off
would
add
administrative
costs
and
red
tape
to
the
current
successful
system.
It
is
also
important
to
remember
the
beef
checkoff
is
funded
by
beef
producers.
Thus,
common
sense
would
dictate
that
any
changes
to
the
checkoff
should
rest
in
the
hands
of
those
producers,
not
the
federal
government.
It
is
important
for
Secretary
Vilsack
to
listen
to
cattle
producers
who
are
insisting
USDA
to
not
move
forward
with
this
plan
to
create
a
new,
separate
checkoff.

Deadly
Attacks
in
Jerusalem I
was
disgusted
and
saddened
by
the
attacks
in
Jerusalem
last
week
that
took
the
lives
of
three
American-Israelis
while
they
were
at
prayer
at
a
Jewish
synagogue.
Two
of
the
victims,
Rabbi
Kalman
Levine
and
Rabbi
Mosheh
Twersky,
had
close
ties
to
Kansas
and
have
family
in
our
community.
In
the
face
of
such
gross
violence,
we
must
continue
to
advocate
for
a
world
where
people
of
all
faiths
can
attend
places
of
worship
without
threat
of
danger.
My
family
is
keeping
the
friends
and
loved
ones
of
those
lost
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers
as
they
mourn
during
this
most
difficult
time.
Kansas
Home
Care
Association&#8217;s
2014
Legislator
of
the
Year I
am
honored
to
have
recently
received
the
2014
Legislator
of
the
Year
Award
from
the
Kansas
Home
Care
Association
(KHCA).
KHCA
is
a
member
organization
of
the
National
Association
for
Home
Care
and
Hospice
and
was
established
in
1973
to
provide
leadership,
support,
and
services
to
the
home
care
industry
in
Kansas.
Access
to
quality,
affordable
health
care
determines
whether
Kansans
can
remain
in
their
homes
and
communities
as
they
grow
older.
My
parents
were
married
for
73
years
and
were
able
to
live
independently
in
my
hometown
of
Plainville
for
their
entire
lives
because
they
had
the
loving
support
of
their
friends
and
neighbors.
This
support
embodies
the
special
way
of
life
we
live
in
Kansas,
a
way
of
life
we
cherish
deeply.
This
way
of
life
would
not
be
possible
without
access
to
the
types
of
care
home
health
practitioners
and
others
provide
to
Kansans
in
their
own
communities.
Home
health
care
is
a
cost-efficient
alternative
to
other
forms
of
care,
especially
in
rural
areas
where
patients
tend
to
be
older,
sicker,
and
more
geographically
dispersed.
Furthermore,
Medicare
patients
in
rural
areas
often
lack
alternative
care
options
within
their
own
communities.
I
will
continue
working
to
see
that
federal
policies
reflect
the
value
of
home
care
in
Kansas
communities,
and
I
am
grateful
to
partner
with
KHCA
in
this
effort.
Celebrating
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day Entrepreneurs
have
long
been
vital
to
the
economic
health
and
growth
of
America.
Research
from
the
Kauffman
Foundation
shows
that
new
businesses
accounted
for
nearly
all
net
new
jobs
between
1980
and
2005.
In
fact,
entrepreneurs
and
the
businesses
they
start
create
3
million
jobs
annually.
On
Tuesday,
Senator
Cory
Booker
and
I
introduced
a
Senate
resolution
to
celebrate
the
contributions
of
American
entrepreneurs
and
officially
establish
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day
as
a
federally
recognized
observance
day.
The
Moran-Booker
Senate
resolution
aims
to
have
Congress
recognize
the
third
Tuesday
of
every
November
as
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day.
This
year,
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day
is
celebrated
today,
November
18.
Devoting
one
day
a
year
to
celebrating
the
important
role
entrepreneurs
play
is
a
small
step
toward
encouraging
more
Americans
to
be
entrepreneurial
and
securing
future
economic
success.
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day
was
established
in
2010
by
David
Hauser
and
Siamak
Taghaddos,
co-founders
of
Grasshopper,
an
organization
that
helps
entrepreneurs
to
establish
a
phone
system
for
their
businesses,
and
Amir
Tehrani,
entrepreneur
and
co-founder
of
The
Legacy
Foundation,
a
non-partisan
educational
organization
that
promotes
free
enterprise.
The
group
successfully
petitioned
President
Obama
to
proclaim
National
Entrepreneurs&#8217;
Day
as
a
holiday
in
2010
and
each
year
since.

Congress
Passes
Moran-Jenkins
Rural
Health
Legislation On
Thursday
evening,
the
Senate
passed
H.R.
4067,
legislation
to
prevent
the
federal
government&#8217;s
enforcement
of
unreasonable
and
inflexible
direct
supervision
rules
for
outpatient
therapy
services
in
Critical
Access
Hospitals
(CAHs)
and
other
small,
rural
hospitals
in
2014.
I
introduced
the
original
version
of
this
bill,
S.
1954,
and
it
passed
the
Senate
on
February
10.
Congresswoman
Jenkins
introduced
an
identical
version
of
the
bill
in
the
House
of
Representatives
and
she
advanced
it
to
passage
in
the
House
on
September
9.
While
this
one-year
enforcement
delay
is
a
positive
development,
I
plan
to
introduce
an
updated
version
of
the
Protecting
Access
to
Rural
Therapy
Services
(PARTS)
Act
next
year
in
the
new
Congress.
The
PARTS
Act
would
address
the
therapy
supervision
issue
on
a
permanent
basis.
In
2009,
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
&#8211;
the
federal
agency
that
administers
Medicare
and
Medicaid
&#8211;
unexpectedly
mandated
new
rules
for
&#8220;direct
supervision&#8221;
of
outpatient
therapeutic
services,
which
include
services
such
as
drug
infusions,
blood
transfusions,
outpatient
psychiatric
services,
wound
debridement,
and
cardiac
and
pulmonary
rehabilitation.
These
new
rules
require
that
a
supervising
physician
be
physically
present
in
the
hospital
department
at
all
times
when
Medicare
beneficiaries
receive
outpatient
therapy
services.
Imposing
an
unrealistic
and
clinically
unnecessary
supervision
policy
jeopardizes
patients&#8217;
access
to
important
therapy
services
in
their
own
communities.
Many
Kansas
hospitals
have
had
to
consider
cutting
services
for
their
patients
or
limiting
hours
of
operation
in
order
to
comply
with
this
inflexible
regulation.
H.R.
4067
prevents
CMS&#8217;
enforcement
of
these
rules
so
that
a
reasonable
policy
can
be
implemented
that
more
adequately
reflects
the
realities
of
providing
care
in
rural
areas.

Celebrating
National
Rural
Health
Day Thursday
was
National
Rural
Health
Day
&#8212;
a
day
to
honor
the
community-minded
spirit
and
dedication
that
prevails
in
Kansas
and
other
parts
of
rural
America.
It
also
gives
us
a
chance
to
recognize
the
unique
health
care
challenges
that
rural
Americans
face,
and
to
celebrate
the
individuals
who
rise
to
meet
these
challenges
every
day.
In
February,
I
introduced
a
bipartisan
Senate
resolution
(S.
Res.
26)
recognizing
the
importance
of
access
to
health
care
in
rural
areas
in
Kansas
and
throughout
our
nation.
Last
week,
I
introduced
an
updated
version
of
this
resolution
(S.
Res.
588),
which
passed
the
Senate
on
National
Rural
Health
Day.
Click
here
to
read
more
about
this
resolution.
Rural
communities
must
deal
with
a
number
of
health
care
challenges,
including
caring
effectively
for
an
aging
population
across
wide
areas,
addressing
medical
workforce
shortages,
and
covering
high
proportions
of
uninsured
and
underinsured
patients.
Due
in
large
part
to
the
effort,
cooperation,
and
commitment
it
takes
to
confront
such
challenges,
it
is
the
selfless,
resilient
doctors,
nurses,
administrators,
and
other
rural
health
providers
that
make
up
the
foundation
of
these
towns.
In
addition
to
the
care
these
providers
furnish
to
residents,
they
are
also
vital
to
their
local
economies
as
large
employers
in
rural
areas.
I
commend
the
men
and
women
working
in
these
health
care
facilities
for
their
tireless
effort
and
dedication
to
the
people
they
serve.
We
are
grateful
to
you
and
your
fellow
health
professionals
who
care
for
the
62
million
individuals
that
call
rural
America
home.
Welcoming
New
FHSU
President There
is
no
more
important
decision
for
the
future
of
Western
Kansas
than
who
leads
Fort
Hays
State
University.
It
was
a
real
honor
to
attend
the
inauguration
of
their
new
President
Dr.
Mirta
Martin
at
Gross
Memorial
Coliseum
on
Friday.
Also
in
attendance
were
a
number
of
state
and
local
officials,
faculty,
staff,
students,
alumni,
and
community
members
who
all
came
to
celebrate
the
transition
in
leadership.
Dr.
Martin
has
made
quite
an
impression
on
the
FHSU
community,
and
my
expectation
is
her
vision,
charisma
and
experience
will
lead
FHSU
to
many
future
successes
and
achievements.
My
wife
and
Kansas
Board
of
Regents
Member,
Robba,
served
on
the
selection
committee
and
I
was
glad
to
join
her
in
Hays
to
congratulate
and
support
President
Martin.
Welcome
&#8220;home&#8221;
President
Martin.
