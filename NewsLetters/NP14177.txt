Dear Friend,
This week, the U.S. House approved H.R. 3350 - the Keep Your Health
Plan Act - to provide Americans the option of keeping the health plans
they currently have. This is needed because, after the Affordable Care
Act went into effect, more than 3.5 million Americans, according to the
Associated Press, received health plan cancellation notices. Studies
estimate up to 15 million Americans could lose their coverage over the
next year due to the new law. This is devastating to the hundreds of
families in our district who no longer have health insurance. Clearly,
the promise of "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it" has
proven to be unfounded.
Furthermore, the website, when it works, presents security risks for
many users. And many of those who have been able to obtain quotes on
replacement policies are getting 'sticker shock' as they learn the
costs of their premiums will rise more than 100 percent in some cases.
Many of the policy cancellations or exorbitant increases are due to the
bill's mandates that force consumers to purchase coverage they don't
need and don't want. Our bill will allow plans currently available on
the individual market to be offered next year. I urge the Senate to
quickly follow the lead of the House in serving the American people by
passing this critical piece of legislation and sending it to the
President.
The House also approved H.R. 2655, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of
2013, which would require courts to impose appropriate sanctions on
attorneys, law firms, or parties filing frivolous lawsuits and to
require them to compensate parties injured by these frivolous lawsuits.
Under current law, courts may, but are not required to impose such
sanctions. Too many family businesses are subjected to frivolous
lawsuits that result in layoffs or company closings. No legitimate
action would be prevented by this legislation, but it would help to
limit the frivolous lawsuits that have the effect of greatly
benefitting trial attorneys at the expense of job creators and American
workers.
On another matter, I had the privilege of leading my colleagues in a
Special Order - a series of short speeches from the House floor on a
given topic - on religious freedom in the U.S. military. Members of the
United States Armed Forces, like other Americans, enjoy a First
Amendment right to religious freedom. But these rights are slowly being
eroded. Some recent examples of religious intolerance include.
*	Army Reserve Equal Opportunity trainers referencing "Evangelical
Christianity" and "Catholicism" as examples of religious extremism
along with the KKK, Al Qaeda, and Hamas;
*	A Christian chaplain being ordered to remove a religious column
he had written which simply detailed the history of the phrase "there
are no atheists in foxholes;"
*	An Air Force officer being told that, after 18 years, he could
no longer keep a Bible on his desk because it might "offend" someone;
*	The Air Force Academy removing a poster portraying the words of
the Academy oath because it ends with the phrase "so help me God" and
announcing the final phrase will now be optional for cadets, even
though the phrase has been a part of oaths since the Continental
Congress instituted it in 1776; and
*	Soldiers like Sergeant Phillip Monk being relieved of their
duties because of their support of traditional marriage.
This coercion, intimidation, and outright assault on our military's
freedom of religion has got to stop! Religious freedom includes not
only a service member's beliefs; his or her action and speech are also
protected by the First Amendment. An individual's faith is inseparable
from the way in which he or she lives and acts. Service members must be
permitted to express, share, and act upon their faith without
repercussions. Rest assured, I will continue to be a strong voice on
behalf of this vital right.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
U.S.
House
approved
H.R.
3350
&#8211;
the
Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act
&#8211;
to
provide
Americans
the
option
of
keeping
the
health
plans
they
currently
have.
This
is
needed
because,
after
the
Affordable
Care
Act
went
into
effect,
more
than
3.5
million
Americans,
according
to
the
Associated
Press,
received
health
plan
cancellation
notices.
Studies
estimate
up
to
15
million
Americans
could
lose
their
coverage
over
the
next
year
due
to
the
new
law.
This
is
devastating
to
the
hundreds
of
families
in
our
district
who
no
longer
have
health
insurance.
Clearly,
the
promise
of
&#8220;If
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you
can
keep
it&#8221;
has
proven
to
be
unfounded.
Furthermore,
the
website,
when
it
works,
presents
security
risks
for
many
users.
And
many
of
those
who
have
been
able
to
obtain
quotes
on
replacement
policies
are
getting
&#8216;sticker
shock&#8217;
as
they
learn
the
costs
of
their
premiums
will
rise
more
than
100
percent
in
some
cases.
Many
of
the
policy
cancellations
or
exorbitant
increases
are
due
to
the
bill&#8217;s
mandates
that
force
consumers
to
purchase
coverage
they
don&#8217;t
need
and
don&#8217;t
want.
Our
bill
will
allow
plans
currently
available
on
the
individual
market
to
be
offered
next
year.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
quickly
follow
the
lead
of
the
House
in
serving
the
American
people
by
passing
this
critical
piece
of
legislation
and
sending
it
to
the
President.
The
House
also
approved
H.R.
2655,
the
Lawsuit
Abuse
Reduction
Act
of
2013 ,
which
would
require
courts
to
impose
appropriate
sanctions
on
attorneys,
law
firms,
or
parties
filing
frivolous
lawsuits
and
to
require
them
to
compensate
parties
injured
by
these
frivolous
lawsuits.
Under
current
law,
courts
may ,
but
are
not
required
to
impose
such
sanctions.
Too
many
family
businesses
are
subjected
to
frivolous
lawsuits
that
result
in
layoffs
or
company
closings.
No
legitimate
action
would
be
prevented
by
this
legislation,
but
it
would
help
to
limit
the
frivolous
lawsuits
that
have
the
effect
of
greatly
benefitting
trial
attorneys
at
the
expense
of
job
creators
and
American
workers.
On
another
matter,
I
had
the
privilege
of
leading
my
colleagues
in
a
Special
Order
&#8211;
a
series
of
short
speeches
from
the
House
floor
on
a
given
topic
&#8211;
on
religious
freedom
in
the
U.S.
military.
Members
of
the
United
States
Armed
Forces,
like
other
Americans,
enjoy
a
First
Amendment
right
to
religious
freedom.
But
these
rights
are
slowly
being
eroded.
Some
recent
examples
of
religious
intolerance
include. Army
Reserve
Equal
Opportunity
trainers
referencing
&#8220;Evangelical
Christianity&#8221;
and
&#8220;Catholicism&#8221;
as
examples
of
religious
extremism
along
with
the
KKK,
Al
Qaeda,
and
Hamas; A
Christian
chaplain
being
ordered
to
remove
a
religious
column
he
had
written
which
simply
detailed
the
history
of
the
phrase
&#8220;there
are
no
atheists
in
foxholes;&#8221; An
Air
Force
officer
being
told
that,
after
18
years,
he
could
no
longer
keep
a
Bible
on
his
desk
because
it
might
&#8220;offend&#8221;
someone; The
Air
Force
Academy
removing
a
poster
portraying
the
words
of
the
Academy
oath
because
it
ends
with
the
phrase
&#8220;so
help
me
God&#8221;
and
announcing
the
final
phrase
will
now
be
optional
for
cadets,
even
though
the
phrase
has
been
a
part
of
oaths
since
the
Continental
Congress
instituted
it
in
1776;
and Soldiers
like
Sergeant
Phillip
Monk
being
relieved
of
their
duties
because
of
their
support
of
traditional
marriage.
This
coercion,
intimidation,
and
outright
assault
on
our
military&#8217;s
freedom
of
religion
has
got
to
stop!
Religious
freedom
includes
not
only
a
service
member&#8217;s
beliefs;
his
or
her
action
and
speech
are
also
protected
by
the
First
Amendment.
An
individual&#8217;s
faith
is
inseparable
from
the
way
in
which
he
or
she
lives
and
acts.
Service
members
must
be
permitted
to
express,
share,
and
act
upon
their
faith
without
repercussions.
Rest
assured,
I
will
continue
to
be
a
strong
voice
on
behalf
of
this
vital
right.
Have
a
great
week.
