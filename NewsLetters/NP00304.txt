Friends,
Each American has a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. That's why I voted this week for the Fiscal Year 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act,
legislation that includes a provision preventing the Obama administration from implementing a dangerous United Nations treaty signed by Secretary of State Kerry, which could lead to a national gun registry.
A registry would leave millions of law abiding gun owners throughout Georgia and around the country vulnerable to confiscation schemes.
This legislation is critical in protecting our Second Amendment rights from the Obama administrations gun control efforts.
Additionally,
this bill permanently blocks gun walking programs.
As we saw with Operation Fast and Furious, not only do gun walking operations waste taxpayer dollars but they put American lives in danger. Voting for this legislation is a vote to permanently end these unacceptable programs.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
