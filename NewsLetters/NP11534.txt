Friend-
I recently sat down with Defense News to discuss my priorities as Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee and to voice my concerns about the dangers of continued reckless cuts to our national defense.

Interview: Rep. Randy Forbes
Mar. 11, 2014
By Christopher P. Cavas and John T. Bennett
WASHINGTON
Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., could be called the US Houses dean of Navy shipbuilding, and he is attempting to become its top Asia-Pacific strategist. Whats more, most insiders put him on the shortlist for possible successors to retiring House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif. Forbes is chairman of the committees seapower subcommittee.
On that topic, Forbes was complimentary of his likely rivals for the panels gavel. It really is kind of the team effort. It doesnt matter who is sitting in the chair and who has got the gavel, I dont think.
He spoke with Defense News on March 5, one day after the Defense Department released its fiscal 2015 budget and latest quadrennial defense review (QDR).
Q. What are your thoughts on the Pentagons 2015 budget request and then the QDR? What are the strong suits of both and the weaknesses?
A.
Its like the baby with the bathwater. Dont throw it out. There are some positive things in the QDR, but they are mostly nomenclature. The way Ive characterized it, its kind of like they turned the ship in the right direction, but they just dont have a propulsion system to get it where it needs to go. They havent given it any capabilities. So, if you look, they at least do recognize the importance of the Asia-Pacific area. They recognize the importance of doing things with munitions and how important thats going to be. They recognize the role seapower is going to play in the next decade. The problem is, when you link that with the budget, there are no capabilities that are driving that, at least not adequate capabilities.
Q. Speaking of capabilities, they cost money. How much is enough?
A.
Well, nobody can answer that question right now, because they havent asked the question that I think is important to ask. This was a fair question that was set forth by [House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Smith]: We should be only focused on the dollars that have been set forth by Congress in how we allocate those dollars. We shouldnt ask other questions outside of that. I just refuse that limitation. I think its vitally important for us to be asking what does it take to defend The United States of America? Now, after youve asked that question, I can come close to telling you the dollars and cents that are behind there, but the world has a vote in this thing. And basically when you start asking the question, I cant just come up and say, OK, I only need five aircraft carriers, because thats all I want to spend. Thats a ludicrous thing for me to say. I have to say, how many carriers does it take to defend this country? Then if I cant get there, at least I have put on the table what we need to defend the country, so we start asking two questions. One, what can we afford to spend? Fair question, you know how much do we want to spend, but the other corollary is what is the risk to the United States of America if we dont spend those dollars?
Q. So $500 billion per year is, to you, not enough?
A.
No, no. You cannot spend your way into national security, but at the same time, you cant get it on the cheap. When you say how much is enough, I can tell you cutting 11 cruisers out, by any analysis I know, thats not enough. There are huge gaps when we wont have a carrier out there. That is dangerous when you look at every one of our contingency scenarios.
Q. In the Navy budget, the only area that went up is research and development. Would you recommend, though, stripping money out of R&amp;D for new weapons?
A.
Well I think the R&amp;D is part of that new weapons capability. Here is what I am arguing: We should be asking the question. We should be saying, OK, next decade, where is our [biggest] vulnerability? [An admiral said] if youre looking at where you put your dollars in defense budget, you need it where it has the most consequence and the most impact. In the next decade, that is going to probably be in the seapower and projection forces. If that is true, and Im just saying we should at least be asking the question.
Q. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel gives his budget preview and the mainstream media focused on the size of the Army. It was all about the troop strength. There doesnt seem to be much of an awareness of the Navy, of sea power. What can you do about it?
A.
Well, the public wasnt interested in sequestration when it first came out. When Im giving a speech somewhere, and I tell somebody the Chinese, in eight years, will have 80-plus submarines versus our 32, that resonates, and they understand.
Q. Thats the outside game. Theres also an inside game. Conservative members of your party played a major role in setting spending caps. How do you convince them to support raising defense caps?
A.
What weve been trying to get across to anybody that writes about this, thinks about this and has their livelihood dependent upon this, is the first step is not to use their terminology of settling. You know, what frightens me the most is these people that are going around saying, Well, this is the number. We just have to live with this number. It is a self-defeating mentality. So the first thing Im saying is, dont let that hemorrhaging keep going. Second thing is: Im trying to tell people theyve got to have an organization across the country. I think youre going to have to have an overlay where all of these guys stop just worrying about their own lanes, be it subs or carriers or this aircraft or that aircraft. I think what its going to take is us doing some truly intellectual pushback to try to have a fair debate.
Q. On the remaining defense sequestration cuts, if Republicans take control of the Senate
and keep the House
would the party push legislation to turn off the remaining defense cuts?
A.
I know they could. The question is not whether they could. Its whether they would. And look, you know Im going to be the first one to tell you that we kind of need a consensus of leadership in the Republican Party. We used to be the party of defense. We need to become the party of defense again. The reason is not for political reasons; its because the national defense of this country is going to depend on one party taking that lead. So, we certainly could do that. A lot of that depends on the mix in the Senate.
