A
recent report
released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that the
U.S. ranks below average
when it comes to innovation in primary and secondary schools.
Innovation is essential to the progress of our education systems and in strengthening our students ability to compete in an increasingly global economy, especially in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. I believe that we must encourage students to get involved in STEM at an early age, not only to develop their interest in those subjects, but to allow them to see that what they like doing
like playing on computers
can be what they do for a living.
By coupling increased interest with strengthening STEM education itself, we can spur economic development through the diffusion of technology and information, and better equip our students to push our country towards to a brighter future.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I supported the STEM Education Act of 2014,
H.Res.5031 , which expands the definition of STEM education to include computer science and ensures the awarding of National Science Foundation grants to improve STEM learning outcomes, as well as research that advances the field of informal STEM education. I will continue to support the expansion of STEM education throughout the Commonwealth and across the country.
