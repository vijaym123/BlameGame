Dear Friends,
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of the
senseless tragedy that occurred early Thursday morning at the SXSW
festival in Austin.
My sincere thanks goes out to the first responders
who jumped into action in the middle of the night.
SXSW is an Austin
institution and international destination with a proud history that
reaches across a broad spectrum of our American culture and economy.
I
am hopeful that those attending the remainder of the festival will
remain safe.
On Thursday I chaired a hearing of the Homeland Security Committee
focused on the president's budget request for the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) for the upcoming fiscal year.
I was able to
question DHS Secretary Johnson about the missing Malaysian flight and
what actions DHS is taking following the reports of stolen passports
linked to the flight as well as his priorities for DHS this year.

Legislative Update
This week the House of Representatives passed several important pieces
of legislation that I supported. H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and Medicare
Provider Payment Modernization Act
will protect Medicare beneficiaries by preserving the
doctor-patient relationship and will protect millions of Americans from
a multi-billion dollar tax increase imposed by the president's health
care law.
H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE the Law Act
and H.R. 3973, the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act
are important
oversight bills aimed at stopping executive branch overreach.
The
ENFORCE the Law Act will establish a process that allows Congress to
file a civil suit against a president or executive branch official for
not faithfully executing laws as they are written.
The Faithful
Execution of the Law Act will require the Attorney General to submit a
report to Congress if any federal official establishes or implements a
policy to not enforce a federal law.
If enacted into law, these bills
will help stop the president and his administration from stretching
their power beyond the existing constitutional limits.

If
