Thank you, Max
Dear David,
The Senate yesterday said goodbye to a true public servant, my good friend Max Baucus.
Max has spent his entire career serving the state of Montana.
Just out of law school, Max oversaw the adoption of our state's constitution guaranteeing Montanans the right to enjoy clean air and water and an open, transparent government.
And he spent the last 40 years serving our state in Congress.
As a Senator, Max fought to protect our public lands.
He blocked efforts to gut Social Security and Medicare.
He expanded health care access to millions who were previously denied coverage.
Max learned from his mentor, Senator Mike Mansfield, that working together is the only way to move this country forward.
That's how he earned the respect of Senators from both sides of the aisle and how he was able to accomplish so muc h for Montana.
Since I join ed the Senate, Max has been a mentor and a friend.
And I told him so
yesterday before his confirmation.
I will do my best
to live up to the legacy of Max Baucus and Mike Mansfield and work every day to make sure Montana st ays the Last Best Place.
I wish Max well in his new role as America's ambassador to China. I know he will always put Montana first.
Be well ,
