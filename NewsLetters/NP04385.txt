It&rsquo;s OUTRAGEOUS: Just hours after President Obama announced an historic plan to improve our broken immigration system, John Boehner filed a lawsuit to sue your President.
Friend -- It&rsquo;s OUTRAGEOUS: Just hours after President Obama announced an historic plan to improve our broken immigration system, John Boehner filed a lawsuit to sue him.
This morning -- just MINUTES ago -- Boehner filed his long-threatened lawsuit against President Obama (paid for by YOUR tax dollars).
The single best thing we can do to right now is back President Obama up with an outpouring of grassroots support.
Let&rsquo;s hit 2,500 contributions strong today and deliver a devastating blow to Boehner and Mitch McConnell.

Boehner has CROSSED the line, and we&rsquo;re FURIOUS. This morning, Boehner even accused President Obama of being a dictator, saying, &ldquo;The president has said before that &lsquo;he&rsquo;s not king&rsquo; &amp; he&rsquo;s &lsquo;not an emperor,&rsquo; but he sure is acting like one.&rdquo;
You can NOT stand for this reprehensible lawsuit and utter disrespect of your President.
Will you stand behind the President in this critical moment? Gifts will be MATCHED until midnight, doubling the impact of your support.
Thank you,
