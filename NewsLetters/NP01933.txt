David -- Need a spring vacation?
Here&rsquo;s your chance!
We&rsquo;re sending one lucky winner and a guest to Montana to spend a day with DSCC Chair Senator Jon Tester on his farm!
Senator Tester&rsquo;s farm has been in his family for three generations, and every spring he goes home to plant. This April he&rsquo;s taking a Democratic supporter and their guest along!
Click here to enter our contest to spend a day at Senator Tester&rsquo;s Montana farm! Entry is completely free!
We&rsquo;ll fly you to Montana, put you up in a hotel, and get you to the farm in Big Sandy. You&rsquo;ll get to spend a day with Jon and Sharla Tester while they do their spring planting! We&rsquo;ll pay for all meals, lodging, and transportation.
Honestly, it&rsquo;s hard to think of a more unique experience
than hanging out on a farm with a U.S. Senator on his farm in Montana. He might even let you ride the tractor!
What are you waiting for? Enter our contest -- the trip is on us!
That farmer&rsquo;s tan will look great on you.
