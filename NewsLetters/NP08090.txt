Johnson demands explanation for lack of border agents on Rio Grande Valley
The most trafficked region along U.S.-Mexico border
WASHINGTON
Today U.S. Congressman Sam Johnson (TX-03) sent a
letter
to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on the current humanitarian and national security crisis involving tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who are illegally crossing Texas southern border.
The letter calls on Secretary Johnson to explain why the most trafficked area, the Rio Grande Valley, has less Border Patrol agents than areas where illegal crossings are relatively low and to also address what is currently being done to secure the border.
Excerpts:
A recent
Associated Press
article titled, 'A Look at the Border Patrols Staffing Imbalance,' highlights the inadequate number of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley.
While this region is the most trafficked when it comes to illegal crossings, it is not the most staffed.
As Secretary of Homeland Security your number one priority is to protect the U.S. and the safety of U.S. Citizens.
Its clear that our southern border needs more protection.
Now more than ever, the Rio Grande Valley needs your utmost attention.
The time for concrete action is now. Americans want, need, and deserve more than an editorial.
Its past time for a secure border.
On behalf of my constituents, I would like to know why the Rio Grande Valley, the leading region in illegal crossings, has less Border Patrol agents than areas where illegal crossings are lower?
In addition, what is currently being done to address these staffing inadequacies?
