David -- Here at Democratic Headquarters, it&rsquo;s my job to figure out who are the best leaders around the country to run for Congress. Well, Cheri Bustos is in one of the toughest battles in the entire country.
I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say their race could come down to just a few votes.
Monday is the first quarterly FEC fundraising deadline of the election year. This deadline could literally make or break Cheri&rsquo;s chances of winning reelection and keeping Illinois&rsquo; 17th district out of Tea Party hands. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to step up for Cheri, this is it. Can she count on your support? 48 HOURS TO GO: Chip in $8 or whatever you can before Monday&rsquo;s FEC deadline &gt;&gt; If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: EXPRESS DONATE: $8 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $35 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $50 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $100 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $250 &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
You can bet outside groups funded by deep-pocketed special interests have Cheri on their target list -- that means big money and countless attacks are on their way.
We need to make sure Cheri has the resources she needs to fight back and win in November.
Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late. Click here to chip in for Cheri &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
