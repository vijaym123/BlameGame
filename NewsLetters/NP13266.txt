Dear friend,
Happy New Year to you and your family, and my
very best wishes for 2014. This is a time of reflections and
resolutions, looking back on the year just ending and forward to the new
challenges and new promise of the year ahead.
Each year there are things to celebrate
first steps,
graduations, milestones achieved. But there are challenges,
too
making ends meet, finding work, growing or sustaining a business,
balancing work and family.
In 2013, I visited with people all across our state and
shared in these celebrations and struggles. I am looking
forward to 2014 with a redoubled commitment to make a difference for New
Hampshire.

Senator Shaheen's Holiday
Greeting
If 2013 taught us anything, its that
we've got to work together to get things done. I voted with Democrats
and Republicans to pass a budget that is good for jobs and the
economy here in New Hampshire and around the country, removing the threat of
yet another government shutdown.
Though the bill was not
perfect, it represented hard work and compromise from both parties, and
epitomizes the kinds of bipartisan action I hope we can see more of from
Congress in 2014.
There were lots of accomplishments worth celebrating right here in
New Hampshire this year, too.
We finally broke ground on the
Manchester Job Corps
earlier this year, which
was the culmination of 15 years of bipartisan work that will help our
students gain the skills they need to get good paying
jobs. Pease was selected as the top Air National Guard base to receive the
KC-46A tanker.
Pease's selection was a big win
for the base and for New Hampshires economy. Analysts estimate
the new tanker will bring an additional 100 jobs to the base, not to
mention millions in economic investments throughout the
Seacoast.
Over the course of the year,
I visited dozens of Granite State small businesses (click

to see photos!) who were innovating, growing exports,
and investing in energy efficiency, helping to create more jobs here at
home.
In 2014,
I will keep working to help these small businesses, to grow our
economy so it's creating jobs, and to protect taxpayers. I am also
committed to making 2014 the year we pass an updated version of my
bipartisan energy efficiency legislation
with Senator Rob
Portman. The Shaheen-Portman bill has brought business, labor and
environmental leaders together around sensible, pragmatic energy proposals,
and it has the potential to create 136,000 domestic jobs by 2025
while saving consumers and businesses billions of
dollars.
Ive always aimed to make a
meaningful difference for New Hampshire families and our communities by
finding commonsense solutions to the challenges we face. That's what
I'm going to keep doing in 2014. I am excited to see what the New Year
brings, both for our state and our country and look forward to seeing
you, and hearing from you in the days ahead.
I hope you all enjoy your holiday season and
again, I wish you a Happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
