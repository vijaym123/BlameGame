Dear Friends:
Weve all been watching the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs that have come to light. Im working to ensure we get these problems fixed and that we hold the appropriate people accountable for their neglect and wrongdoing.
While we do that, we need to redouble our efforts to help those who are still waiting for the benefits that they have earned.
Next week, Ill be holding special veterans office hours throughout the entire 12th District to help veterans who are having problems. Sometimes a quick conversation can help resolve a veteran's problem, and sometimes more work is needed.
But we can help, and these special offices hours mean veterans will have access to their Congressman, the VA, and other organizations that can help.
If you're a veteran who's waiting for your benefits, or if you know a veteran who's getting the runaround, please stop by during our office hours next week.
The hours and locations are all listed to the right.
Also, this weekend, Im hosting another round of Congress on the Corner town hall meetings in the district. This is one of the best ways we can visit and talk about the work Im doing for the 12 th
District.
On Saturday, June 28 th , Ill be hosting "Congress on the Corner" in Laurens, Wheeler, Treutlen, and Montgomery Counties.
You can stop by if youre having a problem with a federal agency, or we can just visit. More information on these locations is available by
clicking here .
Another way to stay in touch is to use these emails to hear from you. So please take a moment to participate in our poll below. I need your input as we continue to work to make the VA better for all of our veterans.
As always, please dont hesitate to let me know if you need help with anything.
Also, please share this message with any veterans you know in the 12 th District who might find our office hours helpful.
I look forward to seeing you around the district next week.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress

Would you support the Department of Justice appointing a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of misconduct at the VA where records were changed to make wait times for veterans appear shorter than they actually were?
