Rep. Tammy Duckworth shows what women really want for Valentine's Day:
equal pay for equal work.
Dear Neighbors,
This Valentine's Day, what women need more than flowers or chocolates,
what they deserve, is equal pay for equal work.
Today in the United States women make only $.77 on the dollar that a
man makes. In Illinois specifically, women earn nearly $12,000 a year
less than their male counterparts.?
I know that my neighbors believe that our daughters deserve better. Pay
discrimination doesn't just hurt women - it hurts working families
throughout the Eighth District.
During my service in the Army, I got equal pay for equal work to my
male counterparts.
And this policy of equal pay for equal work helped
make our military the strongest, fiercest in the world.
What women need from Congress is fair compensation for their enormous
contributions to our country.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress

The

By

You

TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,

any
individual
item

and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default

in
the
TD.

Things

Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than

Rep.
Tammy
Duckworth
shows
what
women
really
want
for
Valentine's
Day:
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
Dear
Neighbors,
This
Valentine&#8217;s
Day,
what
women
need
more
than
flowers
or
chocolates,
what
they
deserve,
is
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
Today
in
the
United
States
women
make
only
$.77
on
the
dollar
that
a
man
makes.
In
Illinois
specifically,
women
earn
nearly
$12,000
a
year
less
than
their
male
counterparts. &#8232;
I
know
that
my
neighbors
believe
that
our
daughters
deserve
better.
Pay
discrimination
doesn&#8217;t
just
hurt
women
&#8211;
it
hurts
working
families
throughout
the
Eighth
District.
During
my
service
in
the
Army,
I
got
equal
pay
for
equal
work
to
my
male
counterparts.
And
this
policy
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work
helped
make
our
military
the
strongest,
fiercest
in
the
world.
What
women
need
from
Congress
is
fair
compensation
for
their
enormous
contributions
to
our
country.
Sincerely,
Tammy
Duckworth Member
of
Congress
