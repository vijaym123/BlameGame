We Were Not Always Free
Every year on the Fourth of July, we are reminded of those brave patriots who came before us to establish and preserve liberty. Those precious freedoms that we now enjoy were paid for at a high price by thousands who believed in a better, brighter future for all generations of Americans.
Freedom is not free or easily attained. The brainchild of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and Robert Livingston, the Declaration of Independence was just the beginning of a long, dangerous road to building and establishing the America we live in today.
Our founders bravely penned the words, With a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. Because they believed in America and their vision for our future was clear, they were ready and willing to put everything on the line and potentially lose their lives in the fight for freedom.
After we declared independence from the British, the fight for freedom and liberty was long, full of trials and war. Countless men endured unbelievable hardship, and a miraculous victory was at last claimed. In times since that first war, thousands more have risked their lives to preserve freedom and liberty.
We truly live in the greatest nation on earth, and our history is rich indeed. As we celebrate another birthday, do not let the day go by without remembering the true price of freedom, for Independence Day is the day that patriotism should ring especially loudly and proudly in our hearts.
Sincerely,
Tom Cole
