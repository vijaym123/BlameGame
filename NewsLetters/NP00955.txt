Dear Friends,
On Sunday, we honor our
mothers. Ill be celebrating Mothers Day with my wife, Rebecca, the mother
of our five wonderful children. Ill also reflect on the love and
support of my mother, Ana Pastor, who passed away 10 years ago this
September.
These are the women who keep us safe, fed and clothed,
help us with homework, support us in our extracurricular activities
and dry our tears. Often, they give up professional ambitions to advance
our success. Nothing equals a mothers love.
Mothers pick us up
when were down and keep us humble when we excel. Their guidance,
grace and nurturing make us better people.
This Mothers Day,
I hope you remember your mom fondly. And if shes alive, near or far,
let her feel your gratitude and love.
Thank you ,
