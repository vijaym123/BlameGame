Dear Friend--
I have
great news to report! The Senate just passed legislation to roll back the
most harmful flood insurance premium increases caused by the
Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act.
Sign up here to become a citizen cosponsor of the Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act
We need your
help to make sure the House of Representatives acts before flood
insurance premiums cause more damage to our communities.
There are
already more than 170 cosponsors of H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act of 2013.
I invite you to sign on today as
a citizen cosponsor of this legislation so that your voice is heard.
Join the group of over
170 bipartisan Members of Congress supporting this bill: sign up to
become a citizen cosponsor
Flood insurance
premium increases have sent shockwaves throughout Louisiana.
I
hope you continue to lend your voice as we seek a sustainable,
long-term solution that will allow people to buy and sell homes without
premium spikes.
This effort transcends party affiliation and
reaches down to the core of our purpose in Congress, which is to pass
legislation that protects our constituents.
Please join us in
this fight for a commonsense solution.
Feel free to share with your friends and family so
that they can stay up to date on my efforts regarding flood
insurance.
