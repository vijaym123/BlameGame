Rubio Delivers Speech On Rebuilding
American Defense
On Wednesday, Marco addressed the need
to build American defense capabilities
for the 21
st
century, in light of the
current global crises and attempts to
diminish American military strength to
historic lows. He offered specific policy
targets for rebuilding each branch of the
armed services, heightening cyber and
space capabilities, and reforming
components of the military personnel
system.
An excerpt of his
speech
is below:
The world needs American
Strength just as much as our people and
our economy do. No other nation can
deter global conflict by its presence
alone. No other nation can offer the
security and benevolence that America
can. No other nation can be trusted to
defend peace and advance liberty.
The proposals I have outlined
today will allow us to achieve these
objectives. They will ensure that
Americas light shines on, into
the face of whatever evil looks our way
this century. And that our armed forces
their bravery and skill
unmatched
are equipped to meet
the growing and changing forces that
never cease to threaten our people, our
allies, and our sacred principles of
freedom and opportunity for
all.

Senate Passes Bill To Offer Reward
For Information On The Murders Of
American Journalists
Marco, along with Senators Jeanne
Shaheen (D-NH), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Bill
Nelson (D-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) hailed
the Senates unanimous passage of
a
bill
authorizing up to $10 million in
rewards for information leading up to the
arrest and conviction of any individuals
involved in the kidnapping and murders of
American journalists James Foley and
Steven Sotloff, who were natives of New
Hampshire and Florida, respectively.
The bill would update the State
Departments Rewards for Justice
Program to offer a reward to anyone who
provides information leading to the
arrest or conviction of any individual
responsible for committing, conspiring or
aiding in the commission of the
kidnapping and murders of Foley and
Sotloff. Since the inception of the
Rewards for Justice Program in 1984, the
U.S. has paid more than $125 million to
over 80 people who provided actionable
information that put terrorists behind
bars or prevented acts of international
terrorism worldwide.
One way we can honor the
memories of James Foley and Steven
Sotloff is to bring their evil
murderers to justice, which this
measure will help do,
said Marco . I hope the
House approves this at the earliest
possible opportunity so that the
President can sign it into law.
Its important that we send a
powerful message to the Foley and
Sotloff families, to the American
people and to the world that the United
States will work tirelessly to ensure
that the deaths of these beloved
journalists does not go
unpunished.
In
a
Senate floor speech on Thursday ,
Marco discussed the importance of funding
efforts to combat the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist
group.
In
a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing on Wednesday , Marco pressed
Secretary of State John Kerry on why
President Obama has ruled out using U.S.
combat troops to defeat ISIL.
Rubio Introduces Legislation To
Improve Florida Fisheries
Marco, Ranking Member of the
Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere,
Fisheries and Coast Guard, introduced the
Florida
Fisheries Improvement Act , a bill
that outlines legislative priorities that
will improve fisheries management in the
Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
regions. The purpose of the legislation
is to begin outlining Floridas
priorities for the eventual
reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens
Act (MSA). The legislation is the result
of multiple hearings, meetings, and
conversations with stakeholders from the
state.
Floridas fisheries
deeply impact the economic well-being
of our state, as well as many
Floridians whose way of life depends on
them. But our fisheries are also a
national treasure that feed Americans
across the country, provide jobs across
the food industry chain, and have
become a favorite pastime for millions
who provide direct and indirect
benefits to our local, state and
national economies,
said Marco . This
legislation ensures necessary
improvements to management and data
collection are made to fully optimize
our fisheries and help advance
Floridas interests when it comes
time to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
However, I know there is more work to
be done, and I will continue to work
with Floridians and my colleagues in
Congress to prioritize reauthorization
of the MSA in the next
Congress.
Rubio Comments On NASAs Plans
To Resume Manned Space Launches
On Tuesday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding NASAs
commercial crew transport selection:
Todays announcement
from NASA marks an important milestone
for our nations space program
and is an exciting development for
Florida and the commercial space
industry. These partnerships will
ensure that American astronauts are
once again launched into space from
American soil. As the nations
spaceport, Floridas Space Coast
will play a crucial role in advancing
this initiative and exploring low earth
orbit. I, along with all Floridians,
look forward to seeing our astronauts
launch from Kennedy Space Center once
again.
Constituent Casework Corner
Stephen, a small business owner from
South Florida, contacted Senator
Rubios office to request

the Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
that is was canceled. A member of the
staff contacted the agency and forwarded
the information he provided to CBP and
requested a review of his account. After
careful review of the information, the
agency reinstated his membership.
