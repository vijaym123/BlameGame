Dear Friend,
This week, I spoke with more than 15,000 Memphians in a telephone town
hall meeting, Sheri Lipman was confirmed as a District Court Judge
(without a single Senator voting against her) after I recommended her
to President Obama, and Shelby County was awarded more than $5 million
to help fight HIV and AIDS. Keep reading to learn more.

My Recommendation to President Obama Confirmed as Next District Court
Judge
On Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Senate confirmed Sheri Lipman-who I
recommended to the President after convening a diverse screening panel
of Memphians-to be the next U.S. District Court Judge for the Western
District of Tennessee by a vote of 95 to 0. Just before the Senate's
vote, I urged her confirmation
on the House floor.
Throughout her career, Sheri Lipman has proven herself a stellar
attorney. She fully deserved to be confirmed to the bench, and I am
confident that she will be a superb federal judge. Her breadth of
experience, strong work ethic, and unimpeachable integrity easily made
her the overwhelming first choice of the screening committee of local
attorneys.
I commend President Obama for taking my recommendation and nominating
such a skilled Memphis attorney to the federal bench, and I am pleased
that she has been confirmed overwhelmingly by the United States Senate.
I know that she will serve the Western District of Tennessee and the
people of Memphis with distinction.
Listening to Constituents
On Wednesday evening, I hosted a telephone town hall meeting for the
citizens of the Ninth District. I enjoyed the opportunity to speak to
more than 15,000 constituents and discuss a number of issues, including
the Affordable Care Act and services that are available to veterans We
also discussed my "Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness series.
Town hall meetings give citizens of the Ninth District like you another
way to speak directly with me and share what's really on your mind. I
appreciated having this opportunity to listen to your perspective on
the issues facing our city and enjoyed discussing my work to promote
Memphis to President Obama's Administration and help the middle class
by raising the minimum wage as well as give the unemployed a helping
hand by extending unemployment insurance. Regardless of the issue, the
perspective, opinions and ideas of the citizens of the Ninth District
like you help me move forward with legislation in Congress.
If you would like to sign up to participate in my future telephone town
halls-including one scheduled this coming Tuesday (May 6th) which will
focus on issues affecting our seniors-please fill out this form
. Please enter a landline
phone number, as cell phones cannot be called during telephone town
halls.
Working for the Middle Class
Throughout my career, I have always fought to ensure that hard-working
Memphians can earn a living wage and won't have to struggle to provide
for themselves and their families. No one who works hard and plays by
the rules should have to raise their families in poverty.
When I came to Congress in 2007, I was proud to vote for an increase in
the federal minimum wage, but since then the cost of basic necessities
has risen and the minimum wage has become less valuable.
I am disappointed that earlier this week Republicans blocked the Senate
from even debating an increase in the minimum wage. That's why I
renewed my call for Speaker John Boehner to schedule an immediate vote
on the Fair Minimum Wage Act
, which would increase the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to
$10.10 per hour and tie the wage to inflation moving forward.
Increasing the minimum wage would help more than 600,000 Tennesseans
and help lift as many as 4.5 million Americans out of poverty. The
millions of Americans working for the minimum wage-who average 35 years
old-deserve a raise for their hard work.
Fighting for Our Veterans
This week, the House debated the 2015 Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs spending bill. With too many veterans waiting for
months and even years to get their benefits, I'm pleased that some of
the amendments included in the bill will help speed up the VA's efforts
to cut down on the claim backlog and ensure veterans can receive
treatment in a timelier manner. I am, however, very disappointed that
an amendment failed which would have helped veterans in states where
cannabis is a legal medicine receive full, complete, and accurate
advice from their doctors. I spoke out in support of the amendment on
the House floor
because we shouldn't muzzle doctors from giving their medical
advice to their patients, and our veterans deserve the best advice
there is.
Preventing Sex Trafficking
On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee
in supporting a number of bills to help victims of sex trafficking and
stop people from benefitting from advertising the services of sex
traffickers. It is outrageous that so many women and girls in this
country are forced or coerced into sexual exploitation. We must do
everything we can to stop these heinous acts and to protect the victims
of trafficking.
Fighting AIDS and HIV in Shelby County
On Tuesday, I announced more than $5 million in funding through the
Ryan White Program to provide care and health services to those living
with HIV and AIDS in the Ninth District. While there have been major
breakthroughs in treatment in recent years, the HIV epidemic continues
to plague the Ninth District. This funding will help thousands of
Memphians living with these terrible illnesses better access to the
high-quality, comprehensive care they need and deserve but otherwise
may not have had access to.
Helping Reformed Ex-Offenders Re-Enter the Workforce
It has been proven that recidivism rates are significantly reduced when
an ex-offender has a decent job and community support in place. But too
often, those who have already paid their debts to society face
significant barriers when looking for a job.
We can and should ensure that readiness is not one of those barriers.
That's why yesterday I introduced my Re-Integration of Ex-Offenders
Through Technology Act, which will help lower recidivism rates by
providing rehabilitated ex-offenders with the tech literacy skills they
need to compete for many of today's jobs and it will help ensure a
qualified workforce for small business owners.
My legislation would give reformed ex-offenders who have repaid their
debts to society a fair chance to compete in today's job market by
incorporating technology literacy programs into the U.S. Department of
Labor's (DOL) offender re-entry job assistance programs. These programs
provide job training and assistance to ex-offenders who have served
their time and are seeking to contribute to society through gainful
employment. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass it in
the House.
Google's Self-Driving Car
This week, I was given the opportunity to take a ride in one of Google's
driverless cars. I am impressed by the innovation and ingenuity that
Google's engineers have shown in developing this car, and look forward
to what these sorts of self-driving cars could do in the future.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Find Jobs
This week, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden announced the
launch of a new integrated employment tool to connect veterans and
service members with employers, and to help translate military skills
into the civilian workforce. The Veterans Employment Center
, an integrated, online tool connecting
veterans, transitioning service members and their spouses with both
public and private-sector employers, is the result of an interagency
effort to improve, simplify and consolidate the current array of
employment resources for veterans. Additionally, this will provide one
comprehensive database of resumes for employers who are seeking to
leverage the skills and talents of veterans, service members, and their
spouses. A video tutorial on how to use the Veterans Employment Center
can be viewed here
.
As always, I remain.

My
Recommendation
to
President

Confirmed
as
Next
District
Court
Judge
On
Wednesday
afternoon,
the
U.S.
Senate
confirmed
Sheri
Lipman&#8212;who
I
recommended
to
the
President
after
convening
a
diverse

of
Memphians&#8212;to
be
the
next
U.S.
District
Court
Judge
for
the
Western
District
of
Tennessee
by
a
vote
of
95
to
0.
Just
before
the
Senate&#8217;s
vote,
I
urged
her
confirmation
on
the
House
floor.
Throughout
her
career,
Sheri
Lipman
has
proven
herself
a
stellar
attorney.
She
fully
deserved
to
be
confirmed
to
the
bench,
and
I
am
confident
that
she
will
be
a
superb
federal
judge.
Her
breadth
of
experience,
strong
work
ethic,
and
unimpeachable
integrity
easily
made
her
the
overwhelming
first
choice
of
the
screening

of
local
attorneys.
I
commend
President
Obama
for
taking
my
recommendation
and
nominating
such
a
skilled
Memphis
attorney
to
the
federal
bench,
and
I
am
pleased
that
she
has
been
confirmed
overwhelmingly
by
the
United

Senate.
I
know
that
she
will
serve
the
Western

of
Tennessee
and
the
people
of
Memphis
with
distinction.

I

Obama&#8217;s

the

by
raising
the
minimum

as
well
as
give
the

a

Working
for
the
Middle
Class
Throughout
my
career,
I
have
always
fought
to
ensure
that
hard-working
Memphians
can
earn
a
living
wage
and
won&#8217;t
have
to
struggle
to
provide
for
themselves
and
their
families.
No
one
who
works
hard
and
plays
by
the
rules
should
have
to
raise
their
families
in
poverty.
When
I
came
to
Congress
in
2007,
I
was
proud
to
vote
for
an
increase
in
the
federal
minimum
wage,
but
since
then
the
cost
of
basic
necessities
has
risen
and
the
minimum
wage
has
become
less
valuable.
I
am
disappointed
that
earlier
this
week
Republicans
blocked
the
Senate
from
even
debating
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage.
That&#8217;s
why
I
renewed
my
call
for
Speaker
John
Boehner
to
schedule
an
immediate
vote
on
the
Fair
Minimum
Wage
Act ,
which
would
increase
the
minimum
wage
from
$7.25
per
hour
to
$10.10
per
hour
and
tie
the
wage
to
inflation
moving
forward.
Increasing
the
minimum
wage
would
help
more
than
600,000
Tennesseans
and
help
lift
as
many
as
4.5
million
Americans
out
of
poverty.
The
millions
of
Americans
working
for
the
minimum
wage&#8212;who
average
35
years
old&#8212;deserve
a
raise
for
their
hard
work.
Fighting
for
Our
Veterans
This
week,
the
House
debated
the
2015
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
spending
bill.
With
too
many
veterans
waiting
for
months
and
even
years
to
get
their
benefits,
I&#8217;m
pleased
that
some
of
the
amendments
included
in
the
bill
will
help
speed
up
the
VA&#8217;s
efforts
to
cut
down
on
the
claim
backlog
and
ensure
veterans
can
receive
treatment
in
a
timelier
manner.
I
am,
however,
very
disappointed
that
an
amendment
failed
which
would
have
helped
veterans
in
states
where
cannabis
is
a
legal
medicine
receive
full,
complete,
and
accurate
advice from
their
doctors.
I
spoke
out
in
support
of
the
amendment
on
the
House
floor
because
we
shouldn&#8217;t
muzzle
doctors
from
giving
their
medical
advice
to
their
patients,
and
our
veterans
deserve
the
best
advice
there
is.
Preventing
Sex
Trafficking
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
in
supporting
a
number
of
bills
to
help
victims
of
sex
trafficking
and
stop
people
from
benefitting
from
advertising
the
services
of
sex
traffickers. It
is
outrageous
that
so
many
women
and
girls
in
this
country
are
forced
or
coerced
into
sexual
exploitation. We
must
do
everything
we
can
to
stop
these
heinous
acts
and
to
protect
the
victims
of
trafficking.
Fighting
AIDS
and
HIV
in
Shelby
County
On
Tuesday,
I
announced
more
than
$5
million
in
funding
through
the
Ryan
White
Program
to
provide
care
and
health
services
to
those
living
with
HIV
and
AIDS
in
the
Ninth
District.
While
there
have
been
major
breakthroughs
in
treatment
in
recent
years,
the
HIV
epidemic
continues
to
plague
the
Ninth
District.
This
funding
will
help
thousands
of
Memphians
living
with
these
terrible
illnesses
better
access
to
the
high-quality,
comprehensive
care
they
need
and
deserve
but
otherwise
may
not
have
had
access
to.
Helping
Reformed
Ex-Offenders
Re-Enter
the
Workforce
It
has
been
proven
that
recidivism
rates
are
significantly
reduced
when
an
ex-offender
has
a
decent
job
and
community
support
in
place.
But
too
often,
those
who
have
already
paid
their
debts
to
society
face
significant
barriers
when
looking
for
a
job.
We
can
and
should
ensure
that
readiness
is
not
one
of
those
barriers.
That&#8217;s
why
yesterday
I
introduced
my
Re-Integration
of
Ex-Offenders
Through
Technology
Act,
which
will
help
lower
recidivism
rates
by
providing
rehabilitated
ex-offenders
with
the
tech
literacy
skills
they
need
to
compete
for
many
of
today&#8217;s
jobs
and
it
will
help
ensure
a
qualified
workforce
for
small
business
owners.
My
legislation
would
give
reformed
ex-offenders
who
have
repaid
their
debts
to
society
a
fair
chance
to
compete
in
today&#8217;s
job
market
by
incorporating
technology
literacy
programs
into
the
U.S.
Department
of
Labor&#8217;s
(DOL)
offender
re-entry
job
assistance
programs.
These
programs
provide
job
training
and
assistance
to
ex-offenders
who
have
served
their
time
and
are
seeking
to
contribute
to
society
through
gainful
employment.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
pass
it
in
the
House.
Google&#8217;s
Self-Driving
Car
This
week,
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
take
a
ride
in
one
of
Google&#8217;s
driverless
cars.
I
am
impressed
by
the
innovation
and
ingenuity
that
Google&#8217;s
engineers
have
shown
in
developing
this
car,
and
look
forward
to
what
these
sorts
of
self-driving
cars
could
do
in
the
future.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
Helping

This
week,
First
Lady
Michelle
Obama
and
Dr.
Jill
Biden
announced
the
launch
of
a
new
integrated
employment
tool
to
connect
veterans
and
service
members
with
employers,
and
to
help
translate
military
skills
into
the
civilian
workforce. The
Veterans
Employment
Center ,
an
integrated,
online
tool
connecting
veterans,
transitioning
service
members
and
their
spouses
with
both
public
and
private-sector
employers,
is
the
result
of
an
interagency
effort
to
improve,
simplify
and
consolidate
the
current
array
of
employment
resources
for
veterans. Additionally,
this
will
provide
one
comprehensive
database
of
resumes
for
employers
who
are
seeking
to
leverage
the
skills
and
talents
of
veterans,
service
members,
and
their
spouses.
A
