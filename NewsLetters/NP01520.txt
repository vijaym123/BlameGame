Week in Review
Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to receive my e-newsletter! Here, you can keep up to date on what I have been working on in Washington and at home in Central New York.
Keeping Agriculture Strong in CNY
We held the inaugural meeting of my Agriculture Committee, with farmers from each of the four counties in NY-24.
Local farms are a critical driver of economic growth in Central New York, and this group will meet regularly to discuss and keep me informed on priority agricultural issues.
Community Dialogue on Mental Health
Because of discontinuities and other gaps in the care system, young people in our area do not always receive the best available mental health care.
I'm proud to announce that Assemblyman Magnarelli and I have partnered to create a Mental Health &amp; Behavioral Health Task Force to strengthen pediatric mental health care in Central New York.
You can learn more about our task force
here .

Alzheimer's Awareness
Did you know that Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the most expensive disease in America? Of the top 10 killers, it is the only one that cannot be cured, prevented or even slowed.
It was my pleasure to visit the Central New York chapter of the Alzheimer's Association to learn about services and care for local Alzheimer's patients at the Kirkpatrick Day Program.
Thanks again for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
