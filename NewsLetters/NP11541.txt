Kinzinger brings
Boeing to Rockford
Yesterday, Congressman Adam Kinzinger
hosted representatives from Boeing at Rockford International Airport
for a supplier symposium with local manufacturers. Organized with the
help of the Rockford Area Economic Development Council, the
symposium was attended by over two dozen business owners and was aimed at
bringing new business and jobs to the Rockford-area. Local business
owners heard a presentation on how they can become suppliers to Boeing and
had the chance to talk one-on-one with Boeing
representatives.
