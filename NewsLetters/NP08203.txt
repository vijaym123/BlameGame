David,
I wanted to personally give you this news. With just 5 hours to go, we&rsquo;re only $241 short of hitting $100,000 for the quarter and setting a new online record for donations this election!
That&rsquo;s an incredible showing, David. And it&rsquo;s all a testament to your steadfast support.
Your donations allow us to set the record straight and get the facts out to Illinois voters.
But David, we&rsquo;re not there yet.
Please use this personalized link below and send a donation before midnight. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/donate
Thanks for your help!
Brad
