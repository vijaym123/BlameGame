Kicking off Mental Health Awareness Month
Dear Friend,
Today I gave opening remarks at the first-ever Yoga on the Hill event, hosted by the Congressional Yogi Association, to promote mental and physical wellness among veterans, and to kick of Mental Health Awareness Month. I was joined by Rep. Tim Ryan, Rep. Barbara Lee, former NFL Linebacker and celebrity yogi Keith Mitchell, Iraq War Veteran Tom Voss of the documentary
Almost Sunrise , and Brennan Mullaney from Team RWB.
Join me in striking a pose for wounded warriors.
Tweet me , or tag me on
Facebook
or
Instagram , a picture of you doing your favorite yoga pose in honor of Mental Health Awareness Month. Here I am doing the Mountain Pose this morning:
Yesterday I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the importance of education in moving our country forward in the competitive global marketplace.
There is a connection between poverty and hopelessness, poverty and joblessness, poverty and not being able to send your kids to school.
Funding education and the children tax credits are costly. But the return we see is even greater. Investment in our people and the talent of our minds makes this country all that she can be. By increasing education we decrease poverty.
You can watch my statement below.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
