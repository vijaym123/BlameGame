The Conaway Chronicle:
Vote against the Fiscal Year 2015 Spending Bill , Constituent Outreach in Mason, Rodeo Stars of the 11th District
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
Voting against the Fiscal Year 2015 Spending Bill:
This was a flawed bill which I opposed for a multitude of reasons including the fact that it did not include restrictive language that would have hindered the Presidents amnesty plan.
I look forward to continuing the Houses fight against the plan.
I have a commitment from our Republican leadership that this process will begin in mid-January.
By that time, we will have a Republican controlled Senate.
It will still be a challenge to reverse the Presidents executive order, but my Republican colleagues and I will not give up this fight.
There were a lot of good things in the bill such as cutting millions of dollars from the EPA and IRS budgets and cutting IRS staffing back to 1989 levels, but unfortunately the problems with the bill outweighed the good.
These fiscally conservative provisions are indicative of the work we will do in the 114th Congress.
Constituent Outreach in Mason:
Eleventh District regional director Nancy Watson will hold a constituent outreach session in Mason next week. She will be in the County Commissioners Courtroom, which is on the first floor of the Mason County Courthouse on Wednesday, December 17th, from 10:00 am
11:00 am.
These constituent outreach sessions are a great opportunity to get help with federal issues such as Medicare or VA benefits. I always post upcoming constituent outreach sessions on my Facebook page. If you are unable to attend one of these sessions, you can always call the regional director who works in your area. All of the regional directors and the areas they cover can be found on my
website .
11th District Residents Honored by the Texas Farm Bureau:
Congratulations to Cade and Jessica Richmond of De Leon, on winning the Texas Farm Bureau's Outstanding Young Farmer &amp; Rancher contest and Ballinger's Sarah "Sally" Buxkemper on receiving the Texas Farm Bureau's prestigious Pioneer Award.
The Richmonds grow hay, raise cattle, and own a rural real estate business.
Sally was instrumental in the development of the Simbrah cattle, which is a combination of the Simmental and Brahman breeds. She was also the first woman to graduate from Oklahoma State University with an Animal Husbandry degree and and the first woman trained by the American Breeders Service in artificial insemination.
I also want to recognize the Richmonds' fellow finalists for Outstanding Young Farmer &amp; Rancher, Andy and Morgan Boyd of Lamesa.
If our nation is to continue to feed and clothe itself, we need men and women like the Richmonds, Sally, and the Boyds to be out there farming and ranching. Thank you for all the hard work that you do.
11th District Residents Competing in the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo:
Saddle bronc rider Jacobs Crawley is one of 10 residents of the 11th District who are competing in the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. Jacobs, who is in the photograph on the left, is one of five who hail from the Cowboy Capital of the World, Stephenville.
More than eight percent of the competitors are from the 11th District. I am pretty sure no other Congressional District can lay claim to more. Tie Down Roper Marty Yates, Barrel Racer Carlee Pierce, and Team Ropers Luke Brown and Turtle Powell also live in Stephenville. Team Roper Patrick Smith, who was born in Midland, Texas, and lives in Lipan, Texas, is also competing in Las Vegas. Team Roper Rich Skelton hails from the Hill Country town of Llano, and Team Roper Dakota Kirchenschlager calls Morgan Mill home. Mullin bull rider J.W. Harris, who is in the picture on the right, and Bluff Dale tie down roper Ryan Watkins are also competing. We make them a little tougher in the 11th District. Suzanne and I are proud of all of you.
As always, you can follow me on
Facebook ,
YouTube , and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
