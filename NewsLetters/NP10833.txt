Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
The recent decision by the Obama administration to give up U.S.
oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN) and the domain name system is alarming.
Even former President Bill Clinton and the left-leaning editorial board
of The Washington Post have expressed concerns about this pending
transition, noting that empowering international actors might very well
facilitate crackdowns on internet freedom. A Clinton-era law called for
this transition; much has changed since then and Clinton's concerns
demonstrate that a transition contemplated when the web was in its
infancy is not necessarily good policy today.
The House Judiciary Committee will be doing a hearing on this issue
soon and I anticipate legislation being offered to prevent this
transition.
Also, the internet tax moratorium is scheduled to expire soon, which is
why I have cosponsored H.R. 3086, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom
Act, which would make the tax moratorium permanent.
It is vital that
Congress safeguard consumer access to the internet by protecting
against the imposition of onerous taxes and fees on the local level.
If the moratorium is allowed to expire, then consumers will start
seeing access charges appear on their bills, indeed, there are a number
of jurisdictions that have already passed new access taxes that will
automatically take effect upon expiration of the moratorium.
We can't
let this happen.
Washington being Washington, there is a movement underway to hold the
extension of the moratorium on internet access taxes hostage to
Congress enacting a tax on internet sales.
The scheme, reportedly
hatched by Senators such as Harry Reid of Nevada, is basically seeking
to leverage the broad bipartisan support in favor maintaining the
internet tax moratorium to push through controversial taxes for goods
purchased on the internet.
This gambit is wrong.
The internet tax
moratorium should be made permanent as soon as possible, with no
strings attached.
The House Judiciary Committee also featured me this week on the
Committee's Member Spotlight page
! My Faithful Execution of the Law Act, which the House passed last
month, has been a large component of the Committee's work to rein in
executive overreach.
Finally, voting for the 2014 Congressional Art Contest has begun! Check
out all of the great entries our office has received from talented
students across the district on Facebook
and vote for your favorites by hitting LIKE. Voting
will end on Friday, April 18 and the 10 submissions receiving the most
likes will be judged later this month by a panel of local art
professionals. Stay tuned for details!
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me
on Facebook
and Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not
hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear
Friend&#8211;
The
recent
decision
by
the
Obama
administration
to
give
up
U.S.
oversight
of
the
Internet
Corporation
for
Assigned
Names
and
Numbers
(ICANN)
and
the
domain
name
system
is
alarming.
Even
former
President
Bill
Clinton
and
the
left-leaning
editorial
board
of
The
Washington
Post
have
expressed
concerns
about
this
pending
transition,
noting
that
empowering
international
actors
might
very
well
facilitate
crackdowns
on
internet
freedom.
A
Clinton-era
law
called
for
this
transition;
much
has
changed
since
then
and
Clinton&#8217;s
concerns
demonstrate
that
a
transition
contemplated
when
the
web
was
in
its
infancy
is
not
necessarily
good
policy
today.
The
House
Judiciary
Committee
will
be
doing
a
hearing
on
this
issue
soon
and
I
anticipate
legislation
being
offered
to
prevent
this
transition.
Also,
the
internet
tax
moratorium
is
scheduled
to
expire
soon,
which
is
why
I
have
cosponsored
H.R.
3086,
the
Permanent
Internet
Tax
Freedom
Act,
which
would
make
the
tax
moratorium
permanent.
It
is
vital
that
Congress
safeguard
consumer
access
to
the
internet
by
protecting
against
the
imposition
of
onerous
taxes
and
fees
on
the
local
level.
If
the
moratorium
is
allowed
to
expire,
then
consumers
will
start
seeing
access
charges
appear
on
their
bills,
indeed,
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions
that
have
already
passed
new
access
taxes
that
will
automatically
take
effect
upon
expiration
of
the
moratorium.
We
can&#8217;t
let
this
happen.
Washington

there
is
a
movement
underway
to
hold
the
extension
of
the
moratorium
on
internet
access
taxes
hostage
to
Congress

a
tax
on
internet
sales.
The
scheme,
reportedly
hatched
by
Senators
such
as
Harry
Reid
of
Nevada,
is
basically
seeking
to
leverage
the
broad
bipartisan
support
in

This
gambit
is
wrong.
The

be
made
permanent
as
soon
as
possible,
with

this
week

My
Faithful

of
the
Law

which
the

passed

month,
has
been
a
large
component
of
the
Committee's
work
to

Finally,
voting
