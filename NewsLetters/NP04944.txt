Today, I held a public town hall meeting in Fairfield County to talk
with Ohioans about a range of issues. No question was off the table,
and we discussed everything from how to bring back jobs and what
Washington needs to do to get the nation's debt under control, to how
we can defeat the threat of ISIS and the Ebola crisis.
When it came to Ebola, we talked about the nurse infected with Ebola
who traveled to Northeast Ohio which reminds us all of the potential
for this disease to affect us more here at home.
Ebola continues to spread throughout West Africa with the
number of infections doubling every 15 to 20 days, and the World Health
Organization projects that over a million people could be infected
within a few months. Over 5,000 people have died from the outbreak, and
the death rate of those infected has risen to 70 percent. Ending this
epidemic requires proactive leadership in the form of a comprehensive
strategy and focused execution.
People told me that they were concerned with the issue. With the virus,
yes, but even more so with a response from our government that has
seemed unfocused, reactionary, and ineffective. I agree and think we
need a more proactive response to this crisis. Here's the five point
plan I have laid out to deal with Ebola:
1. Appoint a single, accountable, high-ranking official to coordinate
the many federal agencies tasked with moving quickly to contain the
virus. After weeks of urging from me and some others, President Obama
recently agreed to take this step. I hope this will improve the U.S.
governmental response.
2. Effective travel restrictions: Since this crisis began, our
government has issued more than 6,000 visas to nationals from the
affected countries in Africa and continues to issue over 100 such visas
every day, on average. This is irresponsible in the current situation.
We should immediately stop issuing new visas to nationals of the
affected countries, and the State Department should cancel all
non-executed visas that have already been issued.
3. Establish regional infectious disease centers: The government should
designate and support a single hospital in each of the ten federal
Medicare Service Areas to receive new Ebola patients. Candidates would
be hospitals that already have containment or isolation wards, and
their medical staff would be specially trained in treating Ebola.
4. Harness the immense generosity and compassion of the American
people: Establish an Ebola Fund that has the stamp of approval and
support of the U.S. government as was done with the 2004 Indian Ocean
tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. This fund could accept donations
and establish a database of volunteer health workers who are willing to
join the efforts on the ground of nonprofit, faith-based and volunteer
groups.
5. Invest in innovation: To help detect, treat and cure this infectious
disease I was pleased that the Administration agreed to my idea that
the federal government should allow hospitals to utilize the best
equipment possible to quickly detect this disease and keep health care
workers safe. That's why I urged the FDA to expedite their review
process and allow Ohio's hospitals to obtain the state-of-the-art
equipment they need to do their important work fighting Ebola.
These five simple steps are not exhaustive, but they would go a long
way toward addressing a growing crisis, ending this epidemic and
putting the American people's minds at ease.

Today,
I
held
a
public
town
hall
meeting
in
Fairfield
County
to
talk
with
Ohioans
about
a
range
of
issues.
No
question
was
off
the
table,
and
we
discussed
everything
from
how
to
bring
back
jobs
and
what
Washington
needs
to
do
to
get
the
nation&#8217;s
debt
under
control,
to
how
we
can
defeat
the
threat
of
ISIS
and
the
Ebola
crisis.
When
it
came
to
Ebola,
we
talked
about
the
nurse
infected
with
Ebola
who
traveled
to
Northeast
Ohio
which
reminds
us
all
of
the
potential
for
this
disease
to
affect
us
more
here
at
home.
Ebola
continues
to
spread
throughout
West
Africa
with
the
number
of
infections
doubling
every
15
to
20
days,
and
the
World
Health
Organization
projects
that
over
a
million
people
could
be
infected
within
a
few
months.
Over
5,000
people
have
died
from
the
outbreak,
and
the
death
rate
of
those
infected
has
risen
to
70
percent.
Ending
this
epidemic
requires
proactive
leadership
in
the
form
of
a
comprehensive
strategy
and
focused
execution.
People
told
me
that
they
were
concerned
with
the
issue.
With
the
virus,
yes,
but
even
more
so
with
a
response
from
our
government
that
has
seemed
unfocused,
reactionary,
and
ineffective.
I
agree
and
think
we
need
a
more
proactive
response
to
this
crisis.
Here's
the
five
point
plan
I
have
laid
out
to
deal
with
Ebola:
1.
Appoint
a
single,
accountable,
high-ranking
official
to
coordinate
the
many
federal
agencies
tasked
with
moving
quickly
to
contain
the
virus.
After
weeks
of
urging
from
me
and
some
others,
President
Obama
recently
agreed
to
take
this
step.
I
hope
this
will
improve
the
U.S.
governmental
response.
2.
Effective
travel
restrictions:
Since
this
crisis
began,
our
government
has
issued
more
than
6,000
visas
to
nationals
from
the
affected
countries
in
Africa
and
continues
to
issue
over
100
such
visas
every
day,
on
average.
This
is
irresponsible
in
the
current
situation.
We
should
immediately
stop
issuing
new
visas
to
nationals
of
the
affected
countries,
and
the
State
Department
should
cancel
all
non-executed
visas
that
have
already
been
issued.
3.
Establish
regional
infectious
disease
centers:
The
government
should
designate
and
support
a
single
hospital
in
each
of
the
ten
federal
Medicare
Service
Areas
to
receive
new
Ebola
patients.
Candidates
would
be
hospitals
that
already
have
containment
or
isolation
wards,
and
their
medical
staff
would
be
specially
trained
in
treating
Ebola.
4.
Harness
the
immense
generosity
and
compassion
of
the
American
people:
Establish
an
Ebola
Fund
that
has
the
stamp
of
approval
and
support
of
the
U.S.
government
as
was
done
with
the
2004
Indian
Ocean
tsunami
and
the
2010
Haiti
earthquake.
This
fund
could
accept
donations
and
establish
a
database
of
volunteer
health
workers
who
are
willing
to
join
the
efforts
on
the
ground
of
nonprofit,
faith-based
and
volunteer
groups.
5.
Invest
in
innovation:
To
help
detect,
treat
and
cure
this
infectious
disease
I
was
pleased
that
the
Administration
agreed
to
my
idea
that
the
federal
government
should
allow
hospitals
to
utilize
the
best
equipment
possible
to
quickly
detect
this
disease
and
keep
health
care
workers
safe.
That&#8217;s
why
I
urged
the
FDA
to
expedite
their
review
process
and
allow
Ohio&#8217;s
hospitals
to
obtain
the
state-of-the-art
equipment
they
need
to
do
their
important
work
fighting
Ebola.
These
five
simple
steps
are
not
exhaustive,
but
they
would
go
a
long
way
toward
addressing
a
growing
crisis,
ending
this
epidemic
and
putting
the
American
people's
minds
at
ease.
