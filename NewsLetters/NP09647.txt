Dear
Friends,
As you may have heard, new information is emerging about alleged secret
waiting lists and mismanagement at Veterans Affairs medical centers
across the country, and I am deeply concerned that West Virginia's
veterans may not be receiving the standard of care that they need and
deserve.
I wrote a letter to President Obama this week
expressing my concerns about these allegations and that rural veterans' needs
must be considered as the administration examines operations at the
VA.
Recent allegations of secret waiting lists at the
Phoenix VA Medical Center and reports of mismanagement at other medical
centers have shaken the trust of our veterans in our nations ability to
follow through on the promises we have made. The men and women who have
served in our armed forces have been promised medical care through
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and our nation must honor that
promise, I wrote.
In the letter, I endorsed a proposal
from House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) to
form an independent, bipartisan commission on VA access and veteran
harm. I also asked the president to ensure that rural veterans needs are
being met as the administration investigates the beleaguered U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs.
Our disabled veterans have to
rely on their local communities for transportation to the medical
center for treatment, which typically requires setting up appointments
for multiple veterans at the same medical center to reduce the amount of
trips taken to the VA. Due to the infrequency of available shared
transportation, a veteran may have to spend multiple days away from home
just to receive medical care," I wrote.

UPWARD BOUND
GRADUATION
I had the privilege last
Saturday of speaking at the Upward Bound graduation at West Virginia
University Institute of Technology in Montgomery. Upward Bound gives
first-generation college students the tools and support necessary to
succeed in higher education, with counselors mentoring these students
starting in high school.
While college life and academics may
be difficult, schools and counselors are ready to help these students
navigate the challenges of higher education. With the support of
family, friends, teachers and counselors, these students are ready to
pursue higher education, and I wish them all the best for the next four
years.
Thank you for reading
my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in
the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
