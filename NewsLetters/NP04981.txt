Friend &ndash; We can&rsquo;t just hold our breath and wait to see who wins the Senate.
It&rsquo;s too close for that. We need your help immediately. Here&rsquo;s why:
Six outstanding Democratic women have a real chance to win their elections!
If we win these races, Democrats will keep control of the Senate.
Our voter mobilization project is giving Democrats the edge &ndash; but so many of these races are so close, so we need to work even harder.
That&rsquo;s why I need you to join me today. If we go after every single vote, I know we will win.
But the DSCC&rsquo;s final Get Out the Vote funding deadline hits in just 24 hours.
Will you pitch in to keep the Senate blue? Your gift will be triple-matched until the monthly deadline in 24 hours.

Or donate another amount.
These races are going to be unbelievably tight. They could be won or lost by a few thousand &ndash; or even a few hundred &ndash; votes.
But here&rsquo;s the good news:
We can win every one of these races &ndash; but only if we get can get every possible Democratic voter to the polls.
It all comes down to whether or not we have the resources we need to get this done. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for your help right now.
Far too much is at stake in this election to leave the outcome up to chance.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling on you to step up immediately &ndash; please pitch in to protect our Democratic Senate majority. Remember: The final Get Out the Vote funding deadline is in just 24 hours.
Thank you,
Michelle Obama
