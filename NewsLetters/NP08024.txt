Dear Patriots,
Our Founding Fathers escaped tyranny
and oppression in their pursuit of freedom, and their journey
culminated in the great experiment of democracy that we are carrying out
today.
Founded on the ideals of individual liberty and independence,
we as a nation must remain ever vigilant to maintain the freedoms we
have fought for and to preserve democracy at home and around the
world.
It is important to remember that our freedom is
not free. We must continue to thank and support the men and women, past
and present, who have answered the call to defend America and her
constitution. It is essential that our support for these brave men and
women, who volunteer to protect our freedoms, continues in order to
maintain a strong national security in the face of an increasingly
dangerous world.
It is they who keep our nation safe and stand as the
beacon of freedom throughout the world.
The 4th of
July has always been a time to gather and celebrate with friends and
family.
This Independence Day, I hope that we take time out of our
festivities to reflect on what has made America great. As Congress
works to address critical issues across the world, I will work to ensure
the dreams of our founders are not neglected and remain as the
guiding principles, intended as they were, to limit government and maintain
our independence and individual liberties.
We
salute those who have served this country with honor and continue to do so.
I wish each of you a Happy Fourth of July and God bless the men and
women of our military, and God bless the United States of
America
Happy Independence
Day.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
