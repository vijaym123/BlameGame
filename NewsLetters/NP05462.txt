Listen, we need your urgent support. Here&rsquo;s why:
-- Every piece of data shows our race TIED
-- Republican outside groups are spending more in our race than any in the ENTIRE country
-- Our last fundraising deadline of the election is at midnight and we&rsquo;re coming up short.
Look, this is it. With the millions being spent against us, it&rsquo;s going to take real grassroots power to come out on top.
That means we need each and every person reading this to chip in for Ami. But only gifts before midnight can count towards hitting our fundraising goal.
Can we count you in?
