Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

House Begins NewSession Of Congress With Flurry Of Activity
The 2nd Session of the 113th Congress began last week with the House of
Representatives tackling a large slate of legislative priorities.
Despite a veto threat from the President, the House on Friday passed
H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, 291-122.
I supported the legislation
, which would give the Department of Health and Human Services two
business days to notify Americans in the event that their personally
identifiable information is breached or compromised on the health care
exchanges.
The Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation into Obamacare's
failed rollout has raised serious questions about the functionality and
readiness of the law. For months, administration officials testified
that implementation was on track, but uncovered documents reveal that
was clearly not the case behind the scenes. Now, the administration's
insistence that everything is secure is rightfully met with skepticism.
H.R. 2279: Thursday, the House approved H.R. 2279
by a
225-188 margin. I also supported that legislation, a product of a
series of bills advanced by the Energy and Commerce Committee,
including the Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act, the Federal
and State Partnership for Environmental Protection Act, and the Federal
Facility Accountability Act. The legislation seeks to modernize
existing federal law, reduce red tape, and increase the role of the
states in environmental cleanups under the Comprehensive Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
Key Coal Vote Upcoming: I am an original cosponsor of the Electricity
Security and Affordability Act, H.R. 3826
, which was introduced Thursday in the
House and Senate. The bill offers a reasonable alternative to the
Environmental Protection Agency's proposed greenhouse gas standards for
new power plants and the agency's planned regulations for existing
power plants.
The Energy and Power Subcommittee, on which I sit, is expected to vote
on the bipartisan legislation Tuesday. H.R. 3826 would require that any
greenhouse gas standards set by the EPA for new coal-fired plants are
able to be achieved by commercial power plants operating in the real
world, including highly efficient plants that utilize the most modern,
state-of-the-art emissions-control technologies. The legislation also
provides that Congress would set the effective date for the EPA's
expected regulations for existing plants.
By exceeding its legal authority, the EPA is, in effect, making it
impossible to build a new power plant that would use coal, one of our
most abundant and affordable resources and the lifeblood of so many
communities in rural America.
Show Some Heart To Heroes
My office is again sponsoring "Valentines for Heroes," a program where
we collect valentines for distribution throughout the region to
veterans and those currently serving in the military.
Thousands of valentines have come into my offices every year since we
began Valentines for Heroes. Constituents have been overwhelmingly
generous and supportive of our military men and women, past and present.
School classes, church youth groups, home schoolers, and individuals
have all helped brighten a soldier or veterans day.
This year, valentines will be accepted via mail or in person at my
district offices until February 7.
The few basic rules to follow are to return signed valentines without
addressing them to a specific person, without signing your last name or
including your address, and without sealing them in individual
envelopes. All valentines are reviewed for content and appropriateness.
Nearly Two Dozen From District Nominated To Military Academies
On Dec. 22 in Effingham, I hosted a reception in honor of my military
academy nominees, including (left to right) Connor Cunningham of
Edwardsville, Grant Camillo of Highland, Zachary Auer of Collinsville,
and Spencer Murphy of Highland.
Nominations from the 15th Congressional District to the nation's
military service academies have been finalized for the Class of 2018. I
have put forward the names of 22 young men and women, and the academies
themselves will make the final determination regarding whether a
nominee receives an appointment to attend that academy.
The academies look at academics, leadership, and physical fitness in
order to assure a young person is well-rounded and able to cope with
the uniqueness of attending a military school. As a West Point
graduate, I am very proud of these young men and women for considering
an academy for their college choice and am grateful for the honor of
being able to nominate.
The four military academies that require Congressional nominations are:
United States Military Academy, West Point, New York; United States Air
Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado; United States Naval Academy,
Annapolis, Maryland; and United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings
Point, New York.
High school juniors, college students, or current members of the
military who are residents of the 15th District and wish to attend an
academy beginning in 2015 can request a nomination packet by writing
Congressman John Shimkus, 15 Professional Park Drive, Maryville, IL
62062. Those packets with complete requirements will be sent out in
late summer. Potential nominees complete applications with both my
office and each individual academy.
Here is this year's full list of nominees, with their hometowns:
Hunter Adkins, Gifford; Zachary Auer, Collinsville; Zachary Bell,
Trenton; Grant Camillo, Highland; Joshua Campbell, Dieterich; Mary
Campbell, St. Joseph; Paul Coen, Golconda; Dakota Couch, Humboldt;
Connor Cunningham, Edwardsville; Noah Dart, Newton; James Davis,
Dieterich; Landon Ghast, Newton; Alex Kaper, Mahomet; Robert Lowery,
Boles; Austin Mettitt, Chrisman; Spencer Murphy, Highland; Cort
Rodgers, Mt. Carmel; Reed Scheve, Metropolis; Matthew Sefton,
Brownstown; Brockton Smith, Tuscola; Nicco Stepina, Casey; and Matthew
White, Shelbyville.

Sincerely,
John Shimkus, Member of Congress
Coming To Your Town
Open Office Hours provide the opportunity for you to meet with me
one-one-one in your hometown.
On Wednesday, January 22, 2014, I will be holding Open Office Hours
with Illinois State Representative David Reis in his Olney office, 219
East Main Street, from 1-2:30 p.m. For an appointment, please call my
Effingham office at (217) 347-7947.
On Thursday, January 23, 2014, I will be holding Open Office Hours in
the City Council Chambers of the Breese City Hall, 500 North 1st
Street, from 1:30-3 p.m. For an appointment, please call my Maryville
office at (618) 288-7190.
Disaster Assistance Update
On Thursday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced
its denial of the State of Illinois' application for a disaster
declaration for public assistance in the recovery from the Nov. 17
severe weather.
I am disappointed the declaration was denied. I know that the affected
communities had enormous expenses in cleaning up and getting basic
services back up and running after the tornadoes. I will support the
state's appeal of this decision.
Individuals affected by the storms still have until Jan. 27 to register
for disaster assistance, but that doesn't mean help is ending.
Those who register by Jan. 27 may continue to receive federal disaster
assistance after this date, including temporary housing, home repairs,
financial help for damaged cars and personal contents, and low-interest
disaster loans from the Small Business Administration.
Survivors with questions about their applications can continue calling
FEMA's helpline at 800-621-FEMA (3362), 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a
week, after Jan. 27. Face-to-face help continues to be available at the
Brookport Disaster Recovery Center at the Brookport Library on U.S.
Highway 45 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
In addition to applying for assistance via the FEMA helpline and the
Disaster Recovery Center, survivors can also apply online at
www.fema.gov
.

Key

Upcoming :
I
am

H.R.
3826 , which
was

Thursday

for
existing
power
plants.
The
Energy
and
Power
Subcommittee,
on
which
I
sit,
is
expected
to
vote
on the
bipartisan
legislation
Tuesday.
H.R.
3826
would
require
that
any

By

the
EPA
is,
in
effect, making
it
impossible
to
build
a
new
power
plant
that
would
use
coal,
one
of
our
most
abundant

Show
Some
Heart
To
Heroes
My
office is
again
sponsoring
&#8220;Valentines
for

a
program
where
we collect
valentines
for
distribution
throughout
the
region
to
veterans
and
those
currently
serving
in
the
military.
Thousands
of
valentines
have
come
into
my
offices
every
year
since
we
began
Valentines
for
Heroes.
Constituents
have
been
overwhelmingly
generous
and
supportive
of
our
military
men
and
women,
past
and
present.
School
classes,
church
youth
groups,
home
schoolers,
and
individuals
have
all
helped
brighten
a
soldier
or
veterans
day.
This
year,
valentines
will
be
accepted
via
mail
or
in
person
at
my
district
offices
until
February
7.
The
few
basic
rules
to
follow
are
to
return
signed
valentines
without
addressing
them
to
a
specific
person,
without
signing
your
last
name
or
including
your
address,
and
without
sealing
them
in
individual
envelopes.
All
valentines
are
reviewed
for
content
