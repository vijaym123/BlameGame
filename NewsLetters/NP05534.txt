I wouldn&rsquo;t email you twice in one day if it wasn&rsquo;t important:
-- A new poll just showed our race against Bobby Schilling within a single digit
-- Days later, Karl Rove announced a massive attack campaign targeting me Here&rsquo;s what that means:
our goals just skyrocketed. And we need your grassroots support to keep pace.
David, I hate to ask over and over -- but will you chip in to help set the record straight?
Every dollar helps.
