&ldquo;Bet on a GOP Senate majority&rdquo; --
Politico , 10/29/2014
Dear Friend, Polls open in less than 48 hours.
Politico
is telling us to bet on big GOP wins -- but Ed is betting big on you.
And as long as we reach our $25,OOO goal before Election Day, I know we&rsquo;ll have the resources we need to get out the vote. All we need is some grassroots financial support. There isn&rsquo;t much time left to make a difference in this campaign. Pitch in $5, $10, or more if you can, and help us finish strong.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Everything we&rsquo;ve been working towards for nearly 2 years comes down to the results we&rsquo;re able to put up in two days&rsquo; time. Not surprisingly, this is the most expensive week for any campaign.
We&rsquo;ve been steadily hitting our fundraising goals all year long, and we can&rsquo;t afford to break that good habit now.
Give $5 and help us finish the job of sending Ed back to the Senate.
Thank you.
Colleen
