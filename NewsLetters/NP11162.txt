News from Congressman Scott Peters
March 27, 2014
Dear Friend,
I love being back in San Diego and I was fortunate to be here last
week, talking to constituents about how we solve our nation's problems
and make our region even stronger. I wanted to share some of those
activities with you.
Fighting for Basic Scientific Research Funding
One of my top priorities in Congress has been to protect and expand
funding for basic scientific research, mostly through grants at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). San Diego receives 25% of all NIH
grants in California, and we're home 42,000 life-science jobs. We risk
losing our place as the top country for scientific innovation if we
don't protect funding for scientific research.
I was proud to meet with members of our medical research community and
my colleague, Rep. Susan Davis, at a roundtable discussion and press
conference about the need for NIH funding. Watch KUSI's coverage of the
event by clicking the image below.
Visiting the Marine Corps Recruit Depot
Whenever I get an extended time in San Diego I try to visit a military
installation to see the dedicated work our servicemen and women are
performing. On my visit last week to MCRD, I met with Brigadier General
Bierman and base leadership and was honored to see their Silent Drill
Platoon in action.
Feeding San Diego
Another stop was at the warehouse of Feeding America's San Diego
chapter. This organization has a food center that provides meals to
thousands of local families in our communities. As an advocate for
policies that increase food security, I was eager to reengage and thank
the group's leaders and volunteers.
Promoting Drought Resiliency
It isn't news to you that California is in the midst of a drought.
While San Diegans have gone to great lengths to reduce water usage in
recent years, we must do more to diversify our water supply to sustain
us in future dry years. San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria
and I were on KUSI to talk about the effort to find new sources of
water, including recycling and desalination. Click the image below to

Leading in Cyber Security
San Diego is home to a unique confluence of world-class research
universities and a large military presence that is increasingly focused
on cyber security. I was proud to lead the effort with local economic
development leaders and San Diego Mayor Faulconer to launch the Cyber
Center of Excellence that will help facilitate regional growth in this
sector. Already cyber security has a $1.515 billion economic impact in
our region, supporting more than 13,000 jobs. Watch NBC 7's coverage of

Stay Connected
I hope you'll stay connected with what I'm working on. Like my Facebook
page, follow me on Twitter, add my Google + page
to your circles, or visit my website
for further information.
One of the most important jobs I have in Congress is providing a number
of constituent services. As always if you have any questions, are
having trouble with a federal agency, or want to weigh in on a
particular issue, feel free to email me or call either of my offices at
202-225-0508 (Washington) or 858-455-5550 (San Diego). I look forward
to hearing from you.
