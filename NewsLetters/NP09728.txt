Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week, I held a press conference at VFW Post 2391 in St. Augustine
to discuss the unacceptable state of the VA and the pressing need to
restore accountability.
In order to help give our veterans the care that they deserve, I have
co-sponsored the VA Management Accountability Act, which would give the
Secretary of the VA the necessary authority to hold poorly-performing
VA managers accountable for their failures. If our senior officials at
the VA are not getting the job done, then they need to be removed.
News 4 Jax was there to cover this important issue - watch their news
report by clicking here.
This week, the House passed two resolutions related to the IRS
targeting scandal. One resolution holds former IRS official Lois Lerner
in contempt of Congress and the other calls on Attorney General Eric
Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS scandal.
Lois Lerner has obstructed Congressional inquiries into her role in the
illicit targeting of conservative groups by the IRS. I fully support
holding her in contempt of Congress for her refusal to answer questions
surrounding the malfeasance of the IRS.
Furthermore, the same Department of Justice that inquired into the
possibility of using criminal prosecutions against conservative groups
has produced zero results after a year's worth of investigation into
the IRS abuses. The appointment of a special prosecutor is long
overdue.
26 Democrats joined with Republicans to demand that one be
appointed.
Please take a moment to watch my floor speech on this
resolution by clicking here.
On Thursday, the House voted to establish a House Select Committee on
Benghazi. I am pleased that the House will move forward with a select
committee to investigate the attack that killed four Americans,
including Ambassador Chris Stevens. I applaud the appointment of
Congressman Trey Gowdy to serve as chairman of this committee-
he is a
principled former prosecutor who will doggedly pursue justice.
Rep. DeSantis speaking at a press conference regarding the need for
accountability at the VA.
On Thursday, I introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity
(HERO) Act, which is the House companion to the reform bill introduced
in the Senate by Sen. Mike Lee earlier this year.
The value of a traditional college degree has been declining due to the
rising costs of higher education, increasing student loan debt, and
declining job opportunities. Indeed, a startling 40% of recent college
graduates have ended up in jobs that do not even require a degree. Why
take on significant debt only to obtain a job you could have had out of
high school? Of course, millions of students incur debt and yet fail to
graduate with a bachelor's degree.
At the same time, given the nature of our economy, the acquisition of
advanced knowledge and skills is more important than ever. Those who
accumulate knowledge and skills will see enhanced job opportunities,
higher earning potential, and better prospects for upward mobility.
Those who do not will likely face the prospect of stagnant wages and
diminished opportunities.
Allowing students to reach their full potential requires us to
recognize the reality that obtaining a college degree is not the only
way to obtain knowledge and skills. Indeed, it is not the way that most
Americans - from the millions who do not graduate from college to the
millions more who do not attend college at all - obtain knowledge and
skills. From online learning courses to vocational schools and
apprenticeships in skilled trades, there exists the potential for a
dynamic alternative market for knowledge.
Senator Lee and I believe that allowing States to experiment with their
own accreditation systems will help to unleash these potentially
powerful alternatives. States could choose to accredit more than
traditional degree-conferring colleges; they could also accredit
apprenticeships, specialty schools, professional certifications, and
even individual courses. This way, students would be able to use Title
IV loans and grants to gain access to the skills they need at lower
prices and on a better timeline.
As Senator Lee pointed out, the HERO Act "would not only make the cost
of higher education more affordable, but also make it easier for
students to customize their own education and gain the specific skills
they need to compete in today's economy. The HERO Act will open the
floodgates of innovation, providing greater choice, access, and
opportunity for America's students."

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week,
I
held
a
press
conference
at
VFW
Post
2391
in
St.
Augustine
to
discuss
the
unacceptable
state
of
the
VA
and
the
pressing
need
to
restore
accountability.
In
order
to
help
give
our
veterans
the
care
that
they
deserve,
I
have
co-sponsored
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
which
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
VA
the
necessary
authority
to
hold
poorly-performing
VA
managers
accountable
for
their
failures.
If
our
senior
officials
at
the
VA
are
not
getting
the
job
done,
then
they
need
to
be
removed.
News
4
Jax
was
there
to
cover
this
important
issue
&#8211;
watch
their
news
report
by
clicking
here.
This
week,
the
House
passed
two
resolutions
related
to
the
IRS
targeting
scandal.
One
resolution
holds
former
IRS
official
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
and
the
other
calls
on
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
to
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
to
investigate
the
IRS
scandal.
Lois
Lerner
has
obstructed
Congressional
inquiries
into
her
role
in
the
illicit
targeting
of
conservative
groups
by
the
IRS.
I
fully
support
holding
her
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
her
refusal
to
answer
questions
surrounding
the
malfeasance
of
the
IRS.
Furthermore,
the
same
Department
of
Justice
that
inquired
into
the
possibility
of
using
criminal
prosecutions
against
conservative
groups
has
produced
zero
results
after
a
year's
worth
of
investigation
into
the
IRS
abuses.
The
appointment
of
a
special
prosecutor
is
long
overdue.
26
Democrats
joined
with
Republicans
to
demand
that
one
be
appointed.
Please
take
a
moment
to
watch
my
floor
speech
on
this
resolution
by
clicking
here.
On
Thursday,
the
House
voted
to
establish
a
House
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi.
I
am
pleased
that
the
House
will
move
forward
with
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
attack
that
killed
four
Americans,
including
Ambassador
Chris
Stevens.
I
applaud
the
appointment
of
Congressman
Trey
Gowdy
to
serve
as
chairman
of
this
committee-
he
is
a
principled
former
prosecutor
who
will
doggedly
pursue
justice.
Rep.
DeSantis
speaking
at
a
press
conference
regarding
the
need
for
accountability
at
the
VA.
On
Thursday,
I
introduced
the
Higher
Education
Reform
and
Opportunity
(HERO)
Act,
which
is
the
House
companion
to
the
reform
bill
introduced
in
the
Senate
by
Sen.
Mike
Lee
earlier
this
year.
The
value
of
a
traditional
college
degree
has
been
declining
due
to
the
rising
costs
of
higher
education,
increasing
student
loan
debt,
and
declining
job
opportunities.
Indeed,
a
startling
40%
of
recent
college
graduates
have
ended
up
in
jobs
that
do
not
even
require
a
degree.
Why
take
on
significant
debt
only
to
obtain
a
job
you
could
have
had
out
of
high
school?
Of
course,
millions
of
students
incur
debt
and
yet
fail
to
graduate
with
a
bachelor's
degree.
At
the
same
time,
given
the
nature
of
our
economy,
the
acquisition
of
advanced
knowledge
and
skills
is
more
important
than
ever.
Those
who
accumulate
knowledge
and
skills
will
see
enhanced
job
opportunities,
higher
earning
potential,
and
better
prospects
for
upward
mobility.
Those
who
do
not
will
likely
face
the
prospect
of
stagnant
wages
and
diminished
opportunities.
Allowing
students
to
reach
their
full
potential
requires
us
to
recognize
the
reality
that
obtaining
a
college
degree
is
not
the
only
way
to
obtain
knowledge
and
skills.
Indeed,
it
is
not
the
way
that
most
Americans
-
from
the
millions
who
do
not
graduate
from
college
to
the
millions
more
who
do
not
attend
college
at
all
-
obtain
knowledge
and
skills.
From
online
learning
courses
to
vocational
schools
and
apprenticeships
in
skilled
trades,
there
exists
the
potential
for
a
dynamic
alternative
market
for
knowledge.
Senator
Lee
and
I
believe
that
allowing
States
to
experiment
with
their
own
accreditation
systems
will
help
to
unleash
these
potentially
powerful
alternatives.
States
could
choose
to
accredit
more
than
traditional
degree-conferring
colleges;
they
could
also
accredit
apprenticeships,
specialty
schools,
professional
certifications,
and
even
individual
courses.
This
way,
students
would
be
able
to
use
Title
IV
loans
and
grants
to
gain
access
to
the
skills
they
need
at
lower
prices
and
on
a
better
timeline.
As
Senator
Lee
pointed
out,
the
HERO
Act
"would
not
only
make
the
cost
of
higher
education
more
affordable,
but
also
make
it
easier
for
students
to
customize
their
own
education
and
gain
the
specific
skills
they
need
to
compete
in
today's
economy.
The
HERO
Act
will
open
the
floodgates
of
innovation,
providing
greater
choice,
access,
and
opportunity
for
America's
students."
