Friend -
Last night, the House of Representatives passed
legislation
to extend in-state tuition rates to Veterans who are attending public universities or colleges on the Post-9/11 GI Bill, regardless of whether they have been stationed in a state long enough to establish residency. While the Senate must now take up this legislation, I was pleased to see this bill pass the House in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. As my friend and Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Congressman Jeff Miller said, "The men and women who serve this nation did not just defend citizens of their own home states but the citizens of all 50 states," and its not only a privilege, but a duty, to recognize them in all 50 states.
