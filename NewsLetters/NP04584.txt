Chairman Miller Welcomes Freshman Class of 114 th
Congress
WASHINGTON D.C.
&#8211; Today, as Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, the U.S. House of Representatives&#8217; committee responsible for the New Member Orientation Program for Members-elect, Rep. Candice Miller (MI-10) welcomed the
freshman class of the 114 th
Congress.
After kicking off the Committee&#8217;s orientation program, Rep. Miller issued the following statement:
&#8220;Today, I had the distinct honor of welcoming the freshman class of the 114 th
Congress to Washington, D.C. to participate in the New Member Orientation Program. As Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, one of
my primary responsibilities is to help Members-elect understand the mechanics of becoming a Member, which includes setting up D.C. and District offices, hiring staff, and knowing the rules and procedures of the House, so that they are ready to serve their
constituents as soon as they are sworn into office.
&#8220;This freshman class consists of an extremely talented, eager and diverse group of individuals from across the country &#8211; including our five new Members-elect from the great state of Michigan.
I look forward to serving with them, as
colleagues, and working together to address the challenges facing our nation.&#8221;
