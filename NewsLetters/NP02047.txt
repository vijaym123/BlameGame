Rubio: Obama Administrations
Treatment Of Israel Is A
Historic And Tragic
Mistake
On Thursday, Marco delivered
a
Senate floor speech
regarding the
U.S.-Israel relationship, the Obama
Administrations abandonment of
Israel and the importance of standing
with our allies.
Rubio: This is outrageous. It
is irresponsible. It is dangerous, and
it betrays the commitment this nation
has made to the right of a Jewish state
to exist in peace. No people on Earth
want peace more than the people of
Israel. No people have suffered more at
the hands of this violence and this
terrorism than the people of Israel.
And they need Americas support,
unconditionally.
I hope the bipartisan nature
of our support of Israel is
reinvigorated. I hope that once again
this body, this Congress, and this
government will recommit itself to this
extraordinarily important relationship.
Because if America doesnt stand
with Israel, who would we stand with?
If Israel, a democracy, a strong
American ally on the international
stage, if they are not worthy of our
unconditional support, then what ally
of ours around the world can feel safe
in their alliance with us?

Rubio: U.S. Cannot Turn A Blind Eye
To Cuban Regimes Role In
Repression Of Venezuelan People
In
a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing
Tuesday, Marco, the chairman
of the Subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian
Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and
Global Womens Issues, pressed the
Obama Administration to broaden sanctions
on human rights violators in Venezuela
and highlighted the role the Cuban regime
plays in the repression of the Venezuelan
people. An excerpt from the hearing is
below:
Rubio: And so, at the end of
the day, it truly is amazing to me that
in this hearing the individual
responsible for this portfolio, on
behalf of the U.S. government, refuses
to state on the record that the Cuban
government is intricately involved in
helping the Venezuelan government to
repress its own people. This is a claim
weve been willing to make about
multiple countries around the world.
This is a claim weve made about
the Cubans in the past. This is a claim
that weve made about the Cubans
and that the State Department has
acknowledged
up until December
of last year when suddenly they stopped
talking about it.
I just find it unbelievable
that we cannot get somebody from the
Department of State who is responsible
for this portfolio to openly
acknowledge that the Cuban government
is providing extraordinary assistance
to the Venezuelan government in
suppressing the people of Venezuela. I
hope that youll reconsider. I
hope that the State Department will
reconsider acknowledging that because
it undermines our credibility as a
nation to turn a blind eye to the role
that the Cuban government is playing in
the suppression of the Venezuelan
people.

Rubio: FCC Net Neutrality Order
Opens Door To Foreign Government
Restriction Of The Internet
During
a
Senate Commerce, Science, and
Transportation Committee hearing
Wednesday, Marco, in an exchange with Tom
Wheeler, Chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC),
expressed his concern that the
FCCs new net neutrality order
gives foreign governments an excuse to
restrict the Internet in their own
nations.
Marco pointed out that countries who
restrict the Internet, like Russia and
China, do not have a First Amendment or
any sort of societal or
governmental commitment to the notion of
free speech. An excerpt from the
hearing is below:
Rubio: But as you just said
at the outset of your statement,
youre saying this is no more a
regulation than the First Amendment,
the problem is Putin doesnt have
a First Amendment and neither does
China. And I understand youre
meeting and talking with Europeans, but
the ones were really concerned
about is China and Russia and others
who already control the Internet
because they are not constrained by a
First Amendment, and, in fact,
dont even understand the
concept. In particular, in China, of
this notion of free speech, when you
make the argument to them, for example
as youve made now, that we are
not regulating content, this is for
them, literally, a foreign concept.
They dont have a First
Amendment, nor do they have any sort of
societal or governmental commitment to
the notion of free speech. What they
see is a governmental agency of the
United States involved in setting terms
for how the Internet can be provided,
maybe even if its content neutral. And
I think it gives them an excuse to say,
If your government can do it,
our government can do it
too.
