Dear
Friends:
Thursday evening, the Veterans Access to Care through Choice,
Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 was passed in the Senate with a
vote of 91-3. It will now move to the White House to await President
Obamas signature.
This important piece of
legislation includes a number of provisions that will fix the longstanding
dysfunction within the VA healthcare system. Currently, at least 42
facilities are being investigated by the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) Office of Inspector General (IG) for allegations regarding
inappropriate scheduling policies. It has been reported that at least 40
patients died waiting for care at the Phoenix VA Healthcare System, and
the IG revealed in an interim report that veterans in Phoenix have been
waiting an average of 115 days just to see a primary care
doctor.
The fact that our veterans have been systematically
mistreated and inadequately cared for is simply unacceptable. This bill
will improve the VAs scheduling systems, training and hiring methods,
and set performance standards and metrics for wait time and care, which
will be evaluated by the veterans who receive it. Furthermore, this
law authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote any
individual from the Senior Executive Service if the Secretary
determines their performance-now based on definitive metrics-warrants such a
removal.
Additionally, this bill will initiate a program
allowing veterans to have the option of receiving care through non-VA
providers in certain circumstances. This will make it easier for
veterans who live far from care centers, or who are unable to obtain an
appointment.
The severe and deep-rooted problems at the VA
required a complete overhaul. This legislation promises to implement
changes that would be critical for introducing individual accountability to
the VA, something that clearly has been absent for some time. I am
happy and relieved to see these changes take place, and I will continue
to support the push for full and immediate accountability by the VA
leadership.
In other VA news, the Senate this Tuesday
unanimously confirmed Robert McDonald by a vote of 97-0 to be the next
Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He will replace Eric Shinseki, who resigned in
May. McDonald is a former army officer who graduated from the United
States Military Academy at West Point, and he most recently served as
the CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble. McDonald has promised to take
"immediate actions" in his first 90 days, and I am confident that his
military service and business background will render him a
success.
Very Truly Yours,
