Ebola Epidemic
The
increasingly disturbing news about the spread of Ebola in West Africa and
the growing number of Ebola patients here in the United States is
understandably making people very uneasy. This sense of unease reflects,
in no small measure, a lack of confidence in our federal governments
uncertain response to this crisis.
The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has not bolstered peoples confidence that it
is, in fact, fully capable of
controlling
and
preventing
Ebola here in the United States.
In this well-reasoned column
Washington Post
columnist Michael
Gerson
discusses
the need for a better
response.
What we do
not
need, however, is an
Ebola czar. Unfortunately, the President not only decided to create
that position, he filled it with someone with absolutely no experience in
public health or medicine. Personally, I believe Dr. Anthony Fauci of
the National Institutes of Health, would have been the perfect person
to coordinate our efforts, without the need for another
czar.
American Troops Already Making a Difference in Ebola
Fight
In Liberia, American troops are already hard at
work , essentially rebuilding the nations health
infrastructure from the ground up.
The Defense
Department has assured me that while our troops are helping the
most-affected African countries fight the epidemic, they will
not
be caring for Ebola patients directly.
I am
sure you share my pride in our troops as they work to contain the spread
of Ebola and save countless lives as a
result!
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew: a Giant Job Killer
The
Obama Administrations continued refusal to recognize that the best way
to create jobs is to unleash the private sector from excessive
regulations and high taxes is one of the major reasons we are stuck in the
slowest recovery from recession since World War
II.
Todays must-read
editorial
in the
Wall Street Journal
examines why The Obama
Administration keeps wondering why businesses dont invest more and why
it gets no credit for what it claims is its wonderful economic
recovery.
ISIS Approaching Baghdad
The
United States limited air campaign to degrade and then destroy
ISIS does not yet appear to be achieving its goal. Brave American airmen
are risking their lives every time they take to the sky.
But the
jury is still out whether these actions have degraded or destroyed
this terrorist threat.
As the
New York
Times
reported
earlier this week,
ISIS is apparently preparing to lay siege to a town just 25 miles from
Baghdad. This is a disturbing sign that the fight against ISIS is far
from over.
Richard Cohen: Obama must be
feared as well as admired
Perhaps the fundamental
weakness of President Obamas foreign policy is the fact that Americas
enemies dont believe he has the stomach to defend Americas interests
overseas.
The cumulative effect of too many apologies, erased
red lines, and half measures has created the perception that the
United States has become a paper
tiger.
Washington Post
columnist Richard Cohen
describes
why the United States must be both admired and feared
if our enemies are going take us seriously.
Salute:
Richard Eastman
Congratulations to Richard
Eastman of Morristown who was sworn in on October 12 th
as
Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army (CASA) from New Jersey. Rich, a
retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel, will serve as a special
Army ambassador representing our state. In this important position,
he will work with Army commanders and with the Secretary of the Army on
issues affecting New Jersey.
I was honored to nominate
Rich to be one of New Jerseys two CASAs and was not at all surprised
when he was appointed to this post by Army Secretary John
McHugh.
Among the criteria for appointment is that the CASA be a United
States citizen of outstanding character, integrity, and patriotism; has
a deep interest in military affairs; and, is a leader in community
affairs. Richs 24 years in the Army (active and reserve), coupled with
his service as the Morris County Chamber of Commerces Military Liaison
for the past 12 years, make him an ideal person for this volunteer
job!
I salute Richard Eastman for his long record of service
to our nation and for his willingness to serve as CASA for New
Jersey.
Salute: Kinnelon Fire
Department
This past Sunday, the Kinnelon Volunteer Fire Company celebrated 50
years of pancake breakfasts!
Very few organizations are able to
maintain a tradition such as this for 10 years, let alone 50. Their
long record of success is a tribute to the volunteers who have
sustained this tradition.
The success of these types of breakfasts
is also a measure of the strong support and gratitude that the members
of our communities have for the volunteer members of the fire
departments who protect life and property.
