Wicker Troubled by Government
Audit
of HealthCare.gov
Recently Released Report
Shows Unresolved Security
Risks
October 1 marked the one-year anniversary of HealthCare.gov,
the centerpiece of the $2.1 billion insurance enrollment system created
by the President's health-care law.
Americans vividly remember
the frustration of long wait times and technical malfunctions during
the website's disastrous rollout last year.
As the second
enrollment period approaches on November 15, HealthCare.gov is still cause
for concern.
Administration Did Not Heed
Warnings
Last month, a
troubling report released by the Government Accountability Office revealed
that HealthCare.gov has security risks that could compromise Americans'
personal information and privacy.
The independent agency said the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not adequately
addressed these weaknesses and remained silent on significant security
risks when the website was first launched.
Just this summer, a
hacker was successful in uploading malicious software to
HealthCare.gov.
The breach went undetected for more than a
month.
The Obama Administration has repeatedly
tried to downplay problems with HealthCare.gov and the health-care
law itself.
Last year, both Kathleen Sebelius, the former
secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and CMS Administrator Marilyn
Tavenner assured lawmakers that the website was secure.
Congress
later learned that cybersecurity and technology officials at CMS and
HHS had concerns with security testing and warned against the full
launch of the site on October 1, 2013.
More Americans Hurt by Law
Than Helped
In addition
to technological issues, Americans have yet to see lower health-care
bills.
Instead of reducing costs by an average of $2,500 per
family annually, as President Obama repeatedly promised, premiums have
jumped by an average of $3,459 since he took office.
Moreover,
tens of thousands of Americans are expected to see their insurance plans
have been canceled this year.
They join more than 2 million
people who have already lost health coverage, despite the President's
assurance that "if you like the plan you have, you can keep it."
Adding insult to injury, about 30 million Americans are still uninsured.
The negative fallout helps
explain the health-care law's unpopularity.
According to a
recent Gallup poll, a rising number of Americans say that the law has done
more harm than good for their families.
A majority disapproves
of the law overall.
Challenges Loom for Tax
Season
The implementation
of Obamacare continues to cause confusion.
The Internal Revenue
Service, which is administering the law's punitive tax provisions,
recently released drafts of new tax forms needed to implement the law's
subsidies and exemptions.
The complex paperwork will pose
additional burdens for individuals and employers during next year's tax
season.
Complications in the
income verification procedures have already emerged.
More than
300,000 Americans who applied for insurance through HealthCare.gov have
been informed that they must provide additional financial information
for insurance subsidies.
Many who receive tax credits are
expected to owe the government money in the final analysis, due to
inconsistencies in the process.
During the past two years, the Republican-controlled House of
Representatives has passed numerous bills to protect Americans from the most
harmful provisions of the President's health-care law.
These ideas
have yet to be brought up for debate in the Senate, where Democrats hold
the majority.
Only under new leadership will there be the
opportunity for true health-care reform that puts patients first.
