&ldquo; Rothenberg: Senate GOP Gains At Least 7 Seats &rdquo; --
Roll Call , 9/8/2014
Dear Friend,
The primary is over. The general election has officially begun.
And Republicans stand to gain 7 seats in the Senate.
That&rsquo;s one more seat than they need for a majority.
The pundits may have counted Democrats out, but they&rsquo;re underestimating one very important factor:
You. We have two weeks to go until our FEC deadline hits, and we need to work hard to reach our $145,000 goal. Can you give $5 or more to help?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
Most people think of Massachusetts as a safe Democratic seat. But that&rsquo;s just not the case. Republicans have occupied the corner office on Beacon Hill for 16 out of the past 23 years. The largest political party in our state is &ldquo;unenrolled.&rdquo;
Conventional wisdom says that Democrats don&rsquo;t engage in midterm elections. But that &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; misses one crucial point --
we know what&rsquo;s at stake this year, and we&rsquo;re not willing to let Tea Party Republicans take over and ruin our country. The FEC deadline will be here before you know it. Help us reach our $145,000 goal before time runs out. Give $5 or more now.
Thank you.
