Since taking office, President Obama has formally proposed 442 tax increases - not including the tax increases from Obamacare
according to Americans for Tax Reform's

America has a spending problem, not a taxing problem, and we can no more tax our way into prosperity than we can spend our way out of debt.

PS
Thats why I am pushing for a simpler, fairer tax code
including supporting an optional flat tax and working to reform the entire code. Learn more,
