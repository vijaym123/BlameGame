APRIL IS FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH
The month of April marks National Financial Literacy Month and serves as a good reminder that we are all responsible for our own fiscal future.
If you would like to learn more on how to set yourself up for financial success, there are resources I would suggest visiting to to help you learn more. One source is the U.S. Treasury Departments resource center, which can be found at:
http://www.treasury.gov .
Another good site to check out is the FDIC Money Smart web site at:
http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/moneysmart/index.html
If you are looking for resources to talk with your children about finances, you can check out Jump$tart.
It is a national coalition of organizations dedicated to improving financial literacy for those in kindergarten through college.
The Jump$tart website can be found at:
http://www.jumpstart.org/ .
This April, I hope you will consider taking steps to learn something new about finances. Even small steps can make a big difference in your financial future.
If you have any questions about this, or any other federal issue, please feel free to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 225-2015, Hilliard at (614) 771-4968, Lancaster at (740) 654-2654, or Wilmington at (937) 283-7049.
