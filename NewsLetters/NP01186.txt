Week in Review
The final weeks of April have
been productive on Capitol Hill,
with the Senate working to pass key
legislation.
To begin, the Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178)
passed through the Senate. I am
proud that my
amendment,
which ensures Transportation
Security Administration, U.S.
Customs and Border Protection, and
other Department of Homeland
Security personnel are trained and
equipped to better identify victims
and perpetrators of human
trafficking, was included in this
legislation. My amendment also
allows funds to be used to
strengthen Internet Crimes Against
Children Task Forces across the
country, which investigate heinous
crimes, such as the production of
child pornography and human
trafficking. Every day, countless,
innocent victims are bought and
sold into modern-day slavery here
in America, and all too often, this
crime is hidden in plain sight.
Passage of this legislation was an
important step in bringing an end
to human trafficking. Read more

The Senate Committee on
Veterans' Affairs held a hearing
that I specifically
requested
earlier this year . The hearing
examined what progress the VA has
made in offering care to female
veterans. There are countless
distinguished women veterans who
have made sacrifices beyond measure
and deserve nothing but the best
treatment when they return home.
That is why I have introduced
legislation
(S.
471)
to improve VA care for
women veterans, and I will continue
to fight for our veterans until
this quality care becomes a
reality.
Over the past weekend, I had the
opportunity to return to Las Vegas.
During my time there, the Armenian
Cultural Society hosted the
groundbreaking of the Armenian
Memorial Monument to commemorate
the 100
th
Anniversary of the
Armenian Genocide. I am glad I was
there to witness this historic
moment. I also received the
Leadership Award at the Best of the
Silver State Awards. It was a great
honor to receive this accolade at
an event benefitting such a noble
cause, S.A.F.E. House, which
provides a comprehensive approach
to working with families to stop
abuse in the family
environment.
This past week has been an
important time. I am happy to
report the Good Samaritan Search
and Recovery Act of 2015 passed the
House of Representatives. This
legislation speeds access to public
lands so accredited volunteer
search groups can conduct searches
for missing persons. Im now
looking forward to encouraging my
colleagues in the Senate to pass my
legislation, which I introduced
earlier this year with Senator Mark
Warner (D-VA). Read more

I was also honored to receive
the National Park Heritage Award,
in recognition of my work on the
Las Vegas Valley Public Land and
Tule Springs Fossil Beds National
Monument Act of 2013. The
legislation was
enacted
into law as part of the National
Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA)
at the end of the 113
th
Congress. The eight
Nevada public lands bills included
in the NDAA were long-standing
priorities that will create
thousands of Nevada jobs, enhance
our countrys national
security, and conserve some of the
most treasured outdoor areas in our
state. Read more
