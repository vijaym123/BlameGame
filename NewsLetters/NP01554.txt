Hello,
I'm working hard for you every day in
Congress, and we're making progress every day, brick by brick. I hope
you'll take a moment and watch a video I made to show you how I've been
working for you.
If you'd like to stay more up to date about what's going on
in Congress and how I am working for you, I hope you'll follow me on
social media where I post updates often.

It is an honor to serve and be your voice in
Congress,
Dave
