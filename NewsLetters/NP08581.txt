Dear Neighbor,
We kicked off this week with a visit to the Alternative School for Math and Science where we met with Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion Sriram Hathwar. We
presented Sriram with an official Statement for the Record
in the House of Representatives. Sriram mastered the dictionary and displayed an impressive level of composure and confidence as millions of viewers around the world watched him take on some of the most challenging words in the English language. We are all so proud of Sriram.
Sriram is joined here by his mother Dr. Roopa Hathwar as we presented him with an official Statement for the Record in the U.S. House of Representatives.
REED: ONE STEP CLOSER TO FLOODING RELIEF
This week Governor Cuomo sent a request to President Obama for a Federal Major Disaster Declaration for the parts of our state hit hardest by severe storms and flash flooding. This request from the Governor is right and fair for the countless families and businesses under serious financial stress trying to repair and rebuild from flooding. I encourage the President to make this declaration as soon as possible to restore these communities without delay.
REP. REED, SENATOR GILLIBRAND BILL TO NAME CORNING POST OFFICE AFTER RYAN JAYNE PASSES HOUSE
This week the House passed our bill to
rename the Corning Post Office after Army Specialist Ryan P. Jayne . The 22-year-old Elmira native was killed in 2012 in the Paktia Province of Afghanistan when his vehicle was struck by an IED. Specialist Ryan Jayne&rsquo;s sacrifice &ndash; and that of his family &ndash; is something that we must keep fresh in our minds each and every day. I am honored to be a part of recognizing Specialist Jayne in this way in the community he loved and called home.
REED PROTECTS NATIONAL SECURITY WHILE ENHANCING WELLSVILLE DRESSER-RAND JOBS THROUGH AIRCRAFT CARRIER PROGRAM
Protecting our national security and the men and women of the Armed Forces is a top priority I care deeply about. That&rsquo;s why I supported the Defense appropriations bill passed in the House today. Included in the bill is a program to refuel the Navy aircraft carrier
USS George Washington
&ndash; a program that positively impacts Wellsville&rsquo;s Dresser-Rand facility and supports jobs there.
Head on over to our
Facebook page
for more from this week including our meeting with the President of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, meetings with constituents and photos from the district.
Enjoy the first day of summer tomorrow!
