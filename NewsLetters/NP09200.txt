News from Representative Peter Roskam
Fixing the VA
On Friday, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned following multiple
reports that document "systemic" delayed medical care and wait list
fraud at veteran healthcare facilities nationwide. Secretary Shinseki
was right to step down, but it is clear the problem goes well beyond
one person. Fixing this problem requires new management throughout the
VA, and a culture of transparency and accountability across the whole
system.
Sweeping changes are needed to eliminate institutional corruption and
make the VA work again, and House Republicans are committed to making
this right for our veterans and their families. That's why the House
passed the VA Management Accountability Act, which gives VA leaders
every possible tool to improve management and hold their team
responsible for delivering high quality care.
We already know thousands of veterans and their families have been hurt
by delays in treatment and substandard care, and that number will
likely grow even larger as more people come forward to share their
stories. House Republicans are encouraging veterans impacted by VA
mismangement to speak out at gop.gov/yourstory so we can more fully
understand the scope of this problem and fix it.
