Friend,
The sun is starting to shine more often, kids are getting ready for
spring break, and the Mariners are near the top of the stands (and I
still have Cano fever). Sure it's a long season but I'm not going to
pass up a chance to talk about how close we are to first place - even
after two weeks of ball games.
Thinking of the Mariners reminds me of home. While normally I'm
commuting back and forth to our nation's capital each week, the next
two weeks are known as a "district work period," meaning I'll be
running from pillar to post all throughout our region. One of the best
parts about my job is getting to visit and listen to ideas from the
folks I represent about how we can move our country forward.
Let me give you a little sense of some of the things I've got planned
over the next couple of weeks.
Kilmer at Your Company
The most important thing I did while working in economic development
was to meet with small businesses. It was crucial to hear what they
needed to continue creating jobs and opportunities.
It's a trend I've continued while serving as your representative.
Nearly every time I'm back home in Washington State, I try to spend
time with the companies in our region to learn about the work they do
and to understand the good, the bad, and the ugly of how they interact
with the federal government. We even have a name for it - "Kilmer at
Your Company" (which I think is pretty catchy). In fact, I've sat down
with 68 companies since taking office last January, and I don't plan on
stopping anytime soon. Among the businesses I'm visiting over the next
couple weeks are SAFE Boats, UPS, Avalara, Site Crafting, Nippon Paper,
Jefferson Health Care, Grays Harbor Community Hospital and Tacoma Rail
just to name a few.
If you work for a company you'd like me to visit, just give us a call
or drop me an email and we'll work with you to get something scheduled.
Community Meetings
If you are part of a community group, chances are you'll be seeing my
face as well. I will be speaking at the Aberdeen Rotary, the Port
Angeles Chamber, the Hilltop Business District, and Tacoma Rotary Club
#8 over the next two weeks, among many other places. I've made it a
priority to make sure that I'm accessible, available and accountable to
the folks I represent. To me, it's important to let you know what I've
been working on and to answer questions you have. After all, I work for
you.
If you have a group you'd like me to speak to don't hesitate to contact
us. Please go to my website and fill out this form and hopefully I'll
see you soon.
A Budget Discussion
One of the things I'll be discussing back home is the federal budget.
Many of you will remember that back in December I supported a
bipartisan budget compromise that had been negotiated by Congressman
Paul Ryan and our state's own Senator Patty Murray. That proposal made
progress toward dealing with our nation's long-term fiscal challenges.
While it made some difficult cuts, it protected some critical
investments that are important to getting our economy back on track.
This week, the House voted on a new proposal by Congressman Ryan that,
in my view, moved in the wrong direction. That proposal passed the
House but I did not support it. Let me give you a few reasons why.
First, and foremost, I'm concerned that Congressman Ryan's budget
damages our economic recovery.
According to the Economic Policy
Institute, his budget would cost 1.1 million jobs in fiscal year 2015
and 3 million jobs the year thereafter. In the midst of this very
fragile recovery, that doesn't make sense to me.
In addition, his budget negatively impacts our nation's long-term
economic competitiveness - cutting investments in education, scientific
research, and infrastructure by levels even deeper than sequestration
levels.
For instance, the proposal cuts transportation investments by
over $52 billion in 2015. It also would cut Pell Grants by up to $145
billion at a time when college is becoming unaffordable for so many.
And finally, the proposal would negatively impact retirees, ending the
Medicare guarantee by turning the program into a voucher program. What's
more, the budget would force seniors to pay substantially more for
preventive services and prescription drugs. In fact, the AARP commented
that the plan "fails to address the high costs of health care and
instead shifts costs onto seniors and future retirees."
In my view, budgets are reflections of our values. Addressing our
nation's long-term fiscal health and upholding our values shouldn't be
mutually exclusive. We can - and should - do both. I believe that,
going forward, Congress needs to consistently craft budgets that deal
with our budget deficits in a responsible way, that uphold our
commitments to our seniors and those most vulnerable, and that ensure
that our nation remains competitive in a 21st century economy.
Humane Champion Award
Most folks know this, but I'm a total animal lover. I grew up with dogs
as furry little parts of our family, and our family now has an
Australian Shepard named Truman.
Stemming from those experiences, I became a proud member of the
Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, a bipartisan caucus that raises
awareness and advocates for animal welfare issues in the House of
Representatives. We know that animals of all kinds deserve to be
treated humanely. As Gandhi once said, "The greatness of a nation can
be judged by the way its animals are treated."
This past week, I was truly honored to receive the Humane Champion
Award from the Humane Society. I value my partnership with them in
advocating on behalf of the welfare of animals.
Here I am receiving the Humane Champion Award from leaders of The
Humane Society of the United States.
Equal Pay for Equal Work
This past Tuesday, April 8th, was Equal Pay Day. I am a strong advocate
for passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, because women are still earning,
on average, just 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. Turns out I'm
not the only one in the Kilmer household who supports equal pay - my
8-year-old daughter Sophie listed it in her Diary of a Wimpy Kid
Handbook as the number one priority on her "agenda". (Yes, she has an
agenda.. and yes, we're working on her spelling).
When women succeed, so does our economy. This issue is personal to me -
I want my daughters to enter a workforce where they are able to earn
the same pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts.
Although the Equal Pay Act was passed 51 years ago, there is still more
work to be done. I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Paycheck
Fairness Act in the House - and I spoke in support of this bill on the
House floor Thursday morning. You can check out my comments here
.
An Oso Update
Earlier this week, President Obama announced that he will be visiting
the site of the Oso mudslide on April 22nd. I am glad to see that he is
able to meet with the Oso and Darrington communities himself and listen
to their stories. I know he will encourage the country to continue
supporting our fellow Washingtonians. I am also inspired to see the
outpouring of support to the Red Cross and other aid organizations.
Thanks to all who have extended a hand to our Washington family.
As always, thank you for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I
or my office can be helpful to you. I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek Kilmer

2014 Friend,
The
sun
is
starting
to
shine
more
often,
kids
are
getting
ready
for
spring
break,
and
the
Mariners
are
near
the
top
of
the
stands
(and
I
still
have
Cano
fever).
Sure
it&#8217;s
a
long
season
but
I&#8217;m
not
going
to
pass
up
a
chance
to
talk
about
how
close
we
are
to
first
place
&#8211;
even
after
two
weeks
of
ball
games.
Thinking
of
the
Mariners
reminds
me
of
home.
While
normally
I&#8217;m
commuting
back
and

to
our
nation&#8217;s
capital
each

the
next
two

I&#8217;ll

Let

We

A
Budget
Discussion
One
of
the
things
I&#8217;ll
be
discussing
back
home
is
the
federal
budget.
Many
of
you
will
remember
that
back
in
December
I
supported
a
bipartisan
budget
compromise
that
had
been
negotiated
by
Congressman
Paul
Ryan
and
our
state&#8217;s
own
Senator
Patty
Murray. That
proposal
made
progress
toward
dealing
with
our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
fiscal
challenges. While
it
made
some
difficult
cuts,
it
protected
some
critical
investments
that
are
important
to
getting
our
economy
back
on
track.
This
week,
the
House
voted
on
a
new
proposal
by
Congressman
Ryan
that,
in
my
view,
moved
in
the
wrong
direction. That
proposal
passed
the
House
but
I
did
not
support
it. Let
me
give
you
a
few
reasons
why.
First,
and
foremost,
I&#8217;m
concerned
that
Congressman
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
damages
our
economic
recovery.
According
to
the
Economic
Policy
Institute,
his
budget
would
cost
1.1
million
jobs
in
fiscal
year
2015
and
3
million
jobs
the
year
thereafter. In
the
midst
of
this
very
fragile
recovery,
that
doesn&#8217;t
make
sense
to
me.
In
addition,
his
budget
negatively
impacts
our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
economic
competitiveness
&#8211;
cutting
investments
in
education,
scientific research,
and
infrastructure
by
levels
even
deeper
than
sequestration
levels.
For
instance,
the
proposal
cuts
transportation
investments
by
over
$52
billion
in
2015. It
also
would
cut
Pell
Grants
by
up
to
$145
billion
at
a
time
when
college
is
becoming
unaffordable
for
so
many.
And
finally,
the
proposal
would
negatively
impact
retirees,
ending
the
Medicare
guarantee
by
turning
the
program
into
a
voucher
program. What&#8217;s
more,
the
budget
would
force
seniors
to
pay
substantially
more
for
preventive
services
and
prescription
drugs. In
fact,
the
AARP
commented
that
the
plan
&#8220;fails
to
address
the
high
costs
of
health
care
and
instead
shifts
costs
onto
seniors
and
future
retirees.&#8221;
In
my
view,
budgets
are
reflections
of
our
values. Addressing
our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
fiscal
health
and
upholding
our
values
shouldn&#8217;t
be
mutually
exclusive. We
can
&#8211;
and
should
&#8211;
do
both. I
believe
that,
going
forward,
Congress
needs
to
consistently
craft
budgets
that
deal
with
our
budget
deficits
in
a
responsible
way,
that
uphold
our
commitments
to
our
seniors
and
those
most
vulnerable,
and
that
ensure
that
our
nation
remains
competitive
in
a
21st
century
economy.
Humane
Champion
Award
Most
folks
know
this,
but
I&#8217;m
a
total
animal
lover. I
grew
up
with
dogs
as
furry
little
parts
of
our
family,
and
our
family
now
has
an
Australian
Shepard
named
Truman.
Stemming
from
those
experiences,
I
became
a
proud
member
of
the
Congressional
Animal
Protection
Caucus,
a
bipartisan
caucus
that
raises
awareness
and
advocates
for
animal
welfare
issues
in
the
House
of
Representatives.
We
know
that
animals
of
all
kinds
deserve
to
be
treated
humanely.
As
Gandhi
once
said,
&#8220;The
greatness
of
a
nation
can
be
judged
by
the
way
its
animals
are
treated.&#8221;
This
past
week,
I
was
truly
honored
to
receive
the
Humane
Champion
Award
from
the
Humane
Society. I
value
my
partnership
with
them
in
advocating
on
behalf
of
the
welfare
of
animals.
Here
I
am
receiving
the
Humane
Champion
Award
from
leaders
of
The
Humane
Society
of
the
United
States.
Equal
Pay
for
Equal
Work
This
past
Tuesday,
April
8th,
was
Equal
Pay
Day.
I
am
a
strong
advocate
for
passing
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act,
because
women
are
still
earning,
on
average,
just
77
cents
for
every
dollar
earned
by
men.
Turns
out
I&#8217;m
not
the
only
one
in
the
Kilmer
household
who
supports
equal
pay
&#8211;
my
8-year-old
daughter
Sophie
listed
it
in
her
Diary
of
a
Wimpy
Kid
Handbook
as
the number
one
priority
on
her
&#8220;agenda&#8221;.
(Yes,
she
has
an
agenda&#8230;.
and
yes,
we&#8217;re
working
on
her
spelling).
When
women
succeed,
so
does
our
economy.
This
issue
is
personal
to
me
-
I
want
my
daughters
to
enter
a
workforce
where
they
are
able
to
earn
the
same
pay
for
doing
the
same
work
as
their
male
counterparts.
Although
the
Equal
Pay
Act
was
passed
51
years
ago,
there
is
still
more
work
to
be
done.
I
have
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
of
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
in
the
House
&#8211;
and
I
spoke
in
support
of
this
bill
on
the
House
floor
Thursday
morning. You
can
check
out
my
comments
here .
An
Oso
Update
Earlier
this
week,
President
Obama
announced
that
he
will
be
visiting
the
site
of
the
Oso
mudslide
on
April
22nd.
I
am
glad
to
see
that
he
is
able
to
meet
with
the
Oso
and
Darrington
communities
himself
and
listen
to
their
stories. I
know
he
will
encourage
the
country
to
continue
supporting
our
fellow
Washingtonians.
I
am
also
inspired
to
see
the
outpouring
of
support
to
the
Red
Cross
and
other
aid
organizations. Thanks
to
all
who
have
extended
a
hand
to
our
Washington
family. As
always,
thank
you
for
reading

don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out
if
I
or
my

can
be
helpful
to
you.
I&#8217;m
