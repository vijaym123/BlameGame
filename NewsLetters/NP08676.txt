Battling Rising Waters
Dear Friend,
As waters continued to rise across northern Koochiching and St. Louis
Counties, I cancelled my regular schedule on Monday and headed for
International Falls to see the situation for myself, meet with local
officials, volunteers, business people and homeowners, and draw
attention to this rapidly developing crisis in our region.
What I witnessed was considerable damage to private housing and
property, public infrastructure, and business and commercial facilities
- but what I saw and experienced from the community was inspiring.
People of all ages and walks of life pitching in to fill and stack
sandbags, prepare and deliver meals, move precious possessions to
higher ground - people encouraging and helping one another in that
"Minnesota way" we all know so well.
Back in Washington, I am in constant touch with Governor Dayton, as
well as with the Department of Homeland Security, and local and state
officials. With their help, my job will be to assure that any and all
assistance be made available.
If you have the time and means, the folks who are working around the
clock sandbagging and otherwise volunteering could sure use your help.
I will keep you posted as we pray the rains hold off and these high
waters will recede.
Sincerely,
_____

A Message from Congressman

Battling
Rising
Waters
Dear
Friend,
As
waters
continued
to
rise
across
northern
Koochiching
and
St.
Louis
Counties,
I
cancelled
my
regular
schedule
on
Monday
and
headed
for
International
Falls
to
see
the
situation
for
myself,
meet
with
local
officials,
volunteers,
business
people
and
homeowners,
and
draw
attention
to
this
rapidly
developing
crisis
in
our
region.
What
I
witnessed
was
considerable
damage
to
private
housing
and
property,
public
infrastructure,
and
business
and
commercial facilities
&#8211;
but
what
I
saw
and
experienced
from
the
community was
inspiring. People
of
all
ages
and
walks
of
life
pitching

and
deliver
meals,
move
precious

to

&#8211;
people
encouraging
and
helping
one
another
in
that
&#8220;Minnesota
way&#8221;
we
all
know
so
well.
Back
in
Washington,
I
am
in
constant
touch
with
Governor
Dayton,
as
well
as
with the
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
and

With

my

any
