If you missed this week&rsquo;s
New York Times
poll, here&rsquo;s what you need to know: We&rsquo;re losing.
Republicans&rsquo; $12 million Obama-bashing ad blitz is crushing us. And yesterday, NPR reported a right-wing mega-donor gave $10 million more to fund Karl Rove attack ads.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama emailed you yesterday. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re emailing you right now.
We still have time to turn this thing around -- but if we can&rsquo;t repair the damage now, you can kiss all hope of a Democratic victory goodbye.
Control of Congress is at stake. Can you respond to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action today?
