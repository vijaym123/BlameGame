About Tim

News and Media
Friends,
I hope that you all have enjoyed the summer, and for those of you in
school or with children in school, that you are looking forward to the
new school year.
It has been a busy time for me, and I remain grateful
for the opportunity to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
Telephone Town Halls
When I have to be in Washington for legislative duties, a telephone
town hall is the next best way to hear from people from home
. So far this season, I have
been able to call about 38,208 South Carolinians to ask them to
participate in one of four telephone town halls
.
If you were
able to participate, thank you for your time and feedback! I hope that
you found it as valuable as I did.
If not, I hope that we will be able to reach you in the future.
As
always, if you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate
to call my office at (843) 727-4525.
Angels in Adoption
Every year, I have the privilege of honoring a South Carolinian who
does incredible work in promoting adoption and protecting a very
vulnerable population of young people in our state.
I am proud to
nominate Dan Cruver as our 2014 Angel in Adoption.
Mr. Cruver, who lives with his wife Melissa and three children (two of
whom are adopted) in Travelers Rest, SC, is the founder and director of
Together for Adoption (T4A), which provides teaching, training, and
other resources to local churches as well as globally through national
and international conferences.
T4A works to equip individuals,
churches, and organizations theologically with a solid foundation and
motivation of caring for orphaned and vulnerable children in our
communities.
Thank you to Mr. Cruver and his family for all their hard work!
Around South Carolina
During my time in and around South Carolina, my priority is always
meeting with and hearing from my constituents.
Over the past week, I
have spoken with the Greenville Rotary Club, met with a group of
concerned pastors in Powdersville, visited the Farmers Telephone
Cooperative in Kingstree, and thrown out the first pitch at a
Greenville Drive baseball game
.
Each time, I am reminded of
how much we have to be grateful for in South Carolina.
I welcome your thoughts and suggestions.
You can email me
here, and telephone numbers for all
of my offices are at the bottom of this email. For more frequent
updates on my work in the Senate, you can follow my blog
