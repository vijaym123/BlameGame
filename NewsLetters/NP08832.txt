Friend,
Today marks the 51 st
anniversary of President John F. Kennedy signing the Equal Pay Act, which required men and women in the same work place to be given equal pay for equal work.
Together with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Act not only makes this kind of discrimination based on gender illegal, but also ensures that women are valued for their contributions in the workplace.
However, the fight for equality is not over.
Despite the work of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act, womens wages continue to lag behind those of their male colleagues.
When the Act was signed into law by President Kennedy, women earned 59 cents on the dollar for the same work performed by men.
Despite continued efforts, women still only receive 77 cents for every dollar received by their male counterparts.
As your representative, I have continued to tackle this ongoing issue by proudly cosponsoring the Paycheck Fairness Act.
The Paycheck Fairness Act works to strengthen and reform the Equal Pay Act by ending pay secrecy, strengthening workers ability to challenge discrimination, and bringing equal pay law into line with other civil rights laws.
I am proud to work to protect women from discrimination, because I strongly believe that women are entitled to all that they earn.
Sincerely,
