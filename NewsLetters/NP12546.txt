Greetings:
Our FREE health care workshops in January were so successful
that dozens of people have asked me to continue holding them as we near
the health insurance enrollment deadline of April 1st. I am proud to
announce a new series of these workships, throughout the San Fernando
Valley. The workshops will allow area families to learn about the
options available to them under the Affordable Care Act, including
learning about insurance policies that can be purchased through the Covered
California health insurance exchange.
Families will also be able to speak with
certified counselors, who will be able to pre-approve health insurance
applications.
Thousands of families in the
Valley who lived in fear of illness or injury can now purchase
affordable, quality health insurance. My goal is to let every family know
that coverage is available, explain how to get it and work as hard as I
can to make sure that every family in my District has the ability to
see a doctor to stay healthy, not just to stay
alive.
My staff will work with area health organizations,
including certified Navigators, at several locations, including area high
schools. The following FREE workshops are still open for the
public:
