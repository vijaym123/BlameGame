15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Recently, the Inspector General for the VA released a report stating that bad scheduling practices are widespread.
Americas Veterans have risked their lives for our freedom. The least they deserve is timely access to quality health care. I am thankful for the military service that all Veterans, including Secretary Shinseki, have given to our country. However, the horrific misconduct that occurred under the watch of Secretary Shinseki is unacceptable and leaves our Veterans untrusting of the department that was created to help them. For this reason, I am calling for Secretary Shinsekis resignation and for a thorough investigation into this horrible situation to make sure it never happens again.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
