We know we can seem a bit all over the place with the emails&hellip;
-- Sometimes it&rsquo;s good news.
-- Sometimes it&rsquo;s bad news.
-- Sometimes it feels like all hope is lost.
But that&rsquo;s exactly how the 2014 Election has been. Right now there&rsquo;s good news:
we&rsquo;ve gotten some amazing polls recently showing we can win in deep-red states like Nebraska, Arkansas, and West Virginia. And right now there&rsquo;s bad news:
Boehner&rsquo;s allies just launched their largest ad buy yet&hellip; $25 MILLION to defeat Democrats.
The only real answer is to just keep fighting. And thanks to your support, that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re doing.
Late last night, you helped us smash our ad buy deadline goal. In just the last 48 hours, we&rsquo;ve brought in over $1.2 million to fight Republicans&rsquo; Obama-bashing attacks. And get this: our average gift was just $23. That&rsquo;s grassroots!
Last weekend, you helped us Get-Out-The-Vote in more than 30 too-close-to-call races. All together, we knocked on over 300,000 doors in just 2 days.
Thank you SO MUCH for all you&rsquo;ve done. Now, it&rsquo;s time to knock some doors, make some phone calls, and go win this election!

Thanks for all you do -- we&rsquo;ll see you out in the field!
