Rep. Bob Goodlatte
A Season of Hope
We can see the spirit of the season all around
us &ndash; brightly colored lights cover homes, nativity scenes are set up at churches, and store windows are decked out. The sounds of the holidays
fill the airwaves and carolers take to the streets and bring cheer to the halls of nursing homes. This time of year evokes many sentiments. There are
feelings of nostalgia and memories of Christmases past. It also represents a sense of comfort and familiarity as well as time with family and friends.
And for many it is a season of hope.
There are countless stories of the
hope that stems from Christmas. One particularly stirring story is from 1914 at the outset of World War I.
On the battlefields of the Western Front
in Europe the sounds of war grew silent on Christmas Eve. Instead, voices singing carols across enemy lines filled the air. On Christmas Day, troops
emerged from the trenches, greeting each other, shaking hands, and even breaking out into a friendly game of soccer. Even in the midst of a war that
many of these young men would not survive, British and German soldiers paused to celebrate this season.
As we gather with loved ones and reflect on the year that has passed, this story is a reminder that the spirit of this season can bring even the
most unlikely together. Christmas is a celebration of a promise fulfilled and of a hope for the future. President George H.W. Bush fittingly said in
his 1989 Christmas message, &ldquo;Today, nearly 2,000 years later, the shining promise of that first Christmas continues to give our lives a sense of
peace and purpose.&rdquo;
During this holiday season, let us remember
that sense of hope and peace and reflect on our many blessings. We have much to be thankful for in this nation. This holiday season many of our
military personnel may find themselves far from the comforts of their homes and their families. Theirs is a service marked by humility and deep
dedication to preserving the ideals of our nation that make the very celebration of this season possible. We must also try to find a way to capture
this season of hope all year, even after the decorations have come down, and continue to carry this goodwill throughout the year.
From my family to yours, I wish all of you a safe
and joyous holiday season, a very Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. May the peace and joy of this season and hope for our nation fill your heart,
and may God continue to bless the United States of America.
We Cannot Allow Foreign Dictators to Threaten Our Freedoms
The recent cyber-attack on Sony Pictures and threats against the United States by North Korea relating to the movie,
The Interview ,
are very disturbing. We cannot allow terrorists or a narcissistic dictator to control what products can be created and distributed in America. Whether
or not we like the plot, production, or tone of
The Interview , every American has a stake in ensuring that our collective freedom of speech
is not diminished by either our own government or a foreign government. The United States must stand firm against this type of aggression against our
freedom of speech. Otherwise these actions will embolden North Korea and other copycats to act again. Our national response to this threat must be
clear and unequivocal. The
House Judiciary Committee
has
jurisdiction over the Justice Department and FBI, and we will continue to monitor this investigation and support efforts by the U.S. to thwart these
intrusive attacks.
