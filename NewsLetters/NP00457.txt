Fifth
District Veterans Deserve Better
Dear Friend,
This past week, as our nation came
together on
Memorial
Day
to pay tribute to those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice for our
country, I traveled across the Fifth
District and met with many veterans from
Henry County to Brunswick County and from
Fauquier County to Danville.
This week served as a reminder of how
fortunate we are to live in this great
nation and enjoy these tremendous freedoms,
but if it were not for those willing to
serve, we would not have these blessings. I
was grateful to have the opportunity to
thank some of our American heroes for all
they have sacrificed for American liberty
and gain insight on how their lives can be
made easier.
At
Southern
Virginia Community College in Brunswick
County , I met with student veterans,
and I toured
Liberty
University Army ROTC
offices meeting
with students and faculty. While
at
Buckingham County High School , JROTC
cadets performed their rope bridge
demonstration, and I was honored to
participate in their promotion ceremony,
and at
Fork
Union Military Academy,
I was able to
meet with faculty who prepare these young
cadets for service.
At American Legion Posts in
Warrenton
and
Appomattox
and while meeting with veterans in
Mecklenburg
and
Fluvanna
Counties, I continued to hear about how the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
continues to be an impenetrable bureaucracy
for so many of our veterans. While
visiting
veterans at the Halifax War Memorial , I
heard about the excessive backlog of claims
in Virginia. As a result of this backlog,
they told me how their claims have been
sent to different states that seem to have
different standards of assessing claims. I
talked with veterans who explained that
they have been waiting an entire year for
the VA to respond to their claims, because
it takes the VA as long as six months to
even access the necessary records.
Another
veteran at the Halifax War Memorial
told me how the 40 mile rule
created to allow veterans residing over 40
miles from the nearest VA medical facility
to receive care outside the VA system is
not fulfilling its intended purpose because
some clinics are included in this criteria
do not provide the type of care the veteran
may need. I was encouraged that the Senate
passed a bill that will change the 40-mile
calculation to be based on the nearest VA
facility that provides the service being
sought by the veteran. I hope that the
House considers this commonsense bill
expeditiously.
Our veterans deserve better. Period. We
have an obligation to take care of those
who have taken care of us, and it is our
responsibility to make sure they receive
the highest level of care. I encourage our
veterans and our active-duty members of the
armed services to
contact
our office
if we may ever be of
assistance in dealing with the Veterans
Administration or any other federal
agency.
I am grateful to all of the veterans who
took the time to meet with me this week. I
am humbled by the opportunity to serve
Virginias Fifth District veterans,
and I remain fully committed to ensuring
that our citizens who have given the most
receive the benefits they have earned and
deserve.

with veterans at the Howitzer Cannon at
American Legion Post 104 in Appomattox.

American Legion Post 99 Commander Frank
Carr at the Halifax War Memorial.
