Dear Friend,
I am
writing to remind you that
this Saturday, November 15th, is the
beginning of Open Enrollment for health coverage in the Health Insurance
Marketplace .
The last day to enroll for coverage that
begins on January 1, 2015 is December 15th.
If you or
someone you know is uninsured, visit
www.healthcare.gov
to apply for coverage for 2015.
You can also click
here
to see if free or low-cost health coverage is
available.
Even if you signed up for health insurance last
year, you can renew your coverage and shop around to get the plan that
best fits your needs and budget.
There is also in-person
assistance in our area to help you navigate through this process.
