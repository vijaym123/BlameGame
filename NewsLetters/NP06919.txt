David, it&rsquo;s that fun time of the year again that you&rsquo;ve been
anxiously
awaiting: BRAD&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY!
He&rsquo;s turning 53 on Wednesday, and if you can&rsquo;t contain your excitement, we understand. WE CAN&rsquo;T EITHER! I mean how often does Brad Schneider turn 53?
Anyways, we&rsquo;re here preparing for the big event, but apparently
someone
is upset they didn&rsquo;t get the invite: Karl Rove. Now, Karl did send a present -- which was nice -- but we double-checked and it definitely wasn&rsquo;t on the wish list.
What was it?
$640,000 of attack ads against Brad, starting over the weekend on Chicagoland TV.
David, it&rsquo;s up to us to save the day for Brad.
If we can reach 1,053 donations by Wednesday at midnight, we can turn the tables on Rove and give Brad the best birthday present imaginable: a powerful grassroots response. What do you say, David -- will you pitch in for Brad&rsquo;s birthday?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for helping out!
Team Brad
P.S. Karl didn&rsquo;t even send a card.
