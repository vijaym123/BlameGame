Dear Friend:
Yesterday, I chaired a hearing on violence and discrimination against women around the world and the tools we need to combat it. To watch the opening statement I made at yesterday's hearing, please click
here .
It was so powerful to hear testimony from seven women Senators - Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, Tammy Baldwin, Mazie Hirono, Elizabeth Warren, Heidi Heitkamp, and Amy Klobuchar - who had come to bring the voices of women subjected to violence and discrimination into the halls of the United States Senate. We must heed those voices and
pass the
International Violence Against Women Act
(IVAWA) and finally ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
