There&rsquo;s a reason Boehner just predicted:
&ldquo;Illinois is probably going to have the best Republican year [in 2 decades]."
-- first, Boehner came to Colona to pick up MASSIVE checks for Cheri&rsquo;s opponent
-- then, a right-wing Super PAC launched deceptive ads targeting us
-- now, Republicans are up with a $2.2 million assault on Illinois T.V.
Look, we are only 114 away from hitting 2,750 donations since the GOP went on the air.
If we don&rsquo;t have a huge surge of support today, the outcome is clear:
BOEHNER WINS.
