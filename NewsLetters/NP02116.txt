&ldquo;Why would Republicans go after children&rsquo;s health insurance?&rdquo; --
The Hill , 3/9/15
Dear Friend, Good question.
Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch worked together to create the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) back in 1997, and CHIP used to be an example of bipartisan cooperation.
Today, however, the question of how to care for underprivileged children has become a political football rather than a matter of basic human decency.
There are few programs less controversial than CHIP, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Republicans from attacking it.
Join me and my colleagues to give a voice to the 10 million kids who stand to lose health coverage if CHIP expires -- sign our petition today.
Children can&rsquo;t go to work, they can&rsquo;t lobby Congress, and they can&rsquo;t pay insurance premiums with their allowance money.
CHIP provides health care for some of the most vulnerable members of our society. And Republicans want to pull the rug out from under them. I find that unconscionable.
Some issues should transcend politics, and caring for children from low-income families should be one of those issues. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a debate about whether or not we will renew CHIP. The program has been phenomenally successful, and I need you to help me send a message to the Republicans. Add your name to mine and stand up for children&rsquo;s health insurance.
Thank you,
Ed
