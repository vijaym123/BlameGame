Dear Friends,
Numerous homes and a fire station were damaged by a tornado that hit the village of Coal City last night - the second time in less than two years a tornado has hit the area.
Although the damage in Coal City is extensive, there have miraculously been no reported deaths and only a few minor injuries. We should all be thankful to fire department personnel, area police, first responders and the Illinois State Police who are on the ground helping those in need.
While the village is currently off-limits for volunteers and non-residents, people wishing to help can donate items to
We Care of Grundy County , located at 530 Bedford Road in Morris. The organization is collecting cleaning supplies and personal products, including shampoo, deodorant and soap. Those wishing to make a cash donation can do so by visiting the
Community Foundation of Grundy County .
Sincerely,
Senator Toi Hutchinson
