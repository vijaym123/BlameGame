Dear Friends,
It is with great enthusiasm that I announce two opportunities for high school students living in the 14th Congressional District that will challenge them both academically and artistically in unique competitions.
To encourage art education, the Congressional Art Competition gives high school students a chance to gain national recognition for their creative talents. Seventh and 8th graders who share campuses with high schools are also welcome to compete.
All artwork submissions
must
be received
by 5 p.m. on Monday, April 14, 2014 , at my district office located at 155 Bovet Road, Suite 780, in San Mateo, and must include a completed
Student Information &amp; Release Form , signed by the student, his or her parent/guardian, and his or her art teacher. To learn more about the Congressional Art Competition, please visit my
website .
I am also proud to announce the first annual Congressional STEM Academic Competition, a.k.a. the &ldquo;House App Contest.&rdquo; This new competition is designed to engage students&rsquo; creativity and encourage participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Representing Silicon Valley &ndash; a hotbed of innovation &ndash; has convinced me of the importance of such initiatives that promote investment in STEM education, as well as legislation like H.R. 2426, the Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. We must prepare our students for employment in the high-tech industry and enhance American competitiveness in the global economy.
The House APP contest is also open to students eligible to enroll in high schools located in the 14th District, and to teams of up to four if at least two students reside in the 14th District. Students must register at
StudentAppChallenge.house.gov
and create an account at
ChallengePost.com
by April 30, 2014 . Students can visit
ChallengePost
any time before then to submit their contact information, completed release form, and final app entry. Students can learn more about the competition and find resources for students and teachers on my
website . For any additional information, contact Kenneth Dowling at
kenneth.dowling@mail.house.gov
or (202) 225-3531.
These are great opportunities to let creativity flow and produce tangible results!
All the best,
