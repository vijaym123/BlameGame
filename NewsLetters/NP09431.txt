Remembering Those Who Served
Dear Friend:
More than 1 million Michiganders will be on the go this weekend as folks travel by road, rail, or air to spend time with loved ones this Memorial Day weekend.
As we join with family and friends to enjoy some much-deserved warmer weather, let us continue to keep in mind those brave American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation.
It was nearly 150 years ago this May that a proclamation was issued by an organization of Union Civil War veterans to honor and decorate the graves of fellow Union soldiers who were killed during the American Civil War.
Now celebrated on the last Monday of the month, Memorial Day is an occasion to remember American soldiers of all wars who died while serving our country and to honor the sacrifice made by them and their families.
We are also mindful of the sacrifices that continued to be made by our troops today. They and their families have given so much for our country. We look forward to their safe return home and owe them not only our sincere gratitude, but the support and services they need to succeed off the battlefield.
For every monument we see, for every flag on a grave, there is an important story to tell.
From generation to generation, the people who have fought to preserve liberty were not only soldiers
they were fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters. They were our neighbors and classmates, our friends and colleagues, and when the nation needed them, they answered the call. They fought for their nation, for their communities, for all of us, and
not least
for one another.
We pay our respects to the many generations of heroes who sacrificed their tomorrows so that we may enjoy our freedoms today. We are all so proud of their service and we say thank you. We are truly the land of the free because of our brave.
God bless,
Fred Upton
