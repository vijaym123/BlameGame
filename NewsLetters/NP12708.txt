Dear Friends,
This Saturday, February 8, my office will host two Tax Filing Season
Readiness outreach events that are free and open to the public. The
first will be held from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the University of Maryland
Eastern Shore in Princess Anne, Md. The event will take place in the
theater at the Student Services Center. Free parking is available in
the lot adjacent to the Student Services Center.
This presentation will address new changes specific to the Eastern
Shore, including the shift of income tax preparation assistance from
the local Salisbury IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center to the local
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program and Tax Counseling for
the Elderly programs. These programs are administered through Shore Up
in Salisbury and UMES in Somerset County, as well as local AARP state
representatives, all of whom have been invited to attend the event in
Princess Anne.
A similar event will be held later that day, from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30
p.m. at the Elkton Central Branch Library located at 301 Newark Avenue,
Elkton, Md. 21921. Free overflow parking is available at the Singerly
Fire Company across the street from the library.
At both events, the IRS will provide information on tax preparation
services, identity theft, and refund fraud, as well as guidance on how
to select a return preparer. The events will also provide an
opportunity for district constituents to speak with an IRS
representative regarding personal tax-filing issues.
I am pleased my office is hosting Tax Filing Season Readiness events to
provide you with the opportunity to speak with an IRS representative
about your specific tax-filing issues and to obtain information about
the most recent changes to the federal tax code. The current tax code
is very complex and sometimes burdensome for millions of individuals
and small businesses. With all of the federal tax code changes from
year to year, my office frequently addresses these concerns with the
IRS. Last year alone, my office handled 126 IRS-related cases. Knowing
of this difficulty, I am pleased to have the IRS as a guest for this
event on behalf of my constituents.
Please RSVP for either event below.
