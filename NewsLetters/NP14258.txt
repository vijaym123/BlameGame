Hey Utah, I need your feedback
I
recently
unveiled a series of policy proposals
that
intend to correct the crisis of unequal opporunity in America
today.
I have been encouraged by the feedback I have received from
thought leaders
and
constituents
so
far.
In order to build a new reform agenda, we first need
everyone to participate in an open, rigorous, transparent debate about
ideas. Too many in Washington seem to believe that on any issue, we should
either have one plan
one that everyone supports in lockstep
or no
plans. But unity cannot come at the expense of
creativity.
Americans believe in the wisdom of markets. So lets trust the
marketplace of ideas. If we want policy innovation, we need to innovate
policy!
On certain issues, we have been. And we need more
of that kind of innovation
especially to meet the broader range of
problems confronting the middle class.
I have been
challenging the country to help Washington consider a new reform agenda that
will help us translate Americas bedrock principles into new and
innovative policy reforms to confront the problems facing the middle
class.
I invite you to join this debate.
On Wednesday night,
I will be hosting my monthly tele-townhall meeting @ 7:00 p.m.
MT.
I invite you to sign up for this event, so we can maintain an open
dialogue about the policy reforms you would like to see.
I look
forward to sharing some of the highlights from my recent proposals and
answering your questions:
