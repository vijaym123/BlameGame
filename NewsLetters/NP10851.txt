Former CIA Deputy Director
Testifies Before House Intelligence
Committee
Last week, the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) held an open hearing entitled
Benghazi Talking Points and Michael J. Morells Role in Shaping the
Administrations Narrative. Michael Morell is the former CIA Deputy
Director and was recalled to testify on his role in altering the talking
points on the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. facilities in Benghazi
that took the lives of four Americans. Mr. Morell has testified twice
before HPSCI in closed hearings, and this was his first time
testifying in an opening hearing.
Mr. Morell confirmed
the alteration of the word attack to demonstration and the removal
of Al Qaeda, both of which dramatically change the tone of the
talking points from a coordinated attack to a violent reaction to a protest,
and I questioned Mr. Morell on these
edits.
What we heard from Mr. Morell is that important and
widespread information was based on incomplete and poor judgment. The
alteration and removal of certain key words significantly changed the
narrative of what happened. Mr. Morell knew this was not a protest, yet the
talking points were altered and approved to seem like it was. We dont
know why it was done or in whose best interest, but it certainly
wasnt the American peoples.
Combined
with my efforts as Chairman of the HPSCI Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee, HPSCI will continue their investigation into the
attacks until those who were involved have been held
responsible.
