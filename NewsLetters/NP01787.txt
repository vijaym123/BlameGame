David -- Thank you.
The support you gave me last year means so much to me.
Now I&rsquo;m asking for your support again. Can you chip in now to help our Democratic campaign start strong? http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/donate
I want you with me on this, David. Let&rsquo;s turn this district blue in 2016. -Brad
