Carper's Connection
February 6, 2014
Dear Friends,
The first Friday of every month, the Department of Labor releases a
jobs report that provides a snapshot of the employment picture from the
previous month. Today, we received some good news. The economy added
257,000 jobs in January, and the November and December monthly numbers
were revised upward to 423,000 jobs and 329,000 jobs respectively.
That's now 59 straight months of job growth for a total of 11.8 million
new private sector jobs during that span of time.
These numbers are all the more encouraging when you consider that when
President Obama took office our economy was shedding jobs at an
alarming rate - the economy lost almost 800,000 jobs in January 2009
alone. According to many economists, we were headed for a second Great
Depression. Today's jobs report shows that the economic rescue efforts
from Congress and the Obama administration continue to help our economy
recover from the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The news in Delaware is encouraging, too. Our state's unemployment rate
dropped to 5.4 percent in December, the lowest since September 2008 and
below the national average.
However, this doesn't mean our economy has fully healed from the Great
Recession. Too many people in the First State and around the country
are still looking for work. I strongly believe that Congress and the
administration must work together to encourage a nurturing environment
for job creation and preservation.
We can rebuild our manufacturing sector by strengthening our
trade agreements and restructuring our complicated tax code. We can
raise student achievement and equip the next generation of students
with the skills to succeed in an increasingly competitive global
economy. And Congress can do its part to fix our nation's crumbling
infrastructure by enacting a long-term plan that will create thousands
of jobs in the short-term and help our economy run more efficiently in
the long-run.
No issue matters more than meaningful job creation. It's still my top
priority and I look forward to making more progress for our state and
our country in the year to come.
