Friends,
Over the Mother's Day weekend, I once again had the opportunity to
travel to Afghanistan
to meet with
some of our military moms and get a status check on the situation with
Afghan and US military officials. This is the fourth straight year I
visited Afghanistan, and the third time I've led the women's Mother's
Day Congressional Delegation. We held a special Mother's Day meal with
military women who are also mothers and presented them with handmade
cards from Alabama students.
You can find more pictures from our trip here
.
While in Afghanistan, I also had the opportunity to meet with many of
those from the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard
, which is
based out of Montgomery. As you may know, the 187th is famous for its
"Red Tails" heritage and reputation as a well-trained and organized
unit. I am pleased to report that the 187th is doing great work and
their spirits are high. I know I speak for all of us in wishing them a
successful mission and a safe return home to their families.
Over my many trips to Afghanistan, I have also taken a special interest
in
preserving the important gains made by Afghan women since the conflict
first started in 2001. We met with female members of the Afghan
parliament, as well as female students at the Women's Resource Center
at Marmal Airfield. In many ways, the status of Afghan women is an
indicator for the overall well-being of the Afghan people and the
renewed democracy in the nation. The world has a significant interest
in preserving the human rights gains made by Afghan women. I'm proud to
be involved in this issue, working to make more people aware of the
progress and how fragile it is.
This annual Mother's Day Congressional Delegation is a really special
trip and an important way to continue attention and oversight of the
ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. As our military presence in the area
winds down, it is more important than ever that we closely monitor the
gains and developments made. I appreciate my colleagues for taking time
away from their families to be with our troops, a small sacrifice that
means so much to our military members.
Waiting on the Senate
Last weekend, I joined a number of my colleagues to take part in the
Weekly Republican Address
. We highlighted several House-passed
measures to boost the economy and help working families.
We focused on bills that would allow for construction of the Keystone
Pipeline, end costly regulations on energy production, combat excessive
federal regulations, improve skills training for the unemployed, and
promote innovation. Americans are still waiting for President Obama and
Senate Democrats to act.
I talked about my bill, H.R. 1406, the Working Families Flexibility Act
, which passed the House last May. As you may recall,
the Working Families Flexibility Act would allow the commonly-used
government employee benefit of "comp time" to be utilized in the
private sector. A working mom or dad could use the "time and a half"
overtime he or she earned as actual paid "time and a half" off work
instead of cash, if that's what they'd rather have. Under my bill, no
worker could ever be forced to take paid time off, just like no
business owner would be forced to offer it. The bill does not change
the 40-hour workweek or how overtime pay is calculated. The same
protections that have been a part of labor law for decades remain.
Unfortunately, all these common-sense bills remain stuck in the Senate.
Martha's Mailbag
In the latest installment of Martha's Mailbag, I once again answered
questions that constituents have submitted either by email
, Facebook
, or Twitter
. One of the hot topics is the ongoing controversy at
the VA. I also tackled a question about the IRS and explained how the
House has acted to hold the IRS and Lois Lerner accountable. I even
tried to refute a liberal talking point that Republicans only focus on
repealing ObamaCare when other important issues are out there.
Please keep the questions coming. I really appreciate hearing from you
and having the opportunity to share my positions and thoughts with the
people I represent.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the House will return to session with a full slate of
legislation on our plate. We are expected to pass the Water Resources
Reform & Development Act of 2014, which improves water resource
infrastructure, like ports and shipyards, in a responsible and cost
efficient way. The House is also expected to vote on a bill to address
human trafficking, which has been a growing problem in recent years.
Of particular importance to our area, the House is also likely to
consider the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets
the policy for our nation's military. I have followed the bill closely
and believe it is a strong bill for Fort Rucker and Maxwell-Gunter. The
bill also protects the Army aviation restructuring plan, which could
bring new training aircraft to Fort Rucker.
The House may also consider the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection, and
Online Monitoring Act, which would make serious reforms to NSA
surveillance programs.
Thanks for allowing me to serve you in Washington. Please let me know
if my staff or I can ever do anything for you.

Friends,
Over
the
Mother&#8217;s
Day
weekend,
I
once
again
had
the
opportunity
to
travel
to
Afghanistan
to
meet
with
some
of

and
get
a

military
officials.
This
is
the
fourth
straight
year
I
visited
Afghanistan,
and
the
third
time
I've
led
the
women's
Mother&#8217;s
Day
Congressional
Delegation.
We
held
a
special
Mother&#8217;s
Day
meal
with
military
women
who
are
also
mothers
and
presented
them
with
handmade

from

You

I
also

to

from
the
187th

of
the
Alabama
Air

which
is

As
you
may

the
187th
is
famous
for
its
&#8220;Red
Tails&#8221;
heritage
and
reputation
as
a

I
am
pleased
to
report
that
the
187th
is
doing
great
work
and
their
spirits
are
high.
I
know
I
speak
for
all
of
us
in
wishing
them
a
successful
mission
and
a
safe
return
home
to
their
families.
Over
my
many
trips
to
Afghanistan,
I
have
also
taken
a
special
interest
in
preserving
the
important
gains
made
by
Afghan
women
since
the
conflict
first
started
in
2001.
We
met
with
female
members
of
the
Afghan
parliament,
as
well
as
female
students
at
the
Women&#8217;s
Resource
Center
at
Marmal
Airfield.
In
many
ways,
the
status
of
Afghan
women
is
an
indicator
for
the
overall
well-being
of
the
Afghan
people
and
the
renewed
democracy
in
the
nation.
The
world
has
a
significant
interest
in
preserving
the
human
rights
gains
made
by
Afghan
women.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
be
involved
in
this
issue,
working
to
make
more
people
aware
of
the
progress
and
how
fragile
it
is.
This
annual
Mother&#8217;s
Day
Congressional
Delegation
is
a
really
special
trip
and
an
important
way
to
continue
attention
and
oversight
of
the
ongoing
conflict
in
Afghanistan.
As
our
military
presence
in
the
area
winds
down,
it
is
more
important
than
ever
that
we
closely
monitor
the
gains
and
developments
made.
I
appreciate
my
colleagues
for
taking
time
away
from
their
families
to
be
with
our
troops,
a
small
sacrifice
that
means
so
much
to
our
military
members.
Waiting
on
the
Senate
Last
weekend,
I
joined
a
number
of
my
colleagues
to
take
part
in
the
Weekly
Republican
Address .
We
highlighted
several
House-passed
measures
to
boost
the
economy
and
help
working
families.
We
focused
on
bills
that
would
allow
for
construction
of
the
Keystone
Pipeline,
end
costly
regulations
on
energy
production,
combat
excessive
federal
regulations,
improve
skills
training
for
the
unemployed,
and
promote
innovation.
Americans
are
still
waiting
for
President
Obama
and
Senate
Democrats
to
act.
I
talked
about
my
bill,
H.R.
1406,
the
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act ,
which
passed
the
House
last
May.
As
you
may
recall,
the
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act
would
allow
the
commonly-used
government
employee
benefit
of
&#8220;comp
time&#8221;
to
be
utilized
in
the
private
sector.
A
working
mom
or
dad
could use
the
&#8220;time
and
a
half&#8221;
overtime
he
or
she
earned
as
actual
paid
&#8220;time
and
a
half&#8221;
off
work
instead
of
cash,
if
that&#8217;s
what
they&#8217;d
rather
have.
Under
my
bill,
no
worker
could
ever
be
forced
to
take
paid
time
off,
just
like
no
business
owner
would
be
forced
to
offer
it.
The
bill
does
not
change
the
40-hour
workweek
or
how
overtime
pay
is
calculated.
The
same
protections
that
have
been
a
part
of
labor
law
for
decades
remain.
Unfortunately,
all
these
common-sense
bills
remain
stuck
in
the
Senate.
Martha&#8217;s
Mailbag
In
the
latest
installment
of
Martha&#8217;s
Mailbag,
I
once
again
answered
questions
that
constituents
have
submitted
either
by
email ,
Facebook ,
or
Twitter .
One
of
the
hot
topics
is
the
ongoing
controversy
at
the
VA.
I
also
tackled
a
question
about
the
IRS
and
explained
how
the
House
has
acted
to
hold
the
IRS
and
Lois
Lerner
accountable.
I
even
tried
to
refute
a
liberal
talking
point
that
Republicans
only
focus
on
repealing
ObamaCare
when
other
important
issues
are
out
there.
Please
keep
the
questions
coming.
I
really
appreciate
hearing
from
you
and
having
the
opportunity
to
share
my
positions
and
thoughts
with
the
people
I
represent.

Next

the

will
return

with
a

to
pass
the
Water
Resources

2014,
which
improves
water
resource
infrastructure,
like
ports
and
shipyards,
in
a
responsible

cost
efficient
way.
The
House
is
also
expected
to
vote
on
a
bill
to
address
human
trafficking,
which
has
been
a
growing
problem
in
recent
years.
Of
particular
importance
to
our
area,
the
House
is
also
likely
to
consider
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act,
or
NDAA,
which
sets
the
policy
for
our
nation&#8217;s
military.
I
have
followed
the
bill
closely
and
believe
it
is
a
strong
bill
for
Fort
Rucker
and
Maxwell-Gunter.
The
bill
also
protects
the
Army
aviation
restructuring
plan,
which
could
bring
new
training
aircraft
to
Fort
Rucker.
The
House
may
also

which
would
make
serious

Thanks
for
allowing
me
to
serve
you
in
Washington.
Please
let

or
I
can
ever
do
anything
for
you.
