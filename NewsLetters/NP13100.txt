Dear
Friends,
This Monday, January 20,
millions of Americans will
come together on Martin
Luther King, Jr. Day to honor
the civil rights leader who
fought for justice and
dedicated his life to ending
racism and
discrimination.
Dr. King lived his life to
serve his country by working
for social justice through
empowerment and civil action.
In honor of his memory, I
will be joining millions of
Americans in a day of service
on Monday. On this day,
Americans across the country
will gather to serve their
neighborhoods and
communities. Let us strive to
promote the mission of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., and
promote the programs and
community activities that
enhance the lives of all
Americans.
Here in Delaware, the
State Office of Volunteerism
is partnering with the Blood
Bank of Delmarva, Youth
Service America, and the Food
Bank of Delaware on two major
initiativesthe
3rd
Annual Hero Blood
Drive and the
SNAP
Challenge . These are just
two ways that you can honor
Dr. Kings legacy here
in Delaware but, as he taught
us, there are many ways to
serve our communities. On
this day of service, please
consider taking part in an
activity that strengthens
your community and brings you
closer to your neighbors.
Sincerely,
Stay Connected with
Senator Carper
