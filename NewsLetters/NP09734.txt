House Creates Select Committee on Benghazi
Since the terrorist attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in
September 2012, various House committees have been investigating the
incident, but unfortunately, without a willing partner in the White
House, these committee's investigations have been stymied. The most
recent revelation that the Obama Administration held back important
email records
even after they were subpoenaed by the House Oversight
and Government Reform Committee has convinced the Speaker of the House
that a special Select Committee on Benghazi
needs to be formed. This committee will investigate all facets of the
terrorist attack so that we can learn why it happened, what we did
right and what we did wrong, and how we can protect American diplomats
better in the future.

Bipartisan House Vote Holds Lois Lerner in Contempt of Congress
On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of House members voted to hold former
IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to
testify about her actions in this scandal. While President Obama
continues to insist that there is "not even a smidgeon of corruption,"
the central figure in the scandal, Lois Lerner, continues to refuse to
testify by asserting her privilege against self-incrimination. Parsing
the legal opinions in this case regarding whether Ms. Lerner waived her
5th Amendment rights is a job for our judicial system. And that is
exactly what the vote last week was all about. If there was no
corruption as the President attests, than all of the individuals
involved should be happy to testify.
If there was corruption -- and
the facts presented so far make a very compelling case that there was
-- then we must get to the bottom of who ordered it and why and ensure
that the appropriate instigators are held responsible.

Oversight Committee investigates EPA wrong-doing
There is broad bipartisan consensus that the Environmental Protection
Agency is in need of some major oversight. The House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee held a hearing last week in which both
Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-MD)
voiced their strong concerns that the EPA must reform the way it does
business.

Another Bipartisan House Vote Supporting American Workers and Businesses
On Friday, the House voted to permanently extend the Research and
Development tax credit.
You know that I support a total rewrite of the tax code in favor of the
FairTax, but until that happens, we need to provide certainty in the
tax code and ensure that our tax code is rewarding growth and job
creation.
Making the R&D; tax credit permanent does just that, and I
was happy to support it.

Bipartisan Support for Charter Schools
On Friday, the House passed a bipartisan bill -- H.R. 10
-- by a vote of 360-45 to reauthorize and bolster the federal
charter school program. The bill increases the number of high-quality
charter schools, makes it easier for underserved children to attend
those schools, and ensures that charter schools can share their best
practices with traditional public schools.

Technology and the Maxwell High School of Technology in preparing our
community's children for a profitable and fulfilling future.

Defense Authorization Act Cleared for House floor action
Last week, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) unanimously
approved a new bill to ensure that our military and the men and women
who serve in it are prepared for any future crisis. The bill forces
Congress to address some difficult issues related to troop levels,
weapons systems, and the future legacy costs of our fighting men and
women. The debate over these issues will continue in the coming weeks,
but I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats on the committee were
able to work together to give the full House an opportunity to move
forward with on this critically important legislation.

Meeting with Georgia EMCs
I always appreciate hearing the concerns of folks who are as invested
in our community's success as I am.
That's why I was pleased this week
to welcome my friends from Jackson EMC
and Sawnee EMC
to Washington to discuss their concerns with the direction of
the Obama Administration's energy policies. These are the folks who are
responsible for literally "keeping the lights on" for thousands of
families in the Seventh District, and the Administration's misguided
and destructive agenda is making it harder and harder to do that.
I
look forward to continuing working with our EMC partners to protect our
environment and ensure Seventh District families continue to have
access to safe, reliable, affordable energy.
Celebrating Mother's Day
Yesterday, we spent the day honoring our mothers by showing our love
and gratitude for everything they do.
Mothers truly have one of the
toughest jobs in the world, and I think we can all agree that it is no
easy task to wear the many hats that moms do every day.
Moms are our
best teachers, our friends, and our role models, and we look to them to
guide us throughout our lives.
We have our mothers to thank for
providing us with their tireless love and care and for helping to shape
us into the people who we become as adults.
I hope that everyone
enjoyed spending the day celebrating our cherished mothers - I know my
family did.
The Week Ahead
This week I am so pleased to be back in Georgia, and the best news is
that I have the opportunity to visit four schools in the 7th District.
I've said it many times, but I'll say it again - the most fulfilling
experiences that I have as your Member of Congress are when I can learn
from our nation's young people and bring their optimism back to
Washington, D.C.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
