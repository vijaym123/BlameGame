SHARE YOUR STORY
A number of families have already reached out to my office because
their premiums under the Affordable Care Act's regulations are
skyrocketing.
I want to hear your story.
The more we can demonstrate
the real-life consequences of Obamacare, the better our chance will be
to replace this law with a consumer-driven alternative like the
American Health Care Reform Act, which I have cosponsored. Please watch
my video below and visit noem.house.gov/mystory
