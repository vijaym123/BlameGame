Rubio Comments On GOP Victory In The
Senate
Marco issued the following statement
after Republicans gained a Senate
majority in the 2014 midterm
elections:
Voters across the country
have sent a clear message that they are
not ready to give up on the American
Dream. The American people have elected
a new crop of reformers to go to
Washington, end the dysfunction and
achieve real solutions to the many
obstacles standing in the way of all
people who are trying to achieve a
better life.
I hope President Obama will
listen carefully to the message the
American people sent him in this
election, and work with Congress to
solve the pressing issues facing all
Americans. The American people deserve
it.
In the coming months, I look
forward to working in a Senate
Republican majority to advance the
reform agenda Ive presented this
year to promote job creation and higher
education, help people save for
retirement, improve our anti-poverty
programs, and rebuild and modernize our
military to meet the challenges
well face throughout this
century.
During Official Visit To Colombia,
Rubio Discusses Future Of
U.S.-Colombian Relations
While on an official visit to
Colombia, Marco met with key leaders to
discuss the future of U.S.-Colombian
relations. He issued the following
statement:
Id like to thank the
people and government of Colombia for
their generous hospitality, as well as
the entire team at the U.S. Embassy in
Bogot. America has a vested
interest in Colombias security
and economic prosperity, and it is my
hope that we continue working together
to build a strong U.S.-Colombia
relationship that lasts well beyond
this century.
Colombia is Americas
most capable and willing ally in Latin
America. I am proud of the role the
U.S. has played in helping
Colombias armed forces and
national police take back their country
from the violence and terror that has
gripped so much of Colombia for
decades.
I support the Government of
Colombias efforts to rid their
country, once and for all, from
poisonous narcoterrorist organizations
like the FARC and ELN, and I hope one
day Colombians will be able to enjoy a
real and lasting peace. The U.S.
commitment to Colombia remains strong
and it is vital for the security of the
hemisphere that we maintain this
important alliance.
Florida is home to hundreds
of thousands of Americans of Colombian
descent, and Colombia is
Floridas second-largest foreign
export market. Growing commerce between
our countries is vital to continued
economic growth and a vibrant middle
class in both the U.S. and Colombia.
And Colombias success is
particularly important to Floridians,
as so many Colombians have chosen to
call Florida their home.
I pledge to return to the
Senate to ensure the U.S.-Colombia
relationship remains strong, and a top
priority of the new Senate and House
majorities.

Rubio, Cardin Urge Obama To Press
China On Human Rights During Visit
Marco and Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD)
urged President Obama to raise the issue
of human rights and the need for
political reform with President Xi
Jinping during his visit to China next
week.
In
a
letter to President Obama , Marco and
Cardin, the Ranking Member and
Chairmanof the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, respectively, expressed
concern over the Chinese
governments emphasis on
authoritarian control at the
expense of human rights and rule of
law, and encouraged the President
to stand up for those Chinese who
are unjustly imprisoned, tortured, or
harassed because of their political
views, ethnicity, or religious
beliefs.
Human rights are too
important to the future of U.S.-China
relations to be treated as a side issue
handled by low-level
officials,
the Senators
wrote .The ultimate
success of U.S. engagement with China
will ultimately depend on whether the
Chinese people one day have a
government that allows them to fulfill
their aspirations rather than restricts
their fundamental freedoms and limits
their potential. As the
Congressional-Executive Commission
stated in their report, There is
a direct link between concrete
improvements in human rights and the
rule of law and the security and
prosperity of the United States and
China.
That is why your visit is so
important not just to the cause of
freedom in China, but also to
Americas long-term interests in
a productive relationship with China
and prosperity and stability in East
Asia,
they added . We hope that
you will use this opportunity to
publicly and privately speak out on
behalf of these individuals and all in
China who yearn for the day when their
government will truly reflect their
interests and values.

Agency Updates
Scam Phone Calls Continue; IRS
Unveils New Video to Warn Taxpayers
IRS YouTube Video:
Tax Scams:
English
As incidents of an aggressive
telephone scam continue across the
country, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) unveiled a new YouTube video with a
renewed warning to taxpayers not to be
fooled by imposters posing as tax agency
representatives.
The new Tax Scams video describes some
basic tips to help protect taxpayers from
tax scams.
These callers may demand money or may
say you have a refund due and try to
trick you into sharing private
information. Here are five things the
scammers often do but the IRS will not
do. Any one of these five things is a
tell-tale sign of a scam. The IRS will
never:
Call to demand immediate payment,
nor will the agency call about taxes
owed without first having mailed you a
bill.
Demand that you pay taxes without
giving you the opportunity to question
or appeal the amount they say you
owe.
Require you to use a specific
payment method for your taxes, such as
a prepaid debit card.
Ask for credit or debit card
numbers over the phone.
Threaten to bring in local police
or other law-enforcement groups to have
you arrested for not paying.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS and asking
for money, heres what you should
do:
If you know you owe taxes or think
you might owe, call the IRS at
1.800.829.1040. The IRS workers can
help you with a payment issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to believe that
you do, report the incident to the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA) at
1.800.366.4484 or at
www.tigta.gov .
If youve been targeted by
this scam, also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their
FTC Complaint Assistant
at FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
Remember, too, the IRS does not use
email, text messages or any social media
to discuss your personal tax issue. For
more information on reporting tax scams,
go to
www.irs.gov
and type
scam in the search box.
Additional information about tax scams
is available on IRS social media sites,
including YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/user/irsvideos
and Tumblr
http://internalrevenueservice.tumblr.com ,
where people can search
scam to find all the
scam-related posts.
