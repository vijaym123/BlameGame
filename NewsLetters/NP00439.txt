Dear Friend,
This month we got a closer look at the goals of Karl Rove&rsquo;s outside spending group, American Crossroads, when their president said:
&ldquo;Our goal is to win the White House and hold the Senate and the House&rdquo; for Republicans.
And we know the Koch network has a huge goal: Spend nearly
a billion dollars
in advance of the 2016 elections to change minds and mislead voters.
Well you know what? Our network has a goal, too:
Be prepared to fight against these special interests, no matter what they throw at us. You can help us accomplish that by contributing $5 or more toward the $15,000 we need to raise in June to stay on track.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
In Congress my big goal is to support and protect Massachusetts families. And with every vote I cast to protect Medicare and Social Security, to lower the cost of education, or to counteract the effects of climate change, I do a little more to accomplish that.
But keeping the likes of Karl Rove and the Koch brothers at bay isn&rsquo;t a job I can do all by myself.
Make no mistake, I will continue fighting to end the effects of
Citizens United
that led to these outside groups in the first place.
But only a strong grassroots network can hope to fight against the massive spending Rove and the Kochs are unleashing.
And to keep up our strength, we need to hit each and every goal we set.
If you can, please make a contribution today.
Friend -- thank you for your help today.
