Dear Friends,
Im wearing this blue
ribbon to show my support for our foster care families during
National Foster Care Month. Thousands of children across West Virginia are
waiting for homes, and you can make a difference by volunteering,
mentoring or fostering a child.

THANK A TEACHER
This week is also Teacher
Appreciation Week -- what an opportunity to express your gratitude to a
teacher in your life! Whether it is to the teacher of one of your
children or an educator who made a difference in your life, reach out and
thank a teacher this week for all of the hard work he or she does for
West Virginia's students.
This is Teresa Hammond, now of
Kenna Elementary, who met with me in Washington today to discuss
education issues. Teresa taught all three of my children when they were in
fourth grade, and I thank her for everything she's done for her past and
present students.
The House also voted 360-45 today to
pass improvements to charter schools. H.R. 10, the Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools, would provide grants for new
charter schools and improve and streamline current charter school
programs.
Happy Mother's
Day!
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and
as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
