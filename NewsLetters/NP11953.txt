Dear Friend,
I have received a number of emails and letters concerned that the
Republican conference has committed to a bill that grants amnesty to
persons who entered the country illegally. This is not true.
Speaker John Boehner introduced a list of guidelines he supported if we
were to write an immigration reform bill. He has since pulled that
document from consideration.
The document did not support amnesty. It did provide for a limited
pathway to legal status, meaning people could be here legally after
meeting a number of stringent requirements, but there was not a pathway
to citizenship or amnesty.
I will keep you informed if there is a bill that supports immigration
reform in the future and outline what the bill supports.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress
