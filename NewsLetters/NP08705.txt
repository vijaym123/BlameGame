Friend,
Tomorrow, June 14 th , is the 239 th
anniversary of the founding of our army.
In the spring of 1775, the colonies had no proper army, but following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the revolutionaries had to re-organize their disjointed militia forces quickly if they were to stand a chance against the professional British army.
Reportedly, at John Adams request, Congress voted to incorporate the Boston militia into a single armed force that also included the formation of ten companies of riflemen from other colonies on June 14.
Also on this day, Congress resolved to form a committee to bring in a draft of rules and regulations for the government of the Army, and voted $2,000,000 to support the forces around Boston, and those at New York City.
Since being sworn into office I have worked hard to ensure that our military families and veterans receive the care they deserve. In support of our military families and veterans I have introduced The Military Family Leave Act, to further support military families, and the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act, to better help those who served with the services that they need.
As your Congressman, I will continue to do everything that I can to maintain a strong, ready force capable of defeating our strongest enemies and to ensure that our veterans are welcomed home with respect and care.
Sincerely,
