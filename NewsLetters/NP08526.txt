Making a Difference in Indian Country
Far too often, the challenges, such as high rates of abuse, suicide,
and poverty, facing Native American families are misunderstood,
overlooked, or ignored. For decades, I have worked hard to raise
awareness and bring light to these issues because we should care about
every family and every child.
Last Friday, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama visited the
Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation
in North Dakota - only the second visit to
Indian Country by a sitting president since World War II. They had an
opportunity to see the rich culture, history, and traditions of our
tribes. They also sat down with a group of Native children to talk
about some of the challenges they face and what can be done to give
every Native child the opportunity to grow and succeed. While I may not
agree with the President on some issues, we both absolutely agree that
giving Native families and children every opportunity is imperative.
The President's visit meant a great deal to Indian Country, and to
every family and child there, it was a symbol to them that they matter.
That's a wonderful thing to see.

I'm hopeful the President's visit helps elevate these issues
nationally, just as I'm trying to do through my work in the Senate -
including my Commission on Native Children bill - so more Americans
realize that we must do a better job for Native children. Click here

Speaking with veterans at my Native American Veterans Summit in Bismarck
The following day, I held my first Native American Veterans Summit in
Bismarck. Native Americans serve in the military at a higher rate than
any other ethnic group. But I'm concerned they don't have the support
and access to resources and benefits they deserve. To fix this problem,
I wanted to make sure their concerns were heard and they have access to
the resources, support, and benefits they earned. More than 140 Native
veterans who participated in the summit also were able to hear from
Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Interior Department Assistant
Secretary - Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn who joined. I'll keep working
to improve coordination between the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), Veterans Service Officers, Indian Health Service, and tribes to
improve access to housing, employment, transportation, and health care
programs. If you are a veteran seeking support or services, feel free
to contact my office at 800-223-4457 to get your questions answered.
I've spent a great deal of time in Indian Country and have seen
firsthand the problems facing our tribes, but we are beginning to turn
the corner. By working together and understanding these issues, we have
a tremendous opportunity to make a significant impact and create real,
long-term solutions for Native families. I'll keep fighting to make
that happen.

Making
a
Difference
in
Indian
Country
Far
too
often,
the
challenges,
such
as
high
rates
of
abuse,
suicide,
and
poverty,
facing
Native

are
misunderstood,

visited
the
Standing

Sioux
Indian

in
North

-
only
the

visit
to
Indian

by a
sitting
president
since
World
War
II.
They
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the

They
also
sat

The
following
day,
I
held
my

Native
Americans
serve
in
the
military
at
a
higher
rate
than
any
other
ethnic
group.
But
I'm
concerned
they
don't
have
the
support
and

to
resources
and
benefits
they
deserve.
To
fix
this
problem,
I
wanted
to
make
sure
their
concerns
were
heard
and
they
have
access
to
the
resources,
support,

they
earned.

140
Native

who
participated
in
the
summit
also
were
able
to
hear
from
Interior

Sally
Jewell
and

who
joined.
I'll

coordination
between
the

and
tribes
to
