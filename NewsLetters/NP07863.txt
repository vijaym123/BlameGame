Crisis at Our Southern Border
The broad nature of our southern border poses many challenges when it comes to enforcing our nations immigration laws.
Recent reports have indicated that more than 52,000 unaccompanied children and an additional 39,000 women with children have been apprehended at the border this year. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported a 92% rise in the number of unaccompanied children crossing the southern border in 2014.
Recently, Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson estimated that up to 90,000 minors could illegally cross the border by the end of the summer.
In your opinion, how should the United States federal government respond to this growing crisis?
I look forward to hearing your responses on this important issue.
Sincerely,
David G. Valadao
Member of Congress
