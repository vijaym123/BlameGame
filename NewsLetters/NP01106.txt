Let people, not courts, define
marriage
This week the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case
involving four separate lawsuits, each dealing with the same question: does
the U.S. Constitution require the redefinition of
marriage?
The answer is simple: there is nothing in the Constitution
prohibiting the states from retaining the traditional definition of marriage as
a union between a man and a woman.
This case comes from
the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled last year that the
citizens of Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee have the constitutional
authority to amend their state constitutions to define marriage as the
union of a man and a woman.
The basis of the 6th
Circuits decision is the plain fact that the Constitution is silent on the
question of marriage, just as it is silent on many questions that arise
in the public square.
This is by
design.
When the Constitution neither requires nor forbids a particular policy
outcome, it leaves the matter up to the people to decide. In this sense,
our Constitution is not an answer book as much as it is a blueprint.
Its purpose is not to resolve every debate, but to create a framework
of government in which a free people can govern themselves and
address the questions of the day through their elected
representatives.
