KNOW A VETERAN? SHARE WITH A VETERAN!
THIS SATURDAY I'm hosting my 10th enrollment clinic in South Jersey.
>From 10:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., South Jersey veterans can get
assistance in person from VA Wilmington Medical Center personnel to
help access healthcare, education and other benefits. Veterans need
only to bring a copy of the DD214 and last year's financial
information, as well as a picture ID. My staff will also be on hand to
help with casework. So if you know a veteran, share this e-newsletter
with them and pass it forward so that we can ensure all South Jersey
veterans are enrolled. More information is available at my website
.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Earlier this month I convened an Aviation Subcommittee field hearing at
the FAA Technical Center in Pomona. A first for the Tech Center and its
staff, Ranking Member Rick Larsen (WA-02) and I questioned witnesses
from the FAA and private industry on the implementation and importance
of NextGen - the nation's aviation modernization project. Additionally,
we examined the role that unmanned aerial systems will play in our
daily lives once commercial UAS are safely integrated into the National
Air Space. Get caught up with NBC 40's report
and the Press of Atlantic City
.

SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC"
After a overwhelmingly bipartisan 306-91 vote in the House, I held a
press conference to discuss the flood insurance reform fix I helped
author
and detail the intense behind-the-scenes negotiations that
led to the bill being sent to the President for his signature. I was
joined by fellow New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, Cape May County
Freeholder Director Gerry Thornton, Ocean City Mayor Jay Gillian and
other coastal community mayors from Atlantic & Cape May counties at the
Ocean City Music Pier.
