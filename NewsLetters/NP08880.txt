Dear Friends:
Weve had quite a week in Washington, but some good things have happened for the folks in the 12 th
District.
I wanted to share with you whats been going on, but more importantly, get your feedback.
This week, the President signed into law the Water Resources Reform Development Act (WRRDA).
This bill was the final legislative approval needed for work to begin at the Port of Savannah.
Deepening the harbor will mean more jobs for the region, and will significantly boost the economy in Georgia and the entire Southeast portion of the country.
I was very proud to work with my colleagues to get this long overdue project underway.
Also this week, the House passed a bill to address the long delays at Veterans Affairs (VA) clinics across the country.
The bill introduced by House Veterans Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, myself, and a bipartisan coalition of members makes it possible for service members to receive care outside the VA if the wait times are too long. Its a commonsense piece of legislation that removes bonuses for VA employees and focuses on providing access to our veterans, something theyve earned.
Finally, this week, Ive introduced with my Republican colleague from Virginia, Rep. Scott Rigell, a resolution of disapproval of the transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
I know how important it is for us to get our troops back if theyve been captured, but I disagree with the administration's decision to negotiate with terrorists and failure to properly notify Congress.
I want to know what you think about this.
Please take our very quick survey below to give us your thoughts .
Thanks for staying involved.
I hope youll join me this weekend at another round of Congress on the Corner town hall meetings in the district. Ill be in
Screven, Effingham, Bulloch, and Evans Counties . You can get the information on our meetings by
