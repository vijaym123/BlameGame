Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
The holiday season is a valued time for Landra and me. We
always look forward to the opportunity to spend time with our children
and grandchildren. This year we were blessed to spend the
Thanksgiving holiday with 44 of our family members. We hope you were also
surrounded by loved ones. And we wish you the joy of family and friends
during this holiday season.
Unfortunately, too many families
will not have that privilege this year, as their loved ones are serving
abroad in the Armed Forces. We look forward to their safe return, as
they continue to sacrifice to keep our country safe. During this time of
celebration, we honor their selflessness and sacrifice.
It
is an honor and a privilege to represent Nevada in the United States
Senate. I am grateful for the trust placed in me. This year, I
recorded a special holiday greeting that you can view by

On behalf of our entire family, we
wish you and yours a safe and happy holiday season and New
Year.
Sincerely,
HARRY REID
U.S. Senator for
Nevada
