The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Sessions
Week of January 6 - 10, 2014
This week, the House passed the Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act of 2014, which requires the HHS Secretary to alert any
individual within two business days if their personal information
entered on the ObamaCare website when signing up for the exchange has
been compromised. While House Republicans continue to fight to fully
repeal ObamaCare, it is imperative that we take steps to protect
Americans' personal information and demand much-needed transparency
from the Administration.
Although the Administration claims it will notify individuals about
security breaches, these notifications need to be required by law -
especially since the American people have already witnessed so many
broken promises regarding ObamaCare. Additionally, congressional
oversight uncovered that HHS did not perform a full Security Control
Assessment before the website went live on October 1, 2013, and that
they failed to conduct an end-to-end security check since the web site
has launched. To make matters worse, CMS's Chief Information Security
Officer admitted in a draft memo that "there is also no confidence that
Personal Identifiable Information will be protected."
Clearly, the functionality and readiness of ObamaCare has been
repeatedly misrepresented. That is why it is imperative that we enforce
legislative measures to safeguard the American people from the impacts
of this disastrous law. To read this straightforward, two-page bill,

Another Weak Jobs Report
The Department of Labor's monthly jobs report released today showed
that our economy only added 74,000 jobs in the month of December - the
lowest number of new jobs created in a single month since January 2011.
This weak report highlights the fact that the Obama economy fails to
meet the needs of the American people. At a time when the labor force
participation rate is at its lowest in 35 years and 5.6 million people
between 18 and 34 are out of work
, the Administration should focus on promoting legislation to
spur job creation.
In the 113th Congress, House Republicans have passed dozens of
job-creating bills
that Senate Democrats refuse to consider. Our initiatives
include bills to expand American energy production, improve job
training for the long-term unemployed, and limit burdensome rules and
regulations that stifle economic growth. Texans know firsthand that a
thriving energy sector and sensible regulations are essential to a
robust economy. That is why in the new year I will remain committed to
a pro-jobs agenda that focuses on getting Washington out of the way so
that new job opportunities can be created for North Texans.
Update on Benghazi Attack
As you may remember, I joined several Members in sending a letter,
spearheaded by my Texas colleague Michael McCaul (TX-10), to Secretary
Kerry
calling on
him to use the Department of State's "Reward for Justice" program to
help apprehend the perpetrators of the Benghazi terrorist attack. The
program includes a reward of up to $10 million for information leading
to the arrest or conviction of any individual responsible for the
attacks. Initially, the State Department replied that the program was
being used to bring the perpetrators to justice, but it did not
identify the groups that were responsible for the attack.
Today, thanks to our efforts, the State Department designated Ansar
al-Shari'a in Benghazi, Ansar al-Shari'a in Darnah, and Ansar al-Shari'a
in Tunisia as separate Foreign Terrorist Organizations responsible for
the attack and agreed to use the Rewards for Justice program to bring
members of these groups to justice. I'm pleased that the State
Department finally named the exact groups that were responsible for the
attack against the U.S. Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi. This
proves what we have known all along - the Obama administration mislead
the American people when it said that the attack was a spontaneous
response to a video when in reality it was a calculated terrorist
attack against an American outpost. Congress and the American people
have still not been told the full story regarding Benghazi and I will
continue to support every effort to uncover the truth.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

Another
Weak
Jobs
Report The
Department
of
Labor&#8217;s
monthly
jobs
report
released
today
showed
that
our
economy
only
added
74,000
jobs
in
the
month
of
December
&#8211;
the
lowest
number
of
new
jobs
created
in
a
single
month
since
January
2011.
This
weak
report
highlights
the
fact
that
the
Obama
economy
fails
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
American
people. At
a
time
when
the
labor
force
participation
rate
is
at
its
lowest
in
35
years
and
5.6
million
people
between
18
and
34
are
out
of
work ,
the
Administration
should
focus
on
promoting
legislation
to
spur
job
creation.
In
the
113th
Congress,
House
Republicans
have
passed
dozens
of
job-creating
bills
that
Senate
Democrats
refuse
to
consider.
Our
initiatives
include
bills
to
expand
American
energy
production,
improve
job
training
for
the
long-term
unemployed,
and
limit
burdensome
rules
and
regulations
that
stifle
economic
growth.
Texans
know
firsthand
that
a
thriving
energy
sector
and
sensible
regulations
are
essential
to
a
robust
economy. That
is
why
in
the
new
year
I
will
remain
committed
to
a
pro-jobs
agenda
that
focuses
on
getting
Washington
out
of
the
way
so
that
new
job

can

North

Benghazi
Attack
As
you
may

I
joined
several

in
sending
a

spearheaded
by
my
Texas

Michael

(TX-10),
to
Secretary
Kerry
calling
on
him
to
use
the
Department
of
State&#8217;s
&#8220;Reward
for
Justice&#8221;
program
to
help
apprehend
the
perpetrators
of
the
Benghazi
terrorist
attack. The
program
includes
a
reward
of
up
to
$10
million
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
or
conviction
of
any
individual
responsible
for
the
attacks. Initially,
the
State
Department
replied
that
the

being
used
to
bring
the
perpetrators
to
justice,
but
it
did
not
identify
the
groups
that
were
responsible
for
the
attack.
Today,
thanks
to
our
efforts,
the
State
Department
designated
Ansar
al-Shari&#8217;a
in
Benghazi,
Ansar
al-Shari&#8217;a
in
Darnah,
and
Ansar
al-Shari&#8217;a
in
Tunisia
as
separate
Foreign
Terrorist
Organizations
responsible
for
the
attack
and
agreed
to
use
the
Rewards
for
Justice
program
to
bring
members
of
these
groups
to
justice. I&#8217;m
pleased
that
the
State
Department
finally
named
the
exact
groups
that
were
responsible
for
the
attack
against
the
U.S.
Special
Mission
and
Annex
in
Benghazi. This
proves
what
we
have
known
all

&#8211;

the
American
people
when

that
the

when
in
reality
it
was
a

terrorist
attack
against
an
American
outpost.
Congress
and
the
American
people
have
still
not
been
told
the
full
story
regarding
Benghazi
and
I
will
continue
to
support
every
effort
to
uncover
the
truth.
Have
a
