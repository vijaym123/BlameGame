I am looking forward to 2015 and the start of a new
Congress.
The American people want to see action and I look forward to
the 114 th
Congress and getting to work.
Early next
year both Chambers appear likely to send legislation to President
Obama saying it is time to build the Keystone XL pipeline.
We need
jobs and energy security in our country and that is what the Keystone
XL represents.
I am also hopeful the House and Senate can
make meaningful efforts at reforming our nations broken tax
code.
Our current tax code is riddled with loopholes and is too
complex.
I will again be supporting the Fair Tax.
I like the Fair
Tax because it is a consumption based tax and treats everyone
fairly.
Whatever direction Congress takes, we need a simpler and fairer
tax code.
In the 114 th
Congress both
chambers will work to rein in the unelected bureaucrats who like to crank out
rules and regulations with little to no thought on how the rules
impact hardworking taxpayers.
While we should all strive for strong
environmental protections, some of the recent regulations coming out
of the EPA run the very real risk of bankrupting towns, cities and
municipalities across the country. We need to reform the regulatory
process to ensure any new regulation does not hinder growth in our
economy.
I hope both chambers can pass a version of the REINS Act which
would require Congressional approval for major
regulations.
Immigration will be another issue that the new Congress will
address.
I have always held that a secure border means we have
operational control over our borders, and this must be done before any other
action is taken on immigration.
Any reform effort without border
security first will not fix the problem.
Congress will also take
action to rein in the presidents unilateral action on
immigration.
Americans expect Congress to work for them, and I am
excited about the opportunities the House and Senate will have in the
114 th
Congress to support efforts to get our nations economy
growing and create jobs.
It is exciting to think we can now have
realistic expectations in the 114 th
Congress to actually
pass bills out of the House and Senate and get them to the presidents
desk to get our economy moving once again.
