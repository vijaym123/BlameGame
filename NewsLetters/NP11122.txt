Dear Friend
Today, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments for two challenges to Obamacares HHS mandate, from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood. With these cases, there is more at stake here than the ability of businesses to exercise their First Amendment right to freedom of religion, as important as that is. Intrinsic to the arguments being heard today is the fundamental understanding of the freedom of conscience: does it extend beyond merely where an individual worships to encompass a persons whole being
who he is, how he acts, and the daily decisions he makes?
If our nation is to maintain our heritage of religious liberty and preserve the values of our Founders for future generations, then the answer to that question is clear. Freedom of conscience can include nothing less than the way a person lives all aspects of her life, from her private life to her public life and commercial conduct.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
Despite the snowy day on Capitol Hill, many still came out to show their support for Hobby Lobby and the Green familys fight for religious freedom.
