Here&rsquo;s the state of play with only 28 days until the election:
-- Control of Congress is at stake
-- Republican groups are spending massive sums against us
-- Democrats need your help to win
It all comes down to this: If the Republicans win, we know who they&rsquo;ll be fighting for. Once again, the interests of billionaires will come before the needs of the middle class.
I&rsquo;m not willing to let that happen.
But I need your help.
So David, will you be one of the 26 supporters from the 60659 zip code we need to chip in before this final fundraising deadline?
Your donation will be triple-matched.
All Donations to this Email

Right now, Democrats are building one of the largest grassroots organizations ever seen for a midterm election. We&rsquo;re registering tens of thousands of new voters who will vote for the first time this year. And in states with early voting, we&rsquo;re already getting folks out to the polls.
But all that work&hellip; it can&rsquo;t happen without your support. So please David, do what you can today. https://action.dccc.org/tonight-deadline

Barack Obama
