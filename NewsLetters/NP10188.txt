Dear Friend &ndash;
You may have recently signed up for new health insurance through Covered California. I know that health insurance can seem overwhelming, especially if this is the first time you have had access to coverage or have qualified for MediCal.
As your representative in Congress, I want to help you put your new policies to work for you and your family. That is why I am launching
&ldquo;Know Your Benefits,&rdquo;
a series of workshops where you can learn more about how health insurance will work for you and the benefits everyone receives under the Affordable Care Act. Most importantly, you can get directly connected &ndash; in person &ndash; to your insurance provider.
I hope you&rsquo;ll join me and our community partners AltaMed, CalOptima and Kaiser Permanente for the first of many workshops this year.
And if you're already fluent in deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums, I hope you'll share this information with your friends and neighbors.
