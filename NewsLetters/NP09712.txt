News from Representative Peter Roskam
Celebrating Our Local Young Artists
For over 30 years, the Congressional Art Competition has showcased the
amazing ability of our nation's most talented young artists. From
dozens of submissions, three students were recognized at a reception
for the annual 6th District Congressional Art Competition reception for
their outstanding artistic talent by an independent local judge.
I am always impressed by the creativity and ability these students
demonstrate, and this year was no exception. My wife Elizabeth and I
truly enjoyed spending the evening with area high school artists, and
as an artist herself this competition is near and dear to Elizabeth's
heart.
Congratulations to all the artists who participate, and I hope
this is just the beginning of their interest and participation in the
arts.
