We don't know what else to say.
Normally at this point, we'd email you to say we're SO CLOSE to reaching our goal.
But we're not even close.
We don't want to give up and let Karl Rove's Obama-bashing ads go unanswered -- but right now, we simply can't afford to fight back.
So we have to ask one more time:
David -- will you chip in to help us fight Rove's lies before tonight's ad buy deadline?
