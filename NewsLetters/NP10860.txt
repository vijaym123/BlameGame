Dear Friends,
Before I get into what happened last week in Congress, I want to say
how great it was to go to the Clay County and Suwannee County Fairs
yesterday. The Suwannee County fair is celebrating its 99th-year and
Clay County is putting on their 28th. It's no secret that I love being
home. But, as a large animal vet, I really enjoy attending these fairs,
seeing the livestock, and watching everyone enjoying themselves. It is
events like these that bring people and communities together, showing
the heart and soul of America. I wish we had more of a community feel
in Washington, D.C.
Tomorrow I head back to do the peoples business, but I want to shed
light on what I was doing last week. I have sent letters to various
committee chairmen requesting that language be inserted into funding
bills that will protect you the citizens of the 3rd congressional
district and the American people. Government is encroaching more and
more on our way of life and it needs to be stopped. One of my goals in
Congress is to reduce the size and reach of the federal government.
Reagan once said, "Man is not free unless government is limited." I
agreed whole-heartedly with this statement.
Making Sure American Citizens Are Not Victims Of Warrantless Drone
Surveillance:
I asked Chairman John Carter (R-TX) and Ranking Member David Price
(D-NC) of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, to
ensure that no funding for FY2015 be made available for warrantless
drone surveillance of U.S. citizens on U.S. territory. Read more.
Ensuring The Federal Government Does Not Regulate Your Backyard Pond:
I submitted a letter to two Appropriations subcommittees; the Energy,
Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and the Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. I requested that
language be inserted in their respective funding bills ensuring the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers
will not implement new rules on navigable waters. Essentially, denying
the EPA from redefining "waters of the United States." Read More.
Strengthening Education by Eliminating Federal Overreach:
I have asked Chairman Jack Kingston (R-GA) of the Labor, Health and
Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee and Ranking
Member Rosa Luisa DeLauro (D-Conn), to eliminate funding for the Race
to the Top Fund (RTT).
Read more.
American Conservative Union Award:
I was given the 'ACU Conservative Award' for my achievements recognized
in the 2013 American Conservative Union (ACU) Rating of Congress. Since
1971, as the nation's oldest and largest grassroots conservative
organization, it has annually graded Members of Congress based on their
votes on key conservative issues. It was an honor to be recognized by
this organization.
I appreciate you taking the time to read this newsletter, and I am
looking forward to speaking with you next week.
Sincerely,
Ted

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
Before
I
get
into
what
happened
last
week
in
Congress,
I
want
to
say
how
great
it
was
to
go
to
the
Clay
County
and
Suwannee
County
Fairs
yesterday.
The
Suwannee
County
fair
is
celebrating
its
99th-year
and
Clay
County
is
putting
on
their
28 th .
It&#8217;s
no
secret
that
I
love
being
home.
But,
as
a
large
animal
vet,
I
really
enjoy
attending
these
fairs,
seeing
the
livestock,
and
watching
everyone
enjoying
themselves.
It
is
events
like
these
that
bring
people
and
communities
together,
showing
the
heart
and
soul
of
America.
I
wish
we
had
more
of
a
community
feel
in
Washington,
D.C.
Tomorrow
I
head
back
to
do
the
peoples
business,
but
I
want
to
shed
light
on
what
I
was
doing
last
week.
I
have
sent
letters
to
various
committee
chairmen
requesting
that
language
be
inserted
into
funding
bills
that
will
protect
you
the
citizens
of
the
3 rd
congressional
district
and
the
American
people.
Government
is
encroaching
more
and
more
on
our
way
of
life
and
it
needs
to
be
stopped.
One
of
my
goals
in
Congress
is
to
reduce
the
size
and
reach
of
the
federal
government.
Reagan
once
said,
&#8220; Man
is
not
free
unless
government
is
limited .&#8221;
I
agreed
whole-heartedly
with
this
statement.
Making
Sure
American
Citizens
Are
Not
Victims
Of
Warrantless
Drone
Surveillance:
I
asked
Chairman
John
Carter
(R-TX)
and
Ranking
Member
David
Price
(D-NC)
of
the
Appropriations
Subcommittee
on
Homeland
Security,
to
ensure
that
no
funding
for
FY2015
be
made
available
for
warrantless
drone
surveillance
of
U.S.
citizens
on
U.S.
territory.

Ensuring
The
Federal
Government
Does
Not
Regulate
Your
Backyard
Pond:
I
submitted
a
letter
to
two
Appropriations
subcommittees;
the
Energy,
Water
Development,
and
Related
Agencies
Subcommittee
and
the
Interior,
Environment,
and
Related
Agencies
Subcommittee.
I
requested
that
language
be
inserted
in
their
respective
funding
bills
ensuring
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
and
U.S.
Army
Corp
of
Engineers
will
not
implement
new
rules
on
navigable
waters.
Essentially,
denying
the
EPA
from
redefining
&#8220; waters
of
the
United
States .&#8221;

Strengthening
Education
by
Eliminating
Federal
Overreach:
I
have
asked
Chairman
Jack
Kingston
(R-GA)
of
the
Labor,
Health
and
Human
Services
and
Education
Appropriations
Subcommittee
and
Ranking
Member
Rosa
Luisa
DeLauro
(D-Conn),
to
eliminate
funding
for
the
Race

the

I
was
