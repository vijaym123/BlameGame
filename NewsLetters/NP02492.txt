Dear Friend,
Today Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress about the ongoing threat of Irans nuclear proliferation program.
The radical Iranian regime is a known sponsor of terrorism and, as a member of the Conference Committee that considered the Iran Sanctions Act, I agree with Prime Minister Netanyahu that allowing them to have nuclear weapons would have a devastating impact on the Middle East, on our allies, and most importantly, on the United States.
Currently, Secretary of State John Kerry is beginning another round of negotiations to put an end to Irans nuclear arms race by the end of this month.
While we have seen deadlines for these negotiations pass time and time again, we must act now as Iran could be only months away from having enough nuclear material to create a bomb.
Unlike the administration, I believe tougher sanctions must be implemented immediately.
The United States can in no way allow Iran to continue their hunt for nuclear weapons.
The Iranian regime has shown they cannot be trusted for a number of reasons.
They have refused to answer basic, longstanding questions from the International Atomic Energy Agency about their nuclear ambitions, they sponsor terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and they have repeatedly proclaimed that the state of Israel should be violently destroyed.
I will continue to call on President Obama and Secretary Kerry to negotiate an agreement that ends Irans nuclear ambitions once and for all.
Again, I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for sharing his unique insight on this growing threat to the safety and security of the United States and its allies.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
