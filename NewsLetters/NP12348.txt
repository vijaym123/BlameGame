Supporting Our Veterans This Valentine&rsquo;s Day
Dear Friends,
A very important event is approaching: The National Salute to Veterans Patients. Each year during the month of February, The Department of Veterans Affairs organizes a week during which America is called to honor the brave men and women that have courageously served in the Armed Forces. Veterans deserve our utmost support, and Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a perfect time to honor them through the VA&rsquo;s
National Salute to Veteran Patients .
Please consider taking a moment of your time to make a valentine or card to send to a VA Hospital, or visit a facility to thank the veterans who are being cared for there. The week of February 14 is full of opportunities to say thank you to these courageous men and women.
