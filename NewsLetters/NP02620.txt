Republicans are out of control -- going after Social Security and Obamacare, and even threatening a partial government shutdown. If the GOP takes control of the White House AND Congress in 2016, it would be a disaster.

We need you more than ever. Republicans are out of control -- going after Social Security and Obamacare, and even threatening a partial government shutdown. If the GOP takes control of the White House AND Congress in 2016, it would be a disaster.
The truth is, we CAN beat them.
We only need to knock off FOUR GOP Senators to reclaim the majority. Our targets include vulnerable Republicans in
blue states
--
Extremist Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who supports a partial government shutdown
Incendiary Mark Kirk of Illinois, who actually said that
&ldquo;If we have a successful terrorist attack, all the dead Americans from that should be laid at the feet of the Democratic caucus.&rdquo;
Unbelievable!
Renew your membership by Friday and we&rsquo;ll use every cent to hold these Republican extremists accountable and defeat them at the polls.
