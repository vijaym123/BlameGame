; as well as the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, where I will fight for my bipartisan Application Privacy, Protection and Security (APPS) Act , a bill to protect consumer privacy on mobile devices.
I am proud to serve on these two important committees, which will benefit constituents of the Fourth District and the nation by allowing me to continue to champion the rights of all Americans - consumers, workers and the middle class. I will also continue to fight to keep the Internet open and accessible, ensure consumer privacy is protected, work on comprehensive patent reform to increase innovation, and work to ensure that consumers do not sign away their rights unknowingly when they rent cars, buy cell phones, and enter into contracts with businesses.

GRAND JURY REFORM: As promised, I re-introduced the Grand Jury Reform Act. Passage of this bill would help restore trust in our justice system, while ensuring a fair process for all parties. According to a new poll released by the Progressive Change Institute, a strong majority of likely 2016 voters back a proposal for outside special prosecutors to investigate police-involved deaths. Sixty-one percent of those polled back the proposal, including 76 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Independents. A plurality of Republicans - 48 percent - also support the plan.

Dear
F riends,
I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I was renamed Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law (RRCAL) last week.
I have long supported competition, consumer welfare, and workers&#8217; rights. I look forward to building on these issues and expanding into new areas in the 114th Congress.
As ranking member of the subcommittee in the 113th Congress, I served as the subcommittee&#8217;s senior Democrat during hearings on net neutrality, the proposed mergers of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, and worked with my colleagues across the
aisle to pass legislation to update the nation&#8217;s bankruptcy laws.
In the 114th Congress, I will serve on two subcommittees: RRCAL, where I will seek support for my bill &#8211; the
Arbitration Fairness Act ; as well as the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, where I will fight for my bipartisan
Application Privacy, Protection and Security (APPS) Act , a bill to protect consumer privacy on mobile devices.
I am proud to serve on these two important committees, which will benefit constituents of the Fourth District and the nation by allowing me to continue to champion the rights of all Americans &#8211; consumers, workers and the middle class. I
will also continue to fight to keep the Internet open and accessible, ensure consumer privacy is protected, work on comprehensive patent reform to increase innovation, and work to ensure that consumers do not sign away their rights unknowingly when they rent
cars, buy cell phones, and enter into contracts with businesses. For more, click
