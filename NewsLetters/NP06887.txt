Pictures from the Grants and Small Business Workshop
During the August district work period, residents of the 10th Congressional District of Georgia were invited to attend my annual Grants and Small Business Workshop. This provided constituents with the opportunity to network with state and federal agencies while learning valuable information for a business or project. Thank you to everyone who stopped by and helped make this a successful event!
