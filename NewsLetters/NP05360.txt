Yesterday, I received some bad news:
The Koch Brothers cut Bobby Schilling&rsquo;s campaign a MASSIVE check. And David, it gets worse:
Chris Christie held a VIP fundraiser for Mr. Schilling TODAY. Bottom line?
All that cash will go
straight
towards nasty, personal attack ads. With the Illinois voters ALREADY casting their ballots, we can&rsquo;t wait even one day to set the record straight. Will you chip in a gift of any amount to our Emergency Rapid Response Fund?
Every dollar helps.
