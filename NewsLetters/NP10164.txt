Johnson Comments on
Minimum Wage Vote
Sen. Ron Johnson on voting against
cloture on the motion to proceed to S.2223, a bill to raise the minimum
wage:
We all want Americans to earn higher wages, but the
president's minimum wage proposal would have significant negative unintended
consequences that cannot be ignored.
The nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the current proposal would eliminate as
many as 1 million jobs, cutting off the first rung of the ladder of
opportunity for working Americans. We need more jobs, not fewer
jobs."

Washington
Post:
"It is time for the West to move ahead without
Russia"
By: Senators Johnson, McCain, Barasso and
Hoeven
We
recently visited Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Moldova. In
each country, our allies want a stronger immediate response to Russias
annexation of Crimea and its ongoing subversion of Ukraine. They also
believe, as we do, that Russian President Vladimir Putins latest acts
of aggression require an enduring strategic response from the United
States, Europe and NATO. It should be clear to all that Putins Russia
has taken a dark turn. There is no resetting this relationship. We
cannot return to business as usual.

A
raise to $10.10 an hour, unless you're
unlucky
It is
disturbing that Democrats in the Senate keep pushing for a higher minimum
wage even after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported
that will lead to as many as a million people losing their jobs. Read the
recent report. It clearly states that raising the minimum wage would
mean more income for some people now earning less than $10.10 but a
terrible pric e for others... Read
