Gratitude on Memorial Day
Because of the bravery, courage and commitment of our military, we are privileged to wake up each and every day feeling safe. We tend to forget that this sense of security doesnt come without a price.
Without a doubt, the United States remains the greatest and freest nation on earth because of the extraordinary service of those who step forward to protect and preserve the common good. Since our nations beginnings, countless men and women have done just that by selflessly answering the call of duty to protect our nation through service in the military.
Throughout all of May, we have observed Military Appreciation Month and rightly shown gratitude to our service members, veterans and their families. But Memorial Day marks a time to especially remember those who offered their last full measure of devotion to our nation, which is the ultimate display of sacrifice, loyalty and patriotism.
Certainly, the brave spirit and incredible courage of our fallen heroes will live on. Our history books must always tell their story, whether we remember the first founding heroes or those who fought valiantly in wars of the last and present century.
Please join me this Memorial Day in remembering all of our heroes past and present. They deserve our greatest and most sincere gratitude.
Sincerely,
Tom Cole
