Week in Review
Last week, I teamed up with
Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to
introduce a new bill to
extend
unemployment insurance
benefits . The paid-for bill
provides prospective emergency
benefits and allows eligible job
seekers who were cutoff on December
28 to pick up where they left off
in the unemployment insurance
claims process. This year has been
extremely difficult for Nevadans
who still do not know how they are
going to pay their bills or feed
their families. I am grateful to
Senator Reed for his continued
partnership on this important
issue, and I hope Congress can move
this legislation forward.
On Wednesday, I questioned the
Department of Treasury Secretary,
Jacob Lew, at a Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing, &amp; Urban
Affairs hearing titled, The
Financial Stability Oversight
Council Annual Report to
Congress. During the
hearing, I questioned the Treasury
Secretarys apparent
hands off approach on
addressing the missing emails of
former IRS Exempt Organizations
Division Director Lois Lerner.
Recently, the IRS has come under
fire for having lost a number of
emails pertaining to the activities
of Ms. Lerner. You can watch our
back and forth
here .
Thursday, I introduced the
PLAQ Act ,
legislation that would identify
quagga mussels as invasive species.
The quagga mussel is considered one
of the biggest threats to Lake
Tahoe, Lake Mead, Lahontan
Reservoir, Rye Patch Reservoir, and
many other western lakes and
reservoirs. They wreak havoc
on the water bodies by
concentrating pollutants, clogging
pipes, and lining shorelines. By
passing the PLAQ Act and listing
the quagga mussel as an invasive
species, Congress can protect these
natural resources and accomplish in
just a short time what would
otherwise take many years.
Last week, we also witnessed the
Supreme Court of
the United States overturn the
appointments that President Obama
made to the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB)
in
January 2012. This decision
reinforces the basic principles
upon which this nation was founded
and provides an important check to
President Obamas
extraordinary power grab. This
Administration has a troubling
pattern of circumventing Congress,
which has no doubt contributed to
Americans lack of faith in
their government.
