Visiting Local Small
Businesses
This past week, I was
glad to spend time in the district visiting local industry. On
Wednesday, I spent the day in Morganton stopping by small businesses and
speaking with their owners and employees. I met with local officials at
Pat's Snack Bar and tried my hand at frying an egg. Later that morning, I
stopped into Smokefoot Trade and Loan, My Local Bakery, and Kala
Contemporary Craft Gala where I picked up a pair of colorful socks for my
friend, Rep. Howard Coble.

Morganton in the News Herald

Teaming Up With Former Rep.
Heath Shuler on 'Road to Nowhere'
Funding
Next week, former Democrat Representative of the 11th District,
Heath Shuler, will join me to tesitfy before the House
Sub-committee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation urging it to pay
Swain County funds allocated for the "Road to
Nowhere."
The National Park service is currently witholding $4 million that was
allocated to Swain County back in 2012 as part of a settlement with
the federal government over a road that was supposed to be constructed
as payment for the county when they conveyed land to the NPS for Great
Smoky Mountains National Park in 1943, but the road was never
built.
The hold up in releasing the funds is a typical case of
government bureacracy and former Rep. Shuler and I will strongly urge
they move forward and pay the money owed to Swain County. You can read
more about it in the Citizen Times
here .
Appearing on WCNC in

I sat down with WCNC's Dave Wagner on
Thursday evening to discuss a variety of issues.
Visiting Local Schools
During my time in
the district this week, I had the opportunity to visit four different
schools. It is always a pleasure to meet and speak with students as
well as the teachers and faculty who work tirelessly to give them the
best education possible. If you're a student, parent, or teacher
who would like me to come by your local school, don't hesitate to reach
out to my office and we will do our best to try to coordinate a
visit.
