April 25, 2015
Dear Friend,
Following the first 100 days of our new Congress, I wanted to
share with you some accomplishments and reaffirm my commitment to
working with my colleagues to build an opportunity economy based on your
priorities.
We have passed 62 bills, which is more than double the
25 passed in the first 100 days of the 113th Congress.
Of the 62
bills, eight were signed into law.
Since January, the House has:
Enacted the
first real entitlement reform in a generation by fixing Medicare's
broken physician reimbursement formula and increasing accountability for
health care providers;
Passed bills that provide new
mental health resources
for veteran suicide
prevention
and encourage the hiring of
veterans;
Stopped the Presidents proposed tax on college
savings;
Passed legislation that simplifies the tax code such as
the Death Tax Repeal Act, the Permanent State &amp; Local Tax
Deduction Act and the Americas Small Business Tax Relief
Act;
Sent a jobs bill to the President to
build
the Keystone Pipeline ;
Passed a
budget that balances in ten years and cuts $5.5 trillion in unnecessary
spending;
Enacted a package of reforms to stop human
trafficking; and
Passed bills to restore the 40-hour work
week for the middle class, expand liquefied natural gas exports, stop
IRS abuses and
much
more .
Over the next 100 days and
beyond, our Congressional agenda will continue to move forward
reflecting the priorities of American
families.
With my regards and best wishes, I remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
Member of
Congress
