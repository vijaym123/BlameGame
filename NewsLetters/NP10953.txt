Dear Friend,
Louisiana women make 67 cents to every dollar a man makes.
Think if the women in your family had a tax on their paycheck that took 33 percent of their total pay just because they're a woman.
On average, that's $1,300 a month or almost $16,000 a year. That could be a down payment on a home, or two years of tuition at LSU for her child, or two and a half years of groceries.
What would $1,300 extra a month mean to your family?

Our sisters, mothers and daughters in Louisiana and the country deserve our support, and the Senate should support the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Sadly, Louisiana ranks second-to-last in equal pay for women. Equal pay is not only about women; it's also about supporting and strengthening middle class families so they can build a prosperous future for themselves and their communities.
The Paycheck Fairness Act closes loopholes that allow employers to escape liability even when gender-based wage discrimination exists. It also includes protections for employees against retaliation for disclosing or discussing their salaries, as well as ensures employees have the same remedies for gender-based pay discrimination as other forms of discrimination such as race or national origin.
Tell me: What would $1,300 more a month mean to your family?
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
the office nearest you .
