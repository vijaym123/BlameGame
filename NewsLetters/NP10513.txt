Friend,
Sometimes I feel like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day: waking up every morning only to have the same conversations and to fight the same battles of the previous day.
If that movie was released today, they could call it Ryan Budget Day.
Because yet again, Paul Ryan and his extreme friends in Congress have introduced a budget that places an unfair burden on the shoulders of the middle class. Yet again, they want to gut Medicare as we know it and replace it with a voucher system. Yet again, this budget sells out the middle class and breaks the promises we made to our seniors.
I wish there was a punchline here, I really do. But there&#39;s not.
People all across the country are uniting to tell Paul Ryan and his friends that Groundhog Day is over and that we&#39;ve had enough of them selling out the middle class. Can you sign here and join us?
This is an important message -- and unlike Bill Murray, we only have today to make sure it&#39;s received.
Click here and sign now.
Thanks.
Be Well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
