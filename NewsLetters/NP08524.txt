Northeast Florida Congressional Update on Tap for Saturday, June 28
I encourage you to join me and Congressmen Ron DeSantis and Ted Yoho on
Saturday, June 28 for a Northeast Florida Congressional Update, at the
University of North Florida. It's a great opportunity for us to give
you a DC Update, and more importantly, to listen to and address your
questions and concerns on federal issues.
And, we'll have Cindy
Graves, host of The Cindy Graves Shows, on AM 600 WBOB radio in
Jacksonville on hand to moderate the event.
We can't do our jobs effectively without knowing what's on the minds of
the people who live in our districts. We'll discuss progress on
policies regarding the economy, jobs, national security, health care,
immigration, and more.
And, we look forward to answering questions and
bringing the feedback we receive directly to the debate on Capitol Hill.
Here are the details you need to know:
WHAT: Northeast Florida Congressional Update with Representatives Ander
Crenshaw, Ron DeSantis, and Ted Yoho.
WHERE: University of North Florida's Adam Hebert University Center on
the campus of the University of North Florida.
WHEN: 10 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
BACKGROUND: The event, which is free and open to the public, will
include a panel discussion on top federal issues of the day and is
being hosted by the University of North Florida. Members of the public
will have the opportunity to submit questions that will be answered by
the Congressmen following the panel discussion. Any questions remaining
at the end of the event will be answered by formal correspondence.
IRS Must Come Clean; Restore Trust With the American Taxpayer
Lost e-mails, targeting taxpayers based on political belief, lavish
conferences and video productions, agency employees not paying their
own taxes - not exactly a record for inspiring trust. But, that's the
picture the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has painted for our nation
with its actions.
As head of the Congressional Subcommittee responsible for funding this
agency, I consider it my duty to hold it accountable however possible.
Right now, that means cutting IRS funding until it can restore trust
with the hard-working, law-abiding Americans who send their own tax
dollars to Washington.
On Wednesday, the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG)
Appropriations Subcommittee did just that. We cut IRS funding by $341
million to its lowest levels since 2008. Additionally, our bill
prohibits the agency from using funds to implement ObamaCare and
prohibits funds from being used to target groups based on taxpayer
belief.
We've sent our bill on to the full Appropriations Committee for
consideration later this month. In the meantime, I'll be encouraging
all my colleagues to support it 100% just like I do.
Addressing my colleagues at the Financial Services and General
Government Appropriations on Wednesday.
A Vote for National Security; A Vote for Supporting Our Men and Women
in Uniform
Plain and simple: We live in dangerous times, and now is not the time
to cut back our military. My bottom line is to make sure our men and
women in uniform have what they need to get the job done wherever they
serve, whenever they serve.
That's why I helped write and voted Thursday for passage of the Fiscal
Year 2015 Defense Appropriations Bill - legislation that supports a
strong military and defense industrial base on the First Coast and
around the globe. By raising military pay above the President's
request, the comprehensive bill also makes sure that our military and
their families receive the benefits they have earned and deserve.
I outlined the need the legislation in a speech on the floor of the
United States House of Representatives on Wednesday afternoon.
The
House passed the Defense legislation late Thursday night, sending it on
to the United States Senate where it deserves immediate passage.

IRS
Must
Come
Clean;
Restore
Trust With

Lost

taxpayers
based
on
political
belief,
lavish
conferences
and
video
productions,
agency
employees
not
paying
their
own
taxes
&#8211;
not
exactly
a
record
for
inspiring
trust.
But,
that&#8217;s
the
picture
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
has
painted
for
our
nation
with
its
actions.
As
head
of
the
Congressional
Subcommittee
responsible
for
funding
this
agency,
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
hold
it
accountable
however
possible.
Right
now,
that
means
cutting
IRS
funding
until
it
can
restore
trust
with
the
hard-working,
law-abiding
Americans
who
send
their
own
tax
dollars
to
Washington.
On
Wednesday,
the
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
(FSGG)
Appropriations
Subcommittee
did
just
that.
We
cut
IRS
funding
by
$341
million
to
its
lowest
levels
since
2008.
Additionally,
our
bill
prohibits
the
agency
from
using
funds
to
implement
ObamaCare
and
prohibits
funds
from
being
used
to
target
groups
based
on
taxpayer
belief.
We&#8217;ve
sent
our
bill
on
to
the
full
Appropriations
Committee
for
consideration
later
this
month.
In
the
meantime,
I&#8217;ll
be
encouraging
all
my
colleagues
to
support
it
100%
just
like
I
do.
Addressing
my
colleagues
at

and
General
Government
Appropriations
on
Wednesday.
A
Vote
for
National
Security;
A
Vote
for
Supporting
Our
Men
and
Women
in
Uniform
Plain
and
simple:
We
live
in
dangerous
times,
and
now
is
not
the
time
to
cut
back
our
military.
My
bottom
line
is
to
make
sure
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
what
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
wherever
they
serve,
whenever
they
serve.
That&#8217;s
why
I
helped
write
and
voted
Thursday
for
passage
of
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
Defense
Appropriations
Bill
&#8211;
legislation
that
supports
a
strong
military
and
defense
industrial
base
on
the
First
Coast
and
around
the
globe.
By
raising
military
pay
above
the
President&#8217;s
request,
the
comprehensive
bill
also
makes
sure
that
our
military
and
their
families
receive
the
benefits
they
have
earned
and
deserve.
I
outlined
the
need
the
legislation
in
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives
on
Wednesday
afternoon.
The
House
passed
the
Defense
legislation
late
Thursday
night,
sending
it
on
to
the
United
States
Senate
where
it
deserves
immediate
passage.
