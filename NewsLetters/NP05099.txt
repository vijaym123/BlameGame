Rep. Cuellar Protects Farmers and Ranchers from Economic Losses of Fever Tick Outbreak
Dear Friends,
Constituents living in my district have raised their concern about the deadly fever tick disease particular to South Texas that affects cattle.
That is why
I took action to protect
South Texas farmers and ranchers from economic losses due to a fever tick outbreak.
I was successful in including language in the Farm Bill giving ranchers the ability to receive some compensation for the losses incurred due to this vicious pest.
For more information on the legislation and the language I included,
please read my full press release here.
Resources for South Texans:
A recent outbreak of fever ticks in Cameron County has resulted in the establishment of a Temporary Preventative Quarantine Area to stop the further spread of the tick in South Texas, effective October 7 th , 2014.
If you believe that you have ticks either on your property or on your livestock, please call the Texas Farm Service Agency at 979-680-5151 or
visit their website here .
