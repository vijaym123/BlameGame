Dear Friend,
Thanks to
new data from The Department of Health and Human Services that reflects
competition in the new online Marketplaces has ensured that 6 in 10
Americans will have access to health plans at a cost of $100 or less per
month. This number would increase to 8 in 10 Americans if all states
fully implemented the Affordable Care Act. Currently only 26 states,
including New York, have made the important choice to expand Medicaid
which allows more middle-class working families to gain quality
coverage from the new healthcare law.
Opponents to this law have been
eager to point out the challenges consumers are facing enrolling
through Healthcare.gov, yet they are not doing their part to ensure that
Americans are given the chance to gain health insurance in their
state.
If you have not done so, please
visit

or call 1(855)355-5777 to get affordable, quality health insurance
today.
