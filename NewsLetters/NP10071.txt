Dear Friends,
I am appreciative of the prompt approval of Governor Phil Bryants
request for a federal disaster declaration for seven Mississippi
counties impacted by the storms.
Counties eligible to receive federal
disaster assistance in the First District include: Itawamba, Lee,
Lowndes, Wayne, and Winston Counties.
As rebuilding efforts begin,
my team and I
are
ready to help individuals, families, and businesses navigate the
process of working with the various federal agencies involved.
From
navigating agency websites, filing claims paperwork, and everything in
between,
my team and I
are here for
you.
To better support rebuilding efforts,
I am in the process of setting up a part-time office in Webster
County.
As soon as office location and hours are available, I will be
sure to update you.
My
thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families who lost loved ones,
those who were injured, and those who lost their homes and businesses to
the devastating storms last week.
Military Academy
Appointments
In the face of difficulty Mississippians
have shown an outpouring of generosity and support for one
another.
We have also shown grace as we balance dealing with devastation and
beginning to return to normal daily
life.
On Thursday and Friday of last week, my staff and I had the
opportunity to present three First District High School seniors with
military academy appointments.
Mitchell Embrey a senior at
Desoto Central High School received an appointment to the U.S. Air Force
Academy.
Evan Robins a senior at Desoto Central High School
received an appointment to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
Tupelo
High School seniors Chandler Craig and Grant Thornton both received
appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy.
The academy appointment process is extremely competitive and each
of these young men is deserving of the honor.
I wish these
young men all the best, and I have no doubt that they will make
Mississippi proud as they serve our nation.
Please stay tuned for announcements of additional academy
appointments as well as information on
Academy Day
2015 .
Stay in touch and God
bless,
Tell a Friend
