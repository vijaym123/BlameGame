Special Report

Aloha friends,
Last week, following President Obama's announcement that he plans to send up to 300 military advisers to Iraq to help train Iraqi security forces and the potential for targeted military action, Colleen appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss her amendment to the Defense Authorizations Act that would prevent the President from circumventing the War Powers Resolution to unilaterally commit U.S. forces to combat operations in Iraq.
The amendment passed the House unopposed.
Excerpt from the interview:
"What we are doing now is we are intervening into a sectarian civil war," said Hanabusa. "And the question, I believe, that most of us have is: Why and how does that link to national interest? What is our national security interest in this? And in addition to that, will this be construed as taking the side of one of the three sectarian-related groups in Iraq? And will that then exacerbate the situation? And how are we, then, getting out of it?
"But the real question that we've always had, from the time we intervened the first time into Iraq and went in under the guise of we knew that there were weapons of mass destruction--which then turned to be false--is: What is the endgame? What is it that we intend to achieve? What is it that we want? Or how do we leave a situation like that? But I think, more importantly, the American people want to know why."
