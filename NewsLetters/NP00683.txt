Mental Health First Aid
Briefing:
This week, as part of Mental Health Awareness Month,
I hosted a briefing about what Mental Health First
Aid
does to help folks in Kansas and around the
country.
Mental Health First Aid training is an early-detection training program
that is critical to removing the stigma of mental health treatment and
helping those that are struggling from mental illness. I was honored
to
introduce the Mental Health First Aid Act
along with Congresswoman Doris Matsui in April.
Eastern Kansas
has been a leader in mental health issues for years with great
institutions like the Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center in
Lawrence, the Clinical Child Psychology Program at the University
of Kansas, and the Family Service and Guidance Center in
Topeka.
It is vital we share these important educational tools with
Members of Congress and their staff so we continue to raise awareness for
Mental Health First Aid.
Working to Resolve Colmery-ONeil Staffing
Issues:
In August of 2013I first raised serious concerns
about the apparent staffing problems at the Colmery-ONeil VA Medical
Center in Topeka with then-VA Secretary Erik Shinseki. The departure
of three doctors led to the closing of the emergency room, and after
nearly two years, the situation remains unresolved and the emergency
room is still closed.
After numerous calls,
letters, and meetings with the VA , we have received news that the
emergency room should be reopening soon. Next week, Senator Jerry
Moran and I will be visiting Colmery-ONeil to meet with director
Rudy Klopfer and get an update on the situation. Our veterans deserve
the best care possible, and I will continue to work to ensure this
service is once again available to them.

Working To End Human
Trafficking:
Human trafficking is a growing epidemic around the world that
happens right here in America, including an arrest in Lawrence that
took place just a few weeks ago.
Im pleased
Congress acted this week to bring the victims of human trafficking
out of the shadows , and enable us to better secure justice for its
victims. This bill was a strong step towards providing better care for
the victims of human trafficking and ending the unspeakable practice
of trafficking once and for all.
Encouraging
Innovation Across America:
Not only does America have the
highest corporate tax rate in the world, its also one of the few
countries that allow various provisions of our tax code, like research and
development, to expire on a regular basis.
Congress has
gotten into a self-defeating habit of continually extending tax
provisions on a short-term, temporary and even worse on a retroactive basis. As
a CPA, Ive worked with businesses that are small and large and I
know this is no way to write tax policy. These businesses dont have a
crystal ball and simply cant plan because the uncertainty in Washington
is holding them back.
This week the House voted to
make the research and development tax credit permanent. R&amp;D is
important to American innovation and providing some permanency will give
businesses the stability needed to invest in the United States
economy creating good paying jobs, fostering a healthy bottom up economy,
and increasing wages for hardworking Americans.
I spoke at
the Republican Leadership Press Conference this week about how making
tax credits permanent means businesses can plan ahead to get ahead and
provide a much needed boost to the economy.

House Hunger Caucus Hosts
The Gates Foundation:
As the co-chair of the House
Hunger Caucus, is was an honor to host Melinda Gates from the Gates
Foundation for a powerful discussion about their work to fight hunger
here in America and around the world.
Participating in National Foster Care
Month:
This week, the Congressional Caucus on
Foster Youth helped members host former foster youths from their district
for a day in their office. I had a great time having Billie Boeck
shadow me and it was incredible to hear her story. She is definitely an
amazing person and I wish her the best of the luck for her
future!
Upcoming Coffees with Your Congresswoman:
Next
week, I will be hosting several Coffees with your Congresswoman all over
Eastern Kansas. I hope you can drop by, have a cup of coffee, and
speak with me directly about the issues most important to you. Listening
to Kansans is my top priority and I look forward to hearing your ideas
and bringing them back to Washington.
