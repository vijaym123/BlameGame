Decision to Retire from
Congress
On April 14, I formally announced that I will not
seek to represent the 6th District in Congress for another term.
This is a decision I reached after serious thought and consideration
with my family and others, and there is no one issue that led me to
this decision.
It was a combination of several factors.
Id like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow citizens for
entrusting me with the responsibility of representing them for the last 35
years.
It has been a great honor.
I offer my b est wishes to
whoever is elected to represent us in the next Congress.
He or she
will have the opportunity to turn the great prospects before our
country into concrete reality.
I appreciate all the warm wishes and
kind words from everyone over the past two weeks,
and
I look forward
to continuing to serve the people of the 6th District for the
remainder of this
year.
Town Meeting Wrap
Up
I recently finished another round of town meetings
throughout the Sixth District with stops in each of the counties in the
district.
There are still many important issues facing our country
that Congress will consider throughout the rest of the year, and it was
great to hear from constituents on them.
Here are a few of the
issues that came up for
discussion:
Obamacare :
Open
enrollment for individuals ended on March 31 at midnight with over 8 million
people enrolled in new Obamacare plans.
But as they say, the
devil is in the details.
According to research conducted by the
RAND Corporation and McKinsey Group, only one-quarter to one-third of
sign-ups were from the previously uninsured.
Most of the new
enrollees already had insurance before Obamacare and may have lost their
employer coverage, or they may have been pushed off successful Wisconsin
programs, such as Badgercare or Wisconsins high-risk pool
(HIRSP).
In fact, Wisconsin was already a nationwide leader in providing
health insurance with over 90 percent of residents covered.
One of
the biggest issues with Obamacare is the national market disruption
the law has caused in the insurance market when states like Wisconsin
were already making reforms to extend health
coverage.
Executive
Overreach :
The Constitution created three equal branches of
government, and Congress is solely responsible for making the laws while
the President executes them.
No Presidentregardless of
partyshould be able to bypass Congress or selectively enforce the laws.
Unfortunately, time and time again we are seeing this Administration
pick and choose which laws, or parts of laws, it will enforce.
On
March 12, the House passed H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE Act, so the House
or Senate can utilize the third branch of governmentthe Judicial
Branchto bring a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for failing to
execute the laws.
The following day, the House took up another bill,
H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act, to hold government
officials accountable for enforcing the laws passed by Congress.
I voted for both of these
bills.
Bipartisanship :
Many
comment on the increasing partisanship in Washington.
Over the
years, power has shifted from the committee chairs to the leadership in
both parties -- i.e. the Speaker, Majority/Minority Leaders, Whips, etc.
With this power shift, legislation has become more and more
politicized and therefore more and more polarizing in recent years.
But that's not to say Congress is in total gridlock.
For
instance, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on which I serve,
has been successful in passing bipartisan legislation and working
together on a long-term surface transportation bill that should be voted
on later this year.
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) successfully crafted a
bipartisan Budget Resolution with Senator Patty Murray last December,
and the Farm Bill passed with bipartisan support in both chambers
earlier this year.
Progress is also being made on my bipartisan bill
-- the ExCEL Act -- which could be included in the Higher Education
Act reauthorization later this year.
A New Bill and
a Vision for Student Loan
Reform
Students deserve more than the complicated student loan system we have
now.
Far too many students default after college (the figure is
now almost 15% of students who default within three years), and far too
many students get lost in the bureaucracy of paying for their college
education.
I have already introduced bipartisan legislation to
ensure all students have affordable payments after college by
automatically linking payments to individual earnings.
Recently, on
April 9, I introduced new legislation with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to
give students access to a new way to pay for college.
Income-share agreements (ISAs) are a new, innovative
way to finance higher education where a private
investor pays for
a student's education and the student agrees to pay a certain
percentage of his/her income for a set period of time after graduation.
Some will pay more, but some will pay less than the cost of their
education, but no student would have a fixed balance to repay.
Several for-profit and non-profit organizations are already beginning to
offer these plans to students, but need the legal clarity to be able to
expand.
Our bill provides the legal framework needed.

vision for how to reform our higher education system to benefit
students and taxpayers.
Visit to Wautoma
School District
In between town meetings, I visited the Wautoma School
District, including Redgranite Elementary School and Wautoma High
School.
Students at Redgranite Elementary School sent me Flat
Stanley to see Washington and accompany me on my travels throughout the
Sixth District.
I stopped by the school on April 22 to share photos
and experiences with Flat Stanley and answer their questions about
government.
I also visited Wautoma High School to see the great
things they are doing with federal grant money to improve wellness and
fitness.

A War on Brats?
The
European Union (EU) is continuing its push to restrict the use of
geographic names in certain foods.
Already, champagne can only come
from Champagne, France.
But now, there is growing concern that EU
efforts could bring more name restrictions, including on products such
as kielbasa and Wisconsins own bratwurst.
Lets be clear on this Sheboygan is the Bratwurst Capital of the World , as declared by
Judge John Bolgert in 1970.
On April 10,
I took
to the House floor to speak out
against these provisions being
included in any trade agreement moving forward and to encourage my
colleagues to sign a letter I am circulating to send to the USDA and the
U.S. Trade Representative.
