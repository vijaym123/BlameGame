Friend,
As my first year in Congress comes to a close, I want to take a moment to say what an honor it has been to serve the people of Sacramento County and to have your ongoing support.
It has been a challenging year, but even with the gridlock in Washington, we&#39;ve been able to make some progress.
One of my first acts as a Member of Congress was to co-sponsor legislation that addresses one of the core issues of our campaign, the No Budget No Pay Act, which says if members of Congress don&#39;t do their jobs and pass a responsible budget, they won&#39;t get paid. A version of that legislation was signed into law earlier this year.
Congress also took a promising step in the right direction last week, passing a bipartisan budget on the last day of session. While not perfect, the budget deal will give Americans some stability over the coming months and keep Congress from legislating from one fiscal crisis to another.
Now, as we look to the year ahead, we must rededicate ourselves to moving our country forward.
We need to help families that are struggling to get back on their feet and give them a shot at the American Dream. We need to invest in our infrastructure and rebuild an economy that works for the middle class. And we need to honor the promises we&rsquo;ve made to our parents and grandparents and secure Medicare and Social Security for the next generation.
We must continue the fight together.
Thank you from Janine, Syd and me, for all you&#39;ve done to help us in 2013.
We wish you a safe and prosperous holiday season!
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&rsquo;s 7th District
