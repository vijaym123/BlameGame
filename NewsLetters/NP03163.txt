WASHINGTON DC
U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) has renewed his fight to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a proposal to allow consumers to shop for insurance across state lines.
Harper co-sponsored H.R. 543, the
Health Care Choice Act of 2015 , which was introduced by Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) yesterday.
The American consumer can make better choices for their health care than Washington bureaucrats, Harper said. The Health Care Choice Act empowers consumers by giving them the ability to purchase affordable health insurance coverage with a range of options and replaces Washington mandates with interstate competition.
Instead of requiring every health plan to carry burdensome directives that make insurance unaffordable, the Health Care Choice Act frees insurance companies to compete for your business across state lines: online, by mail, over the phone, or in consultation with an insurance agent in your hometown.
Original cosponsors of the Health Care Choice Act of 2015 include: Rep. Gregg Harper (MS-03); Rep. Diane Black (TN-06); Rep. Charles Boustany (LA-03); Rep. Scott DesJarlais(TN-04); Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (TN-03); Rep. Chris Gibson (NY-19); Rep. Brett Guthrie (KY-02); Adam Kinzinger (IL-16); Rep. Leonard Lance (NJ-07); Rep. Billy Long (MO-07); Rep. Mia Love (UT-04); Rep. Tom McClintock (CA-04); Rep. Pete Olson (TX-22); and Rep. Phil Roe (TN-01).
