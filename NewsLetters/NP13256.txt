Friend,
I knew I could count on you.
With your help, we exceeded our end of year deadline - and now, thanks to you, we&#39;ll be able to start the new year off strong.
Our work is far from over - in fact, it&#39;s just beginning.
This year, we have much work to do, from passing comprehensive immigration reform to securing Social Security and Medicare for the next generation.
And with your support, I know that we&#39;re going to accomplish amazing things in 2014.
To put it simply, I wouldn&#39;t be here without you. Thank you for all you&#39;ve done, and for all you continue to do.
Here&#39;s to 2014!
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
