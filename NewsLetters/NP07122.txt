Rep. Miller: Airstrikes Needed to Protect U.S. Personnel and Christian Refugees in Iraq
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10),
Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,
issued the following statement on the President&#8217;s announcement to provide humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians,
authorize targeted airstrikes against ISIS and provide military aid to Kurdish forces helping Christian refugees in Iraq:
&#8220;Christian communities in Iraq are suffering a near genocide at the hands of the Islamic extremist group ISIS. Thousands unwilling to convert to Islam and pay religious taxes have been forced to flee their homes.
Many have been brutally
slaughtered. It is barbaric, and thus far, only the Kurds have stepped up to help the Christian refugees facing certain death.
&#8220;Here in southeast Michigan, we have a large population of Chaldeans, Iraqi Christians who fled Iraq because of religious persecution, and we share their horror over what is happening to the Christians in Iraq under the guise of religion.
&#8220;I commend the Kurds for their action, and support the decision to provide them with military aid and deliver limited, targeted airstrikes against the extremist organization.
We must stop the immediate advancement of these violent Islamist
militants to protect U.S. personnel and Christian refugees. I also want to express my gratitude to the brave men and women with the U.S. forces that are embarking on this dangerous and noble mission.&#8221;
