Stopping
Amnesty
On Friday, I
helped pass legislation
in
the House to stop the increasing number of illegal immigrants from
entering the United States.
The bill limits the
President's power to provide executive amnesty and secures the border with
National Guard and Border Patrol police.
Helping Veterans
I was proud to
help pass the
Veterans Access to Care through Choice,
Accountability and Transparency Act .
This legislation
authorizes clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles and will allow many
veterans to receive treatment through a private healthcare provider if the VA
cannot meet their needs in a timely fashion.
The bill also
includes legislation I introduced to extend the
VAs Traumatic Brain Injury program .
I will continue to push
for quality reforms and patient-centered
solutions.
Protecting Your Healthcare
Finally, the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed my
bill, the
Employee Health Care Protection Act .
This would provide relief to American workers and
ensure that the American people can keep the health care plans they
like.
