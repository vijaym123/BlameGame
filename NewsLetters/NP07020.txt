David --
Social Security was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14th, 1935 -- and it&rsquo;s been providing millions of Americans with economic security ever since.
But Tea Party politicians in Washington have repeatedly tried to end the guaranteed benefits of Social Security with privatization.
The truth is: Social Security works. It needs to be preserved so that we can ensure that all Americans receive the retirement benefits they've earned.
This Thursday is the 79th anniversary of Social Security. Let&rsquo;s get 100,000 strong supporting Social Security, and opposing Republican attempts to privatize it: http://dccc.org/Support-Social-Security
