Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I enjoyed meeting with people across the Sixth District this past week.
At each stop, I heard about issues facing Kentucky families today, and
I appreciate folks taking the time to come out and share their concerns
with me.
This week is another example to me of how representing Kentuckians is
the honor of a lifetime and I continue to be humbled by the opportunity
to serve you. Thank you.

Protecting Life
This week, thousands gathered in Washington for the annual 'March for
Life.' As a strongly pro-life father of two young girls, I consider
protecting the unborn and the most vulnerable among us as one of my
greatest responsibilities as a parent and legislator.
I have already taken a number of actions while in Congress to protect
life, and I will continue to work hard to advance legislation and
initiatives that protect the lives of the unborn and their mothers.

Signature Industry Spotlight: Sixth District Equine Coalition
On Tuesday, I hosted leaders from the equine industry for a meeting of
my Sixth District Equine Coalition. During our meeting, we discussed
federal legislation impacting the equine industry, the state of the
industry, and set the agenda for the Congressional Horse Caucus, of
which I am a Co-Chairman.
We also discussed two bills I have introduced during the 113th
Congress, H.R. 2212, the Race Horse Cost Recovery Act
, and H.R. 998, the Equine Tax Parity Act
, both of which would promote growth in our equine industry
and provide relief from the unintended consequences of outdated tax
provisions.
It was very beneficial to hear from constituents that work in or
support our equine industry, and they had lots of great ideas which I
am excited to share with my Congressional colleagues.
Honoring Dr. King's Legacy
On Monday, I was glad to attend the Martin Luther King Jr. Unity
Breakfast in Lexington to commemorate the life and work of Dr. King and
honor his commitment to making the American dream available to all
Americans. Dr. King taught us that we all have the power to make our
nation better, and his vision continues to provide a powerful symbol of
a life based on the values of love, compassion and justice.
Around the District
This week, as part of my ongoing Accessibility Initiative, I held
several Meet Your Congressman events and business roundtables across
the district.
At the Fleming County and Mt. Sterling business roundtables, I heard
from small business owners regarding the challenges they face, and
discussed solutions aimed at fostering job creation and easing the
burden carried by Kentucky's business owners.
Thanks to Tracks Restaurant in Carlisle and Biancke's Restaurant in
Cynthiana for hosting my Meet the Congressman lunches! As always, it
was great to see everyone and hear what they had to say about important
issues like Obamacare, the Farm Bill, immigration and other issues
facing Kentuckians and our nation.
In the current economic environment, my focus remains on the crucial
goal of job creation for Kentuckians. I welcome the opportunity to
continue my ongoing conversation with business people and help them to
create more jobs here in Kentucky.

Fleming County Residents."
Although temperatures hovered close to zero degrees outside on the
night of the Jessamine Chamber Annual Awards Banquet, it did not stop
the warmth, friendship and celebration that was shared by attendees
inside. The banquet was hosted in the RJ Corman Hanger, which
commemorates Rick Corman and his life's work that helped make our
community and nation the greatest in the world.
I enjoyed being part of a special night which centered around honoring
the men and women who are responsible for the economic success of
Jessamine County.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

Around
the
District
This
week,
as
part
of
my
ongoing
Accessibility
Initiative,
I
held
several
Meet
Your
Congressman
events
and
business
roundtables
across
the
district.
At
the
Fleming
County
and
Mt.
Sterling
business
roundtables,
I
heard
from
small
business
owners
regarding
the
challenges
they
face,
and
discussed
solutions
aimed
at
fostering
job
creation
and
easing
the
burden
carried
by
Kentucky&#8217;s
business
owners.
Thanks
to
Tracks
Restaurant
in
Carlisle
and
Biancke&#8217;s
Restaurant
in
Cynthiana
for
hosting
my
Meet
the
Congressman
lunches!
As
always,
it
was
great
to
see
everyone
and
hear
what
they
had
to
say
about
important
issues
like
Obamacare,
the
Farm
Bill,
immigration
and
other
issues
facing
Kentuckians
and
our
nation.
In
the
current
economic
environment,
my
focus
remains
on
the
crucial
goal
of
job
creation
for
Kentuckians.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
continue
my
ongoing
conversation
with
business
people
and
help
them
to
create
more
jobs
here
in
Kentucky.
