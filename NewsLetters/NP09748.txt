Protecting Taxpayers from IRS Targeting
Last week, I joined Senator Ted Cruz to introduce legislation that
would amend the tax code so that the IRS no longer creates its own
definitions to determine whether an organization is engaging in
political activity.
H.R. 4593
and S.2067
address a proposed
rule by the IRS that would redefine public service activities by civic
organizations as political campaign intervention. Nonpartisan groups
would lose their tax-exempt status if they engaged in educational
activities like hosting candidate debates. However, the IRS would allow
those activities for unions and non-profit charities.
This new
definition violates our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.
Our bills would provide clear rules based on guidance from the
bipartisan, independent Federal Election Commission (FEC).
The FEC has been providing straight-forward guidance on political
activity for years.
Relying on their definitions is common sense, and
it removes the IRS and the potential for political targeting from the
process. Senator Cruz and I agree that we must do everything in our
power to prevent the IRS from trampling on our First Amendment rights.
We'll keep up this fight on your behalf.
Getting Answers on the Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi
It has been nearly two years since four Americans were killed in a
terrorist attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, but we're
still waiting for answers about what happened and why.
This week, I
voted to establish a Select Committee
to
investigate the attacks and cut through the political spin the
Administration created in the immediate aftermath.
I'm hoping this can be a bipartisan investigation-this shouldn't be
about politics, it should be about accountability and national
security.
To better protect Americans currently serving overseas, we
need to know exactly what went wrong in Benghazi and how we can improve
on that failure.
I hope the Select Committee can provide answers to
some of the following unresolved questions:
If the State Department had responded to early earnings about
security risks in Libya, could the attacks have been prevented? What
can we do to ensure warnings like these are heeded in the future?
Should the military have attempted a rescue once the attacks
begin?
Would that have saved lives?
And finally, why did the White House downplay the attacks,
calling them a reaction to an inflammatory video?
Was it ignorance, an
intelligence failure, or was it a deliberate action because of the
upcoming elections?
I'll keep you posted on this investigation and my work to protect
American serving our country abroad.
This Week in West Texas
It'll be a busy week travelling around Texas' 19th District, but I'm
looking forward to recognizing some exceptional feats by West Texans.
I'm excited to congratulate Lt. Col. Jose E. Sumangil at his Bronze
Star Ceremony, and to award two young Cadet 1st Lieutenants of the
Lubbock Civic Air Patrol with the General Billy Mitchell Award
I'm always impressed by the dedication and sacrifice of our nation's
servicemembers, and I'm honored to take part in these ceremonies. To
celebrate all kinds of service, I'll be attending the Volunteer Center
of Lubbock
's Celebration of Service Luncheon.
And then to kick
off National Small Business Week
, I'll be touring both Lubbock UPS and Shearer's Foods
plants.
I look forward to discussing the local economy with the staff
there, and to learn from their hands-on experience how best to promote
job creation.
After all, small businesses create two out of every
three new American jobs each year.

Getting
Answers
on
the
Terrorist
Attacks
in
Benghazi
It
has
been
nearly
two
years
since
four
Americans
were
killed
in
a
terrorist
attack
on
the
American
Embassy
in
Benghazi,
Libya,
but
we&#8217;re
still
waiting
for
answers
about
what
happened
and
why.
This
week,
I
voted
to
establish
a
Select
Committee
to
investigate
the
attacks
and
cut
through
the
political
spin
the
Administration
created
in
the
immediate

currently
serving
overseas,
we
need
to
know
exactly
what
went
wrong
in
Benghazi
and
how
we
can

that
failure.
I
hope

answers

some
of
the
following
unresolved

&#183;
If
the
State

could
the

&#183;
Should
the
military
have
attempted

Would
that
have
saved
lives?
&#183;
And
finally,
why
did
the
White
House
downplay
the
attacks,
calling
them
a
reaction
to
an
inflammatory
video?
Was
it
ignorance,
an
intelligence

or
was
it

I&#8217;ll
