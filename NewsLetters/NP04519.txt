Friends,
We just received word from the Registrar of Voters, and we have good news.
As we expected, we closed the gap even further, gaining more than 1,600 votes.
That means, with more than tens of thousands of ballots countywide left to be counted, we are currently down by 530 votes.
Make no mistake - we are gaining ground, and quickly. The momentum is on our side, and we must be prepared for what comes next.
In order to keep this process going and keep our legal team on the ground with the resources necessary to ensure a fair process, we need your help.
Please click below and give what you can, right now.
