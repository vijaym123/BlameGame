District
This week, the House took action to ensure
that President Obama does not ignore his Constitutional duties and
abuse his power.
I joined a majority of my colleagues in voting for
H.R. 4138, the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect
Congressional Enactments of the Law
(ENFORCE the Law) Act .
This bill would grant the House or Senate the authority to file a
lawsuit against the executive branch for failure to faithfully execute the
laws.
I am a cosponsor of this bill.
The
president has a constitutional duty to enforce all of Americas laws,
not pick and choose which ones he wants to enforce.
Unfortunately, President Obama has waged a deliberate campaign to expand executive
power at the expense of Congress
a campaign that threatens the rule
of law and jeopardizes our most basic liberties. Those of us in
Congress have an obligation to respond to the presidents abuse of power and
reverse it.
This is not a partisan issue.
All Americans
regardless of party
want to see our constitutional
order protected.
If the bill we approved this week is signed
into law, it will give Congress a new tool to restore the constitutional
balance of power.
Of course, if the president would show more
respect for the Constitution, this legislation would not be
necessary.
Examples of the presidents failure to enforce
the law include delaying the Obamacare employer mandate; the virtual
enactment of most of the Dream Act; and granting welfare work requirement
waivers in violation of the 1996 welfare reform law.
The
Constitution does not delegate legislative authority to the President to
rewrite, amend, or delay duly-enacted Constitutional laws.
Only
Congress can do that.
I attended a House Judiciary
Committee on Feb. 26, about Enforcing the Presidents Constitutional
Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws
At the hearing,
constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley said President Obamas executive
overreach has brought us to a constitutional tipping point that needs to
be addressed.
I agree and the
ENFORCE the Law Act
will
help us do that.
We must continue to bring attention to
the p residents failure to enforce the law and
fulfill his Constitutional duties.
This is an issue that all
Americans can unite behind, and I will continue to be a leader in this
effort.
