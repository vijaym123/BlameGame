An Invitation from Congressman Roe
Dear Friend,
As you may know, taking care of veterans has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress. I have served on the Veterans Affairs Committee since 2009 and have been heavily involved in the investigation into the secret waitlists in Phoenix. Just last week, I was chosen to serve on the conference committee tasked with reconciling the differences between the House and Senate veterans health care bills.
I want to keep East Tennesseans informed throughout every step of this process, and would like to let you know that my door is always open to veterans or other constituents who have concerns. On
Tuesday, July 1st
I am holding a town hall meeting for veterans in the First District at
6 p.m.
The meeting will be held at the
George Jaynes Justice Center in Jonesborough in Courtroom #7.
This event is free to attend and no tickets are needed. I hope you can join me for this important meeting.
What:
Congressman Roe Veterans Town Hall Meeting
When:
Tuesday, July 1st at 6:00 p.m.
Where:
The George Jaynes Justice Center in Jonesborough
Courtroom #7
Please do not hesitate to contact any of my offices if you have questions about this meeting. My contact information can be found below or by visiting

Thank you,
Phil
