Dear Fellow Nevadan,
On Memorial Day, we reflect and pay
tribute to the sacrifices of the brave men and women of Americas
armed services and the thousands of Gold Star families throughout the
country. These brave individuals are called upon to serve America in
distant lands, apart from family and friends, and some make the ultimate
sacrifice in order to protect and defend us.
These brave men
and women deserve nothing but the best from their government. Thats
why, under the leadership of Chairman Bernie Sanders of Vermont,
Democrats in the Senate have worked hard to pass legislation that expands
health care and job training for our veterans.
Our
responsibility to our nations veterans doesnt stop when they arrive safely
back on our shores. In Nevada, Im pleased to see the progress we have
made to reduce the backlog for veterans as they receive the health care
and services they need and receive the benefits they are aptly
entitled to. However, recent events at the VA show that much still needs to
be done. Senate Democrats will not waver in their commitment to our
nations heroes.
As always, I remain committed to ensuring
that our nations heroes have the training and resources to complete
their mission while serving and the support they need and have earned
when they return home. I wish everyone a meaningful and reflective
Memorial Day.
