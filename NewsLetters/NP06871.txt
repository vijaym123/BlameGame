Promoting
Policies to Allow our Family Farms to
Prosper
Dear Friend,
This past week on our Route 15
Agriculture Tour, I traveled across the
Fifth District making over 30 stops in
Madison, Rappahannock, Fauquier, Albemarle,
Fluvanna, Cumberland, Buckingham, Prince
Edward, Appomattox, Pittsylvania,
Charlotte, Mecklenburg, and Danville. I met
with farmers and members of the agriculture
community at dairy farms, tobacco farms,
cattle farms, cattle auctions, orchards,
vineyards, rural country stores, greenhouse
operations, and farming equipment
distributors.
Agriculture is the backbone of our
economy in Virginia, with an annual
economic impact of $52 billion, and it is
vital that we advance policies that
support, not impede, our family farmers.
Last weeks Agriculture Tour was an
important opportunity to listen to Fifth
District Virginians about their concerns
and hear exactly how the policies coming
out of Washington are affecting their
farming operations and businesses.
When I visited a cattle farm in
Appomattox, I spoke with the farmer about
the rising cost of fuel, which is among his
largest expenses as it powers the tractors
and vehicles that allow him to transport
hay and cattle. At a vineyard in Fauquier,
I heard about their health insurance
premiums rising 70 percent. I talked with
the owner of another vineyard in
Pittsylvania County about how his family
has transitioned from growing tobacco to
grapes. In each of these instances, the
federal government's policies are making it
more difficult for these family farms to
succeed.
Preserving and fostering our great
legacy of family farming in Virginia is one
of my top priorities, and as I met with
farmers across the district this past week,
it remains clear that the federal
government is often out of touch with the
needs of our family farmers and
agribusinesses.
Agricultural producers are substantially
impacted by the tax, energy, and regulatory
policies coming out of Washington. Since I
took office, I have worked to promote
policies that make it easier for our family
farms to succeed.
I
introduced
a bipartisan bill,
the
Preserving Rural Resources Act , to ease
regulatory burdens on how farmers use their
land for normal agricultural activities and
co-sponsored legislation to reform our
convoluted tax code with one that is fairer
and simpler for all Americans. I have also
co-sponsored several bills to maximize our
domestic energy supply to help bring down
the cost of fuel, reduce our dependence on
foreign supplies of oil, and create jobs in
Virginia.
Increasing our energy independence,
reforming our tax code, and reducing
unnecessary government regulations that
burden family farms in the Fifth District
will enable agriculture to continue
thriving in Central and Southside Virginia.
I appreciated the opportunity to meet with
so many hardworking Fifth District
Virginians during our district work weeks,
and I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues to put forth policies
that support our robust agriculture
industry.
