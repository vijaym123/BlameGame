Memorial Day 2014
5/26/14
On Memorial Day 2014, Congressman Doug Lamborn has released the
following statement.
" On this Memorial Day 2014, let us be to sure to pause
and thank the men and women who have sacrificed their lives for our
country. Our freedom has been protected by extraordinary individuals.
These heroes are brave enough, dedicated enough,
and selfless enough to lay down their lives so that the rest
of us might breath a little easier, hug our loved ones a little
tighter, and sleep just a little sounder under the blanket of freedom
they've provided. On behalf of the Fifth Congressional District, I offer a
profound and humble thank
you."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
