Dear Friends,
This week I met with the recently confirmed Secretary of Homeland
Security, Jeh Johnson.
I came away from our meeting hopeful that
Secretary Johnson will work with Congress to secure our borders,
improve our domestic security apparatus, and work towards thwarting
threats against our shores.
Last fall I chaired hearings of the Homeland Security Committee that
brought to light the astonishing lack of security built in to
Healthcare.gov.
The website remains virtually unprotected from data
beaches and leaves Americans' personal information, like social
security numbers, in danger of being stolen.
Due to these failings, I
was an original cosponsor of, and voted for this week, the Health
Exchange Security and Transparency Act
, HR 3811, that the House has now passed.
This legislation requires
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to notify any
individuals if their personal information has been stolen or hacked
through an Obamacare exchange no later than two days after their
information has been compromised.
I also voted for the Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act,
HR 2279. This bill requires that the EPA
evaluate existing state and federal financial responsibility
requirements, before developing its own, to ensure that new
requirements would not preempt other existing state or federal
requirements.
This bill is aimed at cutting down on confusion,
over-regulation, and red tape within the government.

Dear

This
