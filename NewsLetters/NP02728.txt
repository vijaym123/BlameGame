Getting Americans to
Work
On Wednesday, the House sent a bipartisan
jobs bill to President Obamas desk. The legislation passed this week
would approve the Keystone XL Pipeline project, which the White House has
delayed for 2,336 days. If approved, the pipeline would support an
estimated 42,000 American jobs and generate billions in economic
activity. Despite the benefits, President Obama has threatened to veto the
bill.
The oil
Keystone XL would transport will travel to market one way or another
and Americans should be the ones reaping the benefits. Transporting oil
by pipeline is safer, more efficient, and more
environmentally-friendly than any other existing option.
The Administration has
run out of excuses not to let this project go forward and I urge the
President to sign this bill into law when it hits his
desk.
Science Bowl
I had the pleasure of
attending the National Science Bowl competition in Morgantown where two
of our First District schools moved on to the finals. You can read
more about it
here . They will be taking part in
the finals in Washington, DC in April. Best of luck!
Towards Peace of Mind on Mental
Healt h
This week, the Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee for Oversight
and Investigations held a hearing about the mental health programs our
federal government runs.
Shockingly, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration sends taxpayer dollars to
groups that undermine their mission. One especially egregious grant went
to a program who tells patients to stop using their medications. Watch
the witnesss response here:
Educating the Next Generation of
Engineers
Earlier this week I had an opportunity to address the
American Society for Engineering Education meeting in Washington, DC.
As the only engineer in Congress, it was a pleasure to meet with these
educators.

Mountaineers Update
The Mountaineers were
able to close out a two game losing streak with a 76-72 victory over
Kansas State this past Wednesday. WVU squeezed by with the help of its
young players, despite a poor second half.
Tomorrow, West
Virginia hits the road to face off against a #14 ranked Iowa State. The
team needs a solid win, to pull away in the big 12 standings. Im
looking forward to an exciting game and a shooting average above
50%!
Lets Go, Eers!
Happy Presidents Day
Weekend!
Monday, February 16, marks Presidents
Day. The holiday began as a way of celebrating the birthday of our first
president, George Washington. It has transformed over the years into a
day to honor all who have held the office of the Presidency, past and
president.
On this occasion, I want to draw attention to
one president in particular, whose birthday is also this month. Abraham
Lincoln, our 16th president, was instrumental in helping West
Virginia achieve statehood. President Lincoln worked closely with Francis H.
Pierpont and other West Virginia representatives to secure West
Virginian statehood on June 20, 1863. While the Mountaineer struggle for
statehood began before Lincolns presidency, it was under his leadership
that statehood became official.
Have a great
weekend!
The Obama Administration has said that climate
change is a bigger threat to Americans than terrorism. Which do you think is a bigger
threat? Terrorism Climate Change
