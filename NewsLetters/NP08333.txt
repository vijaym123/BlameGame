Dear Friend,
Yesterday, the Commerce Department
announced that the United States' economy
declined at a 2.9% annual rate in the first
quarter of 2014, a steeper decline than
previously reported. This is also the
sharpest contraction since early 2009. This
is yet another reminder that we must act to
jumpstart our stagnant economy. The House
has passed dozens of bills to grow our
nation's economy and get Americans back to
work, but
many
of these bills
remain stuck in the
Senate.
Below you will find an article from the
Wall
Street Journal
detailing the
implications of this report.
WSJ: U.S.
Economy Shrank By Most in Five Years in
First Quarter
Sharpest
Pullback Since Recession Ended Five Years
Ago

WASHINGTONThe U.S. economy
contracted at a faster pace than previously
estimated in the first quarter, marking its
sharpest pullback since the recession ended
five years ago.
Gross domestic product, the broadest
measure of goods and services produced
across the economy, contracted at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9% in
the first three months of the year,
according to the Commerce Department's
third reading released Wednesday. That was
the fastest rate of decline since the first
quarter of 2009, when output fell 5.4%, and
matches the average pace of declines during
the recession.
"GDP was recession-like in the first
quarter, although most other data clearly
signal that the decline is an outlier,"
said Jim O' Sullivan, economist at High
Frequency Economics.
In its third GDP reading, based on newly
available data, Commerce said first-quarter
consumer spending and exports were even
weaker than previously estimated. Consumer
spending growth was lowered to 1% from 3.1%
previously, largely because health-care
spending was weaker than previously
estimated.
Early second-quarter data indicate the
economy has improved this spring as warmer
weather helped release some pent-up demand.
Macroeconomic Advisers Wednesday forecast
the economy will grow at a 3.3% annual rate
in the April to June period. But the
economy's stumble in the first three months
of the year has once again dashed hopes the
recovery was on the verge of switching into
a higher gear.
Residential investmentincluding
expenditures on home construction,
improvement and broker's
commissionsfell by a 4.2% pace in
the first quarter, revised from the
previous estimate of a 5% fall. The housing
market rebound, an important growth driver
earlier in the recovery, was derailed in
late 2013 by cold winter weather and rising
mortgage rates.
Commerce had previously estimated output
fell by 1% in the first quarter as
manufacturers drew down inventories rather
than produce new goods and as unusually
harsh weather kept consumers at home and
shut down work sites. Exports also declined
after a surge late last year.
Economists surveyed by The Wall Street
Journal had predicted Wednesday's report
would revise GDP growth down to a 2%
decline.
The depth of the first-quarter decline
in output means growth over the first six
months of the year likely fell below the
economy's average rate of just over 2%
since the economy emerged from recession in
June, 2009. That is below the U.S.
economy's longer-term growth rate of just
over 3%.
"It does not sound like the economy has
reached escape velocity no matter how you
try to spin it," said Chris Rupkey, an
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
"It's going to take some big numbers the
rest of 2014 for the economy to hit 2%
growth."
Five years into the recovery, high
unemployment and stagnant incomes continue
to restrain consumer spending, which
accounts for more than two thirds of U.S.
economic output. The big downgrade to
first-quarter consumer spending was
primarily related to difficulties in
estimating the impact of the Affordable
Care Act on health-care expenditures. The
actual data for health care spending was
substantially lower than the estimates of
the increase under the ACA.
Commerce also revised lower its estimate
of consumer spending on goods slightly to
0.2% growth from 0.7%.
The decline in first-quarter exports was
revised to an 8.9% rate from 6% previously,
a new sign of a challenging global economic
environment. The European economic recovery
remains anemic, while growth in
fast-growing emerging markets like China
and Brazil has downshifted.
A big buildup in private inventories had
boosted economic growth at the end of 2013,
but left a hangover in early 2014. Not
wanting to be stuck with excess production,
producers drew down inventories in the
first quarter. The move subtracted 1.7
percentage points from growth, slightly
more than the 1.6 previously estimated.
A measure of GDP that strips out changes
in private inventories, final sales of
domestic product, declined at a 1.3% pace
in the first quarter, revised from an
initial estimate of 0.6% growth
U.S.-based corporations, meanwhile,
posted slightly higher profits in the first
quarter. Corporate profits after tax,
without inventory valuation and capital
consumption adjustments, rose 0.1% in the
quarter, revised up from the 1.3% decline
previously estimated.
