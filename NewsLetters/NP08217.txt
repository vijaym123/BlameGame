Dear Friends:
There were several significant court decisions
announced this week that address issues important
to Utahns and citizens across the
nation.
Supreme Court Decision on Recess
Appointments
The U. S. Supreme Court unanimously decided on
Thursday in
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) v. Noel
Canning
that President Obamas January
2013 appointments to the NLRB were
unconstitutional. This decision
demonstrates how the Presidents actions
contradicted both constitutional text and
longstanding precedents that enshrine the
Senates legitimate role in federal
appointments. The Court has reaffirmed the
Senates vital advice-and-consent role as a
check on executive abuses.
I applaud the Courts willingness to
stand up to President Obamas flagrantly
unconstitutional power grab. This decision
strengthens my determination to stand up for the
separation of powers against the
Presidents disturbing pattern of
lawlessness.
Earlier this year I joined 41 of my Senate
colleagues in filing an amicus brief in this case
that argues these appointments were
unconstitutional. To read the brief,

I also spearheaded a letter in December 2012
signed by every Senate Republican, which called
on President Obama not to appoint nominees to
NLRB without Senate approval. To read that
letter, click

Supreme Court Decision on EPA
Overreach
In
Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA),
the Supreme Court
ruled that the Obama administration acted
unlawfully in its attempt to regulate greenhouse
gasses without congressional approval.
Congress had already decisively rejected
President Obamas cap-and-trade plan and
its massive energy taxes on American
families. Instead of listening to the
concerns of the American people and their elected
representatives, the President and his EPA
clearly misconstrued the Clean Air Act to give
the administration regulatory authority that
Congress clearly prohibited. By rejecting
this blatant power grab, the Court reaffirmed the
longstanding principle that the Constitution
gives Congress alone the power to make the law,
which the executive branch cannot override or
disregard.
I applaud the Courts willingness to
stand up once again to President Obamas
brazen overreach. As with the above
decision in
NLRB v. Canning , this decision should be a
wakeup call to everyone in Congress
Republican and Democrat
to stand up for
the constitutional checks and balances against
the Presidents alarming pattern of
lawlessness.
Appeals Court Decision on Utahs
Same-Sex Marriage Law
Finally, the 10
th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this
week that Utahs same-sex marriage law is
unconstitutional. Although I oppose
discrimination based on sexual orientation, I
have always believed that marriage is a sacred
union between one man and one woman. In my
view, the U. S. Constitution does not dictate a
particular definition of marriage, so I believe
such judgments are properly left to the citizens
of each state. Although I am not surprised
by todays decision, I disagree with the
courts reasoning and hope the Supreme
Court ultimately adheres to the original
understanding of the Constitution and allows each
State to define marriage for itself.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my
thoughts on these important decisions. I
hope it has been helpful and interesting, and as
always, please feel free to share any comments
and concerns you may have by contacting me

Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
