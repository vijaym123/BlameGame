It was a very moving experience to tour Little Rock Central High School
with Sens. Donnelly, Durbin, and Pryor during our recent trip to
Arkansas.
My son Duncan and I enjoyed a morning of duck hunting.
State of the Union
Last Tuesday night, the President delivered his fifth State of the
Union address. Throughout the night he appeared confident, comfortable,
and surprisingly nonpartisan. He was not overly confrontational, and on
a number of occasions recognized the value of Republican priorities
such as corporate tax reform and finding ways to bring businesses back
to the U.S. In his remarks, he identified many of the challenges our
society continues to confront, especially a weakened middle class, and
charted a course for the future direction of the country.

Connecting With Mainers
Last month I spent our state work period meeting with business owners,
educators, and community leaders to learn about projects they are
working on, challenges they face, and what I can do to help. Here is a
snap shot of a few places I visited:
At the SMCC Advanced Technology & Engineering Center in Brunswick, I
learned how the school is working with industry partners to ensure that
students have the necessary skills for success in today's job market.
You can read more about my visit here.
I toured the Maine Veterans' Home in Scarborough where I learned what
the federal government can do to help improve services.
At Educare Central Maine I saw first-hand the positive impact early
childhood education programs like Head Start and its partners have on
our communities. Learn more here.
At Stratton Lumber Co., Pierre Gapiery, the mill's owner, shows me how
they are increasing efficiency through new automated technology.
Jody Fletcher of Maine Wood Concepts, Inc. showed me several of their
wood product lines including these beautifully crafted salt and pepper
mills.
Members of my staff in Maine tour the Port of Entry facility in
Jackman.
Policy Update
We're one month into the new year and already I've been busy working
with my colleagues on legislation to protect the interest of Mainers.
*
I introduced The Partnership to Build America Act
to
help jumpstart infrastructure projects across the country.
*
I co-sponsored the Properly Reducing Overexemptions for Sports
Act (PRO Sports Act)
to close
tax-loop holes for professional sports leagues.
*
I filed an amendment to the Homeowners Flood Insurance
Affordability Act
that would make
communities eligible for reimbursement from the government for the
costs of successfully appealing inaccurate flood maps.
