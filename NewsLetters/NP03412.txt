On National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to the law enforcement officers across this nation, and especially in the Fourth District of Virginia, who serve our communities.
These brave men and women face danger and risk their lives so that you and I may be safe.
Today, and every day, we say thank you.
Yours in service,
Randy
