Dear Friend,
Business is
good for Americas airlines. Last year, they racked up billions of
dollars in profits from fees for everything from bags to
pets.
And yet some in Congress want to
help them hide the real cost of a ticket from consumers. Thats
wrong.
Right now, a bill is
traveling through the House of Representatives that would roll back consumer
protections and make it legal for airlines to advertise that low base
fare only for us to discover the real
and much higher
bottom line
cost at checkout. Thats a bait and switch
but its exactly what
the deceptively-named Transparent Airfares Act would
do.
Its time to double down
on consumer protections for air travelers
become a citizen
co-sponsor of my Real Transparency in Airfares
Act!
I introduced the Real
Transparency in Airfares Act to make sure consumers know
upfront
exactly what the airfare charge is going to be
no gimmicks, no hidden
costs. Not only will this bill keep the current rules that require
airlines and tickets sellers to show the full base airfare upfront,
including all taxes and fees, it will double the penalties for violating
these rules.
Join me.
Add your name and urge the Senate to
protect consumers and ground any efforts to deceive
travelers.
Sincerely,
Robert Menendez
United States Senator
