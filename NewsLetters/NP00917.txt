Update from the
House Floor
The House finished its first 100 days last month,
and weve gotten a lot done. The House has passed dozens of bills to
increase tax freedom, move closer to North American energy independence,
grow small businesses, fight human trafficking, support our veterans,
and so much
more.
A
recent report
by the Bipartisan Policy Center found that, The first three months
of the 114th Congress showed a burst of energy, with Congressional
committees reporting bills in higher numbers than during recent
Congresses.
Some quick
stats:
Weve passed 62 bills, which more than doubled the 25
passed in the first 100 days of the 113th Congress and is twice as
many as the 31 passed in the 112th
Congress.
Of these bills,
eight have gone on to pass the Senate. All eight of those bills have been
signed into law.
This marks the second most productive first
100 days where Republicans have been in control of the House in decades,
behind only the 106th Congress where 14 bills were
enacted.
As always,
I want to hear from you . If you have any questions or
comments, or if I can be of assistance to you in any way, please feel
free to
contact me . Please let me know how I may
continue to better serve you in the U.S. House of
Representatives.

delivery mechanisms and their inability to execute on deadlines.
