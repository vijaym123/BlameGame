Another Unbalanced Budget
Last week, the President released his budget proposal for FY 2015.
I
was disappointed, but not surprised, to see that it is an incredibly
partisan proposal with no basis in current political or economic
reality. Just two months ago, the President signed a compromise
spending agreement into law that would spend $1.014 trillion in the
next fiscal year.
But the budget he released on Monday would increase
spending by $56 billion above that agreement.
I didn't support that
deal
because of spending increases-I certainly don't support an
additional $56 billion.
All told, his budget will increase spending by 63% over the next ten
years. That translates to another $8 trillion that would be added to
our debt in the next decade.
We're already struggling to bear the
weight of our $17 trillion debt-how does the President think that we
will hold up under $25 trillion in obligations in 2024?
Of course,
this budget never balances either.
But what I find most troubling is
that this President-who has already increased taxes on Americans by
$1.7 trillion-is proposing to collect another $1.8 trillion in new
taxes.
And instead of using all of that revenue for deficit reduction,
about half of those tax hikes would fund more spending.
I want our grandkids to grow up in a prosperous country where they can
pursue their dreams.
I worry every day about whether they'll have the
same opportunities I had, or if our country's reckless spending will
squeeze our economy and force them to pay for this generation's errors.
That's not fair to them, and it's not a responsible way to govern.
That's why reining in spending and making the government accountable to
you is one of my top priorities.

Protecting Your Identity Online
Last week was National Consumer Protection Week, and it's an important
reminder to get informed about how to avoid scams, maximize your online
security, and protect your identity.
Social media and cell phones make
it easier than ever before for thieves to take advantage of you, so
this issue is becoming more important every day.
In fact, the U.S.
Bureau of Justice Statistics
estimates that 16.6
million people-or roughly 7 percent of Americans 16 and older-were
victims of identity theft in 2012 alone.
I've created a page on my
website that lists a variety of resources you can use to keep yourself
safe.
Check it out here
.
Seniors adjusting to the latest technology can be vulnerable to scams
and phishing schemes, where they are persuaded to send money or
personal information to a seemingly trustworthy source.
You can find
information on how to avoid hackers and viruses here
.
Unfortunately, it's not just
adults that are being targeted; child identity theft is a growing crime
because the probability of discovery is low.
I was disturbed to learn
that children are as much as 50 percent more likely than adults to be
identity theft victims.
These crimes take longer to discover because
most parents don't monitor their children's credit.
You can get
information on internet safety for kids here
, and learn how to protect their identity here
.
I encourage you to visit my website to get educated on consumer
protection, and contact me
if you're interested in taking part in
future town hall meetings or telephone calls with experts that can help
you stay safe. Select "Consumer Protection" in the drop-down menu, and
I'll notify you about future events.
Action Item: Reining in Executive Overreach
This week, the House will vote on a series of bills
that will help ensure the executive branch
isn't overstepping its Constitutional authority.
This Presidency has
been characterized by a willingness to use executive powers to
significantly change the law.
In some cases, the Administration has
simply chosen not to enforce existing legislation, and the Attorney
General recently encouraged states
to do the same on
controversial issues.
While other Administrations may have issued more
executive orders, none have used this tool to influence such a broad
range of major policies.
I'm a proud cosponsor of the Faithful
Execution of the Law Act
, which requires federal
officials to report to Congress whenever the Administration fails to
fully enforce current law.

Another
Unbalanced
Budget
Last
week,
the
President
released
his
budget
proposal
for
FY
2015.
I
was
disappointed,
but
not
surprised,
to
see
that
it
is
an
incredibly
partisan
proposal
with
no
basis
in
current
political
or
economic
reality.
Just
two
months
ago,
the
President
signed
a
compromise
spending
agreement
into
law
that
would
spend
$1.014
trillion
in
the
next
fiscal
year.
But
the
budget
he
released
on
Monday
would
increase
spending
by
$56
billion
above
that
agreement.
I
didn't
support
that
deal
because
of
spending
increases&#8212;I
certainly
don't
support
an
additional
$56
billion.
All
told,
his
budget
will
increase
spending
by
63%
over
the
next
ten
years.
That
translates
to
another
$8
trillion
that
would
be
added
to
our
debt
in
the
next
decade.
We&#8217;re
already
struggling
to
bear
the
weight
of
our
$17
trillion
debt&#8212;how
does
the
President
think
that
we
will
hold
up
under
$25
trillion
in
obligations
in
2024?
Of
course,
this
budget
never
balances
either.
But
what
I
find
most
troubling
is
that
this
President&#8212;who
has
already
increased
taxes
on
Americans
by
$1.7
trillion&#8212;is
proposing
to
collect
another
$1.8
trillion
in
new
taxes.
And
instead
of
using
all
of
that
revenue
for
deficit
reduction,
about
half
of
those
tax
hikes
would
fund
more
spending.
I
want
our
grandkids
to
grow
up
in
a
prosperous
country
where
they
can
pursue
their
dreams.
I
worry
every
day
about
whether
they&#8217;ll
have
the
same
opportunities
I
had,
or
if
our
country&#8217;s
reckless
spending
will
squeeze
our
economy
and
force
them
to
pay
for
this
generation&#8217;s
errors.
That&#8217;s
not
fair
to
them,
and
it&#8217;s
not
a
responsible
way
to
govern.
That&#8217;s
why
reining
in
spending
and
making
the
government
accountable
to
you
is
one
of
my
top
priorities.

Protecting
Your

Online
Last
week
was
National
Consumer
Protection
Week,
and
it&#8217;s
an
important
reminder
to
get
informed
about
how
to
avoid
scams,
maximize
your
online
security,
and
protect
your

Social
media
and
cell

make
it
easier
than
ever
before
for
thieves
to
take
advantage
of
you,
so
this
issue
is
becoming
more
important
every
day.
In
fact,
the
U.S.
Bureau
of
Justice
Statistics
estimates
that
16.6
million
people&#8212;or
roughly
7
percent
of
Americans
16
and
older&#8212;were
victims
of
identity
theft
in
2012
alone.
I&#8217;ve
created
a

Unfortunately,
it&#8217;s
not

adults
that
are
being
targeted;
child
identity
theft
is
a
growing
crime
because
the
probability
of
discovery
is
low.
I
was
disturbed
to
learn
that
children
are
as
much
as
50
percent
more
likely
than
adults
to
be
identity
theft
victims.
These
crimes
take
longer
to
discover
because
most
parents
don&#8217;t
monitor
their
children&#8217;s
credit.
