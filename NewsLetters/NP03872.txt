Dear Friend,
In the
military, accountability begins at the top and must extend to every
rank and position. Accountability is especially important when it comes
to preventing and combating sexual assault in the military. A bill I
authored with my Republican colleague Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH) ensures
our military leaders, servicemembers and the military justice system,
are held to the highest standard.
The bill was passed
last week by Congress
and will be signed into law by the President.
Military sexual assault is a multifaceted challenge that requires
continued, meaningful reforms to bring about the cultural change needed
to eradicate these crimes. Our bill is an important step, but we know
much more needs to be done. Read more about this important national
security issue and my recent and longstanding efforts in this edition of
Congress in your Inbox.
Also in this edition,
you will find
my statement
regarding the recent
spending package passed by Congress. In addition, there is news about
recent funding to Third District communities to assist families with
preschool education , as well as
my statement
on the recent Senate report on torture. There
is also information about
a new international
program
at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and some positive
statistics about
job growth in the U.S .
As
always, I look forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thank you for staying engaged and enjoy this week's edition of
Congress in your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas

Tsongas statement
on spending package
Although I
supported, and even helped author, a number of important provisions in the
package to fund our cities, protect our troops, and take care of
victims, I could not in good conscience vote for a package that also
included two inexcusable provisions slipped in at the last
moment.
The first, pushed by the same financial institutions that caused
the financial crash of 2008, rolls back major taxpayer protections
passed in 2010 as part of Wall Street reform, ensuring that banks that make
risky bets get to keep their profits to themselves while dumping
their losses onto taxpayers. And the second, disturbingly, dramatically
increases the amount of money that these same Wall Street executives can
donate to political parties and candidates.

Tsongas
statement on Senate report on torture
The
Senate report on torture raises serious concerns about human rights
violations committed by the United States in the aftermath of the September
11 th
attacks. As a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, I have long supported U.S. adherence to the Geneva Conventions
and our commitment to human rights during American military
campaigns.
