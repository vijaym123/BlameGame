Protecting the First Freedom Guaranteed in
the First Amendment
Yesterday the Senate voted on the
"Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act." The most
extraordinary feature of this bill is the incongruity between its title and
its content.
The titlethe Protect Womens Health from
Corporate Interference Actis clear and straightforward. It suggests the
bill is aimed at the important and worthy goal of protecting womens
health.
But the text of the legislation plainly
demonstrates that the true objective of the bill is to circumscribe Americans
religious liberties within the narrow confines of the Democratic
Partys partisan agenda and the whims of politicians and
bureaucrats.
While maintaining the appearance of preserving all the current
legal protections of religious freedom in America today, this
proposal quietly adds to them a subtle, yet deeply problematic and
inappropriate, qualification: the federal government will not prohibit the free
exercise of religionuntil the federal government decides it wants
to.
Under this bill, your religious liberties stop at the
doorstep of the Democratic National Committee.
The authors
of this bill know all this. They know the American people reject their
intolerance of diversity and indifference to the First Amendment. We
know their bill cannot become law. Indeed, we know this for a fact,
because if the regulations they support were actually written in the
law, Obamacare itself never would have passed. It was slipped in after
the fact, by bureaucrats not subject to public
accountability.
I voted against this bill, and it failed to gain enough support to
pass out of the Senate.

delivered to encourage my colleagues to vote against this bill
