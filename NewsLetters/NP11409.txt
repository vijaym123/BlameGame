Dear
Friends,
Every day when Im talking with constituents, their
top concern is often related to the Executive overreach of our
current Administration. I share that same concern. The Founding Fathers made
it clear in the Constitution that the Presidents responsibility is
to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" (Article II,
Section 3).
But time and time again, we have
seen that President Obama is ignoring his constitutionally mandated
responsibility. He is failing to enforce laws that dont fit his political
agenda. Examples include, delays and changes to Obamacare, granting
deferred removal action to illegal immigrants, and the waiver of
welfare work requirements under TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families). For a document listing all additional examples,

This is simply
unacceptable. And it doesnt matter whether the President is Republican, Democrat
or Independent. Preventing the President from overstepping the
boundaries set by the Constitution is not partisan politics
its
preserving the fundamental premise of our constitutional design: that a limited
government divided into 3 branches, is necessary to protect
individual liberty and the rule of law.
This week,
I voted for two bills that restore the proper balance of power and
protect our constitutional system.
The ENFORCE the Law Act:
The
ENFORCE the Law Act,
H.R. 4138, which passed the House
this week, will help restore balance to the separation of powers which
are constitutionally mandated. Specifically, the ENFORCE the Law Act
puts a procedure in place to permit the House, or the Senate, to
authorize a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for failure to faithfully
execute the laws. The legislation also provides for expedited
consideration of any such lawsuit, first through a three-judge panel at the
federal district court level and then by providing for direct appeal to the
United States Supreme
Court.
Faithful Execution of the Law Act:
The
Faithful Execution of the Law Act , H.R. 3973, strengthens
current law and promotes transparency and honesty in the federal
government. The act requires all federal officials who establish or implement a
policy that refrains from enforcing a federal law to report to
Congress as to why they did not enforce the
law.
