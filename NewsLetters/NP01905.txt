A Balanced
Budget For A Stronger America
Last week my colleagues and I on the House Budget Committee had the
honor of introducing our budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2016
A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America . It was approved by
the House Budget Committee on Thursday and will be on the
floor of the full House of Representative
for consideration this week.
The budget we have introduced would force
Washington to live within its means while tackling the nations
fiscal and economic challenges with positive solutions. It is a plan that
balances the budget in less than ten years, secures and strengthens
vital programs
like Medicare
provides our military men and women with
the resources they need to protect American families, and would make
Washington more efficient, effective and accountable to hard-working
taxpayers. In this budget, we have embraced the innovative spirit of
the American people by putting forth policies that can deliver real
results and that empower individuals, families, job creators and our
communities to build a more secure future and healthier economy.
Here is an outline of what our budget will
accomplish:
-Balances the budget in less than 10 years without
raising taxes
-Reduces Spending by $5.5T
-Repeals Obamacare
-Ensures a Strong National
Defense
-Ends the Obamacare Raid On
Medicare
-Restores Federalism
-Cuts Waste, Corporate Welfare and
Improves Accountability

A
Balanced Budget for a Stronger America , please go to

continue to look for positive solutions to all the challenges we face.
Your feedback as we move forward is always encouraged and
appreciated.
House Votes to Block NLRB
Rule &amp; Reign In EPA
Last week,
I voted with my colleagues to block a radical National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) rule that would have steamrolled decades of
transparency and precedent in union elections. American workers deserve open and
honest elections, not ambush elections.
The
House of Representatives also moved to ensure that the decisions
made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are based on
independently-verified, unbiased scientific research, instead of secret data
that is hidden behind closed doors. Our efforts will prohibit
the EPA from issuing regulations that utilize data that has not been
made public or scientifically analyzed by an independent
party.
