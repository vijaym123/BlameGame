BREAKING: Boehner&rsquo;s $30 MILLION ad blitz starts TOMORROW
We&rsquo;re nearly out of time -- so we won't waste any:
We just got word that Boehner&rsquo;s $30 MILLION ad blitz starts TOMORROW. Boehner knows that if he can beat us right now -- in the last critical months before the election -- then the damage will be irreversible. To be blunt about it: If we fall behind now, we might as well throw in the towel on a Democratic House for President Obama&rsquo;s final two years. Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00
We just ran the numbers: it&rsquo;ll take another 48,000 donations before this week&rsquo;s mid-month fundraising deadline to be able to compete.
David -- if you&rsquo;re planning to chip in soon, we could really use your support today. ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
