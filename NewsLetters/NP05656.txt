Dear Friends,
The outbreak of
Ebola that has claimed the lives of nearly 4,000 people in West Africa
has now reached the United States and Europe. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the virus could infect as many
as 1.4 million people within the next four months. In light of the
unprecedented outbreak, President Obama has tasked our already strained
military with supporting the response effort, and requested that
Congress redirect $1 billion within the Department of Defenses budget to
fund the mission.
Yesterday, Army Gen. David Rodriguez,
commander of United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), provided the most
information to date of what the militarys mission is in the response
effort. In addition to constructing medical facilities, training local
healthcare providers and providing logistical support, the military has
already deployed three mobile lab teams and will be deploying four
more teams in the coming days. Each lab has the ability to quickly test
up to 100 blood samples per day for the Ebola virus to help track the
spread of the disease.
As Ranking Member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee I have serious concerns any time the military is
tasked with a new mission due to the historically steep cuts that have
taken place to the defense budget under President Obamas
leadership. But,I also understand that the U.S. military possess a logistical
expertise that is unmatched throughout the world, and could be key to
abating this now global epidemic.
I have put serious
consideration intothe
Presidents reprogramming request and have given my approval for the
administration to spend a small fraction of that money to begin assisting
West Africa. But, I also have serious questions that the
President needs to answer before I can completely sign-off on the
mission. Before the Administration can access the full funds it has
requested from the DOD, I have demanded the Administration
answer two basic questions: 1) What is the plan to protect our service
members from contracting Ebola; and 2) what is the strategy
for transferring this likely long-term mission back to appropriate
government agencies, like the state department, as well as non-governmental
organizations?
My goal is to
ensure that any further DOD funds being used towards the Ebola crisis
is not only in the best interest of West Africa but also our military
members and their families. Too many unknowns remain about this
lethal virus, and we must ensure that the health of all involved is being
considered.
As discussions continue, it is
important that I know what you think about the U.S. militarys role in the
Ebola response effort. Please take a moment to fill out the survey in
the sidebar.
Sincerely,
Jim Inhofe
