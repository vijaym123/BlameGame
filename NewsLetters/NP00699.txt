Friend,
On Memorial Day, a grateful nation comes together to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who have given their lives to defend the liberty and freedom we hold so dear.
We owe a debt of gratitude to these servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation. And we are eternally thankful to their families and friends, who bear the burden of that sacrifice every single day.
We live in the greatest nation in the world and have a sacred obligation to care for those whose bravery has ensured that the United States continues to shine as a beacon of hope for millions across the globe.
As you commemorate this day, please remember the hundreds of thousands of servicemen and women who made that possible. And let us express our deepest thanks to all of our nation's veterans and active duty members of the Armed Forces who safeguard our liberty and freedoms now and for generations to come.
With appreciation,
Ed
