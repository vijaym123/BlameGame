Friend
Real quick note
just wanted to be sure you saw that
H.Res.11
was recently introduced to provide the House of Representatives with the authority to initiate litigation regarding the failure of the President, the head of any department or agency, or any other officer of the executive branch, to act in accordance with their constitutional and legal duties regarding immigration laws.
This will authorize the House of Representatives to legally determine in federal court whether President Obamas unilateral immigration actions violate the Constitution and federal immigration law duties. Specifically, this bill allows the Speaker to seek declaratory judgment to compel the President to obey immigration laws as passed by Congress, signed into law by previous presidents, and interpreted by federal judges.
I will keep you posted.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. In the meantime, I am working with the Judiciary Committee on legislation to secure the border, remove the President's ability to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement, and strengthen the E-verify system. Learn more,
