Friend,
I want to share a few updates about some recent activity in Washington
that could have a profound impact on Rhode Island and our country.
Promoting Animal Welfare
I believe that we all have a fundamental responsibility to care for and
protect the well-being of our nation's animals, and that's why I was
honored to receive the Humane Society's 2013 Humane Advocate Award last
week.
My commitment to animal protection dates back to two summers I
spent as a young man volunteering at a local animal shelter in Rhode
Island where I saw firsthand the tragic impact of animal abuse.
Efforts to ensure animals are treated humanely are important statements
about our priorities as a nation, which is why I opposed the King
amendment, which could have undone animal welfare laws in many states,
including Rhode Island.
Specifically, it would prohibit states from
denying the trade and transport of agricultural products, including
livestock, across state lines based on the manner in which the products
are handled or treated.
I will continue my work to support animal
rights and fight for legislation that could potentially undermine state
and local animal welfare protections.
Ensuring Free and Fair Elections
Last week the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on total
contributions that a single donor can give to candidates and political
parties.
Now a wealthy out-of-state donor will be able to donate to
campaigns and political parties across the country without restriction.
This ruling is bad for our democracy and will further drown out the
voices of ordinary Americans and give greater power to the wealthiest
special interests.
Now more than ever we need to reform our election
system and create a democracy that reflects the voices of the many
rather than the check books of the few.
This decision by the Supreme
Court in McCutcheon v. FEC is part of a growing trend led by a slim
majority of Republican activist Supreme Court judges that is
reminiscent of Citizens United and could further erode free and fair
elections in our nation.
I strongly disagree with this decision and I
will work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to enact
legislation to respond to this flawed decision to promote fairness in
our political process.
A Responsible Budget
Our national budget should reflect our values as a nation and address
the most pressing issues facing our country today - the creation of
good paying jobs and growing our economy.
Last Tuesday, House
Republicans released their budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2015 and
instead of presenting a bipartisan, commonsense plan, their spending
agenda doubles down on a flawed view of how we should build and grow
our economy.
It preserves many tax loopholes including those that
incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas and it makes cuts to job
training and manufacturing programs, Pell Grants, Medicaid, and
nutrition programs, and it repeals the health reform law that is
benefiting millions of Americans across the country, including more
than 84,000 Rhode Islanders. I strongly oppose this framework and will
work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to develop a budget
that will get our economy back on track and that ensures our spending
priorities promote job growth here in Rhode Island and all across our
country.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov

OUR

April 7,
2014
Friend,
I
want
to
share
a
few
updates
about
some
recent
activity
in
Washington
that
could
have
a
profound
impact
on
Rhode
Island
and
our
country.
Promoting
Animal
Welfare
I
believe
that
we
all
have
a
fundamental
responsibility
to
care
for
and
protect
the
well-being
of
our
nation&#8217;s
animals,
and
that&#8217;s
why
I
was
honored
to
receive
the
Humane
Society&#8217;s
2013
Humane
Advocate
Award
last
week.
My
commitment
to
animal
protection
dates
back
to
two
summers
I
spent
as
a
young
man
volunteering
at
a
local
animal
shelter
in
Rhode
Island
where
I
saw
firsthand
the
tragic
impact
of
animal
abuse.
Efforts
to
ensure
animals
are
treated
humanely
are
important
statements
about
our
priorities
as
a
nation,
which
is
why
I
opposed
the
King

which
could
have

animal

in
many

including
Rhode

Specifically,
it
would

of
agricultural

across

based
on

I
will

that
could
potentially

Last

the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
struck
down
a
ban
on
total
contributions
that
a
single
donor
can
give
to
candidates
and

Now
a
wealthy
out-of-state
donor
will
be
able
to
donate
to
campaigns
and
political
parties
across
the
country
without
restriction.
This
ruling
is
bad
for
our
democracy
and
will
further
drown
out
the
voices
of
ordinary
Americans
and
give
greater
power
to
the
wealthiest
special
interests.
Now
more
than
ever
we
need
to
reform
our
election
system
and
create
a
democracy
that
reflects
the
voices
of
the
many
rather
than
the
check
books
of
the
few.
This
decision
by
the
Supreme
Court
in
McCutcheon

is
part
of
a
growing

led
by
a
slim

of
Republican
activist
Supreme

judges
that
is
reminiscent
of
Citizens

and
could
further
erode
free

I
strongly
disagree
with
this
decision
and
I
will
work
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
and
Senate
to
enact
legislation
to
respond
to
this
flawed
decision
to
promote
fairness
in
our
political
process.
A
Responsible
Budget
Our
national
budget
should
reflect
our
values
as
a
nation
and
address
the
most
pressing
issues
facing
our
country
today
&#8211;
the
creation
of
good
paying
jobs
and
growing
our
economy.
Last
Tuesday,
House
Republicans
released
their
budget
proposal
for
Fiscal
Year
2015
and
instead
of presenting
a
bipartisan,
commonsense
plan,
their
spending
agenda
doubles
down
on
a
flawed
view
of
how
we
should
build
and
grow
our
economy.
It
preserves
many
tax
loopholes
including
those
that
incentivize
companies
to
ship
jobs
overseas
and
it
makes
cuts
to
job
training

Pell

programs,
and
it
repeals
the
health
reform
law
that
is
benefiting
millions
of
Americans
across
the
country,
including
more
than
84,000
Rhode
Islanders.
I
strongly
oppose
this
framework
and
will
work
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
and
Senate
to
develop
a
budget
that
will
get
our
economy
back
on
track
and
that
ensures
our
spending
priorities
promote
job
growth
here
in
Rhode
Island
and
all
across
our
