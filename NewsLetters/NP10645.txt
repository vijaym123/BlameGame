H.Con.Res. 96: Establishing the budget for the United States Government
This week, House Republicans again demonstrated they are the only
adults in the room when it comes to solving our country's fiscal
problems by passing a budget for Fiscal Year 2015. This budget returns
us to balance within 10 years, while repealing Obamacare and imposing
no new taxes. And it begins to rebuild our military from some of the
drastic cuts they've faced in recent years, protecting America's place
on the world stage. Finally, it preserves Medicare for future
generations, while ensuring current retirees and those nearing
retirement see no change.
Committee Spotlight
This week, the House Financial Services Committee
held a
hearing entitled "Whose in Your Wallet: Examining How Washington Red
Tape Impairs Economic Freedom." There is no greater impediment to
America's businesses-particularly our small businesses-than government
red tape. If we want our businesses to create jobs, we must provide
relief from the crushing federal regulatory burden they are currently
dealing with. With more than 2,300 pages, 400 new government dictates,
and creation of vast new government bureaucracies, the Dodd-Frank Act
regulatory red tape is some of the most harmful our economy has ever
seen. It is also among the most confusing, complex and voluminous that
America's job creators have ever confronted. I look forward to
continuing to work with my colleagues on the Committee to find ways to
reduce red tape and repeal Dodd-Frank.
Recently, the House Foreign Affairs Committee
held a hearing entitled "Women's Education:
Promoting Development, Countering Radicalism." For many years,
countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa have
lagged behind the rest of the world in their education of women and
girls. Women in these areas often face a patriarchic culture and
extreme interpretations of religious doctrine that significantly limit
their options for work and school. Research has demonstrated a strong
link between the status of women and a country's ability to establish
democratic governance and achieve economic success. We must help these
countries promote women's rights. To this end, last week, the Foreign
Affairs Committee passed the Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act, a bill
to expand the number of scholarships available to Pakistani women. It
allocates an increased number of merit and need-based scholarships to
help Pakistani women from rural areas pursue Bachelor's and Master's
degrees at Pakistani universities. I look forward to exploring other
ways to address the issue of educating women worldwide.
Fighting Back Against Obamacare: Save American Workers Act
Under Obamacare, any employee who works more than 30 hours per week is
considered full time and their employer is then obligated to provide
them health insurance or face a fine. This 30-hour definition is a
change from the traditional 40-hour definition and it's causing
Arkansans to have their hours cut and their wages reduced. That is why
I sponsored the Save American Workers Act, legislation that would
repeal the 30-hour definition of full time employment and restores the
traditional 40-hour definition.
Former President Bill Clinton once said the American community is
dependent on 'the structure, the values, the discipline and the reward
that work gives.' President Clinton knows better than anyone that
Arkansans have never been scared of a little hard work. Whether it's
putting in overtime, balancing two jobs, or working the farm after a
full day of work, we do what it takes to provide for our families. But
'full days' are becoming few and far between Obamacare. This unworkable
law is a barrier to the honest, good-paying work President Clinton was
talking about-the kind of work we need to get our economy back on
track. Last week the House passed the Save American Workers Act, and I
was proud to vote for this legislation. I urge my colleagues in the
Senate to stop sitting idly by as Obamacare wreaks havoc on our
workforce. They should pass this legislation immediately and send it to
the President to sign into law.

Financial Literacy Month
April is Financial Literacy Month, an opportunity to learn more about
healthy financial habits. Growing up on a farm in Dardanelle, my
parents made sure I understood the value of a dollar and the value of
saving a dollar. In high school, I worked at the U.S. Caf in
Dardanelle for a little extra pocket money. Each paycheck I brought
home was met with a friendly (but serious!) reminder from my mom, Avis,
to put some of those earnings into my savings account at our local bank.
Unfortunately, politicians in Washington aren't currently setting a
very good example of fiscal responsibility for our future generations.
Our debt has grown dramatically over the last 6 years, both in raw
amount-trillions of dollars!-and relative to our economy as a whole. In
2008, our national debt was ten trillion dollars-roughly 68 percent of
the country's economic output. By the end of this year, the president's
own Office of Management and Budget projects it will be almost eighteen
trillion dollars-larger than our entire economy.
I'm working hard in Congress to stop reckless spending and confront our
national debt head-on. But I want to make sure Arkansas's next
generations are learning the importance of fiscal responsibility in
their own lives. To do my part, I will be posting tips and articles
about financial literacy in the coming weeks here on the Cotton Blog
and on our social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. And
I will be meeting with local high school students to share my thoughts
on this important topic. We should always be working to ensure things
are better for the next generation. Please be sure to check back in the
coming weeks for more on my Financial Literacy Month efforts.

Spotlight: Keeping Phone Service Affordable for Rural Arkansans
Recently, the FCC announced a potential increase in the rate small
rural carriers charge for voice services in states like Arkansas. Last
week, my fellow Arkansas Republican Colleagues joined me in writing
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler expressing our
concern over such an increase.
The letter reads, in part, "the rate floor mechanism, in effect, offers
certain rural telecom companies money to raise customers' phone bills,
with the price increases matched dollar-for-dollar from the federal
universal service fund. This perverse incentive structure is negatively
impacting rural customers and is skewing the business costs of
investing in the provision of rural service."
Chairman Wheeler recently testified before the House Financial Services
and General Government Appropriations subcommittee that the FCC may
delay the initial date and phase-in the full rate increase. However, I
remain concerned about the broader negative impacts the rate floor
mechanism will have on rural consumers.

In the meantime, my staff continues to hold Veterans Assistance
Sessions around the 4thdistrict to provide veterans with assistance in

Foreign

Committee
h e ld
a
hearing
entitled
&#8220;Women&#8217;s

Development,
Countering

For
many
years,
countries
in
the
Middle
East,
South
Asia,
and
sub-Saharan
Africa
have
lagged
behind
the
rest
of
the
world
in
their
education
of
women
and
girls.
Women
in
these
areas
often
face
a
patriarchic
culture

Fighting
Back
Against
Obamacare :
Save
American
Workers
Act
Under
Obamacare,
any
employee
who
works
more
than
30
hours
per
week
is
considered
full
time
and
their
employer
is
then
obligated
to
provide
them
health
insurance
or
face
a
fine.
This
30-hour
definition
is
a
change
from
the
traditional
40-hour
definition
and
it&#8217;s
causing
Arkansans
to
have
their
hours
cut
and
their
wages
reduced.
That
is
why
I
sponsored
the
Save
American
Workers
Act ,
legislation
that
would
repeal
the
30-hour
definition
of
full
time
employment
and
restores
the
traditional
40-hour
definition.
Former
President
Bill
Clinton
once
said
the
American
community
is
dependent
on
&#8216;the
structure,
the
values,
the
discipline
and
the
reward
that
work
gives.&#8217;
President
Clinton
knows
better
than
anyone
that
Arkansans
have
never
been
scared
of
a
little
hard
work.
Whether
it&#8217;s
putting
in
overtime,
balancing
two
jobs,
or
working
the
farm
after
a
full
day
of
work,
we
do
what
it
takes
to
provide
for
our
families.
But
&#8216;full

Unfortunately,

aren&#8217;t
currently
setting

head-on.

I
want
to
make

Arkansas&#8217;s
next

are
learning
the
importance
of
fiscal
responsibility
in
their
own

And
I
will

Keeping

Affordable

Rural
Arkansans
Recently,
the
FCC
announced
a
potential
increase
in
the
rate
small
rural

charge
for
voice

in
states
like
Arkansas.
Last
week,
my

Colleagues
joined
me
in
writing
Federal

Chairman
Tom
Wheeler
expressing
our
concern
over
such
an
increase.
The
letter
reads,
in
part,
&#8220;the

mechanism,
in
effect,
offers
certain
rural
telecom
companies
money
to
raise
customers&#8217;
phone
bills,
with
the
price
increases
matched
dollar-for-dollar
from

structure
is
negatively
impacting
rural
customers
and
is
skewing
the
business
costs

Chairman
Wheeler
recently

subcommittee
that
the

may
delay

However,
I
remain
concerned
about
the
broader
negative

will
have
on
