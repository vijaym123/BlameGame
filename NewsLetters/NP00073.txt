Dear Friend,
Every year, thousands of ex-offenders leave prison without the
resources or means to secure employment, purchase food or provide
healthcare for themselves or their families. Unfortunately, without
federal benefits to help them successfully reenter society these
ex-offenders often commit crimes that send them back prison, costing
both our criminal justice system and communities significant money and
resources.
Thats why I recently re-introduced the Recidivism Reduction Act,
legislation that will ensure eligible individuals receive their federal
benefits on the first day of their release so they can start
productive, law-abiding lives out of prison.
Barriers in current federal law means returning ex-offenders have to
wait several months after their release before being able to access
many of their benefits. My proposed legislation works to remove these
barriers and create a smooth transition so that newly released
individuals can have access to their federal disability and health care
benefits right away.
I am proud to re-introduce this bill, and I look forward to support
from my colleagues as we look to reduce recidivism rates, save tax
payers money, and increase the opportunities for released inmates to
become contributing members of society once again.
Your Friend,
Andr

Did you know Habitat for Humanity builds new homes for veterans? Last
week, my staff in Indy helped put some of the finishing touches on
Hoosier veteran Vito Sanders' new home. Sanders learned about Habitats
OrthoIndy Veteran Build program last year, after my office held a
Habitat for Humanity information session.

Dear
Friend,
Every
year,
thousands
of
ex-offenders
leave
prison
without
the
resources
or
means
to
secure
employment,
purchase
food
or
provide
healthcare
for
themselves
or
their
families.
Unfortunately,
without
federal
benefits
to
help
them
successfully
reenter
society
these
ex-offenders
often
commit
crimes
that
send
them
back
prison,
costing
both
our
criminal
justice
system
and
communities
significant
money
and
resources.
That&#146;s
why
I
recently
re-introduced
the
Recidivism
Reduction
Act,
legislation
that
will
ensure
eligible
individuals
receive
their
federal
benefits
on
the
first
day
of
their
release
so
they
can
start
productive,
law-abiding
lives
out
of
prison.
Barriers
in
current
federal
law
means
returning
ex-offenders
have
to
wait
several
months
after
their
release
before
being
able
to
access
many
of
their
benefits.
My
proposed
legislation
works
to
remove
these
barriers
and
create
a
smooth
transition
so
that
newly
released
individuals
can
have
access
to
their

and

right
