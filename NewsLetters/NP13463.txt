Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. It's been a busy week in
the Senate as we discussed a major budget proposal.

I also joined Shannon Bream on Fox News earlier in the week to discuss
the proposed budget agreement.

It's an honor to serve you and South Carolina. As always, please feel
free to contact my office with any questions and concerns. I look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
