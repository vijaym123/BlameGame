MSNBC: Democrats hope to make Koch money backfire on GOP
David --
When the chips are down&hellip; When our backs are against the wall&hellip;
You step up!
Late last night we hit our critical mid-month goal. Thanks everyone! That means we can go on offense against Koch Brothers-funded Republicans. As MSNBC put it this morning:
Democrats are looking to perform some political jiujitsu: by turning the controversial billionaires into weapons against the GOP.
Thanks to your support, we&rsquo;re going on-the-air against 18 Koch-backed Republicans this week! And our on-the-ground organizers have already reached out to over 7 million(!) voters. More to come soon -- but for now, we just wanted to thank you for making our work possible!
All of us at the DCCC
P.S.
We want to hear from you! Why are you supporting Democrats this year? What&rsquo;s the issue that drives you more than any other?
