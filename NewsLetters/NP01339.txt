ICYMI: SEC Reveals It Doesn't Use
Email Snooping Power It Defends
Click here to watch a
video of Congressman Yoder's discussion with Chairwoman White on
YouTube.
On Wednesday, during the Financial Services
Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White made a
revelation that the SEC is no longer reviewing Americans emails
without notice by subpoenaing internet service providers (ISP) like Google
a legal practice under the outdated Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986. This is a welcome
change.
With this revelation, we may have cleared a major hurdle in digital
privacy reform, as the SEC was the lone government-agency holdout
engaging in this practice.
We ought to
codify this change by passing
HR 699
the Email Privacy Act , the legislation I
introduced in February along with more than half of the House of
Representatives as cosponsors. My bill would simply bring Americans privacy
rights in their emails and other digital communications into the 21st
Century, and give our emails the same protection as our paper
mail.

NDSS Champion of Change
Rachel Mast, NDSS President Sara Hart
Weir, and Jawanda Mast presenting Representative Yoder with the
Champion of Change Award on the United States Capitol steps Wednesday morning
on a windy day in Washington, D.C.
I was honored to
be named a National Down Syndrome Society Champion of Change on
Wednesday. Special thank you to NDSS President Sara Hart Weir, Jawanda
Mast, and her daughter Rachel for braving the wind and joining me on the
Capitol steps to present me with the
award.
Advocating for people with Down syndrome and other
developmental disabilities is something that I have prioritized since my
early days in Congress, thanks in large part to my friends Rachel,
Jawanda, and her husband Jonathan. The Masts came to me when I was first
elected to Congress to promote the Achieving a Better Life Experience,
or ABLE Act as it is better known. I immediately recognized this was
something I wanted to fight for in 2011, and was honored to have them in
my office in Washington the day it was passed by Congress this past
December.
It was
especially fulfilling for me to receive this award during the same week
Governor Brownback signed the Kansas ABLE Act into law. Kansas will be one
of the first states in the nation to allow individuals like Rachel to
walk into a bank and open an ABLE account to save for her future. It
will provide her with the flexible savings tools to maintain greater
financial security and prepare for a future of independent
living.
I will proudly continue to help
lead the charge and be a voice for these families as we seek to provide
opportunity for all.
Floor Remarks on
Tax Day

Yoder's remarks on YouTube.
On Wednesday - Tax Day
- I spoke on the House floor to urge my colleagues to ease the tax
burden on hardworking Americans.
House Votes to
Repeal Death Tax
On the 100th day of the 114th
Congress, the House passed legislation to ease the tax burden on families
across the country by repealing the Death Tax. This was the first time
in ten years that the House considered its
repeal.
This counterproductive and unnecessary tax is a
devastating cause of the dissolution of family businesses and farms in
America. The amount of revenue it generates each year barely covers one full
day of Washington spending. It discourages economic growth by
discouraging savings and capital accumulation. In fact, according to a study
by the Joint Economic Committee, it has reduced the amount of capital
stock in our economy by around $1.1 trillion since it was made
permanent in 1916.
As we look toward the next
100 days of the new Congress, I will continue to work with my
colleagues to pass legislation that will make our tax code simpler, flatter,
and fairer.
Donnelly College Receives NSF Grant for
STEM Program
Representative Yoder speaking at Donnelly Colleges press conference announcing
the details of its National Science Foundation grant for Project
S4.
Donnelly College announced on Friday that it has
received a National Science Foundation (NSF) award for Project S4
(Scholarships and Supports for STEM Success). The $619,800 grant will provide
scholarships for more than 50 students in underserved populations
pursuing majors in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(STEM).
Specifically, the grant will help recruit, retain and
graduate students working toward a Bachelor of Science in Information
Systems or an Associate of Science Degree in Biological or Physical
Science. Funding for Project S4 will allow Donnelly College to
strengthen its partnership with local STEM-related companies, allowing
graduates to take advantage of growing employment opportunities around the
metro area.
It is an honor to represent Donnelly College in
Congress. Donnelly College is a hidden gem with 84 percent of students
being the first generation of their family attending college, which made
Friday's event even more special as we discussed the National Science
Foundation award for this new STEM scholarship program.
Congratulations to Monsignor Swetland and everyone involved with this significant
award. It certainly fits Donnelly's mission of Transforming People,
Places and Spirits.
City of Overland Park
On Friday, I
visited with the City of Overland Park, KS Government to give an update on
whats going on in Washington, DC. We discussed our widening deficits
and mounting National Debt and how the GOP Congress is fighting to
get our fiscal house in order by passing a budget that balances within
ten years, working towards long-term tax reform while passing smaller
measures like the repeal of the Death Tax, and coming to an agreement
on a long-term highway funding bill that will ensure the solvency of
the highway trust fund without raising the gas
tax.
Special thanks to Mayor Carl Gerlach and the members of
the OP City Council for their leadership. Brooke and I are proud to
call Overland Park home and Im honored to represent this vibrant
community in Congress.
KCK Chamber of Commerce Congressional Forum
Its always a pleasure to address the Kansas City Kansas
Chamber of Commerces Congressional Forum, which hasn't missed a
monthly meeting in more than 40 years. On Friday, we discussed the
Administrations nuclear negotiations with Iran, the appropriations process
and my new role as Vice Chairman of the THUD Appropriations
Subcommittee, and the recently-passed House GOP budget that balances in less than
ten years without raising taxes.
We
also discussed the importance of increasing organ donation and
awareness, with April being Donate Life month. Recently, the American Society
of Transplantation presented me with their Legislator of the Year
Award for my work on advocating for increased liver
donation.
Floor Remarks
Honoring Victims of Overland Park Shooting
Click here to watch a video of Congressman Yoder's
remarks on YouTube.
On Monday, I spoke on the House
floor to honor the memory of Reat Underwood, William Corporon, and
Terri LaManno, the three people who were victims of a horrific shooting in
Overland Park one year ago.
Rather than divide the Overland
Park community, this hate-filled act of unspeakable violence has led
to love, faith, and kindness toward one another and has caused a
groundswell of unity to show that Overland Park is a place where members of
all faith communities can call home.
Fact of the Week
The Death Tax has reduced the amount of
capital stock in our economy by around $1.1 trillion since it was
made permanent in 1916.
