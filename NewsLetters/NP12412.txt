Dear Friends,
Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a great day to honor our veterans. For the last three years, my office has worked with local schools to make and deliver Valentine&rsquo;s cards for veterans. They never fail to put smiles on the faces of veterans. Here are a few examples of the creativity of San Mateo County elementary, middle school and high school students from this year:
Every February the Department of Veterans Affairs organizes the
National Salute to Veteran Patients , a week during which it calls on Americans to honor the brave men and women who have courageously served our country.
Please consider taking a moment of your time to make a valentine or card to send to a VA Hospital, visit a facility to thank the veterans who are being cared for there, or attend one of the
Valentines for Veterans concerts
as a part of the National Salute. The week of February 14 is full of opportunities to say thank you to these courageous men and women.

Let this Valentine&rsquo;s Day be a day of love, respect and honor.
Sincerely,
