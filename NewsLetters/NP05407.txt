Dear Friend,
Democrats are working hard to close the gap, but Republicans maintain an edge in the race to control the Senate. Nate Silver still gives the GOP a 55% chance of picking up the six seats they need.
Here in Massachusetts, Democrats up and down the ballot are working together to Get Out The Vote in November. Your support helps us build the ground game that will win our races. We have 39 hours to go until our FEC pre-general deadline hits, and we need to reach our $8O,OOO goal by then. Can you give $5 or more to help?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Despite what most people think, Democrats in Massachusetts don&rsquo;t make up the largest number of registered voters in our state. In fact, there are more unenrolled voters than Republicans and Democrats
put together.
We can&rsquo;t take anything for granted. Voters have a choice to make this November -- a Democratic Senate that works for the middle class, or a Tea Party Senate that would drag us straight back into the policies that caused the Great Recession. We have the ideas on our side. We have the infrastructure on the ground. Now, we have to raise the last $6,602 to reach our $8O,OOO goal before midnight tomorrow. Chip in $5, or more if you can.
Thank you for your support.
