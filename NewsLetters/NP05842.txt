Last Call for Congressional Veteran Commendation (CVC) Nominations
Nomination Deadline:
Friday, October 3, 2014
Dear Friends:
Our men and women in uniform provide the ultimate sacrifice for our nation which may often go without recognition. That is why I launched the Congressional Veteran Commendation (CVC); a program designed to honor distinguished veterans of the 33 rd
congressional district of Texas and preserve their stories for future generations.
As members of our community, you have the opportunity to honor exceptional service members for the 2014 CVC award.
The
deadline for nominations is this
Friday, October 3, 2014 .
Nominations must be mailed or hand-delivered to the Fort Worth or Dallas office locations by the deadline date.
Please be sure to read details information on the application and nomination process on my
website . For more information regarding the CVC and nomination process, please contact
Daniela.huerta@mail.house.gov
or call
214-741-1387 (Dallas) / 817-920-9086 (Fort Worth).
Help me honor our service members for their courage and patriotism.
Sincerely,
Marc Veasey
Member of Congress
