Investing in Education
Congressman
Langevin
at
South
Kingstown
HeadStart
Dear Friends,
With the holidays upon us, my nieces and nephew are already counting
down the days until school is out for winter break. But while they look
forward to getting out of school, I had the pleasure recently of going
back. My Back to School
tour started at Stony Lane Elementary School in North Kingstown and
ended at Davies Career-Tech High School in Lincoln, where I
congratulated students and teachers on their achievement as Blue Ribbon
schools for excellence. I read to pre-school students enrolled in
HeadStart. I toured alternative education programs like YearUp
Providence and the New England Laborers Academy. I saw young people
like Nick Lowinger of Gotta Have Sole making a difference in his
community. I met Rhode Island Teacher of the Year Patricia Page. I
spoke with college students at URI and Salve who are ready to step into
leadership roles in our state.
At every level of education, I was impressed by the talent and drive
that Rhode Island students possess.
Whenever I visit schools or meet with young people, I am reminded of my
own experiences. If not for the encouragement of passionate teachers, I
would not be where I am today. Of course, that passion must be paired
with adequate support and resources. If we as a society truly believe
in strengthening our education system - and we must - then we need to
put our money where our mouth is. An investment in education is an
investment in our economy, and I believe that supporting our schools,
educators and, most of all, students, is essential to Rhode Island's
long-term economic growth.
What do you think our students and educators need in order to be
successful? Share your thoughts via email
, Facebook
and Twitter
, and check out my YouTube
and Flickr
pages.
Sincerely,
Rep.

Once Upon a Blog
When I'm not in Washington, I am blessed with the opportunity to travel
the Second District, interacting one-on-one with constituents. The
challenges they face helps to shape my work in Congress. Their success
stories inspire positive change so that others may be successful. It is
an exciting evolution to watch and be a part of, and I enjoy sharing
those stories with others. On my website, you can now find a blog,
"Langevin Hits the Rhode," that allows me to share stories and
photographs with all of you. Check it out!
Congressman
Langevin
at
the
North
Kingstown
Veterans
Day
Parade
Home Sweet Home
The transition from military to civilian life is a challenging time for
our veterans, but we must make that transition as smooth as possible.
These men and women have done so much to protect our country and our
freedom, and it is our responsibility to return the favor. That is why
I introduced the Veterans Homebuyer Accessibility Act
to make it easier for veterans to purchase or modify homes.

Investing
in
Education
Dear
Friends,
With
the
holidays
upon
us,
my
nieces
and
nephew
are
already
counting
down
the
days
until
school
is
out
for
winter
break.
But
while
they
look
forward
to
getting
out
of
school,
I
had
the
pleasure
recently
of
going
back.
My
Back

tour
started
at
Stony

Elementary
School
in
North
Kingstown
and
ended
at
Davies
Career-Tech
High

in
Lincoln,
where
I
congratulated
students
and

on
their
achievement
as
Blue

enrolled

I
toured
alternative

programs
like
YearUp
Providence

I

young
people

Nick

Patricia
Page.
I
spoke
with
college
students
at
URI
and
Salve
who
are
ready

leadership
roles

At

I
was
impressed
by
the
talent
and
drive
that
Rhode

students

Whenever
I

my
own
experiences.
If
not

the

I
would
not
be
where
I

today.
Of

that

If

then
we
need
to
put

An

is
an

and
I

that
supporting
our

and,
most

long-term
economic
