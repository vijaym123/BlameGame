Reps. Lipinski and Quigley Lead Effort
to Improve
Rail Safety
Representatives Dan Lipinski (IL-3) and Mike
Quigley (IL-5) have introduced the Reassuring Adequate Investment in
Lifesaving Systems (RAILS) Act, which reauthorizes the Rail Safety
Technology Grant program to improve the safety of our nations
railroads.
Joined in support by Representatives Bobby Rush (IL-1), Danny
Davis (IL-7), Luis Gutierrez (IL-4), Tammy Duckworth (IL-8), and Robin
Kelly (IL-2), the bill provides $200 million for each of the next five
years for positive train control safety technologies, rail integrity
inspection systems, a system for electronic communication regarding
hazardous material rail shipments, and other new rail safety
items.
"Representing a
district that includes four commuter rail lines, Amtrak, and six of the
country's seven Class I freight railroads, I understand how important rail
safety is," said Rep. Lipinski.
"This bill dedicates funding
and resources to benefit the safety of millions of Americans as a key
part of the Chicagoland economy moves to modernize its safety systems to
comply with the positive train control requirement."
