Killing the Death Tax
Thursday the U. S.
House of Representatives passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of
2015. The death tax, also known as the estate tax, is a 40 percent
tax on an individuals transfer of assets in excess of an exemption
amount to the next generation at the time of his or her death. Typically,
this estate is a family farm or small business, and the death tax
bill punishes families for passing on these businesses to their
children. H.R. 1105 repeals the estate tax and the generation skipping
transfer tax for all future transfers to provide relief to
families.
Many small businesses and farms are a family
legacy passed down from one generation to the next. Unfortunately,
the government wants to cash in on that legacy when one family member
passes away, with taxes so large it causes many businesses to close
their doors. Families are already suffering from the loss of a loved one
and the government shouldnt be the cause of them losing their family
business too.
Additionally, I support
efforts to simplify the US Tax Code, such as the Fair Tax Act, and see the
death tax as an unnecessary double tax. Families already get taxed on
their businesses income, property, and purchases
it just doesnt
make sense to tax them all over again. Repealing the death tax is a
small step that can provide immense relief and support to our local,
family business. In keeping our community farms and businesses afloat, we
can help get the economy on track and help the legacy of our loved
ones live on.
