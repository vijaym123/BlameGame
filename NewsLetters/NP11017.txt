Dear Neighbor,
REED'S RURAL HOSPITAL, DIABETES PROGRAMS SECURED IN MEDICARE ACCESS LEGISLATION
Just yesterday the House passed, with my support, the
Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 . We were able to secure a number of victories in the bill including the extension of the
Medicare Dependent and Low Volume Hospital programs
supporting our rural hospitals and the
Special Diabetes Program
&ndash; both vital programs that care for our families. We have great partners in our local hospitals and diabetes groups that played large roles in getting these programs extended. Visit our website to see what
hospitals
and
diabetes
groups are saying about the programs.
REED TO WHITE HOUSE: BACK OFF ADDITIONAL CUTS TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE
The $300 billion in cuts Obamacare makes to Medicare Advantage is unfair and further jeopardizes access, affordable plans and threaten a program that more than 1.1 million New Yorkers rely on. The White House should back off any additional cuts to protect a proven, successful program for seniors. More on the Obamacare cuts to Medicare Advantage

TOM REED HIGHLIGHTS NEED TO REWARD WORKING POOR
I
spoke before the House Budget Committee
this week regarding welfare reform in the House Budget Resolution to lay out priorities to stand with the working poor. No longer can the amount of money spent or the number of programs administered be a measure of success. The fair, real measure of success is how many people we help out of poverty. To be successful, we have to require work and reward work.
Check out our
Facebook page
for more photos from the week including
American Diabetes Association Alert Day , our
healthcare innovation award , Capitol tour with Western NY
American Legion members
and more.
This week was
American Diabetes Association Alert Day
&ndash; we kicked off the day at the organization&rsquo;s advocacy breakfast to talk about the importance of diabetes research and treatment funding. As the Vice Chair of the Diabetes Caucus and the father of a son with diabetes, disease research is something very personal to me and we&rsquo;ll be a voice in Washington to stand up for diabetes research.
Best,
Tom
