Act Now to Stay Informed
I will soon only be able to send out eNewsletter updates to my
constituents who have signed up for them on my website. Congressional
rules restrict the ways in which I can communicate with my constituents
at certain periods during an election year. I want you to be informed

immigration, which may include executive orders. Sign up now at by

Closing Immigration Loopholes and Providing Resources to Address the
Crisis at the Border
On Friday, I voted in support of H.R. 5230, which includes policy
changes and provides funding to address the ongoing immigration crisis
at the border. The $659 million in funding is significantly below the
President's $3.7 billion request, focuses on immediate border security,
and is fully offset through cuts and recessions of existing funds
within various federal agencies. In approving H.R. 5230, the House took
an overdue step to enact policy changes and ensure our immigration
enforcement agencies have the resources they need to stem the tide of
immigrants illegally crossing our border. My constituents have been
calling for Congress and the President to take action in response to
this crisis. The House has now taken an important step and it is time
for the President and Senate Democrats to follow suit. It is critical
that we send a strong signal to anyone thinking of entering our country
illegally that they will be caught and returned back to their country
of origin. You can read more about the bill by clicking HERE

A recent article in the Valley News gave a good overview of the
legislation I introduced in response to the ongoing immigration crisis
at the border. You can read the article by clicking HERE

Better Health Care Access for Veterans
Rep. Calvert Talks About Veterans Issues at the Riverside County
Veterans' Advisory Committee breakfast.
On July 30, 2014, I voted in support of H.R. 3230, the Veterans' Access
to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act. Our
veterans deserve nothing less than timely, high quality health care and
the bill approved by the House today will help achieve that goal. There
is simply no excuse for the delays and incidents of poor treatment of
our veterans in VA medical centers. We need to provide a consistent,
world class health care treatment and benefits for all veterans across
the country. The bipartisan nature of the bill passed today signals the
unwavering support our veterans have in Congress. This bill provides
important health care options, outside the VA, while also investing to
improve our current VA system. You can read more about the bill by

Challenging Executive Overreach
On July 30, 2014, I voted for House Resolution 676, which authorizes
litigation to challenge the constitutionality of Executive Orders
issued by President Obama. I believe that our President continues to
turn the Constitution on its head by regularly overstepping the powers
granted to the Executive Branch. I took an oath to defend and uphold
the Constitution, which is exactly why I support the action taken by
the House today to challenge the President's executive orders. If the
President is not happy with the laws on the books or the steps being
taken by Congress, he needs to come to the table and work with the duly
elected members of the legislative branch to craft new laws. That's
simply how our democracy works. You can read more about the bill by

Common Sense ESA Reforms
On July 29, 2014, I voted in support of H.R. 4315, the Endangered
Species Transparency and Reasonableness Act. H.R. 4315 improves
Endangered Species Act (ESA) transparency, enhances the role of states,
and discourages harmful, frivolous litigation. Riverside County
continues to suffer economic harm because of the unintended
consequences of the ESA and regular lawsuits by environmental
extremists. When the ESA was first approved the goal was to protect
species, not to line the pockets of radical special interest groups and
their lawyers. Legislation, like H.R. 4315, that restores some common
sense to the application of our ESA law is long overdue. Protecting our
environment and growing our economy are not mutually exclusive goals.

Better

Access
for
Veterans
R ep.
Calvert
Talks
About
Veterans
Issues
at
the
Riverside
County
Veterans&#8217;
Advisory
Committee
breakfast.
On
July
30,
2014,
I
voted
in
support
of
H.R.
3230,
the
Veterans&#8217;
Access
to
Care
through
Choice,
Accountability,
and
Transparency
Act.
Our
veterans
deserve
nothing
less
than
timely,
high
quality
health
care
and
the
bill
approved
by
the
House
today
will
help
achieve
that
goal.
There
is
simply
no
excuse
for
the
delays
and
incidents
of
poor
treatment
of
our
veterans
in
VA
medical
centers.
We
need
to
provide
a
consistent,
world
class
health
care
treatment
and
benefits
for
all
veterans
across
the
country.
The
bipartisan
nature
of
the
bill
passed
today
signals
the
unwavering
support
our
veterans
have
in
Congress.
This
bill
provides
important
health
care
options,
outside
the
VA,
while
also
investing
to
improve
our
current
VA
system. You

Challenging
Executive
Overreach
On
July
30,
2014,
I
voted
for
House
Resolution
676,
which
authorizes
litigation
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
Executive
Orders
issued
by
President
Obama.
I
believe
that
our
President
continues
to
turn
the
Constitution
on
its
head
by
regularly
overstepping
the
powers
granted
to
the
Executive
Branch.
I
took
an
oath
to
defend
and
uphold
the
Constitution,
which
is
exactly
why
I
support
the
action
taken
by
the
House
today
to
challenge
the
President&#8217;s
executive
orders.
If
the
President
is
not
happy
with
the
laws
on
the
books
or
the
steps
being
taken
by
Congress,
he
needs
to
come
to
the
table
and
work
with
the
duly
elected
members
of
the
legislative
branch
to
craft
new
laws.
That&#8217;s
simply
how
our
democracy
works.

Common
Sense
ESA
Reforms
On
July
29,
2014,
I
voted
in
support
of
H.R.
4315,
the
Endangered
Species
Transparency
and
Reasonableness
Act.
H.R.
4315
improves
Endangered
Species
Act
(ESA)
transparency,
enhances
the
role
of
states,
and
discourages
harmful,
frivolous
litigation.
Riverside
County
continues
to
suffer
economic
harm
because
of
the
unintended
consequences
of
the
ESA
and
regular
lawsuits
by
environmental
extremists.
When
the
ESA
was
first
approved
the
goal
was
to
protect
species,
not
to
line
the
pockets
of
radical
special
interest
groups
and
their
lawyers.
Legislation,
like
H.R.
4315,
that
restores
some
common
sense
to
the
application
of
our
ESA
law
is
long
overdue.
Protecting
our
environment
and
growing
our
economy
are
not
mutually
exclusive
goals.
