Republican Israel Caucus Condemns Terrorist
Attack
Three Americans Among Innocent Lives Murdered During
Prayer
11/18/14
U.S. Representatives Leonard Lance (NJ-07), Peter
Roskam (IL-06) and Doug Lamborn (CO-05), co-chairs of the Republican
Israel Caucus, today released the following statement strongly condemning
the terrorist attack in Jerusalem:
We are appalled to learn that another heinous act of violence
has claimed more innocent lives in Israel.
The nature of this
attack - targeting peaceful, innocent civilians during their morning
prayers - is sickening and an affront to people of all faiths.
We
call on the international community to join in our outrage and
immediately condemn this act of terror and vow to bring the perpetrators to
justice.
