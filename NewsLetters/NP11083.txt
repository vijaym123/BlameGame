Dear friends,
Last week the Administration decided to delay the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) open enrollment deadline, yet again. Roughly two and a half weeks
ago, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was
asked during a committee hearing if the administration would extend the
deadline for enrollment past March 31st.
Her answer, "No, Sir."
Sounds like a deadline set in stone to me.
Unfortunately, they have moved the goal posts yet again for one reason;
they don't have the right demographic numbers for this program to be a
success. Is this any way to implement policy? Last year, HHS Secretary
Sebelius said they needed 7 million people to make the system viable.
If this figure was not met, there would not be enough people enrolled
and the costs of the insurance plans could be expected to increase,
further burdening Americans in 2015.
After I heard this, I came up with a bill called The Nullifying the
Unconstitutional Mandate by Evaluating Results (NUMBER) Act. The NUMBER
Act instructs the Comptroller General of the United States to certify
for Congress by June 1, 2014, the actual figures for those who fully
enrolled and selected a plan during the first open enrollment period
ending March 31st.
If 7 million people have not enrolled and selected
a plan during the open enrollment period, then the Affordable Care Act
would be fully repealed.
This clears the way for the better, GOP
Doctor-Patient centered alternative health plans, such as H.R. 3121 and
H.R. 2300.
The delays, regulatory revisions, and extensions are numerous and
troubling.
Health care for all Americans is important, but this one
size fits all approach is not the answer.
Using free market principles
and unleashing competition into the marketplace is the right approach
to fixing the health care system.
Sincerely,
Ted

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
friends,
Last
week
the
Administration
decided
to
delay
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
open
enrollment
deadline,
yet
again.
Roughly
two
and
a
half
weeks
ago,
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
Secretary
Kathleen
Sebelius
was
asked
during
a
committee
hearing
if
the
administration
would
extend
the
deadline
for
enrollment
past
March
31 st .
Her
answer,
&#8220;No,
Sir.&#8221;
Sounds
like
a
deadline
set
in
stone
to
me.
Unfortunately ,
they
have
moved
the
goal
posts
yet
again
for
one
reason ;
they
don&#8217;t
have
the
right
demographic
numbers
for
this
program
to
be
a
success.
Is
this
any
way
to
implement
policy?
Last
year ,
HHS
Secretary
Sebelius
said
they
needed
7
million
people
to
make
the
system
viable.
If
this
figure
was
not
met,
there
would
not
be
enough
people
enrolled
and
the
costs
of
the
insurance
plans
could
be
expected
to
increase,
further
burdening
Americans
in
2015.
After
I
heard
this,
I
came
up
with
a
bill
called
The
Nullifying
the
Unconstitutional
Mandate
by
Evaluating
Results
(NUMBER)
Act.
The
NUMBER
Act
instructs
the
Comptroller
General
of
the
United
States
to
certify
for
Congress
by
June
1,
2014,
the
actual
figures
for
those
who
fully
enrolled
and
selected
a
plan
during
the
first
open
enrollment
period
ending
March
31 st .
If
7
million
people
have
not
enrolled
and
selected
a
plan
during
the
open
enrollment
period,
then
the
Affordable
Care
Act
would
be
fully
repealed .
This
clears
the
way
for
the
better ,
GOP
Doctor-Patient
centered
alternative
health
plans ,
such
as
H.R.
3121
and
H.R.
2300 .
The
delays,
regulatory
revision s ,
and
extensions
are
numerous
and
troubling.
Health
care
for
all
Americans
is
important ,
but
this
one
size
fits
all
approach
is
not
the
answer.
Using
free
market
principles
and
unleashing
competition
into
the
marketplace
is
the
right
approach
to
fixing
the
health
care
system.
Sincerely,
Ted
