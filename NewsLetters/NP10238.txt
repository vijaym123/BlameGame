News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Just a quick update this week on a couple of things. First off, you may
have noticed the header image on this newsletter has changed. Our
community has been especially supportive of trying to raise awareness
about our current POW in Afghanistan, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Thousands of
our neighbors signed a petition recently calling on the United States
government to do everything possible to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home. I was
honored to be asked to deliver those petitions to Secretary of State
Kerry. To make a long story short, after weeks of no response from the
Secretary, he finally agreed to make one of his top deputies available
to receive them.
With everything going on in the world, it may be tough for some to keep
one individual right at the forefront of what they are trying to do.
But I can tell you as a military parent, that if it were my kid being
held captive by terrorists, I would want and I would expect that my
government would be doing every last thing possible to bring my son
home. So while I will continue trying to use the full weight of my
office to keep the pressure on in Washington, I also want to do my part
as a citizen to keep Bowe at the forefront of our minds. So we'll be
keeping his name on our masthead until he finally comes home to his
family.
In Washington-related news, Congress is set to return this week when we
will begin consideration of the first of the twelve (annual)
appropriations bills. It's been a long time since Congress actually
passed all twelve bills and that means, in other words, it's been a
long time since Congress actually sat down and looked at all of the
line items.
In short, the way the process is supposed to work, each chamber looks
at the President's budget request, then comes up with their own
proposed framework. Then the House and Senate get together and iron out
an agreement on a common set of top-line numbers. Those numbers then
dictate the spending caps for each appropriations bill. Once the caps
are set, the relevant committees roll up their sleeves and try to
allocate the available funds in the most intelligent way possible.
That's the way it's supposed to work.
The budget agreement that Congress reached before Christmas marked the
first time in four years that the Senate had even passed its own budget
and it also marked the first time a compromise set of caps had been set
into law. And since the House and Senate actually have agreed upon
top-line budget numbers set for the next fiscal year, the House is
going to take a crack at actually getting the entire job of budgeting
done - right down to the last line items in the last of the 12 bills.
So I'm proud of that and I'm forever hopeful that the Senate will
follow suit.
In any case, a lot remains to be seen, but that's the news for now. I
will definitely have more specifics to report later in the week. In the
meantime, I hope you all had a safe and restful weekend and please let
me know if there is anything I can do to be of service.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
Just
a
quick
update
this
week
on
a
couple
of
things.
First
off,
you
may
have
noticed
the
header
image
on
this
newsletter
has
changed.
Our
community
has
been
especially
supportive
of
trying
to
raise
awareness
about
our
current
POW
in
Afghanistan,
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl.
Thousands
of
our
neighbors
signed
a
petition
recently
calling
on
the
United
States
government
to
do
everything
possible
to
bring
Sgt.
Bergdahl
home.
I
was
honored
to
be
asked
to
deliver
those
petitions
to
Secretary
of
State
Kerry.
To
make
a
long
story
short,
after
weeks
of
no
response
from
the
Secretary,
he
finally
agreed
to
make
one
of
his
top
deputies
available
to
receive
them.
With
everything
going
on
in
the
world,
it
may
be
tough
for
some
to
keep
one
individual
right
at
the
forefront
of
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
But
I
can
tell
you
as
a
military
parent,
that
if
it
were
my
kid
being
held
captive
by
terrorists,
I
would
want
and
I
would
expect
that
my
government
would
be
doing
every
last
thing
possible
to
bring
my
son
home.
So
while
I
will
continue
trying
to
use
the
full
weight
of
my
office
to
keep
the
pressure
on
in
Washington,
I
also
want
to
do
my
part
as
a
citizen
to
keep
Bowe
at
the
forefront
of
our
minds.
So
we&#8217;ll
be
keeping
his
name
on
our
masthead
until
he
finally
comes
home
to
his
family.
In
Washington-related
news,
Congress
is
set
to
return
this
week
when
we
will
begin
consideration
of
the
first
of
the
twelve
(annual)
appropriations
bills.
It&#8217;s
been
a
long
time
since
Congress
actually
passed
all
twelve
bills
and
that
means,
in
other
words,
it&#8217;s
been
a
long
time
since
Congress
actually
sat
down
and
looked
at
all
of
the
line
items.
In
short,
the
way
the
process
is
supposed
to
work,
each
chamber
looks
at
the
President&#8217;s
budget
request,
then
comes
up
with
their
own
proposed
framework.
Then
the
House
and
Senate
get
together
and
iron
out
an
agreement
on
a
common
set
of
top-line
numbers.
Those
numbers
then
dictate
the
spending
caps
for
each
appropriations
bill.
Once
the
caps
are
set,
the
relevant
committees
roll
up
their
sleeves
and
try
to
allocate
the
available
funds
in
the
most
intelligent
way
possible.
That&#8217;s
the
way
it&#8217;s
supposed
to
work&#8230;
The
budget
agreement
that
Congress
reached
before
Christmas
marked
the
first
time
in
four
years
that
the
Senate
had
even
passed
its
own
budget
and
it
also
marked
the
first
time
a
compromise
set
of
caps
had
been
set
into
law.
And
since
the
House
and
Senate
actually
have
agreed
upon
top-line
budget
numbers
set
for
the
next
fiscal
year,
the
House
is
going
to
take
a
crack
at
actually
getting
the
entire
job
of
budgeting
done
&#8211;
right
down
to
the
last
line
items
in
the
last
of
the
12
bills.
So
I&#8217;m
proud
of
that
and
I&#8217;m
forever
hopeful
that
the
Senate
will
follow
suit.
In
any
case,
a
lot
remains
to
be
seen,
but
that&#8217;s
the
news
for
now.
I
will
definitely
have
more
specifics
to
report
later
in
the
week.
In
the
meantime,
I
hope
you
all
had
a
safe
and
restful
weekend
and
please
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
to
be
of
service.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
