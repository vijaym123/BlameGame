David, I really need to talk with you.
We&rsquo;re exactly 48 hours away from our final ad buy deadline of the election. I wish I could tell you we&rsquo;re close to hitting our goal, but the truth is we&rsquo;re $8,783 short.
Polls show our race in single digits, so we can&rsquo;t afford to miss this one- not with the election only 9 days away.
Can you help us close the gap? You can use this link to make a donation: http://action.cheribustos.com/48-hours
A gift of any amount helps, David.
I truly appreciate your support,
