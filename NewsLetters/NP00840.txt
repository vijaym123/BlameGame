Poll: Is TPP Good for most Oregonians?
Based on what you've heard so far, do you think the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) being negotiated in Congress right now would make
things better or worse for most Oregonians?

A Breakthrough on Toxic Chemicals
No parent should have to worry that their baby is being poisoned by the
carpet she's crawling on, or the containers her food is packaged in.
For twenty years, even as our understanding of health and science have
grown, potentially dangerous chemicals have remained virtually
unregulated, with our government unable to protect citizens from even
well-known dangerous chemicals in consumer products and food.
Recently, Jeff worked with his colleagues to produce a major
breakthrough in bipartisan negotiations on a toxic chemical reform bill
that could result in one of the most significant reforms of consumer
protection in decades. This proposal will allow federal regulators to
assess the risk and safety of commonly used chemicals and ensure that
states still have the ability to act to protect their citizens where
the federal government fails to act. The compromise Jeff negotiated
passed out of committee with a bipartisan majority.

Connecting Education to Careers
Going to school and earning a degree should open doors of opportunity -
but too often students aren't graduating with skills that help them get
jobs in today's economy.
Last week, Jeff announced an "education-to-jobs" package, introducing
two bills to strengthen middle-class opportunity by better connecting
students to careers after they graduate.
First, the BUILD Career and Technical Education Act will give local
school districts funds to rebuild and modernize career and technical
education programs, like shop classes, that were cut during the
recession. These classes will help connect students to in-demand
careers, such as skilled manufacturing jobs.
Second, the Protecting Students from Worthless Degrees Act will crack
down on unaccredited degree programs at for-profit colleges that
promise to prepare students for careers in specific fields, only to
leave them deeper in debt and unable to obtain the license they need to
work in that field.

Pushing the VA on Agent Orange
Recently, Jeff released a bipartisan letter urging the VA to ensure
that all veterans exposed to Agent Orange on post-Vietnam C-123 planes
are able to get the care and benefits they deserve. Jeff has been
pushing the VA for nearly four years to acknowledge veterans' claims,
and earlier this year, an Institute of Medicine study found that the
veterans had indeed been exposed to dangerous levels of dioxins.
Taking care of our service members is fundamental to who we are as a
nation. We must uphold our promise to those who wear the uniform and
fight for our country.
