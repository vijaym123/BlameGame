President Obamas Tax Hike
Fever
This past Tuesday, April 15 th , was
the deadline for filing federal and state income tax
returns.
The tax collectors bite from your income is already too big, but
it could have been worse.
Since he came to office, President
Obama has proposed a whopping 442
tax hikes !
Thats an average of one every 4
days!
I will continue to
oppose the Presidents relentless efforts to raise taxes on hard-working
Americans and small business.
Giving Credit Where
Credit is Due
I have not been reluctant to criticize
the Obama Administrations foreign policy when criticism is
merited.
When it does make a smart foreign policy decision, however, I
believe in giving credit where
credit
is
due.
I applaud the State Department for its decision to deny a visa
to Irans new representative to the United Nations.
Irans
selection of Hamid Abutalebi was a deliberate provocation by Iran.
He
is a self-confessed participant in the illegal seizure of the American
Embassy in Tehran in 1979, which was a direct violation of U.S.
national sovereignty, and of the 444-day-long hostage crisis that followed.
I am glad that we stood firm and have refused to let this
terrorist into the United States.
1,800 NJ
Families Lose Health Insurance Under Obamacare
President
Obama seems to think he only has to enforce the laws he chooses to
enforce, but one law even he cannot circumvent: the law of unintended
consequences.
As the
Star-Ledger
recently
reported , The Affordable Care Act
the federal law that mandates everyone have insurance
effectively
killed FamilyCare Advantage, a low-cost option for kids in New Jersey
created by the state six years ago for parents who earned too much to
qualify for Medicaid and other subsidized programs but too little to
buy on a policy on their own. The state program was the first of its
kind in the nation.
An estimated low income 1,800 families
who were enrolled in Family Care in New Jersey have lost health
insurance for their children because of the Obamacare mandates.
Overall, 800,000 people in New Jersey were informed late last year that even
if they liked their policies they wouldnt be able to keep them
because they didnt meet the Obamacare mandates.
The evidence
continues to mount that the Affordable Care Act is deeply flawed and will
continue to result in unintended consequences for the American
people.
Russia is Lying, Again and Again, About
Ukraine
As the Russian threat to Ukraines sovereignty continues
to grow, Russias total disregard for the truth in describing the
situation has even caught the
attention
of the
New York Times .
The
Times
quotes Lilia Shevtsova, an expert
on Russian politics at the Carnegie Moscow Center, who maintains that
the Putin government is even less concerned about the truth than the
old Soviet leaders were.
She said, We cant trust anything. Even
with the Soviet propaganda, when they were talking with the Soviet
people, there were some rules. Now, there are no rules at all. You can
invent anything.
The United States must stand with
Ukraine.
I urge the Administration to act on my March 24, 2014
request
to the President to give Ukraine Major Non-NATO
Ally status.
This would make available military supplies and
training.
I will continue to support robust American efforts to
assist Ukraine in defending itself and in putting pressure on Russia to
stop its reckless adventurism.

the
Washington Post

School Visits Convince Me the Future is
in Good Hands
This past week I visited four
schools around the 11 th
Congressional District to meet with
middle and high school students.
I shared with them my views on
current public policy issues and discussed with them their questions and
concerns.
The students asked lots of great questions and
shared a number of well-considered views on many of the important
challenges facing America, including job creation, health care, national
security, and personal privacy issues.
Clearly, these
young people already know a lot about our political system and
government.
The level of their interest and engagement convinces me that
the future will be in good hands when their generation comes of
age.
A Final Salute: Colonel Peter J. OHagan Jr.,
USMC-Ret. (1932-2014)
New Jersey lost one of its greatest
sons this week with the passing of Colonel Peter J. OHagan, Jr.
A proud Marine, a proud New Jerseyan, a public servant, and a
statesman, Pete OHagan did so much for his country, his state, his county,
and his community in his 81 years, as his
obituary
in the
Star-Ledger
reports.
I had the honor to deliver the eulogy at the Liturgy of Christian
Burial offered Thursday at The Church of the Assumption in
Morristown.
Pete was a dear friend and a great American and he will be
sorely missed.
Our deepest sympathy to his wife, Barbara, and his
children.
