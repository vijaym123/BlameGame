Memorial Day
Dear Friends
As you gather together to celebrate Memorial Day, I wanted to take this opportunity to honor the brave men and women who have served this country.
Last year, Rep. Murphy visited troops overseas
for Memorial Day as part of a bipartisan
Congressional delegation
Last year, I had the honor of visiting our troops who were serving this country overseas.
It was one of the highlights of my first term in office.
Every day, these brave soldiers put their lives on the line, and what amazed me at every stop was how they did so with tremendous honor and pride in the country. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to see the extraordinary work they are doing each and every day.
Its hard to imagine that so many have paid the ultimate price to protect this country that we all love.
As you gather with family and friends, please take a moment to remember not only those who have fallen, but also those family members whose loved ones have paid the ultimate price.
They are left to shoulder the burden here at home.
Thanks from a grateful nation for their loved ones' sacrifices will never be enough.
We cannot say thank you enough to the men and women who continue to serve this nation and their families who cant be with them on this holiday.
We stand ready to support you here at home when your service comes to an end.
Again, I wish you all a Happy Memorial Day, and please stay safe.
Sincerely,
Patrick
