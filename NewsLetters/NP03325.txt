Dear Friends,
Last week marked the beginning of a new Congress and the start to a hopefully productive year in Washington.
If theres one thing I have routinely heard across the Commonwealth, its that you want to see Congress work for you.
I was recently named
Vice Chairman of the Health Subcommittee .
Health care will continue to be a central part of the Congressional agenda and I am looking forward to working in this new capacity.
Working on the
21 st
Century Cures
initiative to find cures and treatments to some of our most deadly diseases, as well as finding ways to relieve Kentucky families from the burdens of Obamacare will be among my top priorities.
WEEK IN REVIEW
This week the House considered the
FY2015 Homeland Security Appropriations bill (H.R. 240) , which funded many vital agencies to keep our nation safe, including: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and the U.S. Secret Service.
H.R. 240 also included five critical amendments to defund President Obamas executive actions on amnesty.
I was proud to support these measures and efforts to ensure the president follows the Constitution.
This legislation is the first step toward fixing our broken immigration system.
This week the House also passed two regulatory reform bills.
H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act
will ensure that the Administration adopts the least costly method when implementing regulations.
H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act
is a package of 11 bipartisan proposals that make clarifications to the regulation-filled law known as Dodd-Frank.
Main Street businesses should not be treated the same as Wall Street, and this package ensures that wont happen.
LOOKING AHEAD
On Tuesday, January 20 th , President Obama will deliver his annual State of the Union address.
I hope this year he will refrain from challenging Congress with his pen and instead vow to work together to improve our nation.
There are many issues facing our country and by working together we can find commonsense solutions that will strengthen our economy and create more good-paying jobs.
