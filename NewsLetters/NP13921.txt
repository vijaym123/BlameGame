On November 27, 2013, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a
final rule
that would update payment policies and payment rates for services provided under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule on or after January 1, 2014.
Each year since 2002, the statutory method for determining the annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule, known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, has resulted in a reduction in the reimbursement rates.
And, each year Congress has passed bills to override the reductions.
In January of this year, Congress acted to delay the previously scheduled reduction of 26.5% in the Medicare reimbursement for physician services through December 31, 2013.
Now, if Congress does not act, CMS projected that the reduction in payment rates, based on the SGR formula, would be reduced by 20.1% for services in 2014.
Our current Medicare physician payment system is badly in need of reform.
Both the House
Ways and Means
and
Energy and Commerce
Committees have put forward legislation to repeal the current SGR formula, to create a stable system of payments to our doctors, and to maintain quality access to care for our nations seniors.
The way in which our doctors are reimbursed by Medicare is of absolute importance in maintaining a high level of accessible care for all patients.
It is my hope that Congress will act quickly not only to avert the scheduled payment reduction, but to enact a permanent solution to address the Medicare physician payment system.
Yours in service,
Randy
