Improving Veterans' Access To Care
Dear Friend,
Last week, I joined U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders, John McCain, Jeff Merkley, and Richard Burr to introduce
The Veterans&rsquo; Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 , bipartisan legislation to improve veterans&rsquo; access to health care and address serious problems facing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
After so many discouraging revelations of issues at the VA - including data released last week that revealed unacceptable wait times at VA centers in Virginia - I&rsquo;m heartened that my Democratic and Republican Senate colleagues came together and
swiftly passed
this bipartisan legislation.

I also took action to better understand the current situation facing Virginia veterans by requesting further information on all VA Medical Centers in Virginia as well as those in bordering states that often serve veterans from the Commonwealth.
In a
letter sent to the VA
last week with Senator Mark Warner, I requested information on each facility&rsquo;s current backlog, staff training needs, outreach to Virginia veterans currently awaiting care, and the role of private providers in veterans care. By increasing transparency and accountability, we can begin to address the serious issues plaguing the VA and ensure veterans receive the care they have earned.
If you need assistance obtaining information about services available to veterans or communicating with a federal agency in regard to veterans&rsquo; issues, my office can help. Click
