Should the United States continue trade relations with countries that
disregard globally-accepted standards of human rights?
YES - Maintaining global trade relations is more important than
upholding basic human rights
YES - We should continue trading, but we should also push for human
rights improvements
MAYBE - We should trade with some countries that violate human rights,
but not others
NO - We should not trade with any country that blatantly violates the
human rights of its people

I am pleased to announce the release of Vietnamese democracy activist
Nguyen Tien Trung, who was jailed by the Hanoi government in 2009 and
whom I adopted through the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission's
"Defending Freedoms Project." While I think this is a good step, the
government of Vietnam has a long way to go in respecting the
fundamental human rights of its own people, and I will continue
fighting to ensure that Trung is not the last person to be released
from unfair and unjust imprisonment in Vietnam.

Reminder: Coffee and Conversation on Saturday, April 26th
Please join me next Saturday at the Los Alamitos-Rossmoor Library for a
coffee and conversation about the critical issues that affect our
district.
To attend, RSVP to my Long Beach office at (562) 436-3828.
The Long Beach College Promise
On Monday, I had the pleasure of speaking at California State
University, Long Beach (CSULB) to honor the 6th anniversary of the Long
Beach College Promise Partnership, which I have helped champion, and to
receive the Inaugural College Promise Champion Award. One of the
manyhighlights of the event was when students and their parents spoke
about their own experiences in the program,
This innovative partnership is designed to improve college preparation,
access and completion for graduates of Long Beach Unified School
District (LBUSD). As part of the partnership, LBUSD graduates receive
guaranteed admission to CSULB or a Promise Scholarship to cover the
first semester enrollment fees at Long Beach City College. In order to
be eligible for the Tuition Free Semester at LBCC, students must
graduate from a local high school and enroll at LBCC the fall semester
immediately after graduation; and, in order to be guaranteed admission
to CSULB, students must meet the minimum CSU admission requirements,
which includes completing the "A - G" college entrance coursework in
high school.
A Reception for the Arts
On Wednesday night at the Long Beach Museum of Art, I was proud to
recognize the three winners of my Congressional Arts Competition,
including First Place Winner Alepsis Hernandez who submitted her work
"America for All." Here I am with Alepsis and her mother.
Cambodian Genocide Commemoration Day
Last night, I joined with the Cambodian community in Long Beach to
remember the Cambodian genocide and the Khmer Rouge regime (killing
fields) More than 2 million Cambodians lost their lives.
It was an honor to be the keynote speaker and to remember
those who
fought, those who resisted, those who survived, and those who perished.
As a child, I remember seeing the effects of the Holocaust on my family
and my community; I remember the heartache, and I remember the strength
and perseverance of my family and community. As a Jew I can say with no
hesitation that I understand our responsibility to never forget.
Earlier this year, I introduced a resolution on the floor of the House
of Representatives to mark the 35th Anniversary of the Cambodian
Genocide.
I encourage you to learn more about my resolution by following this
link: http://1.usa.gov/1hTjhNO
We must never forget the tragedy of the Cambodian Genocide.
Last week, I spoke once again on the House floor to highlight a study
by researcher, former director of the Los Angeles County Museum of
Natural History, and member of the National Science Board Dr. James
Powell that highlights the overwhelming consensus among the scientific
community that humans have significantly contributed to climate change.

Rep. Paul Ryan's Budget
Last week, the House voted on Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal. His
proposal establishes the budget for the United States Government for
fiscal year 2015 and sets forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal
years 2016 through 2024.
I voted "no" on this proposed budget because it proposes drastic cuts
to many of our nation's essential programs, such as education, public
safety, and medical research. The Ryan Budget gets 69 percent of its
cuts from programs benefiting our most vulnerable Americans, including
programs such as Medicaid, SNAP (formerly food stamps), and Pell Grants
for low and moderate income students. Furthermore, the Ryan budget cuts
an additional $385 billion from many mandatory programs for low- and
moderate-income Americans, such as Supplemental Security Income for the
elderly and disabled, the school lunch and child nutrition programs,
and the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits for lower-income working
families. This budget would be devastating to working families.
Unfortunately, it passed the House by a vote of 219 to 205. It now
resides in the Senate where it awaits further analysis, debate, and a
vote.
The CIA's Interrogation Program
Earlier last week, I joined Congressman Adam Schiff in sending a letter
to President Obama about declassifying the Senate report on the Central
Intelligence Agency's interrogation program during the War on Terror.
Here is brief excerpt from the letter:
"Together we stand, as we know you do, for the proposition that our
nation should set an example for the world in humane treatment of
detainees and abiding by the rule of law. Part of that commitment means
acknowledging times when we failed to live up to our values and our
laws, even when doing so is uncomfortable. We urge you to take this
opportunity to cast some new light on a dark period in our history. The
sooner the summary of the report and its findings are made public in
their entirety, the sooner we can move on from this unfortunate chapter
in our history."

Hill: http://bit.ly/1qox0hM
"Concurrent Resolution"
A concurrent resolution is a legislative proposal, such as Rep. Paul
Ryan's budget proposal I mentioned above, that requires the approval of
both houses of Congress. Concurrent resolutions do not require the
signature of the President, nor do they have the force of law. Such
legislation serves to express the opinions of both the House of
Representatives and the Senate. Not only can concurrent resolutions be
used to express opinions on legislative proposals, but they can alsobe
used to convey congratulations to another country. For example a
concurrent resolution can be used to congratulate a country on the
anniversary of their independence.
Should the House extend emergency unemployment insurance for the
long-term unemployed through the end of May?
44.9%
YES - Millions of long-term out-of-work Americans are counting
on Congress to extend emergency unemployment insurance
14.1%
MAYBE - The House should consider a different piece of
legislation that helps long-term out-of-work Americans
38.5%
NO - Congress should not extend emergency unemployment insurance
for the millions of long-term out-of-work Americans
2.6%

Rep.
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
Budget
Last
week,
the
House
voted
on
Rep.
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
proposal.
His
proposal
establishes
the
budget
for
the
United
States
Government
for
fiscal
year
2015
and
sets
forth
appropriate
budgetary
levels
for
fiscal
years
2016
through
2024.
I
voted
&#8220;no&#8221;
on
this
proposed
budget
because
it
proposes
drastic
cuts
to
many
of
our
nation&#8217;s
essential
programs,
such
as
education,
public
safety,
and
medical
research.
The
Ryan
Budget
gets
69
percent
of
its
cuts
from
programs
benefiting
our
most
vulnerable
Americans,
including
programs
such
as
Medicaid,
SNAP
(formerly
food
stamps),
and
Pell
Grants
for
low
and
moderate
income
students.
Furthermore,
the
Ryan
budget
cuts
an
additional
$385
billion
from
many
mandatory
programs
for
low-
and
moderate-income
Americans,
such
as
Supplemental
Security
Income
for
the
elderly
and
disabled,
the
school
lunch
and
child
nutrition
programs,
and
the
Earned
Income
and
Child
Tax
Credits
for
lower-income
working
families.
This
budget
would
be
devastating
to
working
families.
Unfortunately,
it
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
219
to
205.
It
now
resides
in
the
Senate
where
it
awaits
further
analysis,
debate,
and
a
vote.
The
CIA&#8217;s
Interrogation
Program
Earlier
last
week,
I
joined
Congressman
Adam
Schiff
in
sending
a
letter
to
President
Obama
about
declassifying
the
Senate
report
on
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency&#8217;s
interrogation
program
during
the
War
on
Terror.
Here
is
brief
excerpt
from
the
letter:
&#8220;Together
we
stand,
as
we
know
you
do,
for
the
proposition
that
our
nation
should
set
an
example
for
the
world
in
humane
treatment
of
detainees
and
abiding
by
the
rule
of
law.
Part
of
that
commitment
means
acknowledging
times
when
we
failed
to
live
up
to
our
values
and
our
laws,
even
when
doing
so
is
uncomfortable.
We
urge
you
to
take
this
opportunity
to
cast
some
new
light
on
a
dark
period
in
our
history.
The
sooner
the
summary
of
the
report
and
its
findings
are
made
public
in
their
entirety,
the
sooner
we
can
move
on
from
this
unfortunate
chapter
in
our
history.&#8221;

&#8220;Concurrent
Resolution&#8221;
A
concurrent
resolution
is
a
legislative
proposal,
such
as
Rep.
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
proposal
I
mentioned
above,
that
requires
the
approval
of
both
houses
of
Congress.
Concurrent
resolutions
do
not
require
the
signature
of
the
President,
nor
do
they
have
the
force
of
law.
Such
legislation
serves
to
express
the
opinions
of
both
the
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate.
Not
only
can
concurrent
resolutions
be
used
to
express
opinions
on
legislative
proposals,
but
they
can
alsobe
used
to
convey
congratulations
to
another
country.
For
example
a
concurrent
resolution
can
be
used
to
congratulate
a
country
on
the
anniversary
of
their
independence.
