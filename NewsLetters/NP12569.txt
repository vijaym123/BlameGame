Winter Storm Emergency
Dear Friend,
This week's severe winter weather in Southeastern Pennsylvania has
resulted in record power outages, service disruptions and treacherous
travel conditions across our region. I wanted to share the following
resources that can help you and your family cope with the storm and its
aftermath as safely as possible.
As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 500,000 homes and businesses in
our region had lost power at some point. You can check the status of
your area or report an outage through PECO
During winter storms and extreme cold, it is important to have a family
communication plan in place as well as other precautionary measures
such as emergency first aid kits. The Ready.Gov website
provides a variety of tools and resources for
keeping safe, including how to make a plan, winterize your vehicle and
home, build an emergency kit, and get involved in your community.
The following local resources provide information about community alert
systems, utilities, and emergency responders and shelters:
