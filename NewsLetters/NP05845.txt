Welcome to the
Guide to Grants!
I am honored to represent the 7 th
Congressional District of Alabama.
One of the most important responsibilities as your representative is to provide you with information about funding opportunities. Now more than ever, grant opportunities are vital to the success of our local governments, organizations and other entities. This weekly guide will identify federal and foundation grant opportunities to assist you in goals for our communities. This Guide will include links to grant writing resources to help you make your proposals more successful. This Guide will also describe new funding opportunities for economic development, infrastructure, healthcare and educational projects as example. In addition, I am pleased to provide a Letter of Support for grant application projects in the 7th Congressional District of Alabama. Please let us know when grants are awarded, especially if you found the opportunities in the
Guide to Grants .
