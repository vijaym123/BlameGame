A Step Toward Improving VA Care
Wednesday, July 2, 2014
Dear Friend,
One of my most important responsibilities as your Congressman is to help veterans and their families obtain the medical services and benefits they have earned and deserve. To that end, I have found the recent news of delays and backlogs at the Department of Veterans Affairs to be appalling and unacceptable. Subsequent investigations of this matter have revealed that one of many causes of the delays in care for veterans is the acute shortage of doctors, nurses and medical staff at VA facilities. These shortages have led to larger caseloads for doctors and increased wait times for our veterans.
That&rsquo;s why I joined two of my colleagues last week to introduce the
Doctors&rsquo; Education Loans Impact VA Employee Retention (DELIVER) Act , which would help improve the recruitment and retention of doctors, nurses and other medical staff at VA medical facilities. The DELIVER Act would expand loan repayment programs and make it easier for VA employees to pay back crippling higher education loans, thus ensuring the VA can attract and retain high-quality medical professionals who might otherwise choose to work in the private sector. While this legislation alone will not resolve the backlogs and delays that are rampant in the VA system, it is a commonsense first step toward ensuring that our VA medical facilities are fully staffed and able to retain
the best and brightest medical professionals to give our nation&rsquo;s veterans the highest standard of care.
I will continue to work on behalf of our veterans and their families in Congress to make sure they are receiving the timely and quality medical services that they deserve. As always, if you or someone you know is in need of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my Peabody office at (978) 531-1669.
Sincerely,
John F. Tierney
Member of Congress
