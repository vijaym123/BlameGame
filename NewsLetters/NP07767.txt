Volkswagen to Invest
Over $600 Million, Create 2,000 New Jobs in
Chattanooga
Senator Corker was in Wolfsburg, Germany, on Monday as
Volkswagen announced that the company will build its midsize sports
utility vehicle (SUV) and create a first-of-its-kind research and
development center in Chattanooga, a more than $600 million investment in the
region, which will add 2,000 new jobs at the
plant.

Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam and Senator
Corker celebrate Volkswagens expansion announcement at the Hunter Museum
in Chattanooga (Hamilton County).
Corker
delivered remarks
at the announcement in Germany and
released the following statement:
I deeply appreciate
Volkswagens significant long-term commitment to the hometown and state that
I love, said Corker. I am grateful for Governor Haslams steady
leadership, for our mayors, our great community leaders and the workers at
the Chattanooga plant, whose commitment to excellence helped pave the
way for todays announcement. Finally, I am thankful to be able to
help see this through to todays conclusion.
One of the
most meaningful days in my public service career occurred six years ago
when I received the call from the Volkswagen board room that they had
chosen Chattanooga, added Corker. Todays announcement is a similar
high point, as VWs significantly expanded presence means that
thousands of more families will benefit from the good paying jobs being
created at the plant.
On Tuesday, Corker, Tennessee Governor
Bill Haslam, Senator Lamar Alexander and Volkswagen executives, along
with other civic and government officials, celebrated the expansion
announcement in Chattanooga at the Hunter Museum.

around 7:00.
On CNBCs Squawk Box on
Thursday, Corker said Volkswagens announcement is a huge win for
Chattanoogans and Tennesseans.
[Volkswagens expansion] is a
huge win, 2,000 jobs directly impacting Chattanoogans and Tennesseans,
and again establishing Tennessee as the place of auto manufacturing in
our nation, said Corker. The path we took, while I know the nation
watched and, you know, it was a bit controversial, there was no other
way to get to this place without taking the path we took Im very happy
for those 2,000 families that are going to be so directly
affected.

Tennesseans Continue to See
Double Digit Health Care Cost
Increases
Senator Corker released the following statement on Friday regarding
reports
that three of the companies offering
insurance policies in the federal health care marketplace in Tennessee have
requested to raise rates for their exchange plans in
2015:
My heart goes out to the many families and business owners across
the state coping with rising health care costs, and Im hopeful the
Senate might finally be allowed to debate ways to provide relief from
the damaging effects of this law, including solutions to free up the
marketplace so affordable plans that meet the actual needs of Tennesseans
can openly and effectively compete for their business, said Corker.
The presidents health care bill was sold to Tennesseans and the
country as a way to bring down health care costs, yet it has done just the
opposite as we continue to see double digit increases in the cost of
plans.
BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee (BCBST)
the
only health insurance provider to offer a policy in all 95 Volunteer
State counties in 2014
is requesting to raise rates by an average of
19 percent for its exchange plans in 2015. Cigna is requesting an
average rate increase of 7.5 percent, and Humana has requested to raise
rates by an average of 14.4 percent. During the health care laws 2014
open enrollment period, 88 percent of Tennesseans chose a BCBST health
insurance plan.
President Obama Should Personally Engage on DRC Adoption
Delays
In a
letter
to President
Barack Obama last week, Senator Corker joined 167 members of Congress in
asking the president for his personal engagement to resolve over 900
international adoption cases of Congolese children who either have been
or are in the process of being adopted by American families, yet who
are unable to obtain Congolese exit permits due to a suspension in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
We
respectfully request that you raise this human rights crisis with President
Kabila prior to his attendance at the U.S.-African Leaders Summit next
month, and then use the opportunity of the summit to press for a firm
resolution, wrote the members of Congress. We would appreciate your
leadership on this issue to help unite these children and their
families.
In September 2013, the DRC suspended the issuance of
exit permits for children adopted by foreign parents. Over 145 children
who have been legally adopted by U.S. families and have been given
Congolese passports and U.S. visas await exit letters, including several
children with urgent, life-threatening medical
problems.
Advocacy groups indicate at least 23 families in the Volunteer State
are affected by the DRCs halt on adoptions. Corker has met with several
Tennessee families in various stages of the adoption process and
continues to work towards a solution that will bring the children home to
the United States. Corkers staff has also met with State Department
officials, including the U.S. ambassador to the DRC and the DRCs
ambassador to the U.S., to discuss a resolution to this
issue.
Corker is a cosponsor of a
resolution
authored
by Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) calling on the DRC to resume the exit
letter process that has been stalled for nearly a year. In April,
Corker
wrote
to the president and prime minister of
the DRC to request an end to delays in processing adoptions. As of
today, there has been no response from the Congolese
government.
June 25, 2014
Senator Corker meets with Tennessee families
in Washington to discuss delays in U.S. adoptions from the
DRC.

graduate of Tennessee Technological University, will depart for the
International Space Station in September and will begin serving as
commander for Expedition 42 in November.
