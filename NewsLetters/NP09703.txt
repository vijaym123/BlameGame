Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
As we celebrate Mother's Day, I'm reminded of the huge contribution
that mothers across the Sixth District make. I am so grateful to my
mother for always encouraging me in my pursuits. I am also grateful to
my wife Carol, who is a source of constant support and a wonderful
mother to our two girls, Eleanor and Mary Clay.
Bringing Bath County Common Sense to Washington, DC
Remember when the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. decided that Bath
County, Kentucky should be considered "non-rural?" Well, last week, the
entire U.S. House of Representatives sent them a message that
government bureaucrats don't always know best. And they certainly don't
know our local communities better than we do.
My legislation, H.R. 2672, the HELP Rural Communities Act, is a simple,
pragmatic, and bipartisan solution which says that if federal
bureaucrats are going to impose different rules based on the localized
characteristics of an area, then they actually need to listen to the
input of people in the community who know its characteristics.
I am pleased that every Member of the House agreed with how logical
this legislation is and supported its immediate passage by unanimous
voice vote.

Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Congressional Bourbon
Resolution
I was glad to join Congressman John Yarmuth in introducing a resolution
commemorating the 50th anniversary of Congress officially codifying
Bourbon's status as a distinctive product of the United States of
America. As the Lithuanian Ambassador remarked while he toured some of
Kentucky's finest distilleries a few months ago, Bourbon is the "drink
of freedom."
We thank all of the hardworking men and women in the Commonwealth who
make this uniquely American spirit such a great product, and we will
continue working to promote Kentucky's signature Bourbon industry.

Kentuckians in the Capitol
I truly enjoyed speaking with the bright and energetic students from
Sts. Peter and Paul School and Seton Catholic School. It is always fun
to take their questions and share with students some behind-the-scenes
stories, as well as explain my duties and how much I enjoy coming to
Washington to advocate on behalf of Kentucky.
I had a productive conversation with representatives of public and
school libraries from throughout the Commonwealth, including Mr. Wayne
Onkst, Kentucky's State Librarian, on how the federal government can
better support library operations, educational programs, and expand
access to technology for our communities and school children.
Thanks to Joe Westbrook, Owner, GM, Snapflo Inc. for coming to
Washington to share how Obamacare, and its Kentucky counterpart,
Kynect, is harming his business and the families he employs.
I was happy to talk to Rev. Kenneth J. Gophin, president of the
Kentucky Council of Churches, about our moral duty to help those less
fortunate than ourselves.
I was happy to welcome the Kentucky Hospital Association to Washington
and am thankful for their insight into our healthcare system and the
challenges facing health care providers.
I enjoyed meeting with Dr. Marian Swope from UK and other
representatives from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry about necessary reforms to our mental health system.
It was great to see Dr. Bill Gee of Lexington again and to discuss the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Transparency and Accountability
Act.
It was nice to meet with Steve Shannon of Lexington again to hear about
Community Mental Health Centers and the services they provide in our
community.
It was a pleasure speaking with Enrolled Agents from Kentucky,
including Bill Farmer of Lexington, about needed reforms to our
labyrinthine tax system.
I had a great visit with Bob Leer of Bourbon County, who is a local
expert on rearing and maintaining sheep herds. Mr. Leer and I had a
great conversation about protecting local livestock, and growth
opportunities for the sheep industry in central and eastern Kentucky.
It was great to meet Rod Polk of Nicholasville and other members of the
Allergy and Asthma Network to speak about the regulations governing the
treatment of patients with allergies and asthma.
It was great to see Dr. Anjum Bux, Dr. Kevin Hatton, Dr. Regina
Fragneto, and Dr. Brandon Gish to discuss healthcare, reimbursement,
and regulatory issues that anesthesiologists currently face.
I enjoyed a lively conversation with Kentucky craft brewers, including
Daniel Harrison, Owner of Country Boy Brewing, about their remarkable
success as up-and-comers in the beer industry. We discussed the central
Kentucky craft brew scene and how Washington can get out of the way and
allow this growth industry to flourish and create jobs.
Thank you to Ralph Bouvette, Robert McFalls, Cathy Hanna, and Thomas
Hanna for stopping by our office and sharing the issues that are
currently facing community pharmacies in our Commonwealth.
Fighting for Answers for the Families of the Benghazi Terrorist Attack
Victims
It has been almost two years since a terror attack claimed the lives of
four brave Americans in Benghazi:?Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens,
U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, former
Navy Seal Glen Doherty, and former Navy Seal and Bronze Star Recipient
Tyrone Woods.
I have been a vocal supporter of uncovering the truth behind what
happened on that tragic day because the American people, and especially
the families of those killed, deserve answers.
Over a year ago, I signed on as a co-sponsor of a resolution calling
for the creation of a select investigative committee to conduct an
inquiry find out what happened at the American consulate in Benghazi,
Libya on the night of September 11th, 2012. On Thursday, with my
support, the House passed a resolution to create such a committee.
Bringing justice to those who perpetrated this wanton act of violence
against our countrymen should not be a partisan issue. It is my hope
that this committee will shine a light on that dark day and bring
justice for four American patriots and their loved ones.
Demanding Accountability from Our Government
On Wednesday, I voted to hold former Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to comply
with the investigation into the IRS targeting organizations based on
group names and political ideologies, and called on Attorney General
Eric Holder to investigate wrongdoing at the IRS.
I will continue working to bring much-needed accountability to the IRS
because the American people deserve a government they can trust. The
only way to rebuild this trust is to investigate exactly how these
abuses occurred and to ensure they never happen again.
Around the District
Thank you to Dr. Augusta Julian, President of Bluegrass Community and
Technical College (BCTC), and her team for taking the time to show me
around their new campus on Newtown Pike on Monday. The continued growth
at BCTC-Lexington is a reflection of the need and excitement that
Central Kentuckians have for job skills education.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

Thank you and have a great week!

Report
De ar
Friend,
As
we
celebrate
Mother&#8217;s
Day,
I&#8217;m
reminded
of
the
huge
contribution
that

the
Sixth

I

and
a
wonderful
mother
to
our

Kentuckians
in
the
Capitol
I
truly
enjoyed
speaking
with
the
bright
and
energetic
students
from
Sts.
Peter
and
Paul
School
and
Seton
Catholic
School.
It
is
always
fun
to
take
their
questions
and
share
with
students
some
behind-the-scenes
stories,
as
well
as
explain
my
duties
and
how
much
I
enjoy
coming
to
Washington
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
Kentucky.
I
had
a
productive
conversation
with
representatives
of
public
and
school
libraries
from
throughout
the
Commonwealth,
including
Mr.
Wayne
Onkst,
Kentucky&#8217;s
State
Librarian,
on
how
the
federal
government
can
better
support
library
operations,
educational
programs,
and
expand
access
to
technology
for
our
communities
and
school
children.
Thanks
to
Joe
Westbrook,
Owner,
GM,
Snapflo
Inc.
for
coming
to
Washington
to
share
how
Obamacare,
and
its
Kentucky
counterpart,
Kynect,
is
harming
his
business
and
the
families
he
employs.
I
was
happy
to
talk
to
Rev.
Kenneth
J.
Gophin,
president
of
the
Kentucky
Council
of
Churches,
about
our
moral
duty
to
help
those
less
fortunate
than
ourselves.
I
was
happy
to
welcome
the
Kentucky
Hospital
Association
to
Washington
and
am
thankful
for
their
insight
into
our
healthcare
system
and
the
challenges
facing
health
care
providers.
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
Dr.
Marian
Swope
from
UK
and
other
representatives
from
the
American
Academy
of
Child
and
Adolescent
Psychiatry
about
necessary
reforms
to
our
mental
health
system.
It
was
great
to
see
Dr.
Bill
Gee
of
Lexington
again
and
to
discuss
the
U.S.
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
Transparency
and
Accountability
Act.
It
was
nice
to
meet
with
Steve
Shannon
of
Lexington
again
to
hear
about
Community
Mental
Health
Centers
and
the
services
they
provide
in
our
community.
It
was
a
pleasure
speaking
with
Enrolled
Agents
from
Kentucky,
including
Bill
Farmer
of
Lexington,
about
needed
reforms
to
our
labyrinthine
tax
system.
I
had
a
great
visit
with
Bob
Leer
of
Bourbon
County,
who
is
a
local
expert
on
rearing
and
maintaining
sheep
herds.
Mr.
Leer
and
I
had
a
great
conversation
about
protecting
local
livestock,
and
growth
opportunities
for
the
sheep
industry
in
central
and
eastern
Kentucky.
It
was
great
to
meet
Rod
Polk
of
Nicholasville
and
other
members
of
the
Allergy
and
Asthma
Network
to
speak
about
the
regulations
governing
the
treatment
of
patients
with
allergies
and
asthma.
It
was
great
to
see
Dr.
Anjum
Bux,
Dr.
Kevin
Hatton,
Dr.
Regina
Fragneto,
and
Dr.
Brandon
Gish
to
discuss
healthcare,

issues
that
anesthesiologists
currently
face.
I
enjoyed
a

with
Kentucky
craft
brewers,
including
Daniel
Harrison,
Owner
of
Country
Boy
Brewing,
about
their
remarkable
success
as
up-and-comers
in
the
beer
industry.
We
discussed
the
central
Kentucky
craft
brew
scene
and
how
Washington
can
get
out
of
the
way
and
allow
this
growth
industry
to
flourish
and
create
jobs.
Thank
you
to
Ralph
Bouvette,
Robert

and
Thomas

for
stopping
by

sharing
the

with
my

the

On
Wednesday,
I
voted
to
hold
former

(IRS)
official
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
her
refusal
to
comply
with
the
investigation
into
the
IRS
targeting
organizations
based
on
group
names
and
political
ideologies,
and
called
on
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
to
investigate
wrongdoing
at
the
IRS.
I
will
continue
working
to
bring
much-needed
accountability
to
the
IRS
because
the
American
people
deserve
a
government
they
can
trust.
The
only
way
to
rebuild
this
trust
is
to
investigate
exactly
how
these
abuses
occurred
and
to
ensure
they
never
happen
again.
