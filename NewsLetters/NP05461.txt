Congressman
Lamborn Expresses Ebola Concerns to the Secretary of
Defense
10/15/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn sent the following
letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel regarding the Fort Carson
military response to the Ebola threat.
Text of Letter
Dear Secretary
Hagel,
As you know, the President has announced that he is has
launched Operation United Assistance which will send over 3,000 military
personnel to west Africa to help fight the Ebola outbreak. I have
since learned that about 160 Army engineers from the 52 nd
Engineer Battalion at Ft. Carson are being deployed to support this
effort. While I am very concerned about the Ebola outbreak, I do have
some concerns regarding this deployment. I would appreciate a timely
response on the following questions:
What is being
done to ensure the physical security and biosecurity of our men and
women in uniform who are being sent into harms way?
What measures are being put into place by the
Defense Health Agency to prepare for caring for servicemembers who
are exposed to or infected by
Ebola?
When is the 52 nd
Engineer Battalion expected
to deploy and when will they
return?
What is being done to ensure that returning military
personnel do not unintentionally expose their family, friends or
communities to Ebola upon their return?
How long do you expect this mission to last, and when will it be
transferred to non-military agencies within the U.S.
government?
Have DOD medical personnel
received adequate training to identify and care for potential cases of
Ebola?
Is Evans Army Hospital
prepared and equipped to deal with potential Ebola
cases?
Mr. Secretary, I look forward to your
prompt response to these questions. I also request that you provide a
senior representative from the Department of Defense or the U.S. Army to
participate in a public forum that I am organizing regarding
preparations for Ebola in the Colorado Springs
community.
Thank you for your service.
