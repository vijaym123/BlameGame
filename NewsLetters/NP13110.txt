Dear
Friends,
Many of you have been affected by the chemical
spill and water emergency in the Kanawha Valley, and I'd like to update
you on my efforts to get answers as to how this spill occurred and what
we can do to prevent such a spill from happening again.
As
a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I
have asked Chairman Bill Shuster to hold a field hearing in Charleston
on the chemical spill and response. Im pleased that Chairman Shuster
has agreed to hold this hearing, and a date and a witness list will
be released in the coming weeks.
I have also asked the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control to explain whether pregnant women should
drink the water in the Kanawha Valley.
It is particularly
concerning that as many as 150,000 people who had been under a Do Not
Use water order were told that their water supply was safe for use
before the CDCs recommendation that pregnant women should consider an
alternate drinking water source. We are deeply disappointed in the CDC
for recommending a screening level before receiving all relevant studies
and information, which has resulted in confusion, fear and mistrust
among Kanawha Valley residents, I wrote in a letter to CDC Director
Thomas Frieden, also signed by Sen. Joe Manchin.

to read our letter to the
CDC.
I want to thank the West Virginia National Guard,
the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security, FEMA,
first responders and many, many volunteers in West Virginia and
neighboring states for banding together to help provide clean water to
residents in need. We joined together to meet this challenge and
have exemplified once again that Mountaineer spirit for which
our state is so well known.

BENGHAZI
REPORT
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a
report this week on the consulate attack in Benghazi, saying
the attack was preventable .
The
report offers several noteworthy
conclusions:
Security and assistance was insufficient leading up to the
attack
Military and security responses were delayed, hindered and
consequently ineffective
The administration, State
Department and the intelligence community were disorganized and unclear in
responding to the attack's aftermath.
I applaud the
Senate Intelligence Committee for producing such a detailed,
well-researched report and hope it will help us prevent a future attack on
Americans serving overseas.
Though the report is lengthy, I
encourage you to read it for yourself.
Please click here to read the report.
