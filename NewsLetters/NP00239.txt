Dear Friends,
June marks the start of summer - a time when Delawareans and folks from
across the country flock to our state's pristine 5-star beaches and
outdoor spaces. As we prepare to enjoy all that summer has to offer,
it's important to remember that June also marks the start of the
Atlantic hurricane season.
Delawareans have witnessed first-hand how destructive severe tropical
weather can be. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy, forced evacuations across
the state and inflicted tens of billions of dollars in damage to our
neighboring communities along the East Coast. Superstorm Sandy reminded
us of the threats associated with living in the lowest-lying coastal
state - and why it's so important that we prepare for hurricane-related
hazards.
In Delaware, even communities miles inland from the coast can
experience the threat of powerful winds, rainfall and flooding when
hurricanes or severe storms hit. Here are some tips to remember during
hurricane season:
Prepare. Learn more about the potential hurricane-related hazards in
your area from wind, rainfall and flooding. Assess potential flooding
risks nearby and learn accessible evacuation routes for your family and
community.
Plan. Talk to your family and strategize methods of communication,
transportation, and shelter for potential disasters. Maintain a supply
kit that includes water, food, flashlights, batteries, and other
materials that you and your family will need if you lose electricity.
Stay Informed. Familiarize yourself with the risks that coincide with
tropical storm systems and learn terms to help identify hazardous
situations; like storm surge, wind-scale or short-term watches and
warnings. Stay current on weather reports and sign up for Wireless
Emergency Alerts on your mobile device.
I hope that you, your family and your friends stay safe and enjoy the
start of summer. For more information on hurricane preparedness, check

Dear
Friends,
June
marks
the
start
of
summer
&#8211;
a
time
when
Delawareans
and
folks
from
across
the
country
flock
to
our
state's
pristine
5-star
beaches
and
outdoor
spaces.
As
we
prepare
to
enjoy
all
that
summer
has
to
offer,
it's
important
to
remember
that
June
also
marks
the
start
of
the
Atlantic

Delawareans
have

In

tens

Superstorm

reminded
us
of
the
threats
associated
with
living

the
lowest-lying
coastal
state
&#8211;
and
why
it&#8217;s
so
important
that
we
prepare

In
Delaware,
even
communities
miles
inland
from
the
coast
can
experience
the
threat
of
powerful
winds,
rainfall
and
flooding
when
hurricanes
or
severe

Here

some
tips
to

during

Plan.
Talk
