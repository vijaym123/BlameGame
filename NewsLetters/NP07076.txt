Dear Friend,
In recent days, my staff has heard from constituents who have received calls from individuals claiming to be IRS employees. The callers warn of overdue IRS fees and threaten jail-time if payment is not received. They then ask for confidential information, like your Social Security and bank account numbers.
Please be aware that these phone calls are scams. The IRS never asks for confidential information over the phone or via email.
These calls are used to trick you into sharing personal and financial information. Perpetrators then use this information to commit identity theft or steal your money.
How to Protect Yourself
If you receive a call from someone claiming to be an IRS agent,
do not
provide any personal information.
To determine if the IRS has a legitimate need to contact you, please contact them by calling 1-800-829-1040 or by visiting their website at
http://www.irs.gov .
If you have received one of these calls, please report them
here .
