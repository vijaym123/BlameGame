Congressman Lamborn Supports Small
Businesses
To honor Small
Business Week, make sure you shop local. Doing so will support an industry
segment that creates two out of every three new jobs in America.
Congressman Lamborn has voted for multiple bills that have passed the House
and are designed to assist our small
businesses:
The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility
Improvements Act (H.R. 527) scales back the regulatory red tape that burdens
Main Street so that small businesses are free to
grow.
The Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37) cuts excess regulation so that small
businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create
good-paying jobs.
The Small
Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) helps to reduce uncertainty from
government so that small businesses can invest in their future and
grow.
The Save the American Workers Act
(H.R. 30) restores the 40-hour work week that Obamacares employer
mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more workers at the
hours that work for them.
The
Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22) exempts veterans from Obamacares
employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through
TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran
and that no veteran is left jobless because of the
mandate.
H.R. 1105 repealed the death tax, an
important reform to our tax system that ensures small businesses can be
kept in the family, even when a loved one
dies.
