Friend,
Today marks Equal Pay Day, a day where we shed light on the income inequality that exists between men and women.
I know it&#39;s surprising that in 2014, such a day is even necessary - but it very much is.
Equal Pay Day falls on
April 8th
for a reason - today is the day that, more than
three months
into the year, women&#39;s wages finally catch up to what men earned the previous year.
Isn&#39;t that shocking? Isn&#39;t that unacceptable?
I&#39;m a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, and I and 196 of my fellow Democrats are proud to have signed on to a discharge petition to bring the Paycheck Fairness Act to the House Floor. Yet Speaker Boehner refuses to do so.
Can you sign here to help us encourage the Speaker to bring a bill to the Floor?
My wife and I are both doctors, and she&#39;s just as capable, just as dedicated, and (please don&#39;t tell her I said this) much smarter than I am. The fact that an employer would be allowed to pay her less for doing the exact same work as I do makes no sense at all.
This is not an episode of Mad Men. This is the United States of America in 2014. We can do better.
Click here to tell Speaker Boehner we have to stop this ridiculous double standard - women deserve equal pay for equal work.
Thanks.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S. Seriously, please don&#39;t ever tell Janine that I admitted she&#39;s smarter than me.
I&#39;ll never hear the end of it.
