2013: A Year in Review
Friends,
This past year has been full of challenges and rewards as I serve as your representative for the 28th District of Texas.
Through my work in Congress, millions and millions of dollars in funds was brought back to counties in TX28 to improve roads and infrastructure.
My grants coordinators met with every county in the district and discussed how our local government and non-profit organizations can be more competitive in their applications for federal funds.
My office hosted health insurance community workshops in six counties in the 28th District to help taxpayers learn about their options under the marketplace.
I stood up for students and veterans in Washington, voting to prevent an exponential rate hike on student loans and expand services for veterans.
As always, I want to hear what you think and listen to your feedback on how I am doing.
Send me a note on
my website , leave a comment on
my Facebook page , or follow me on
Twitter .
See you soon - in Texas or in Washington.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar

Keeping the Federal Government Accountable to Taxpayers
The House voted to approve the Government Customer Service Improvement Act of 2013, a bill authored by Congressman Cuellar to make government agencies more accountable to taxpayers.
Just like the private sector strives to provide excellent customer service to bring in business, the federal government should embed better service to bring efficiency.
This year, my bill, H.R. 1660 the Government Customer Service Improvement Act of 2013, was passed by unanimous consent in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The bill seeks to serve the taxpayers by improving customer service across federal agencies. We owe our taxpayers more than delays and service breakdowns
we owe them an effective, efficient, and responsible government because, ultimately, government is in the business of customer service
Bringing Affordable Health Care to TX28
My office worked with community organizations throughout the district to hold health insurance workshops across the district.
At each workshop, in Atascosa County, Hidalgo County, Starr County, Webb County, Wilson County, and Zapata County, constituents received information about the new marketplace, including how to enroll and who to contact locally for more assistance.
I encourage all residents to learn more about their options and Get Covered!
The Office of Congressman Cuellar hosted health insurance marketplace community workshops across the 28th District to provide information to constituents about their new options under the marketplace.
Protecting Students from Skyrocketing Loan Rates
Conressman Cuellar speaks about the value of education to visiting students in Washignton, DC.
Over the summer, I helped pass H.R. 1911 Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act. The legislation seeks to reduce the student loan interest rates which doubled on earlier this month after Congress fail to reach a compromise.
The law:
Reverses the July 1 interest rate hike that occurred because of Congressional inaction
Saves undergraduate students $25 billion in student loan payments over the next five years
Saves an average undergraduate $3,300 in interest payments over the course of his or her college career
Allows students to lock in todays low interest rate
Expanding Services in Support of Veterans
We owe the greatest debt of the gratitude to the men and women in uniform who have served our country.
This year, I voted in favor of the 2014 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Act, which seeks to reduce the backlog in claims currently present at the Department of Veteran Affairs.
Congressman Cuellar attended veterans day commemoration events throughout the district and discussed the ways his office can be of service to veterans.
A Broken System - We are Ready for Reform
As the son of migrant workers whose parents only reached a second and sixth grade level of schooling, the issue of immigration reform is personally meaningful to me.
One of my top priorities this year was to advocate for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border, improves our country's visa system, and provides legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the shadows.

The time is now for reform.
