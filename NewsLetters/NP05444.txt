David -- did you see President Obama&rsquo;s email?
It turns out he was right&hellip;
Just days after President Obama sent you that email,
billionaire-backed SuperPACs launched a massive Obama-bashing attack.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama needs your help. And he needs your help tonight. Tonight
is the
LAST
federally-mandated public fundraising deadline of the election. Tonight
is our
LAST
chance to show that we can beat Republicans&rsquo; billionaire-backers. Tonight
is your
LAST
opportunity to get your support for President Obama on the record.
