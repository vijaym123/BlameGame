Friend,
We are just over 100 days into the new Congress and we still have a lot of legislative work to accomplish.

There are a number of important issues&mdash;campaign finance reform, jobs and the economy, education, healthcare, and protecting the environment, to name a few.
We have the opportunity to address many of these issues but need to work in a bipartisan way if we hope to achieve our goals.

Thanks for engaging with our campaign.
Be well,
