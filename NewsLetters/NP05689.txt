&ldquo;Republicans are headed toward a big turnout edge in the midterms&rdquo;
- Washington Post , 9/16/2014
Dear Friend,
That
Washington Post
headline should be a wake-up call for Democrats. And we&rsquo;re working hard to make sure our GOTV operation is better than it&rsquo;s ever been.
Our grassroots team is one of the best in the country, but we need your help to power our campaign through the last few weeks of this race. Turnout is a function of a campaign&rsquo;s ground game -- give our field team the resources they need by getting us $5 closer to our $8O,OOO FEC pre-general deadline goal.

Some prognosticators are already predicting doom and gloom for the Democrats. I&rsquo;ve told you about their predictions before. They seem convinced that there&rsquo;s nothing Democrats can do but accept a Republican sweep. The pundits are wrong.
Campaigns aren&rsquo;t won by computer models, they&rsquo;re won by connecting with voters and with getting voters to the polls. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re focused on from now until November 4th, and you can help. A $5 contribution will help our organizers and volunteers make the most of these last few weeks. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford, and help us reach $8O,OOO before the FEC deadline.
Thanks,
Ed
