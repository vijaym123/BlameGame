Congressman
Bill
Foster
Representing the 11th District
November 11, 2013
Dear Friend,
Today we honor our nations veterans. For many of us they are friends and
family, to all of us they are heroes. I hope you will join me in
taking this time as an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices veterans
have made to secure our freedom. This week, I met with veterans
throughout the 11 th
District to listen to their stories and thank
them for their service.
On
Friday, I had the honor of viewing the Moving Wall Vietnam Veterans Memorial
on display in Aurora.
The Moving Wall is half the size of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC. The wall is a powerful way
to remember those who sacrificed for our
country.

at the Healing Field
veterans memorial in Aurora
My own
father served during World War II. I learned that the experience of
serving during a war is something our veterans carry with them for a
lifetime. Our nation just concluded two wars that have put a great deal of
strain on our servicemembers and their families. We owe it to our
returning veterans to make sure they get the mental and physical care they
deserve, and the services they need to help them re-integrate into
civilian life.
I am proud to
support initiatives like the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which provide robust
education benefits to the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. I also voted
for solutions to help address the claims backlog at the VA to keep
the promise weve made to our veterans.
But we need to do more. There are too many veterans who
cant find work when they come home. Veterans also make up a
disproportionate number of the homeless population in our country. Many come
home with mental health problems that have gone undiagnosed and struggle
to face those problems alone. With your help, I will continue to look
for solutions to ensure our veterans get the care and opportunities
they deserve.
If you know a
veteran who is having trouble getting their benefits or is facing one of
these problems, please
contact my office
and my
staff will do all they can to help.
Sincerely,
Bill Foster
Member of
Congress
