Dear Friend,
Each March we celebrate
Womens History Month and reflect on the great strides women have made
over the past century, and
the work that still needs
to be done for equality . As history has shown, when women assume
positions of leadership, they are able to draw more attention to
issues that affect women and families as a whole. This month, I look
forward to celebrating the unique contribution of women in our society and
to continue working on issues that impact women and families, such as
fair pay, paid sick leave, increased minimum wage and more. In
celebration of Women's History Month, I have been highlighting some of the
extraordinary women from the Third District on my
Facebook
and
Twitter
pages every Thursday, from
Concord's Doris Kearns Goodwin to Andover's Carissa Yip, the youngest
female chess master in the United States.
This week in
Congress in your Inbox
you will find information about a
House Armed Services Committee
hearing about President
Obamas proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force against the
terrorist group known as ISIL. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey testified at the
hearing and I had the opportunity to ask about the participation of
regional players, in particular Iran and whether or not that countrys
involvement poses diplomatic or military
complications.
Also in this weeks newsletter, you can find an article about how
my office assisted a constituent
in getting
recognition for his grandfathers World War II service. In addition, there
is an interview I did for the
Huffington Post with
contributor Stacey Alcorn , plus youll get to meet the young
people whom
I recently nominated for acceptance in the
United States Service Academies . There is also a link to
my recent interview on 980 WCAP .
As always, I look
forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for staying
engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
