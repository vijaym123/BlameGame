Dear Neighbor,
First, some successful efforts in Chautauqua County &ndash; The
community worked hard
to push ConAgra to give employees a fair severance package following ConAgra&rsquo;s announcement it would close the plant. After weeks of meetings, negotiations and community involvement, employees will be cared for with fair severance packages.
The work continues now to find a buyer and restore those jobs in the Chautauqua County community as soon as possible.
REED: THERE&rsquo;S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO FIX THE VA SYSTEM
While VA Secretary Eric Shinseki&rsquo;s decision to step down is the right one, it doesn&rsquo;t go nearly far enough. We cannot lose sight of the tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to fix the VA and
provide veterans with the best care . Fixing this problem at its root means holding anyone involved in criminal activity responsible to the fullest extent of the law.
REED ANNOUNCES ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS IN ALLEGANY AND CATTARAUGUS COUNTIES
We are pleased to announce that the Village of Delevan will receive $101,764 and the William P. Brooks Hose Company in Fillmore will receive $74,682 in Assistance to Firefighter Grant (AFG) awards. Caring for public safety, especially in our smaller, rural communities is something we hear regularly about from firefighters at our first responder roundtables and we&rsquo;re pleased to help our first responders get additional assistance.
Here with county sheriff, police and fire departments, and area emergency services departments talking about ways to improve emergency preparedness, coordinate in combating crime and enhance safety for first responders. Whenever we have an opportunity to listen to and care for those who care for us each and every day, we need to seize that opportunity.
TOM REED KEEPS PRESSURE ON GOV. CUOMO TO REQUEST DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR FLOODED NY COUNTIES
Communities still struggling from flooding last month need the Governor to
make a request for federal disaster assistance . Home and business owners are facing considerable financial pressure and farmers are suffering crop loss and damages.
And as a reminder to fishing and boating enthusiasts,
National Fishing and Boating Week
runs through Sunday. Get outside and enjoy some fresh air with your family this weekend!
Best,
Tom
