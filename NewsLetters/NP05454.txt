Dear Friends,
Fall is a busy time for many, so I wanted to take this opportunity to remind you of Medicare&rsquo;s Open Enrollment period, which begins today, October 15 and ends December 7.
First and foremost, if you are satisfied with the Medicare coverage you have,
you don&rsquo;t need to do anything at all . If you are currently a Medicare beneficiary, you remain eligible and will continue to receive Medicare benefits.
The Open Enrollment period offers Medicare recipients the opportunity to review their health and prescription drug coverage for the coming year and decide if their current plan is still meeting their needs. Please take the time to read up on
all the different options available to you . For free and objective information and counseling about Medicare, I encourage you to contact your local Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program. In Fresno and Madera Counties, you can call the
Valley Caregiver Resource Center
at 559-224-9117. In Merced County, you can call the
Merced County Area Agency on Aging
at 209-385-7550.
In Congress, I&rsquo;m also fighting against potential cuts in funding for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. These dangerous cuts would raise premiums for seniors at a time when our country is just bouncing back from the Great Recession. Due to my advocacy, America&rsquo;s Health Insurance Plans named me a &ldquo;champion&rdquo; of Medicare Advantage.
You may enroll in a different 2015 plan only from October 15 to December 7. Use the
Medicare Plan Finder
to do a personalized search and see all the health care plans available. Remember, this is the only time you can change your plan this year, so take this opportunity to find something that works for you or your eligible family member. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me on this or any other federal issue of importance to you. Furthermore, I encourage you to visit my website at
www.costa.house.gov
for the most recent news on the work I am doing in our Valley and to sign up for my e-newsletter.
Sincerely,
Jim Costa
Member of Congress
