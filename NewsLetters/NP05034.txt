Dear Friend,
Last week, I was honored to speak at the Tifton Chamber Meeting which
focused on veterans' care.
The Eighth District has 59,000 veterans who
deserve the very best care that our nation can provide.
However,
veterans living in Central-South Georgia often travel over to two hours
to receive care.
At the meeting, I was able to discuss the work my office has done in
conjunction with the Dublin VA to create a VA clinic in Tifton.
Representatives from Dublin were present to provide an update on the
status of this project, which has a projected opening date of Fall
2015, and to create an open forum where local veterans and community
members could can ask what services may be available to them at this
clinic.
This Congress, I was proud to several bills that makes it easier for
veterans to receive quality care.
In particular, H.R. 3230, the
Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014
, requires the VA to allow veterans enrolled in the VA system to
receive non-VA care if they are unable to secure an appointment at a VA
medical facility within 30 days or if they live more than 40 miles from
the nearest VA medical facility.
This is especially important for
veterans living in rural parts of our district. The bill also expands
the VA's internal capacity to provide timely care to veterans.
If you are a veteran in need of benefits assistance, please contact one
of my District Offices closest to you to speak with a caseworker: the
Tifton District Office
at (229) 396-5175 or the Warner Robins District
Office
at (478) 971-1776.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
I
was
honored
to
speak
at
the
Tifton
Chamber
Meeting
which focused
on
veterans'
care.
The
Eighth
District
has
59,000
veterans
who
deserve
the very
best
care
that
our nation
can
provide.
However,
veterans
living
in
Central-South
Georgia
often
travel
over
to
two
hours
to
receive
care.
At
the
meeting,
I
was
able
to
discuss
the
work
my
office
has
done
in
conjunction with
the
Dublin
VA
to
create
a
VA
clinic
in
Tifton.
Representatives
from
Dublin
were
present
to
provide
an
update
on
the
status
of
this
project,
which
has
a
projected
opening date
of
Fall
2015, and
to
create
an
open
forum
where
local
veterans
and
community
members
could can
ask
what

may
be
available
to
them
at
this
clinic.
This
Congress,
I
was
proud
to several
bills
that
makes
it
easier
for
veterans
to
receive
quality
care.
In
particular,
H.R.
3230,
the
Veterans

Choice,

Accountability
Act
of
2014 ,
requires
the
VA
to
allow
veterans
enrolled
in
the
VA
system
to
receive
non-VA
care
if
they
are
unable
to
secure
an
appointment
at
a
VA
medical
facility
within
30
days or
if
they
live
more
than
40
miles
from
the
nearest
VA
medical
facility.
This
is
especially
important
for
veterans
living
in
rural
parts
of
our
district. The
bill
also
expands
the
VA's
internal
capacity
to
provide

to
veterans.
