Dear Friends,
This morning, I joined Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman
Cicilline at Electric Boat's Quonset Point facility to celebrate a
$17.6 billion multi-year Naval contract that has been awarded to
General Dynamics for 10 Virginia-class submarines.
No, you did not misread that. I said 17.6 billion dollars.
This contract award reaffirms Electric Boat's position as a leading
defense contractor nationally, and will translate directly into more
jobs locally. Electric Boat's Quonset facility currently employs
approximately 2,800 people, with another 600 jobs on the way. This
award is the largest naval shipbuilding contract in U.S. history -
fantastic news for our state and our residents.
It is good news, too, for Quonset Business Park, which continues to
thrive. Quonset is home to more than 175 companies and 9,500 jobs, and
I have been so impressed by the Quonset Development Corporation's
ability to attract new business and preserve existing tenant
relationships. The commitment is mutual, in fact, with Electric Boat
recently signing a new 25-year lease. This announcement comes just
weeks after my delegation colleagues and I were proud to announce an
$800,000 federal grant to upgrade two new berths at the Port of
Davisville.
All good news. I am thrilled that Quonset continues to produce one
exciting announcement after another. Quonset truly is an anchor to the
Rhode Island economy, and our state gets stronger with every job they
add.

Logging On
Since my days as a State Representative, and especially as Rhode
Island's Secretary of State, I have valued the importance of
transparency and accountability. Today, I still aim to provide as much
information to my constituents as possible. As a result, I was honored
and excited to be one of just 16 members of Congress to receive a Gold
Mouse Award
in recognition of my informative, easy-to-navigate website.

Art Unveiled
My office received a record number of entries this year to the
Congressional Art Competition, and the judges from the Wickford Art
Association gave first place honors to Eleni Giannopoulos, a senior at
Exeter/West Greenwich High School. Her pencil drawing, "Captain's
Dream," will look incredible hanging in the U.S. Capitol, where it will
be starting in June.
