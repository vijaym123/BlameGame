Texans
Know
There's no question that Washington is a mess
and the folks running things there could learn a lot from the people in
Texas.
Texas families...
know that
you can't go on forever
living beyond your
means.
Texas businesses...
know that higher
taxes and more red tape lead to
fewer good-paying
jobs.
Texas seniors...
know how important it is
to see the doctor you
know and
trust.
Texas parents...
know that they should have the
final say
in their child's
education.
Texas doctors...
know that Washington bureaucrats
have no
place in the examining room.
Texas
patients...
know what they want,
and what they do
not want,
in their health care plan.
The
point is that Texans know what's best for Texas and that regarding almost
every issue facing us today, we'd be better off if
Washington
would simply get out of the way.
What's Important To
You?
It's a constant battle against the specter of bigger government, but it's
a fight I'm happy to take on every day for the folks I
represent.
At the over 50 town halls I hold every year in the
district, I hear directly from the families, workers and business owners
about which issues impact them the most.
But I'd
like to hear directly from you today.
If
you have just a couple of moments, please fill out my survey below and
let me know which issues are important to
you.
I work for you in Washington , so it's vital that I know
what you think and what actions you believe should be
taken.
And if ever you need assistance with a federal government agency, my
staff is ready to help you navigate the sometimes complicated rules and
regulations. The contact information for our offices, as well as the
office hours for the district offices and satellite offices are to the
right.
I look forward to hearing from you
today!
Which issues are important to you? Please take
just a minute and let me know which issues are the most important to
you, and what action you'd like to see taken. These are the issues I'm most concerned about:
ObamaCare Immigration Gun
Control Deficit
