Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
While touting ObamaCare, the President repeatedly promised the American
people that "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan
." Turns out, the Obama Administration knew that millions of
Americans would lose their health insurance plans - plans they might
like and want to keep - three years ago.
We already know that 300,000 Floridians have lost their Florida Blue
plans and the Wall Street Journal has reported that "as many as 10
million consumers are expected to have their health plans terminated by
their insurers."
Now that millions of Americans are seeing their policies canceled due
to ObamaCare, it is clear that the President's promises were a reckless
deception designed to facilitate the law's passage against the will of
the people.
That is why last week I introduced legislation - the If You Like Your
Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act - that will halt the cancellation
of existing health insurance plans that do not conform to ObamaCare's
mandates. Senator Ron Johnson is leading this measure in the Senate. My
legislation will hold those who passed ObamaCare accountable to their
promises.
Rep. DeSantis speaking at a press conference introducing his
legislation.
It is interesting to listen to supporters of ObamaCare defend the law,
saying that yes, you might be losing your current plan, but you will
receive a better one. A better plan in whose eyes? You should be able
to decide what is best for you and your family's health - not the
government.
Congress must take action to prevent more Americans from falling victim
to the President's broken promises. In just a few days, the bill has
garnered the support of over 30 of my House colleagues and I look
forward to its passage.
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me
on Facebook
and Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not
hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear
Friend&#8211;
While
touting
ObamaCare,
the
President
repeatedly
promised
the
American
people
that
&#8220; if
you
like
your
plan,
you
can
keep
your
plan .&#8221;
Turns
out,
the
Obama
Administration
knew
that
millions
of
Americans
would
lose
their
health
insurance
plans
- plans
they
might
like
and
want
to
keep
- three
years
ago.
We
already
know
that
300,000
Floridians
have lost
their
Florida
Blue
plans
and the
Wall
Street
Journal has
reported that
"as
many
as
10
million
consumers
are
expected
to
have
their
health
plans
terminated
by
their
insurers."
Now
that
millions
of
Americans
are
seeing
their
policies
canceled
due
to
ObamaCare,
it
is
clear
that
the
President's
promises
were
a
reckless
deception
designed
to
facilitate
the
law&#8217;s
passage
against
the
will
of
the
people.
That
is
why last
week
I
introduced legislation
-
the
If
You
Like
Your
Health
Care
Plan
You
Can
Keep
It
Act
-
that
will
halt
the
cancellation
of
existing
health
insurance
plans
that
do
not
conform
to
ObamaCare&#8217;s
mandates.
Senator
Ron
Johnson
is
leading
this
measure
in
the
Senate.
My legislation
will hold
those
who
passed
ObamaCare
accountable
to
their
promises.
Rep.
DeSantis
speaking
at
a
press
conference
introducing
his
legislation.
It
is
interesting
to
listen
to
supporters
of
ObamaCare
defend
the
law,
saying
that
yes,
you
might
be
losing
your
current
plan,
but
you
will
receive
a
better
one.
A
better
plan
in
whose
eyes?
You
should
be
able
to
decide
what
is
best
for
you
and
your
family's
health
-
not
the
government.
Congress
must
take
action
to
prevent
more
Americans
from
falling
victim
to
the
President's
broken
promises.
In
just
a
few
days,
the
bill
has
garnered
the
support
of
over
30
of
my
House
colleagues
and I
look
forward
to
its
passage.
