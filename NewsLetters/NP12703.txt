Dear Friend,
For 40 years, weve banned
U.S. oil companies from sending our crude oil overseas because we said
we needed all the oil we produce to achieve energy independence and
help protect consumers from gas price shocks.
Now, Big Oil
says we should lift the U.S. ban thats existed since 1975 because
times have really changed.
Well, I think Big Oil just
wants increase their already-big profits and I posted my first-ever
Buzzfeed Community post about this:
http://bzfd.it/1cCRcHW
In the post, Ive included photos
comparing the 1970s to today and I highlight why we must keep American
oil in America.
BONUS: If you check out the post, you
get to see a photo of me from the 70s.
If you agree that we must keep
American oil in America, feel free to
share this
post , or check out these two letters I sent to President Barack Obama
on the subject ( Dec. 2013 ,
Jan.
2014 ).
And tell your Representatives you dont want to
pay more at the pump just so Big Oil can increase their already-big
profits.
Sincerely,
Robert Menendez
United
States Senator
