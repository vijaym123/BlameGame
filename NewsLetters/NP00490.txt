Dear Friends,
Cannon Falls resident Arnold Hjermstad, 96, waited more than 70 years to receive the Legion of Merit he earned during World War II in the U.S. Army.
In January, 1944, Arnold was nominated to receive the Legion of Merit award, but due to bureaucratic errors he never received the medal. Since the 1970s when they first contacted then-Senator Hubert Humphrey, Hjermstads three sons have been trying to secure the award. Unfortunately, they kept running into bureaucratic roadblocks.
Last month on Armed Forces Day, after six months of working with the Pentagon that included contacting the Secretary of the Army, I was honored to present Arnold with the Legion of Merit award in a ceremony in front of his family, friends, and fellow veterans in Cannon Falls.
As we remember D-Day this Saturday, I reflect on the incredible privilege I had to have stood with my fellow Minnesotans to present Arnold his long-overdue award and, in doing so, honoring our fallen and their families, and the ideals for which they lived and died.
Best wishes,
John Kline
Member of Congress
