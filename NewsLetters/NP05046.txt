David --
There&rsquo;s only 9 days to go, so I&rsquo;ll be blunt.
Speaker Boehner and Republican outside groups are pounding the Chicago airwaves with over $8 million against me. I&rsquo;m not surprised. They&rsquo;ve been after me since my first day in Congress.
What&rsquo;s important is that we keep our heads down, focus on the mission at hand, and get the facts out to every last Illinois voter. David, we can&rsquo;t let up. Not now. Not when poll after poll shows our race in a dead-heat.
Tuesday marks one week out from the election and our last major ad buy deadline.
So David, can I count on you to chip in one final time? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Brad
P.S. When polls close, we don&rsquo;t want to have any regrets.
