The FY2015 Budget
Budget season is once again upon us, and I am so proud that for the
fourth year in a row, the House Budget Committee has approved a budget
that responsibly puts our nation on a path to
prosperity by reforming our spending and empowering our economy.
*
Roll Call. Chairman Ryan brings a serious budget proposal
before the House.
*
Wall Street Journal. House Budget is a balanced approach to
controlling our debt.
During our long budget mark-up on Wednesday, I took some extra time to
argue in favor of ensuring that our federal government stops punishing
hard-working Americans who have invested their retirement savings in
American companies from being burdened by unnecessarily high tax rates.
Supporting Economic Development at the Savannah Harbor
Last week the entire Georgia House delegation - Republicans and
Democrats - came together to advocate for continued federal financial
support for a critical infrastructure investment program; the Savannah
Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP).
I can't stress enough how important SHEP is to Georgia's
economic growth and the progress of the entire Southeastern U.S.
Save American Workers Act
Last week the House passed an important piece of legislation - the Save
American Workers Act
- which protects the traditional 40-hour
work week and rolls back provisions of Obamacare that will lead
employers to cut the hours and wages of full-time employees. Too often
we hear that everything in Washington is partisan, but this bill is a
tremendous example of how both parties can work together to help hard
working Americans.
No one wanted to see hours cut and incomes lowered
for American employees, but because of Obamacare's redefining of a
full-time employee as "30 hours per week," hours and incomes are
absolutely dropping.
This bipartisan bill will end this unintended
outcome.
Health Care
You've probably heard that the initial enrollment period for Obamacare
ended on March 31st. We still don't really know how many people have
signed-up and paid for coverage, or how many more will take advantage
of the special sign-up extension, but we know already that prices will
rise next year for health care.
*
Reuters. Obamacare premiums may increase dramatically next
year.
*
Christian Science Monitor. A deadline isn't really a deadline
in Obamacare.
*
Washington Post. Obamacare's statistics are still unclear.
*
USA Today. Open enrollment is over - so now what?
Not all health news is wrapped up in Obamacare. Last week the House
passed by voice vote a Senate bill that will reauthorize the Children's
Hospital Graduate Medical Education program
. This bill was championed by Georgia's Senator
Johnny Isakson and it will help life-saving institutions like our very
own Children's Healthcare of Atlanta train the very best new pediatric
specialists in our nation.
Tax Reform
Last week I read an interesting story about a successful American
company, Caterpillar, and how it had spent millions of dollars on legal
ways to avoid paying exorbitantly high U.S. tax rates. I don't blame
this company - or any U.S. company for that matter - for using every
legal maneuver available to avoid paying the punishing tax rates
imposed by our current tax system. If you support increasing tax rates,
here is a great example of why that's bad for our economy and why it's
so imperative that we reform our tax code sooner rather than later.
*
The Hill. Caterpillar shifts profits to Switzerland to avoid
punitive U.S. taxation.
Standing Up For Life
Last week I joined a number of my House colleagues in co-signing three
letters to the House Appropriations Committee asking that the Committee
uphold our nation's commitment to protecting the unborn. We can all
agree that no taxpayer should have to pay for a procedure that they
find morally objectionable.
*
Protecting conscience rights for individuals and health care
professionals.
*
Prohibiting funding for Planned Parenthood to provide
abortions.
*
Ensuring that American taxpayer dollars aren't spent on
abortions abroad.
The Week Ahead
This is Budget Week in the House of Representatives. We'll pass the
FY15 Budget Resolution
, my
"Baseline Reform Act
," H.R. 1871, and
Representative Scott Garrett's "Budget and Accounting Transparency Act
," H.R. 1872.
The FY15 Budget Resolution is not simply a collection of numbers; it is
a statement of our belief that controlling debt is the most significant
policy necessity facing our country today. We can't grow our economy,
create jobs, or protect our national security if we are mired in debt
and beholden to debt payments to foreign countries or our own citizens.
