Improving The Affordable Care Act
Dear Friend,
The Affordable Care Act has given millions of families in Virginia and across the country access to quality, affordable health care, but serious fixes are still needed to fulfill this promise for all families. Because of how the IRS has defined &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; in its interpretation of the Affordable Care Act &ndash; based on the cost of premiums for an individual instead of the cost of the family premium &ndash; many
spouses and families are cut off from the possibility of receiving tax credits under the ACA. Last week,
I spoke on the Senate floor
about my support for the
Family Coverage Act , legislation to help families access tax credits on state and federal healthcare exchanges to ensure they get the most affordable coverage possible. To learn more about this legislation click

If you need assistance obtaining information on the Affordable Care Act or communicating with a federal agency in regards to benefits available through the Affordable Care Act, my office can help.

The Family Coverage Act
fixes this unforeseen consequence by changing the definition
of affordability
and providing eligible family members access to tax credits. I&rsquo;m proud to work with Senator Franken of Minnesota on this legislation and will continue working with my colleagues on other important fixes to strengthen the law.
