This week, the legislation I introduced to preserve the historic Lincoln Train Station and 45 acres of land along Plum Run (H.R. 1513) passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 396-0 vote. This legislation utilizes no federal funds to purchase the properties. The Gettysburg Foundation, a non-profit partner of the park, will donate the properties to the Gettysburg National Military Park.

President Abraham Lincoln arrived at the Lincoln Train Station on November 18, 1863, prior to delivering the Gettysburg Address the following day. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lincoln Train Station also served as a hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg, transporting wounded soldiers after the battle.
The Battle of Gettysburg marked a turning point in American history. By preserving the Lincoln Train Station, I hope to inspire my fellow citizens to learn and appreciate the significance of the Gettysburg Campaign, the Gettysburg Address, the Civil War and the bravery of the soldiers who, in President Lincoln's words, "gave the last full measure of devotion."
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lincoln Train Station also served as a hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg, transporting wounded soldiers after the battle. The Lincoln Train Station is now operated by the Gettysburg Convention and Visitors Bureau and is owned by the Borough of Gettysburg.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
