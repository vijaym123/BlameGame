Dear Friend,
This week, the Grizzlies showed grit and grind to clinch the 7th seed
in the Western Conference for the NBA Playoffs (UConn was also 7th seed
before winning the National Championship-foreshadowing?), I hosted
another "Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness event focused on
reducing the number of diabetes diagnoses in our city, introduced
legislation to promote job creation and grow our economy, and announced
more than $4 million in federal funds to help reduce homelessness in
Memphis. Keep reading to learn more.

Building a Healthier Memphis by Preventing Diabetes
More than 8 million Americans enrolled in high-quality, affordable
coverage before the Affordable Care Act's 2014 open enrollment period
ended last month. With so many Americans now enrolled in coverage
through marketplaces like HealthCare.gov
, President Obama is right when he says "the Affordable Care Act
is here to stay.
"
The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans get
covered and get the care they need, but we can do more. In February, I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District with a panel discussion and education session focused on
the racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes in Memphis.
Over the weekend, I hosted the second event in my series, this time
focused on the rising number of diabetes diagnoses in Shelby County. My
panel included a number of local experts on diabetes prevention as well
as Dr. Ann Albright from the United States Centers for Disease Control
(CDC). It also highlighted new consumer protections in the President's
landmark health care reform law that prevent insurers from denying
coverage to any American simply because of a pre-existing condition
like diabetes.
We can and must do more to stem this rising tide of diabetes diagnoses,
and I'm encouraged that so many Memphians attended Saturday's panel and
education session to learn how they can prevent diabetes, improve their
own health, and help promote healthy habits among their families and
communities. I look forward to announcing my next "Building a Healthier
Memphis" event in the coming weeks.
Supporting Minority-owned Businesses
Memphis is home to many well-qualified, highly-skilled minority
entrepreneurs who have lacked access to capital or who have had
difficulty navigating the maze of the federal grant application
process. That's why I fought to secure funding to open a Minority
Business Development Agency (MBDA) Business Center in Memphis, which
helps solve both problems. Yesterday, I was glad to announce $250,000
in federal funding to boost the MBDA Memphis Business Center's efforts
to promote job creation and growth at minority-owned businesses in the
Ninth District. This funding will help minority-run businesses in our
city create and retain jobs, which will breathe more life into our
local economy. And that's a step in the right direction.
Promoting Economic Revitalization in Memphis
Urban and rural areas across the county-including Memphis-are grappling
with high unemployment rates and hardworking families throughout these
communities are struggling just to make ends meet. For years,
struggling communities like ours have relied on Renewal Community and
Empowerment Zone tax incentives to create jobs and revitalize
economies. But in recent years, those tax incentives have expired even
though they are still needed. That's why I introduced my Growth Zones
Opportunity Act, which would renew the expired incentives that are so
helpful to Memphis and other distressed areas around the country. With
millions of jobs lost because of the Great Recession and too many
Memphians still struggling, my bill will help cities like Memphis
recover, and I hope it is passed as soon as possible.
Helping Tennesseans Take Full Advantage of the Affordable Care Act
Yesterday afternoon, President Obama announced that 8 million Americans
have enrolled in private health care coverage through the Affordable
Care Act's health insurance marketplaces. With millions of Americans
now enrolled, it is clearer than ever that the President's landmark
health care reform law is achieving its goal of making high-quality,
affordable health coverage a right, not just a privilege. Thanks to the
law, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women or
those with pre-existing conditions, young adults can stay on their
parent's insurance until they are 26, and our seniors are saving money
on their prescriptions.
While the law is working and Memphians are seeing many of the law's
benefits, thousands of Tennesseans are without coverage because of
Govornor Haslam's refusal to expand Medicaid. Other states whose
Governors oppose expanding Medicaid like Arkansas, Iowa, and Michigan,
have been able to reconcile their concerns with the best interests of
those they represent-but Tennessee has not, and our citizens are losing
out. This week, the Washington Post reported
that while the Affordable Care Act is helping lower the uninsured
rate across the country, it is falling more than 3 times faster in
states that have fully implemented the law, which includes expanding
their Medicaid programs. I am dedicated to helping as many Tennesseans
as possible gain access to high-quality health coverage, and I have
offered to help the Governor in expanding TennCare, our state's
Medicaid program.
Working to End Homelessness in the Ninth District
This week, I also announced more than $4.3 million in federal grant
funds that was awarded to the City of Memphis and 13 local non-profits
to help end homelessness in the Ninth District. This significant amount
of funding will help our community work to reduce-and hopefully
eliminate-homeless in Memphis. A list of the grant recipients and award
amounts in available here
.
Helping Shelby County Recover from March's Severe Winter Storms
Late last week, after I joined Senators Alexander and Corker as well as
other members of the Tennessee Congressional delegation in calling on
President Obama to approve Governor Haslam's request for a major
disaster declaration, the President issued a disaster declaration for
several counties-including Shelby County-affected by the severe winter
storms in early March. His declaration triggered the release of federal
funds that will help our community recover, and earlier this week the
U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announced that private
non-profit organizations in Shelby County may be eligible to apply for
low-interest rate disaster loans up to$2 million for the repair or
replacement of damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and
equipment, inventory and other business assets. Non-profits seeking
these loans should call the SBA's Customer Service Center at (800)
659-2955 to help determine if they are eligible, and can apply online
at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela
.
Bringing Justice to the Unfairly Incarcerated
I was pleased to see that President Obama this week asked the U.S.
Department of Justice to improve its clemency recommendation process
and recruit more applicants
for pardons and commutations of unfair sentences. For a year, I
have been encouraging the administration
to make broader use of the President's pardon and commutation
powers to bring justice to those serving unjust sentences that they
would not be serving if sentenced today. I am glad to see this apparent
shift in the President's thinking on this issue, and I hope it leads to
freedom for the thousands of Americans still serving time in prison
even though Congress has voted to reduce sentences for those same
crimes.
Promoting International Cooperation
Recently, I received an A+ for my voting record on international issues
from the Global Solutions Action Network on their 2014 Congressional
Report Card
, which measures how
legislators voted on issues that affect the United Nations, the
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the global environment, global
health, and other international issues. I was also awarded extra credit
for my proposal to promote renewable energy and reduce nuclear weapons
in our country.
It is an honor to be recognized by Global Solutions Action Network for
my work promoting international stability and peaceful relations
between nations. As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I will
continue to be a steadfast advocate for international cooperation,
improving health around the world, and protecting our environment.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
VA Rolls Out Secure Veteran Health ID Cards
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced the phased
roll out of newly designed, more secure Veteran Health Identification
Cards. The new cards are distinguished by additional security features
and will have a different look and feel.
Similar to a typical health insurance card, the VHIC displays the
veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as a Plan ID,
reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. The card
replaces the Veteran Identification Card (VIC), which was introduced in
2004. As part of a phased rollout, the card will only be offered to
newly enrolled and other veterans who have not been issued a VIC. In
early April, the VA will begin a three month effort to automatically
issue the more secure VHIC to current VIC cardholders. The VA
recommends veterans safeguard their VIC as they would a credit card,
and cut up or shred the card once it is replaced. While not required to
receive VA health care, all enrolled Veterans are encouraged to get a
VHIC.
Enrolled veterans can get more information about the VHIC by visiting
their VA medical facility enrollment coordinator or the website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or
visiting their local VA health care facility. Veterans who are not
enrolled in the VA health care system can apply for enrollment at any
time by visiting www.va.gov/healthbenefits
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting
their local VA health care facility.
Hope you have a pleasant and happy Easter, and go Grizz!
As always, I remain.

Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
by
Preventing
Diabetes
More
than
8
million
Americans
enrolled
in
high-quality,
affordable
coverage
before
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
2014
open
enrollment
period
ended
last
month.
With
so
many
Americans
now
enrolled
in
coverage
through
marketplaces
like
HealthCare.gov ,
President
Obama
is
right
when
he
says
&#8220; the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
here
to
stay. &#8221;
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
helping
millions
of
Americans
get
covered
and
get
the
care
they
need,
but
we
can
do
more.
In
February,
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
with
a
panel
discussion
and
education
session
focused
on
the
racial
disparities
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
in
Memphis.
Over
the
weekend,
I
hosted
the
second
event
in
my
series,
this
time
focused
on
the
rising
number
of
diabetes
diagnoses
in
Shelby
County.
My
panel
included
a
number
of
local
experts
on
diabetes
prevention
as
well
as
Dr.
Ann
Albright
from
the
United
States
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC).
It
also
highlighted
new
consumer
protections
in
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
health
care
reform
law
that
prevent
insurers
from
denying
coverage
to
any
American
simply
because
of
a
pre-existing
condition
like
diabetes.
We
can
and
must
do
more
to
stem
this
rising
tide
of
diabetes
diagnoses,
and
I&#8217;m
encouraged
that
so
many
Memphians
attended
Saturday&#8217;s
panel
and
education
session
to
learn
how
they
can
prevent
diabetes,
improve
their
own
health,
and
help
promote
healthy
habits
among
their
families
and
communities.
I
look
forward
to
announcing
my
next
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
event
in
the
coming
weeks.
Supporting
Minority-owned
Businesses
Memphis
is
home
to
many
well-qualified,
highly-skilled minority
entrepreneurs
who
have
lacked
access
to
capital
or
who
have
had
difficulty
navigating
the maze
of
the
federal
grant
application
process.
That&#8217;s
why
I
fought
to
secure
funding
to
open
a
Minority
Business
Development
Agency
(MBDA)
Business
Center
in
Memphis,
which
helps
solve
both
problems.
Yesterday,
I
was
glad
to
announce
$250,000
in
federal
funding
to
boost
the
MBDA
Memphis
Business
Center&#8217;s
efforts
to
promote
job
creation
and
growth
at
minority-owned
businesses
in
the
Ninth
District.
This
funding
will
help
minority-run
businesses
in
our
city
create
and
retain
jobs,
which
will
breathe
more
life
into
our
local
economy.
And
that&#8217;s
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
Promoting
Economic
Revitalization
in
Memphis
Urban
and
rural
areas
across
the
county&#8212;including
Memphis&#8212;are
grappling
with
high
unemployment
rates
and
hardworking
families
throughout
these
communities
are
struggling
just
to
make
ends
meet.
For
years,
struggling
communities
like
ours
have
relied
on
Renewal
Community
and
Empowerment
Zone
tax
incentives
to
create
jobs
and
revitalize
economies.
But
in
recent
years,
those
tax
incentives
have
expired
even
though
they
are
still
needed.
That&#8217;s
why
I
introduced
my
Growth
Zones
Opportunity
Act,
which
would
renew
the
expired
incentives
that
are
so
helpful
to
Memphis
and
other
distressed
areas
around
the
country.
With
millions
of
jobs
lost
because
of
the
Great
Recession
and
too
many
Memphians
still
struggling,
my
bill
will
help
cities
like
Memphis
recover,
and
I
hope
it
is
passed
as
soon
as
possible.
Helping
Tennesseans
Take
Full
Advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
Yesterday
afternoon,
President
Obama
announced
that
8
million
Americans
have
enrolled
in
private
health
care
coverage
through
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
health
insurance
marketplaces.
With
millions
of
Americans
now
enrolled,
it
is
clearer
than
ever
that
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
health
care
reform
law
is
achieving
its
goal
of
making
high-quality,
affordable
health
coverage
a
right,
not
just
a
privilege.
Thanks
to
the
law,
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
women
or
those
with
pre-existing
conditions,
young
adults
can
stay
on
their
parent&#8217;s
insurance
until
they
are
26,
and
our
seniors
are
saving
money
on
their
prescriptions.
While
the
law
is
working
and
Memphians
are
seeing
many
of
the
law&#8217;s
benefits,
thousands
of
Tennesseans
are
without
coverage
because
of
Govornor
Haslam&#8217;s
refusal
to
expand
Medicaid.
Other
states
whose
Governors
oppose
expanding
Medicaid
like
Arkansas,
Iowa,
and
Michigan,
have
been
able
to
reconcile
their
concerns
with
the
best
interests
of
those
they
represent&#8212;but
Tennessee
has
not,
and
our
citizens
are
losing
out.
This
week,
the
Washington
Post
reported
that
while
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
helping
lower
the
uninsured
rate
across
the
country,
it
is
falling
more
than
3
times
faster
in
states
that
have
fully
implemented
the
law,
which
includes
expanding
their
Medicaid
programs.
I
am
dedicated
to
helping
as
many
Tennesseans
as
possible
gain
access
to
high-quality
health
coverage,
and
I
have
offered
to
help
the
Governor
in
expanding
TennCare,
our
state&#8217;s
Medicaid
program.
Working
to
End
Homelessness
in
the
Ninth
District
This
week,
I
also
announced
more
than
$4.3
million
in
federal
grant
funds
that
was
awarded
to
the
City
of
Memphis
and
13
local
non-profits
to
help
end
homelessness
in
the
Ninth
District.
This
significant
amount
of
funding
will
help
our
community
work
to
reduce&#8212;and
hopefully
eliminate&#8212;homeless
in
Memphis.

Helping
Shelby
County
Recover
from
March&#8217;s
Severe
Winter
Storms
Late
last
week,
after
I
joined
Senators
Alexander
and
Corker
as
well
as
other
members
of
the
Tennessee
Congressional
delegation
in
calling
on
President
Obama
to
approve
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
request
for
a
major
disaster
declaration,
the
President
issued
a
disaster
declaration
for
several
counties&#8212;including
Shelby
County&#8212;affected
by
the
severe
winter
storms
in
early
March.
His
declaration
triggered
the
release
of
federal
funds
that
will
help
our
community
recover,
and
earlier
this
week
the
U.S.
Small
Business
Administration
(SBA)
announced
that
private
non-profit
organizations
in
Shelby
County
may
be
eligible
to
apply
for
low-interest
rate
disaster
loans
up
to$2 million
for
the
repair
or
replacement
of
damaged
or
destroyed
real
estate,
machinery
and
equipment,
inventory
and
other
business
assets.
Non-profits
seeking
these
loans
should
call
the
SBA&#8217;s
Customer
Service
Center
at
(800)
659-2955
to
help
determine
if
they
are
eligible,
and
can
apply
online
at
https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela .
Bringing
Justice
to
the
Unfairly
Incarcerated
I
was
pleased
to
see
that
President
Obama
this
week
asked
the
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
to
improve
its
clemency
recommendation
process
and
recruit
more
applicants
for
pardons
and
commutations
of
unfair
sentences.
For
a
year,
I
have
been
encouraging
the
administration
to
make
broader
use
of
the
President&#8217;s
pardon
and
commutation
powers
to
bring
justice
to
those
serving
unjust
sentences
that
they
would
not
be
serving
if
sentenced
today.
I
am
glad
to
see
this
apparent
shift
in
the
President&#8217;s
thinking
on
this
issue,
and
I
hope
it
leads
to
freedom
for
the
thousands
of
Americans
still
serving
time
in
prison
even
though
Congress
has
voted
to
reduce
sentences
for
those
same
crimes.
Promoting
International
Cooperation
Recently,
I
received
an
A+
for
my
voting
record
on
international
issues
from
the
Global
Solutions
Action
Network
on
their
2014
Congressional
Report
Card ,
which
measures
how
legislators
voted
on
issues
that
affect
the
United
Nations,
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons,
the
global
environment,
global
health,
and
other
international
issues.
I
was
also
awarded
extra
credit
for
my
proposal
to
promote
renewable
energy
and
reduce
nuclear
weapons
in
our
country.
It
is
an
honor
to
be
recognized
by
Global
Solutions
Action
Network
for
my
work
promoting
international
stability
and
peaceful
relations
between
nations.
As
a
member
of
the
U.S.
Helsinki
Commission,
I
will
continue
to
be
a
steadfast
advocate
for
international
cooperation,
improving
health
around
the
world,
and
protecting
our
environment.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance

and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you

VA
Rolls
Out
Secure
Veteran
Health
ID
Cards
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
recently
announced
the
phased
roll
out
of
newly
designed,
more
secure
Veteran
Health
Identification
Cards.
The
new
cards
are
distinguished
by
additional
security
features
and
will
have
a
different
look
and
feel.
Similar
to
a
typical
health
insurance
card,
the
VHIC
displays
the
veteran&#8217;s
Member
ID,
a
new
unique
identifier,
as
well
as
a
Plan
ID,
reflecting
the
veteran&#8217;s
enrollment
in
VA
health
care.
The
card
replaces
the
Veteran
Identification
Card
(VIC),
which
was
introduced
in
2004.
As
part
of
a
phased
rollout,
the
card
will
only
be
offered
to
newly
enrolled
and
other
veterans
who
have
not
been
issued
a
VIC.
In
early
April,
the
VA
will
begin
a
three
month
effort
to
automatically
issue
