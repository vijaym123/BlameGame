Do you love taking photos of your backyard or
the sunsets across the city?
When you live
in Congressional District 6, you're familiar with the beautiful vistas
of desert scenery.
We're looking to revamp our website with
photos
in
the District from the people
of
the
District.
Join the contest by emailing us a high
resolution version of your favorite photo of #AZ06 to
AZ06photo@mail.house.gov. We are only accepting one photo submission per
participant.
We'll announce the winner on Friday, October
3!
