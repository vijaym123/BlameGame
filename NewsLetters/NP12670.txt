Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
State of the Union
On Tuesday, I again had the honor of attending the annual State of the Union address.
While I don't always agree with what is said, it is humbling to sit in the House chamber as the President addresses the nation.
This year President Obama focused on economic opportunity, a relevant theme as the Middle Class continues to struggle.
Unfortunately, the policies President Obama articulated were many of the same government-centered ideas that have failed over the past 6 years.
What the country needs are pro-growth reforms that will stimulate the economy and get Americans back to work.

One of the great parts of the State of the Union every year is meeting the wide-range of Americans invited to attend.
This year was no different as there were brave veterans of the war in Afghanistan, community leaders, and a few celebrities including Duck Dynasty's Willie Robertson who I had the pleasure of meeting.
Highlighting Waste at the CFPB
Tuesday morning, the Financial Services Committee held a hearing with Richard Cordray, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Over the last year, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee which I chair, has uncovered significant waste in the Bureau's office renovation budget.
The CFPB had initially planned to spend around $55 million to renovate their leased Washington headquarters but that budget has since jumped to $95 million and now sits at over $150 million.
I find it incomprehensible that a federal agency would spend $150 million of taxpayer funds to renovate leased office space and I used my time to question Director Cordray about the cost overruns.
Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with Director Cordray's answers and on Wednesday I called on the CFPB's Inspector General to investigate the renovation budget.
You can read more about that letter in the
Washington Examiner
and
Washington Business Journal .
You can find more information about Tuesday's hearing, including full video, at the Financial Service Committee's
website .

National School Choice Week
This past week was National School Choice Week 2014.
Since first being elected to Congress, I have advocated the benefits of school choice in America's schools.
I truly believe that parents, not the government, are best positioned to decide what school is the ideal situation for their child.

North Carolina companies in on Team USA preparations
Time Warner Cable News Charlotte
While the North Carolina textile industry has struggled in recent years, it continues to play a major role in the 10th District's economy.
I enjoyed this story on how a Catawba County textile company helped in the manufacturing of the uniforms that will be worn by the American Olympic team during the Opening Ceremonies.
It is great that a local company is helping ensure that our uniforms are 100% Made in America.
Summer of Russell still a fond memory for Grizzlies
Gaston Gazette
In light of this evening's Super Bowl, I wanted to include this story highlighting the 10th District's tie to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.
Wilson, a graduate of North Carolina State University, is also a tremendous baseball player and this story focuses on the summer of 2009 when he played for the Gaston Grizzlies.
That was not his only time in the 10th though as he also spent the summer of 2011 playing for the Asheville Tourists.
