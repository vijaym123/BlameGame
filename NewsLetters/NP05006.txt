I know that you&rsquo;re tired of all the emails, David.
But I need your help.
And so does Barack.
Republican outside groups are swarming to attack Democrats across the country. And if they win in November, they'll do everything they can to erase everything we have accomplished.
We still need 6 Democrats from 60659 zip code to step up and chip in. Can you answer Barack's call-to-action right now? All donations to this email triple-matched!
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Joe Biden
