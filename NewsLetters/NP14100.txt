Congressman Miller Introduces Legislation to Bring Jobs to the Inland Empire
This week I introduced the Revitalize Our Cities Act (H.R. 3535), legislation to support job creation for hardworking Americans. My main priority in Congress is creating jobs and economic prosperity for families of the Inland Empire. This bipartisan legislation will spur economic growth and help put residents of the 31st District back to work by providing vital investment incentives for businesses to come to the Inland Empire. H.R. 3535 will extend federal empowerment zone designations for three years and expand the program adding an additional 20 empowerment zone designees (currently there are 30). Employers located in federal empowerment zones will receive tax credits for hiring employees and additional incentives. Once passed, this legislation will provide a direct and positive impact on Inland Empire residents.
The Inland Empire is still recovering from the 2008 economic downturn with thousands of residents struggling to regain employment and sound financial footing. This legislation will greatly expedite the region's recovery and help reduce unemployment that remains more than three percent higher than the national average.
Congressman Miller Wants Your Feedback About Obamacare
As many of you are aware, much of the focus here in Washington has been on the implementation of Obamacare and the impacts this new health insurance law has had on Americans.
I want to thank the hundreds of you who have let me know how Obamacare is impacting you and your families. If you haven't already, please share your story about Obamacare through the following link on my website . In the meantime, I will keep listening to your needs and supporting common-sense health care reforms like the Keep Your Health Plan Act (H.R. 3350), legislation allowing health plans canceled under Obamacare to continue being offered.
How Can Congressman Miller Assist You?
As always, I appreciate your feedback on the federal issues that are impacting you. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if I can be of assistance or if you want to voice your opinion.
