Congressman
Lamborn Supports PILT Programs to Assist Our Rural
Communities
10/15/14
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined his
fellow Members of Congress in a letter calling on House Leadership to,
"work in a bipartisan, bi-cameral fashion to secure funding for the
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) and Secure Rural Schools and Community
Self-Determination Act (SRS) programs for fiscal year 2015" before the
conclusion of the current 113th Congress.
The letter also points out that, "current authorization for
full PILT funding expired on September 30, 2014. Without
Congressional action, we risk severely crippling these counties' ability to
operate." "PILT and SRS allow the federal government to meet its
long-standing obligations to counties with federal land. It is imperative that we
fulfill this duty."
