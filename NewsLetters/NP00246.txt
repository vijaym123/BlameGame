Agriculture, Business leaders praise Abraham's vote for TPA
WASHINGTON
Business and agriculture leaders throughout Louisiana
praised Congressman Ralph Abraham, M.D., R-Alto, for voting in favor of
Trade Promotion Authority on Friday.
TPA is a procedural step in which Congress designates the President as
the point-person for the United States in international trade
negotiations. Congress did not ratify any new trade agreements with the
TPA vote.
Though TPA has been in existence in some form dating back to President
Franklin Roosevelt, the latest version of TPA imposes more restrictions
on the President and gives Congress more authority over trade
negotiations than ever before.
The new version of TPA gives Congress the ability to set negotiating
objectives, requires the President to publish summaries throughout
negotiations, allows members of Congress to read proposed negotiations,
and requires the President to publish proposed final agreements for 60
days so that members of the public can provide their input on the deal
before Congress gives it an up or down vote. Without TPA, the President
would have complete authority over all negotiations.
I voted for TPA because I wanted Congress to set the standards for our
new trade agreements, not President Obama. New trade agreements will
open Louisianas markets to new territory and strengthen our economy.
Had we not granted TPA, the President would have had complete control
over the process, and that isnt a scenario I trust. With the new
restrictions, Congress and the American people will have the greatest
say in crafting our new trade policies, Dr. Abraham said.
The opportunity for Louisiana to ship its products to new markets
received immediate praise from some of the 5th Congressional Districts
leading voices on economic development.
Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture Mike Strain had urged members of
Congress to support the legislation because trade with Asian and
European nations will allow Louisiana farmers to reach more than 1
billion new customers in regions representing 65 percent of the global
gross domestic product.
Louisiana and American agriculture and forestry desperately needs the
ability to maximize trade negotiations worldwide to get the best
possible results for American workers, farmers, and businesses,
consistent with Congressional priorities.
One of every three acres of
American agricultural production are exported, which provides billions
of dollars for our economy and balance of trade.
Ag leaders are
traveling around the world promoting their states unique agricultural
commodities, but trade barriers remain. Without TPA, our leaders will
be unable to negotiate trade agreements in a timely, transparent and
accountable manner, Strain said.
More than 270 national business and agriculture organizations have
signaled their support for TPA because of the potential for new trade
deals that will open new markets and grow the economy.
Some of the agriculture organizations supporting TPA include Louisiana
Farm Bureau Association, Louisiana Cotton and Grain Association,
National Corn Growers Association, National Cattlemens Beef
Association, American Soybean Association, National Association of
Wheat Growers, National Chicken Council, and the National Grain and
Feed Association, among others.
Trade Promotion Authority is vital to ensure that the U.S. can access
new and existing markets for its agricultural products, as almost all
U.S. grown commodities are dependent on exports and trade. An average
of over 80 percent of U.S. cotton production, for example, is exported
to other countries each year. TPA will allow Louisiana and U.S. farmers
to increase exports and compete in a highly competitive, globalized
economy, which will allow American farmers, suppliers, distributors and
their communities to prosper, said David Crigler of the Louisiana
Cotton and Grain Association.
Other countries are moving forward with bilateral and multi-lateral
trade agreements. Without TPA in place, U.S. producers and related
businesses will be greatly disadvantaged relative to those in other
countries. The hard-working farmers in our country stand ready to
continue to efficiently produce high quality food and fiber for global
consumption.
Business organizations have also thrown their support behind Dr.
Abrahams vote for TPA, including some of the districts largest
employers such as Weyerhaeuser and International Paper.
This legislation is vital to economic growth and job creation of
Northeast Louisiana. Exporting goods and services from Louisianas 5th
Congressional District has an annual economic impact of almost $1.5
billion per year and is responsible for the creation of over 9,300
jobs, said Monroe Chamber of Commerce President Sue Nicholson.
Tearing down barriers that have shut out U.S. products in the past
will open new opportunities for Northeast Louisiana manufacturers,
making them more profitable and allowing them to create more jobs. The
creation of more good-paying manufacturing jobs in northeast Louisiana
would be good news to the many low-income individuals who live here.
The Monroe Chamber strongly supports this legislation, and we thank
Congressman Ralph Abraham for his support.
Added Alexandria Chamber of Commerce President Deborah Randolph,
Trade Promotion Authority is a necessary tool to help sell U.S. goods
and services to the 95% of the customers living outside of our country.
The clear winners of a new trade agreement would be agriculture and
large manufacturers, including here in Louisiana. We thank Congressman
Ralph Abraham for his courageous support of TPA, which will spur
economic growth and job creation in Louisiana.
Dr. Abraham serves on the House Agriculture Committee and is keenly
aware that Louisiana is uniquely positioned to benefit from shipping
exports to as many markets as our states producers can sell to.
Louisianas rivers and ports make it an ideal state to capitalize on
international trade deals.
For three hundred years, the Port of New Orleans has served as a
vital gateway for waterborne commerce to the world. Passage of TPA is
crucial to the Port of New Orleans and all of Louisianas ports to
expand international trade with partner countries. More than 27 percent
of Louisianas exports are destined to Pacific countries, significantly
contributing to the doubling of Louisiana exports over the past five
years, said Gary LaGrange, President and CEO, Port of New Orleans.

WASHINGTON
&#150;
Business

throughout
Louisiana
praised
Congressman
Ralph
Abraham,
M.D.,
R-Alto,
for
voting
in
favor
of
Trade
Promotion
Authority
on

TPA
is
a

step
in
which
Congress
designates
the
President

the
United

in
international

the
latest
version
of
TPA
imposes
more
restrictions
on
the
President
and
gives
Congress
more
authority
over

than
ever

The

New

and
strengthen
our

Had
we
not

the
President
would
have
had
complete
control
over
the

and
that

I
trust.
With
the
new

Congress
and
the
American
people
will

Dr.
Abraham
said.
The
opportunity
for
Louisiana

to
new
markets
received
immediate
praise
from
some
of
the
5th
Congressional
District&#146;s
leading

development.
Louisiana
Commissioner
of
Agriculture
Mike
Strain
had
urged
members
of
Congress
to
support
the
legislation
because
trade
with
Asian
and
European
nations
will
allow
Louisiana
farmers
to
reach
more
than
1
billion
new
customers
in
regions
representing
65
percent
of
the
global
gross
domestic
product.
&#147; Louisiana
and
American
agriculture
and
forestry
desperately
needs
the
ability
to
maximize
trade
negotiations
worldwide
to
get
the
best
possible
results
for
American
workers,
farmers,
and
businesses,
consistent
with
Congressional
priorities.
One
of
every
three
acres
of
American
agricultural
production
are
exported,
which
provides
billions
of
dollars
for
our
economy
and
balance
of
trade.
Ag
leaders
are
traveling
around
the
world
promoting
their
state&#146;s
unique
agricultural
commodities,
but
trade
barriers
remain.
Without
TPA,
our
leaders
will
be
unable
to
negotiate
trade
agreements
in
a
timely,
transparent
and
accountable
manner,&#148;
Strain
said.
More

national
business
and
agriculture
organizations
have
signaled
their
support
for
TPA
because
of
the
potential
for
new
trade
deals
that
will
open
new
markets
and
grow
the
economy.
Some
of

include
Louisiana
Farm
Bureau
Association,
Louisiana
Cotton
and
Grain
Association,
National
Corn
Growers
Association,
National
Cattlemen&#146;s
Beef
Association,
American
Soybean
Association,
National
Association
of
Wheat
Growers,
National
Chicken
Council,
and
the
National
Grain
and
Feed
Association,
among
others.
&#147;Trade
Promotion
Authority
is
vital
to
ensure
that
the
U.S.
can
access
new
and
existing
markets
for
its
agricultural
products,
as
almost
all
U.S.
grown
commodities
are
dependent
on
exports
and
trade.
An
average
of
over
80
percent
of
U.S.
cotton
production,
for
example,
is
exported
to
other
countries
each
year.
TPA
will
allow
Louisiana
and
U.S.
farmers
to
increase
exports
and
compete
in
a
highly
competitive,
globalized
economy,
which
will
allow
American
farmers,
suppliers,
distributors
and
their
communities
to
prosper,&#148;
said
David
Crigler
of
the
Louisiana
Cotton
and
Grain
Association.
&#147;Other
countries
are
moving
forward
with
bilateral
and
multi-lateral
trade
agreements.
Without
TPA
in
place,
U.S.
producers
and
related
businesses
will
be
greatly
disadvantaged
relative
to
those
in
other
countries.
The
hard-working
farmers
in
our
country
stand

to
continue
to
efficiently
produce
high
quality
food
and
fiber
for
global
consumption.&#148;
Business
organizations
have
also
thrown
their
support
behind
Dr.
Abraham&#146;s
vote
for
TPA,
including
some
of
the
district&#146;s
largest
employers
such
as
Weyerhaeuser
and
International
Paper.
&#147;This
legislation
is
vital
to
economic
growth
and
job
creation
of
Northeast
Louisiana.
Exporting
goods
and
services
from
Louisiana&#146;s
5 th
Congressional
District
has
an
annual
economic
impact
of
almost
$1.5
billion
per
year
and
is
responsible
for
the
creation
of
over
9,300
jobs,&#148;
said
Monroe
Chamber
of
Commerce
President
Sue
Nicholson.
&#147;Tearing
down
barriers
that
have
shut
out
U.S.
products
in
the
past
will
open
new
opportunities
for
Northeast
Louisiana
manufacturers,
making
them
more
profitable
and
allowing
them
to
create
more
jobs.
The
creation
of
more
good-paying
manufacturing
jobs
in
northeast
Louisiana
would
be
good
news
to
the
many
low-income
individuals
who
live
here.
The
Monroe
Chamber
strongly
supports
this
legislation,
and
we
thank
Congressman
Ralph
Abraham
for
his
support.&#148;
Added
Alexandria
Chamber
of
Commerce
President
Deborah
Randolph,
&#147;Trade
Promotion
Authority
is
a
necessary
tool
to
help
sell
U.S.
goods
and
services
to
the
95%
of
the
customers
living
outside
of
our
country.
The
clear
winners
of
a
new
trade
agreement
would
be
agriculture
and
large
manufacturers,
including
here
in
Louisiana.
We
thank
Congressman
Ralph
Abraham
for
his
courageous
support
of
TPA,
which
will
spur
economic
growth
and
job
creation
in
Louisiana.&#148;
Dr.
Abraham
serves
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
and
is
keenly
aware
that
Louisiana
is
uniquely
positioned
to
benefit
from
shipping
exports
to
as
many
markets
as
our
state&#146;s
producers
can
sell
to.
Louisiana&#146;s
rivers
and
ports
make
it
an
ideal
state
to
capitalize
on
international
trade
deals.
&#147;For
three
hundred
years,
the
Port
of
New
Orleans
has
served
as
a
vital
gateway
for
waterborne
commerce
to
the
world.
Passage
of
TPA
is
crucial
to
the
Port
of
New
Orleans
and
all
of
Louisiana&#146;s
ports
to
expand
international
trade
with
partner
countries.
More
than
27
percent
of
Louisiana&#146;s
exports
are
destined
to
Pacific
countries,
significantly
contributing
to
the
doubling
of
Louisiana
exports
over
the
past
five
years,&#148;
said
Gary
LaGrange,
President
and

Port
of
New
