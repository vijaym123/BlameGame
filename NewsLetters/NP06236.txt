Dear Friend,
By now, you know what&rsquo;s at stake in this year&rsquo;s elections. You know that most pundits are predicting a GOP takeover of the United States Senate on November 4th.
So I&rsquo;ll cut right to the chase --
we need money to fuel our campaign against these guys. This month, we need to raise $145,000 to stay on track for victory in November. And right now, we&rsquo;re still short -- can you get us $5 closer to our goal?

Or donate another amount.
Republicans in Massachusetts are mounting challenges up and down the ballot. They&rsquo;re motivated, they&rsquo;re committed, and they&rsquo;re chomping at the bit to cast their votes.
We need to turn out our Democratic allies on Election Day, but we also need to convince Massachusetts voters that our pro-middle class priorities are right for them. And to reach them, we need money. If you can chip in $5 before the FEC deadline this month, it will help us run the kind of campaign Massachusetts deserves.
Thank you.
