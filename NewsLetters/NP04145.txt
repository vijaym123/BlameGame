Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is a time to give thanks for the harvest and express gratitude for the blessings in your life. Its about spending time with your family and loved ones. Its about giving back and giving thanks.
As Americans, we have much to be thankful for. Each day we wake up in the greatest country in the world
truly the land of opportunity. Were blessed with a peaceful governing process where citizens are given the privilege of electing their leaders to serve them. I am thankful for the opportunity to serve the First District and represent you in Congress.
This Thanksgiving, I am saying a special prayer for the men and women who serve our country in the Armed Forces, without whom none of these freedoms would be possible. They cannot be with their families and friends here in the States, but they should be in our thoughts and prayers.
Feel free to contact my office if we can be of assistance to you or your family. Our contact information can be found on our website,
