Dear Friends,
Social Security is not an entitlement &ndash; it is insurance that you&rsquo;ve paid into in order to fund retirement, disability, and survivor benefits earned through a lifetime of work.
Social Security has strengthened the fabric of this country and helped build our middle class.
For two-thirds of retirees, Social Security makes up over half of their income and in the First District 137,000 residents receive benefits.
As your representative in Congress, I believe in doing all I can to strengthen Social Security for our seniors today and ensuring Social Security will be there for our children and grandchildren tomorrow.
On Monday, June 16th, I will visit the East Hartford Senior Center to announce my comprehensive proposal to strengthen current Social Security benefits while keeping the program strong through the end of the 21st-century .
