New York Times:
Republican Idiocy on Iran
The Republicans are so determined to insult President Obama that they sent a letter to Iran to undermine him.
It&rsquo;s not only monumentally disrespectful, it&rsquo;s dangerously dumb. The New York Times reports that the Republicans&rsquo; letter was &ldquo;disgraceful and irresponsible&rdquo; &ndash; they even call it &ldquo;IDIOCY.&rdquo;
You&rsquo;re a strong Democrat, and that means you simply can&rsquo;t let the GOP run over your President right now.
By MIDNIGHT, we still need $100,000 for our Republican Accountability Fund to get the word out.
If you are an Obama supporter, this is the most important moment IN HISTORY to have his back.
You CAN&rsquo;T let the GOP sabotage him.
