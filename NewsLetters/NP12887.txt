Dear Friend:
Last
Friday, I hosted a lunch for unemployed workers in our area with my
colleague Gary Peters.
We wanted to highlight the stories of
job-seeking Michiganders as part of our effort to convince the Republican
Majority in the U.S. House to restart the Federal Emergency Unemployment
Compensation program, which ended on December
28th.
As of last Friday, 1.6 Million Americans
are without this vital lifeline while they look for work.
One of
them is Josie Maisano from St. Clair Shores.
Josie felt so strongly
that she prepared a letter to read at the lunch.
She told us a
compelling story of working her entire life as an Administrative Assistant
in the automotive industry for both GM and Chrysler.
She spoke
of going back to school to get a certificate as a legal secretary and
finding it difficult to get a job in a new field without
experience.
She told us how hard
she has looked to find work since being laid off from a local mortgage
company seven months ago, how there are always at least 20 people
looking for the same job.
She also told us how important unemployment insurance has been during
this downturn.
Even with an average benefit of just $293.92 a
week it helps to pay the bills and keep her afloat as she looks for
work.
Now Josies bills are not being paid, and she is worried
about staying in her house.
I am convinced that if every Member of Congress would meet with
unemployed workers, like Josie, in their District
or if the unemployed
were able to come to D.C.
we would re-start the program
immediately.
So I asked Josie
to be my guest at the State of the Union address.
She will
join other unemployed workers from around the country in the balcony of
the Floor of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
She said of this trip, I hope I will play
an integral part in getting this important issue passed as it affects
not only me, but so many others as well!

Thank you Josie for being willing to
speak out on behalf of 1.6 million
Americans.
If you have a story about how
unemployment insurance impacts you, your family, or community, please
share it with us
