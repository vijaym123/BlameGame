Congressional Report -- Week of April 21-25: Thomas
Steigerwald, of Uvalde, Performs at Kennedy Center
Hello Friend,
I spent the week traveling the 23rd District of Texas and visiting with
constituents in Ward, Winkler, Crane, Upton, Jeff Davis, Presidio,
Brewster, El Paso, Bexar, Maverick, Zavala, Uvalde and Reeves counties.
The two week district work period has given me a great opportunity to
touch base folks across CD23. On Monday, I head to Washington, D.C.,
for meetings of the Armed Services and Agriculture Committees in the
House of Representatives. I'll send an update next Saturday to let you
know how the week went.

School Library Month
This month is School Library Month where we take particular notice of
how important it is to put good books in the hands of our children.
School libraries in Texas and across the country play an invaluable
role in educating our kids.
Through the Library of Congress Book Surplus Program, I distribute
books to schools and libraries across the 23rd District of Texas. If
your school or library would like to participate in this program,
please get in touch with our staff or contact us directly at
www.gallego.house.gov. To watch the video I recorded on School Library
Month, click here

Thomas Steigerwald, of Uvalde, Performs at Kennedy Center
Thomas Steigerwald, a constituent from Uvalde, Texas, performed at the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in nation's capital on
Wednesday, April 23.
To my knowledge, Thomas is the first person from home to perform at the
Kennedy Center during my tenure in Congress. The Kennedy Center is one
of the nation's preeminent stages. An invitation to perform at the
Kennedy Center is a tremendous achievement in and of itself.
Knowing young people from across the 23rd District of Texas are
achieving great success in arts, humanities, science, mathematics and
engineering makes me even more proud of CD23. Thomas' story is
motivational for all of us - and teaches us to follow our dreams
because anything is possible. Congratulations and best of luck, Thomas!

Met with first responders, police officers and firefighters in Eagle
Pass.
Child Abuse Prevention Month
I often tell people how much my life changed the day that I held my son
for the very first time. He was seven pounds and seven ounces and it is
a moment indelibly etched in my mind. As a parent, I care deeply about
the well-being of kids whether in the 23rd District of Texas or
anywhere in our nation.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month. During April, let's make a
concerted effort to build better communities and to be better parents.
A good community and safe environment are key to preventing child abuse
and neglect.
Texans have access to many resources to protect our kids. You can call
(800) 252-5400 to report suspected child abuse or to report a child in
dangerous living conditions. To watch a short video I recorded on Child
Abuse Prevention Month, click here

Community Health Center Development Inc. in Uvalde Receives $1.2
Million Grant
Community Health Development, Inc., in Uvalde County received
$1,201,415 in federal funds. The federal grant will help integrate
primary care and behavioral health care at their clinics in Texas.
Our communities are in great need of behavioral health services since
so few currently exist. And, mental,health is just as important as
physical health. Through these federal funds, people suffering from
mental health issues can access resources through Community Health
Development, Inc. For more on the federal grant, click here
.
Lastly, as always, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If
I can help you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of
our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've
never been a big fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part
of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
