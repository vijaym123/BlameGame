Friends,
I hope
you are doing well. I am reaching out to get your opinion on a piece
of legislation we will soon be voting on in
Congress.
Well be voting on something called "fast track" authority -
which would give the President the power to negotiate free trade
agreements with other countries.
Congress would
not have the ability to change the terms of a deal, we would only be
able to vote to approve or reject the deal.
So, I want to hear from you:
Do you think I should vote to give
the President this "fast track" authority?

Congressman Dave
