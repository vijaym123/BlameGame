Rubio Celebrates Independence Day
Watch Marcos video message
honoring the Fourth of July

. His message is below:
Family time, barbeques, spending time
at the beach and by the pool, and
watching fireworks
these are some
of the first things that come to mind
when we think of the Fourth of July.
But its important to remember
why Americans celebrate this special
day.
Exactly 238 years ago, our founding
fathers courageously signed the
Declaration of Independence. They risked
their lives to establish a new nation
that would be guided by the principles of
democracy and freedom.
Over the next two centuries, Americans
would come to prove that self-governance
is not just possible, but also very
valuable. America would become a
unique place where opportunity and hard
work paved the way for anyone from
anywhere to achieve a better life for
themselves and their families
to
live the American Dream.
But today is not just a day to
remember our past; its also a day
to look forward toward our future.
In a world where innovation and
technology provide an economic landscape
much different than the past, the new
opportunities of this century are
endless. And we must look forward to
meeting the challenges of making the 21
st
century another American
century.
Today, we celebrate America and the
values that make our country so
unique.
I wish all Americans a safe and happy
Fourth of July, especially the Floridians
who I have the honor of serving. And
thank all of you our brave
servicemen and women
who are
defending the values that America has
long stood for.
May God bless you and your families.
May God bless the great state of Florida.
And may God always bless the United
States of America.
