Dear Friend,
For the last three months I've been working with the rest of our
congressional delegation to reverse the U.S. Coast Guard's decision to
close the helicopter station in Newport, Oregon. And this week, we were
able to provide a holiday gift to the Newport community by passing
legislation that ensures the Newport helicopter stays in Newport for
another year.
This helicopter has been a literal lifesaver for our coastal
communities and it's ridiculous that the U.S. Coast Guard was even
considering this closure. It's essential to the safety of fishermen,
recreational boaters, and tourists on our coast that we have lifesaving
facilities nearby when the distress call comes.
When the Coast Guard decision came down, the local community was
outraged and immediately organized to reverse the decision.
While the
Coast Guard claimed that it would still be able to meet the national
standard of a two-hour search-and-rescue response time, local fishermen
and their families and other Central Coast residents who depend on the
rescue helicopters made a very vocal and very powerful case that
closure of the air station would put people's lives at risk.
In fact,
just a few weeks ago, this helicopter was involved in helping rescue
five fishermen off the Oregon coast whose boat was sinking.
So last month, I teamed up with members of our Oregon delegation,
Senators Tim Scott and Lindsay Graham and Representatives Mark Sanford
and Tom Rice of South Carolina, and Representative Duncan Hunter of
California to urge the Department of Homeland Security to reverse the
Coast Guard's decision. This bipartisan letter came on the heels of a
letter to and phone call I had with the Commandant of the Coast Guard
urging him to keep the helicopter in Newport.
The initial closure date
was pushed back by a few weeks, with that extra time, we were able to
pass a law requiring the Coast Guard to keep the air station open.
The fishermen and their families, civic leaders, and others whose lives
and livelihoods depend on safety on the water fought hard for this win
and earned it.
We need to keep the Newport helicopter right where it
belongs: in Newport.
All my best,
Jeff
