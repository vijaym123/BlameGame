Dr. Dan Says New Emission Goals Will Cost Michigan Jobs
Benishek, Stabenow Celebrate Dedication of Sleeping Bear Wilderness
Dear Friends,
It was great being back in Northern Michigan this past week!
On
Monday, I took part in a Business Leaders Roundtable in Petoskey, where
we discussed issues important to small businesses in Northern Michigan.
We also visited Grand Traverse Industries in Traverse City, as well as
Shoreline Fruit in Williamsburg to learn about the great work they are
doing.
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.

Michigan's First District
Fighting for the Iron Mountain VA
As a former VA surgeon who worked at the Iron Mountain facility for 20
years, I have seen firsthand how Washington bureaucracy gets in the way
of taking care of those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.
The recent actions that took place at the Iron Mountain VA, where
religious items have been covered up, is just another example of the
VA's misplaced priorities.
While veterans across the country are
dying, the VA is more concerned with spending time, energy and
resources on political correctness than care for our nation's heroes.

Grand Traverse Industries
Here I am catching up with local business owner Steve Perdue of Grand
Traverse Industries.
Mr. Perdue manufactures products in Traverse City
while employing local citizens with disabilities.

his company and products visit their website here

Keep up the great work!
Onekama School Visit
It was great meeting with Onekama Elementary School fourth grade
students this week to talk about my experiences as a Congressman and
learn about their perspectives on American government!
Shoreline Fruit
This week I was honored to visit Shoreline Fruit, which began in the
1960's as a few acres of leased orchards.
Today Shoreline Fruit has
grown into the largest tart cherry operation in Northern America, and
their cooperative of growers typically harvests over 25 million pounds
of Montmorency tart cherries per year.
As the "Cherry Capital," it is
great to see this local Michigan product thrive!
Visit their website here

I want to hear your thoughts on how to best represent Northern
Michigan, so please call me at 202-225-4735 or send me an email through
my website at www.benishek.house.gov
