Dear Friend,
Last week, I announced my new bill to help clean-up old industrial
sites and helped clean-up the Farmington River. Here are a few
highlights from the week.
Happy Earth Day!
I proudly joined volunteers during Farmington's Earth Day clean-up this
past Saturday. Despite the weather, we picked up 155 pounds of trash
along the Farmington River. I'm planning to join in a clean-up effort
at Fulton Park in Waterbury this Sunday. Remember, every day is Earth
Day!
My Bill to Clean-up Old Industrial Sites
I hear over and over again from local leaders and business owners that
one of the best ways we can revitalize our cities and towns is to clean
up brownfields. The redevelopment of brownfields, typically old
industrial sites, pose serious environmental concerns and costs.
Properly done, brownfield remediation projects will turn eyesores into
job-creating assets that contribute to economic growth in our
communities. I'm doing what I can to be a strong partner in these
efforts, which is why I introduced the bipartisan Brownfields
Redevelopment Tax Incentive Reauthorization Act with Rep. Chris Gibson
(R-NY). My bill will encourage private sector investment to clean-up
these sites. Check out this Danbury News-Time article on my bill
.
Community Conversation on the Heroin
I hosted a conversation in Waterbury with Waterbury Mayor Neil O'Leary,
Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone, local law enforcement, and public
health professionals on the concerning rise of heroin abuse in our
communities. Last year, 257 Connecticut residents died from heroin
overdose. We discussed ways to address the underlying issues of
substance abuse, including how to address the fact that prescription
pain killers are often a gateway to heroin. I'm also working with the
Food and Drug Administration to allow an important drug called Narcan,
which reverses overdoses, to be sold over-the-counter and working with
state and local officials to make sure that all first responders have
access to this life-saving medication. Seconds matter when saving
lives. Check out the Torrington Register-Citizen article on the
conversation
.
If your friend or loved one is struggling with a heroin or other drug
addiction, please visit the Connecticut Department of Mental Health &
Addiction Services
or call
860-418-7000 for helpful information.
Additionally, prescription drugs left unattended or forgotten in family
medicine cabinets can be abused. Unfortunately, experts now say that
formerly common methods for disposing these unused medicines-such as
flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash-both pose
safety and health hazards. While last weekend was National Prescription
Drug Take-Back Day
, families can take unused or unwanted
prescription drugs to police stations any time.

Facebook page

or at 860-223-8412. I look forward to hearing
from you.

Dear

Last
week,
I
announced
my
new

to
help
clean-up
old

and
helped
clean-up
the
Farmington

Here

Happy

Despite
the

we
picked
up
155
pounds
of
trash
along
the
Farmington
River.
I&#8217;m
planning
to
join
in
a
clean-up
effort
at
Fulton
Park
in
Waterbury
this
Sunday.
Remember,
every
