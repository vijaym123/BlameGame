Dear David,
Last night, I was extremely
honored to have Kim Evans of Camarillo as my guest at the State of the
Union address. As the founder and director of the Ventura County
Military Collaborative, Kim is a tireless advocate for veterans acros s our community, working to ensure they are
connected to the care and services they need. Additionally, Kim works
as a therapist for the Army National Guard Unit and as the Director
of Psychological Health for the 146th Airlift Wing at Point Mugu. I was
pleased to welcome her to Washington for this very special
occasion.
Congresswoman Brownley and Kim Evans of Camarillo, founder and director
of the Ventura County Military Collaborative, meet and discuss veterans
issues before attending the State of the
Union.
During the State of the
Union, I was pleased to hear the President call for raising the minimum
wage, for ending gender-based pay discrimination, and his ideas to reduce
the cost of higher education and to prepare our students for the
high-paying jobs of the 21st-century global
economy.
As a new Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, I share the President's optimism that we can find bipartisan
solutions to dealing with our aging infrastructure, which will create
jobs and help move our economy forward.
I hope that my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle can find agreement on the common
concerns we share, and that we can work together toward finding
solutions that help the middle class, working families, and our job
creators. The American people deserve no less.
It is an honor
to be your advocate in
Congress.
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
