Although Mother
Nature has not quite decided, the calendar tells us spring is here. We
welcome the hope of warmer weather, a chance to put away those winter
coats, and plan a trip to the park with the children or grandchildren. And
as the season changes to warm, welcoming weather, along comes a day
and topic that, to some, may not be so welcoming: Tax
Day.
Every year, April brings the deadline to
file
your tax return . Many Virginians have completed their paperwork
and sent off a check to the federal government. But do you question
where your money is allocated? Do you wonder if the IRS is being fair and
impartial to each taxpayer? Do you believe that Washington spends your
money wisely and with prudence?
Like many
Americans, I believe government spending is out-of-control. We have lost faith
in institutions such as the IRS as we listen to testimony of citizens
citing solid proof of the targeting of certain groups based upon
their beliefs. Like many Americans, I believe taxpayers deserve better,
and they deserve a simpler, fairer tax code.
According to the
non-partisan Tax Foundation, hard working taxpayers across Virginia worked
from January 1, 2013 until April 20, 2013,
to pay
their share of taxes
for the year before they began working for
themselves. Some are struggling and sacrificing to provide for their
families. We must encourage Washington to do
better.
Thats why I support legislation to reform federal spending, such as the
Balanced Budget Amendment, to ensure Washington doesnt spend more
than it brings in. I have
cosponsored H.R. 1950 ,
which would make it a crime for IRS employees to conduct targeted
discrimination and would increase the maximum penalty for discriminatory
misconduct against taxpayers from termination to criminal punishment. And
I support the
Fair Tax Act , which would repeal
the income tax and employment tax, as well as the estate and gift tax,
and replace them with a sales tax on goods and services purchased in
the United States. The rate of this sales tax would be consistent across
the country for every citizen.
Our nation was
founded on the ideas of a representative government that works for its
citizens. As I talk to folks across the First District, they support an
efficient, fair government that does its job. With some hard work, I
believe we can get there.
The main streets of Virginias
First District are full of ideas to get our economy back on track, and
your feedback is critically important to me as I serve you. I can be
reached by telephone at (202) 225-4261, through my website ( www.wittman.house.gov ), on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/reprobwittman ), and
