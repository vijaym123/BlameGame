Dear Friend,
I would like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very happy
holiday season and update you on the latest in Congress.
Many of you have endured feelings of intense frustration with your
healthcare insurance in the last few months. With unexpected increases
in health care costs and a long trail of broken promises, over sixty
percent of Americans now disapprove of ObamaCare. This sense of
disapproval is well warranted.
We need real solutions. Unfortunately, ObamaCare is not a solution to
our nation's health care challenges, especially when we consider that
more Americans are struck by lightning every year than those Arizonans
who signed up for ObamaCare in the first reporting period.
Real health care reform must be based on a free-market approach that
includes market-based solutions that will drive down costs, thereby
increasing competition and patient access to affordable healthcare.
Watch my video where I share my ideas on how to improve our health care
system, here
.
This month, I joined with my colleagues in supporting and passing two
pieces of important energy legislation. Both H.R. 1900, the Natural Gas
Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, and H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands Jobs
and Energy Security Act, will prove instrumental in bringing jobs back
to America, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and lowering energy
prices to help fuel our economic recovery.
Back in the district, it was my pleasure to meet with many of you at
our town hall meetings in Queen Creek and Chandler. Additionally, it
was my honor and privilege to host a Veterans Open House at our
downtown District Office in Gilbert. There, with over 150 veterans in
attendance, we honored their service and discussed those issues that
are most affecting our nation's veterans.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
service and be sure to sign up for my newsletter here
.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
Reacquainting the Administration with the Founding Principle of
Separation of Powers
No president has the authority to unilaterally alter, rewrite, or amend
what is law. I'd like to reintroduce the President to a historical
concept in America called the separation of powers. That is why I am an
original cosponsor to H. Res. 425 that expresses disapproval of what I
believe is the President's failure to "take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed" as required by Article II, Sec. 3 of the
Constitution. If the Administration wants to change ObamaCare, they
must go through Congress and stop violating the separation of powers.

>From the Fifth District
Town halls in Queen Creek and Chandler
Many of you came to my two town halls last month. At the Queen Creek
Public Library, I was honored to join Queen Creek Mayor Gail Barney to
take your questions. Chandler Mayor Jay Tibshraeny joined my town hall
at Faith Family Church in Mesa. A special thank you to the high school
students and Boy Scout troop that attended. Click here

Veterans Day Open House
I hosted an open house for all of Arizona's Fifth Congressional
District veterans in honor of Veterans Day. Over 150 veterans attended
the event at my downtown Gilbert office and we were even able to help a
few with veterans' casework. My staff and I were inspired by their true
humility and stories of service. Click here

Conversation about ObamaCare
I truly enjoyed my conversation about the state of health care in
America and Arizona with the many medical students and health
professionals that attended the event organized by The Arizona
Osteopathic Medical Association at A.T. Still University in Mesa. Click

Arizona Honor Flight Veterans at Phoenix Sky Harbor
I spent a morning this month with Arizona WWII Honor Flight veterans on
their way to visit Washington, D.C.. As the son of a World War II
veteran, I find nothing more rewarding than working to help our
American heroes. May God bless them and all our veterans for the many
sacrifices they made for the sake of our nation. Click here

Neighborhood Office Hours in Mesa and Gilbert
This month, my office hosted neighborhood office hours at Meridian
Elementary School in Mesa, Rock Church East Valley in Gilbert, and the
Mesa Church of Christ. We were able to help many Arizonans with
casework and answer their questions about federal agencies, such as the
Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs. To
learn when my office staff will be in your neighborhood, sign up for my
newsletter here
.
Finley Farms Elementary School Veterans Day Assembly
I had the opportunity to speak at this Gilbert elementary school about
service. Their passion for patriotism was impressive. These students
raised money to reunite soldiers with service dogs, and I was humbled
by their generosity and acts of service for others. It is important
that all Americans remember the sacrifices that our veterans have made
for us.
Constituent Spotlight
Jim Lynskey is a navy veteran who resides in East Mesa.
He dedicates
his free time to helping other veterans navigate the difficulties of
acquiring medical care and veterans' benefits. His gift of time to
other veterans is selfless and kind, and I thank him for his service.

also able to help. Click here

Dear
Friend,
I
would
like
to
take
the
opportunity
to
wish
all
of
you
a
very
happy
holiday
season
and
update
you
on
the
latest
in
Congress.
Many
of
you
have
endured
feelings
of
intense
frustration
with
your
healthcare
insurance
in
the
last
few
months.
With
unexpected
increases
in
health
care
costs
and
a
long
trail
of
broken
promises,
over
sixty
percent
of
Americans
now
disapprove
of
ObamaCare.
This
sense
of
disapproval
is
well
warranted.
We
need
real
solutions.
Unfortunately,
ObamaCare
is
not
a
solution
to
our
nation&#8217;s
health
care
challenges,
especially
when
we
consider
that
more
Americans
are
struck
by
lightning
every
year
than
those
Arizonans
who
signed
up
for
ObamaCare
in
the
first
reporting
period.
Real
health
care
reform
must
be
based
on
a
free-market
approach
that
includes
market-based
solutions
that
will
drive
down
costs,
thereby
increasing
competition
and
patient
access
to
affordable
healthcare.
Watch

I
share
my
ideas
on
how
to

This
month,
I
joined

and
H.R.
1965,
the
Federal
Lands
Jobs
and
Energy
Security
Act,
will
prove
instrumental
in
bringing
jobs
back
to
America,
reducing
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil,
and
lowering
energy
prices
to
help
fuel
our
economic
recovery.
Back
in
the
district,
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
with
many
of
you
at
our

it
was
