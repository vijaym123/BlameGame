The House
Continues to Fight for Jobs
Dear Friend,
Throughout the 113th Congress, the House
of Representatives has maintained a laser
focus on the policies that will create the
conditions needed for more robust job
growth. With many communities in the Fifth
District continuing to experience
unacceptably high unemployment, it has been
very frustrating to see jobs bills pass the
House with significant bipartisan
majorities only to be ignored by the
Senate.
Nevertheless, the House once again led
the way this week by adopting new
job-creating legislation as well as sending
a package of our best, previously-passed
jobs legislation to the Senate to remind
them of their obligation to address these
vital issues. Both of these legislative
packages included bipartisan bills that I
authored to boost economic growth.
On Tuesday, we passed
the
Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act , which combines
the text of 11 bills all of which aim to
reduce the bureaucratic red tape hindering
job growth.
The
Small Company Disclosure Simplification
Act , a bipartisan bill I introduced
with Representative Terri Sewell
(D-Alabama) in March 2014 to remove
duplicative reporting regulations for small
public companies and require the SEC to
perform a cost benefit analysis on the
rules impact on these companies, was
incorporated into this legislation.
Then on Thursday, the House passed
the
Jobs for America Act , which combines
the text of 15 bipartisan bills, all of
which had already passed the House, to
improve conditions necessary for economic
growth. This legislation includes H.R.
1105,
the
Small Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act , a bill I introduced
to reduce unnecessary regulations that
inhibit investments of private capital into
small businesses, allowing them to expand
and create the jobs we so desperately need.
This bill passed with a strong bipartisan
majority back in December, but Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid refuses to even
allow a debate on the measure.
With the passage both of these bills, we
are making it easy as possible for the
Senate to join us in kick-starting the
economy and getting Americans across the
country back to work. I thank my colleagues
in the House for their support of these
commonsense jobs bills, and I urge our
colleagues in the Senate to consider them
and the other dozens of other jobs bills
that remain stuck there.
Update on
ISIL
This week, the House also voted on an
amendment to a spending measure that would
authorize training and arming Syrian rebels
in hopes of their cooperation to combat the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL). I believe that ISIL is a direct
threat to the United States and our
national security, and I fully support the
Presidents ultimate objective of
dismantling and destroying ISIL.
I have grave concerns about the
President's proposal to train and arm
Syrian rebels to fight for our American
interests, but ultimately, I voted against
this amendment because the President has
not requested a broader Authorization for
Use of Military Force from Congress before
he commences a wider and sustained
engagement against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.
The Constitution requires the President to
obtain authorization from Congress to wage
war. The American people and their
representatives in Congress must be
afforded the opportunity to participate in
an honest, open debate as to exactly what
action will be necessary to achieve our
shared objective and exactly what will be
required of the American people and our
brave men and women in uniform if we embark
on this course.
Furthermore, issues of this magnitude
should not be rolled into an unrelated
must-pass spending bill for
the sake of expediency. It is my fervent
hope that the President will immediately
begin the process of seeking congressional
authorization and present a solid plan of
action to destroy ISIL that the American
people and their representatives in
Congress can rally behind.
