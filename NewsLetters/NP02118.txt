This Week in the 13th District
Had a great week traveling around the 13th District listening to constituents to take their concerns back to Congress.
We were in Madison County, Springfield, Champaign-Urbana, and Bloomington-Normal this week. Check out my
Facebook page
to see more of our stops but here's a couple of highlights below.
Thanks to the McLean County Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak at this year's Agriculture Awareness Breakfast in Bloomington.
As you can see from the photo below, it was a packed house.
Really appreciated all of the great questions from students at Canaan Academy in Urbana! I am impressed by what the students, teachers, and administrators have achieved at this school. (pictured below)
Davis Votes to Improve Veterans Care and Hold the VA Accountable
Last week, I voted for H.R. 294 and H.R. 280, two bills to improve care for veteran's and hold the VA accountable.
Despite many of the positive changes made by
legislation passed last Congress
to improve care, veterans are still experiencing delays. Unfortunately, it seems the VA has a lot more work to do before many of our veterans get the care they need, when they need it. I will continue to monitor these changes and help veterans in my district get answers from the VA. These bills are a good step to improving care and holding bad actors within the VA accountable but more needs to be done.

Israeli PM Netanyahu Addresses Congress
Last week, I was honored to attend a Joint Session of Congress where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke.
Prime Minister Netanyahu reminded us how important our allies are and how dangerous our enemies can be. The United States must stand with our ally Israel and support greater sanctions against Iran. I believe preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is not only in the best interest of Israel but critical to the safety and security of the U.S.
House Passes Bipartisan Passenger Rail Reform Bill
Last week, the House passed H.R. 749, the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 by a bipartisan vote of 316-101. H.R. 749 will improve rail grant programs available to states, reduce costs, help leverage private investments, and increase transparency for Amtrak. Specifically, this bill reauthorizes grant programs that can be used to relocate passenger and freight rail lines.
I am pleased by the amount of bipartisan support shown for improving passenger rail.
This bill will enhance our nations passenger rail network by accelerating projects, like the 10th Street rail consolidation project in Springfield, that are critical to improving rail infrastructure. By authorizing funds to be used for freight and passenger rail lines to be relocated to less congested areas, we can help Amtrak improve its service and therefore, maximize the investment made by taxpayers.

While I was in the district this week, the Illinois Wesleyan men's lacrosse team stopped by my DC office so my staff took them around the Capitol. Hope they enjoyed the tour and sorry to have missed it!
