Dear Friend,
With the Republicans mounting a ground game here in Massachusetts, it&rsquo;s clear that
Ed is a target . But when you consider what he&rsquo;s fighting for, that shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise.
Ed Markey is the author of the only comprehensive climate change bill to ever clear a chamber of Congress -- that&rsquo;s bad news for big oil billionaires like the Koch brothers. And all his other work -- from fighting for net neutrality to taking guns off our streets -- means that lots of special interests don&rsquo;t like him. That&rsquo;s why Ed needs our help. Outside groups are on pace to break spending records this year. Can you help our team stay strong with a $5 contribution?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
This election is going to be here before you know it, and missing our fundraising goals isn&rsquo;t an option. We
have
to reach these goals if we want to send Ed back to the Senate and keep the Republicans from taking over. Please, give $5, $10, or whatever you can before our deadline on Sunday.
Thank you.
Colleen
