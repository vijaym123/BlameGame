PEARCE PARTICIPATES
IN
26th ANNUAL BATAAN
MEMORIAL DEATH MARCH
Congressman Steve Pearce joined thousands of participants
to memorialize the brave American and Filipino POWs who
marched at gunpoint -- 65 miles over 6 to 9 days -- from Mariveles, Bataan
to San Fernando, Pampanga. The Bataan Memorial Death March honors
the brave soldiers who defended the islands of Luzon, Corregidor and
the harbor defense forts of the Philippines. They fought in a
malaria-infested region, surviving on half or quarter rations with little or
no medical help. On April 9, 1942, tens of thousands of American and
Filipino soldiers were surrendered to Japanese forces. The Americans
were Army, Army Air Corps, Navy and Marines. Among those seized were
members of the 200th Coast Artillery, and also its spinoff - the 515th of
New Mexico National Guard.
" We must continue to remember the sacrifice at Bataan.
Courage, spirit, grit, patriotism, teamwork and heroism: it all intertwines
in this annual event to remember the price paid by the Defenders of
Bataan and Corregidor who fought tirelessly and then resisted the enemy
even as POWs, suffering the worst
conditions.
We will always remember the great sacrifice that was made
by these true American heroes."
PEARCE BILL TO IMPROVE NATIVE
AMERICAN HOUSING PASSES HOUSE
Rep. Steve Pearce is pleased to announce the bipartisan
passage of the Native American Housing and Self-Determination
Reauthorization Act of 2015, NAHASDA (H.R. 360). With a decisive vote of 297-98,
the House approved increasing access to safe and affordable housing
for Native Americans. In addition to reauthorizing the original 1996
law, H.R. 360 includes a number of reforms that will enhance tribal
self-determination -- allowing communities to focus more on capital and
development -- instead of administrative requirements.
For too long, safe affordable housing and financial
independence have eluded Native American families on tribal lands. This
bill would reverse that trend. From increased access to quality housing,
to lease-to-own programs aimed at providing rural tribes with the
means for self-growth, NAHASDA provides flexibility and independence to
tribal members nationwide, said Pearce.
I am extremely proud to sponsor this legislation, which has been
called transformative by Native American leaders. It takes a major step
forward in eliminating barriers to good housing, and empowers tribal
leaders to respond to their members needs. Id like to thank my
colleagues in the House, who have worked not only to secure passage, but also
to forge truly bipartisan change. Working across the aisle and with
tribal leaders nationwide, we have been able to make real, concrete
reforms sought in their communities.
Pearce
continued: "Our legislation would cut red tape and expand access to
Native American home ownership. These reforms will result in more
efficient, effective and accountable use of taxpayer money, expedite
approval of projects, and spur development and innovation. By providing
Native Americans more housing, we help lay the foundation for greater
dignity and individual self-worth in addition to improving the lives of
the next generation. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass
this legislation.
NAHASDA has allowed
tribes to determine how their housing dollars are spent, and has proven
successful in creating homeownership opportunities that might not
have otherwise existed. In December 2014, the House voted to reauthorize
this important legislation, but a Senate version stalled before the
113th Congress adjourned.
