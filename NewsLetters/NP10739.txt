IRS Fiscal Year 2015 Budget Request "Troubling"
An agency that has targeted groups based on political belief, spent
outrageous amounts of hard-earned taxpayer dollars on lavish
conferences and videos has no business seeking a 10 percent ($1.2
billion) budget increase.
Yet, that's what the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did on Monday when
it presented its fiscal year 2015 budget request to the Financial
Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee.
As Chair
of the panel that spent the better part of 2013 fighting for
accountability from this agency, I have to wonder, 'was anyone
listening?'
Asking for more money for bigger salaries and an elimination of
existing language that expressly prohibits targeting of citizens
carrying out their First Amendment rights only reinforces a sense of
anger and mistrust with this agency. Americans deserve accountability,
and based on what I heard, they're not getting it.
We live in a time when all federal agencies should be doing their fair
share to hold down spending; that includes the IRS, which of all
agencies, should be going the extra mile to present a leaner budget
request. My subcommittee will keep the IRS request under the
microscope, but I think it's fair to say our final bill will not
include their initial request.

Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Naval Station Mayport Projects Funded
Committee-Passed MILCON Bill
Military bases on the First Coast and around the globe anchor our
national security.
My number one priority is to ensure these
facilities and the men and women in uniform based at them have the
resources they need to carry out that central mission.
The Fiscal Year 2015 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Bill (MILCON) passed the full committee
today and accomplishes that goal through efficient use of taxpayer
dollars. Moreover, it ensures that we keep our commitment to funding
military family housing and quality of life services as well as
veterans' benefits and programs.
The only infrastructure projects in the state of Florida included in
this MILCON bill are located in Northeast Florida, underscoring the
region's strategic role to our national security. Construction of a
Littoral Combat Ship operational training facility at Naval Station
Mayport and expansion of the MH-60R helicopter parking apron and
improvements to P-8A taxiways at Naval Air Station Jacksonville are
critical to keeping our Navy forces strong and ready to serve.
I am proud to support these programs and those that our veterans and
military families have earned through years of dedicated service. I
strongly urge all my colleagues to pass the bill when it comes the full
House for a vote.

IRS
Fiscal
Year
2015
Budget
Request
&#8220;Troubling&#8221;
An
agency
that
has
targeted
groups
based
on
political
belief,
spent
outrageous
amounts
of
hard-earned
taxpayer
dollars
on
lavish
conferences
and
videos
has

seeking
a

percent
($1.2
billion)
budget
increase.
Yet,
that&#8217;s
what
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
did
on
Monday
when
it
presented
its
fiscal
year
2015
budget
request
to
the
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
Appropriations
Subcommittee.
As
Chair
of
the
panel
that
spent
the
better
part
of
2013
fighting
for
accountability
from
this
agency,
I
have
to
wonder,
&#8216;was
anyone
listening?&#8217;
Asking
for
more
money
for
bigger
salaries
and
an
elimination
of
existing
language
that
expressly
prohibits
targeting
of
citizens
carrying
out
their
First
Amendment
rights
only
reinforces
a
sense
of
anger
and
mistrust
with
this
agency.
Americans
deserve
accountability,
and
based
on
what
I
heard,
they&#8217;re
not
getting
it.
We
live
in
a
time
when
all
federal
agencies
should
be
doing
their
fair
share
to
hold

that
includes
the
IRS,
which
of

should
be
going

My

will
keep
the
IRS

the
microscope,
but
I
think
it&#8217;s
fair
to
say
our
final

will
not
include
their
