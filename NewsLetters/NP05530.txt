Dear Friends,
Weve reached an anniversary unworthy of celebration
last Octobers disastrous rollout of Obamacare. A year later, this
overreaching federal mandate continues to harm the very people the law was
supposed to help.
The wreckage continues nationwide -- from
the Twin Falls School District here in Idaho to Americas largest
private employer, Wal-Mart. In recent days, both announced that part-time
workers will suffer because of the burden imposed on employers by the
Affordable Care Act.
In Twin Falls, 150 non-professional
staffers had their hours cut to 27.5 per week. Why? Because it would
cost $1 million annually to buy federally-mandated health insurance for
employees working
30 or more hours a week.
Wal-Mart
expects to spend $500 million more on health care this year, up from
the $330 million extra it anticipated earlier in the year. The result is
30,000 part-time workers will lose their company insurance. Wal-Mart
joins a growing list of companies such as Home Depot, Target and
Trader Joes who are being forced to make difficult decisions when it comes
to providing employee health insurance.
These are people
who play by the rules, trying to get ahead. Check-out clerks, cooks,
dishwashers, teachers aides, even coaches.
However, they will
lose their insurance and will be forced to sign up on the Obamacare
exchange. Ultimately, this means they will have to rely on federal
subsidies and the U.S. taxpayer will end up footing the
bill.
President Obamas promise that if you like your plan you can keep it, was
dubbed the lie of the year for 2013 by the independent fact-checker
Politifact. Additional evidence of the administrations breach of
faith with the American people comes from the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office (CBO). Earlier this year, the CBO had to abandon its
effort to assess the overall fiscal impact of Obamacare because of the
myriad of delays and alterations. However, the CBO was still able to
project an often-overlooked hole in Obamacare: In 2024, an estimated 31
million Americans will remain uninsured.
The next enrollment
period begins Nov. 15. Its hard to imagine the 2014 experience being
any worse than 2013. However, I am looking forward to January 2015
when Congress will renew efforts to enact real reform.
In
September, the House passed a bill to allow employers to continue to offer
group plans to workers, even if they dont comply with federal
coverage mandates. The Senate, unfortunately, wont take up our
bill.
When we convene in January, I will support solutions that put
decision making back in the hands of hard-working Americans. That
includes tort reform, expanding health savings accounts, allowing insurance
purchase across state lines and boosting state high-risk pools and
association health plans.
Real reform shouldnt put a
bureaucrat between patients and their healthcare providers. Nor should it raise
taxes on millions of Americans and add thousands of employees to the
federal payroll. Ill support truly free-market solutions that help
Americans own their health insurance.
Like most Americans,
Im tired of broken promises, lost or diminished jobs, canceled
insurance and higher premiums for less coverage. Its time we get reform
right.
As always, please contact me with any questions or
comments.
Thank you ,
