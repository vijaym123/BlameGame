Each one of us can make a difference. The path to clean air, water and reduced emissions and a healthier planet will only take hold if everyone does his or her part.
On this Earth Day 2014, I urge everyone to get involved locally. Whether it's helping clean the South River , supporting the Alcovy Conservation Center , getting engaged with the Georgia Land Conservation Program
or simply cleaning up trash in your neighborhood, let us all rededicate ourselves to the work of conservation.
As a member of the Safe Climate Caucus in the House of Representatives, I'm dedicated to raising environmental awareness in Washington, D.C. and the nation. I'm part of a group of more than 20 members of Congress who regularly speak from the House floor about the importance of addressing climate change.

I'm also proud of my record protecting and enhancing America's National Parks
and gladly accepted their National Friends Award recently.
My support of our national parks goes hand in hand with my participation in the Safe Climate Caucus - it's part of a quest to protect our environment while encouraging the development of renewable sources of energy. The time to address climate change is now and protecting our beautiful planet is the answer.
