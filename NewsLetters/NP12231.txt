I wanted to share with you a
decision
that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued earlier this month.
The question before the court was whether a law-abiding citizen carrying a gun outside the home for self-defense falls within the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.
The court answered in the affirmative, protecting an individuals right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense.
While no one condones the purchase and use of guns by felons or other high-risk individuals to perpetrate any crime, we must not improperly hamper the right of law-abiding citizens to bear arms, or infringe upon rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
Yours in service,
Randy
