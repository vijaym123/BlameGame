I&rsquo;m deeply saddened.
If Congress doesn&rsquo;t act, this will be the first election in 50 years without critical protections from the Voting Rights Act.
David, the right to vote is precious&hellip; even sacred.
That&rsquo;s why in 1963, I marched on Washington with Martin Luther King for the right to vote.
That&rsquo;s why in 1965, I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Alabama for the right to vote. Folks marched for this. Folks fought for this. And some even died for the right to vote.
But today, the vital protections in the Voting Rights Act have been gutted by the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court. Will you stand with me to demand basic voter protections be reinstated?
Voting is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democratic society. And we&rsquo;ve got to use it!
Election Day is in 41 days. Will you demand that Republicans fix the Voting Rights Act? https://action.dccc.org/protect-voting
