Friend,
Things move quickly during campaign season-- which means that our success hinges on our ability to mobilize and respond.
With your help, we have been able to do just that-- concentrate our efforts and launch our own operations.
Thank you for pitching in towards our $5,000 goal!
The generous support of our grassroots team means that we will now have volunteers hitting the streets, talking to voters, and sharing our message of working together to move our country forward.
Our opponents aren&#39;t wasting any time, but we&#39;re ready for them.
Thank you for stepping up to help us counter their efforts.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
If you would like to help us have an even stronger start to our operations this month, you can still pitch in here.
