Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Honorable Benny
Tso, Chairman of the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, to discuss job creation
in Indian Country and building tribal economies. As Chairman, Tso
oversees the day to day operations of the tribal government and the tribal
enterprises, which include the Downtown and Snow Mountain Smoke
Shops, and the award winning Las Vegas Paiute Golf
Resort.
Nevadas economy and the individual Tribes economies are interdependent.
Tourism is our states number one industry and tribes like the Las
Vegas Paiutes play an important and growing part in Nevadas tourism and
economy.
Nevadas Great Basin has always been the home of
the Washoe, Paiute and Western Shoshone Peoples. Their traditions,
languages, and stories are part of a rich cultural fabric that Nevada
shares with America and the world. We must ensure that tribes have the
tools they need to continue to create jobs and develop and strengthen
their communities and their economies.
Senator Reid
meets with the Honorable Benny Tso,
Chairman of the Las Vegas
Paiute Tribe
