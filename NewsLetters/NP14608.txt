Fellow Marylanders:
This month, we celebrate our nation&rsquo;s veterans. These courageous men and women have made countless sacrifices for our country, and they deserve our respect, support, and recognition. As Veterans Day approaches on Monday, November 11, I am working to ensure we honor both our veterans and current servicemembers.
Veterans Economic Opportunity Act
For the last two years, I have aggressively investigated illegal foreclosures, inflated fees, and other abuses by banks against servicemembers, veterans, and their families.
In my opinion, no one is more deserving of our help than our servicemembers who have sacrificed so much.
Under current law, certain servicemembers, veterans with disabilities, and surviving spouses do not receive the protection they need and deserve under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). That&rsquo;s why I introduced
new legislation
- H.R. 1842 makes common-sense improvements that will better protect military families and veterans with disabilities by closing loopholes and providing needed reforms to the SCRA.
Recently, the House Veterans Affairs Committee included my bill in a larger piece of legislation, the Veterans Economic Opportunity Act. That legislation has now passed the House, and I hope that it will soon pass the Senate so that it can be signed into law, and begin working to help our veterans.

Military Diversity
Last month, I also led a panel discussion on the progress made, and the challenges ahead, in improving diversity and inclusion in the military. I have long advocated for diversity in the military and the Coast Guard, from my work in 2009 helping to establish the Military Leadership Diversity Commission to evaluate the promotion of minorities and women in the armed services, to the inclusion of provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 that would enhance diversity and eliminate hazing in the military.
Diversity in our military ensures that our forces remain strong, vibrant, and at their best. I remain dedicated to that goal, and will continue to seek out ways to make it a reality. To watch video of the panel,

As we celebrate the veterans and service members in our lives this month, know that I continue to fight in Congress to support these outstanding men and women.
Happy Veteran&rsquo;s Day to you and your family.
Sincerely,
U.S. Congressman Elijah E. Cummings
Proudly Serving Maryland's 7th District
