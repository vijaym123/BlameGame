Rep. Veasey Statement on House Republicans 56 th
Vote to Repeal ACA
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, released the following statement in regard to H.R. 596, the 56 th
attempt by House Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act:
Today, the House of Representatives will vote on H.R. 596, marking the 56 th
attempt by House Republicans to kick millions of hard-working American families off of their health insurance plans.
Instead of providing any viable solutions to the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans prefer eliminating health coverage for sick children, terminating tax credits that help make insurance more affordable for hard-working middle class families and increasing the healthcare costs for our seniors on Medicare.
It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is working. During the first open enrollment period in 2013, the Affordable Care Act helped over 700,000 Texans sign up for private health insurance.
This year during open enrollment, more than 900,000 Texans have renewed or signed up for affordable health coverage through the federal marketplace. I will continue to encourage Metroplex residents to enroll before the February 15 deadline.
