Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Congratulations to Bill and Grace Underwood on their 70th wedding anniversary! Last week, I had the opportunity to present this amazing couple with a flag that had been flown over the Capitol in their honor. Bill is a World War II veteran, who married Grace when he was 17 years old, and she was 15. It was a pleasure to honor them at the Lake County Adult Day Care Center and recognize them for their faithfulness and contribution to our community.

It was great to see Warrant Officer Rachel Chiles last Monday, and thank her for her service in the US Army. Rachel came to my office when she was applying for training, and met with me regarding her dream to serve our country in the Armed Forces. This spring, Rachel graduated at the top of her class and will be stationed in Germany to serve as a Black Hawk pilot.

At the AVID Orlando Summer Institute earlier this week, I welcomed teachers and administrators in Orlando and interacted with individual groups from both Lake and Orange counties. Dr. David Christiansen provided me an update on the success of the AVID program in Lake county, and it was great to see so many instructors energetically dedicated to making our students successful.

Modeling and simulation has made a big impact on our local economy. This week, my staff attended local briefings in Orlando, and I stopped by the National Modeling &amp; Simulation Coalition Expo in Washington and met with General Steve Seay and others to discuss the industrys impact on job creation in our region. Advanced technology and innovative resources are leading to expanded opportunity and economic growth, and it is important that we continue to support these efforts in Central Florida.

Benjamin Hartle from Montverde came to my office this week while he was attending the Youth Legislative Conference in Washington, hosted by the American Association of Christian Schools. It was a pleasure to talk with Benjamin, answer his questions, and discuss my role in both the community and legislative process. When I returned from Washington, I saw Benjamin and got to meet his parents while I was with my family at Steak 'n Shake on Friday evening.
Several other groups came to my office this week, including:
-	FSU Student Government and Collegiate Veteran Association
-	Susan Moxley, the Lake County School Superintendent
-	Awake America pastors and concerned citizens
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Last year, after filing their 2012 tax returns, a married couple from Winter Garden was informed that a return had already been filed under their personal ID numbers. For over a year, the constituents worked with the IRS in an attempt to resolve this issue. In January of 2014, they were informed that someone was again attempting to file a tax return using their ID.
The constituents contacted my office and expressed their concerns about the new attempt and to receive assistance obtaining their 2012 refund. My office submitted a congressional inquiry to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, and within a few weeks the ID issue was resolved and an adjustment was made on the account allowing the earlier refund to be processed.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Despite the billions of dollars the federal government spends each year on job training programs, millions of high paying positions remain vacant because employers cannot find workers with the necessary skills to fill these openings. A complex patchwork of overlapping job training and education programs makes it nearly impossible for workers to access the one that is right for their individual needs.
We need to modernize and streamline workforce development. Encouraging collaboration between industry, community colleges, and local workforce development boards will ensure that workforce investments are responsive to the jobs that are being created in communities and that employers find the highly trained workers they need to build the dynamic and innovative economy of the future.
This week, I supported H.R. 803, the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act , that organizes the confusing maze of job training opportunities and makes it easier to navigate the system by streamlining the process and eliminating duplicative programs. The legislation provides One-Stop Career Centers with regional coordination of workforce development so workers can immediately access job training opportunities and tailor their skills in order to secure local employment.
Based on performance measures and quality outcome across the portfolio of workforce development, the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
ensures that providers are measured by their success at training workers and moving them into careers rather than simply the number of workers who walk into a center. To find out more about H.R. 803,
