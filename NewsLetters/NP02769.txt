Dear Friend,
It has been a busy
few weeks in Washington as the new Congress continues to keep the
promises we made to you. Since the beginning of February we have passed a
bill to repeal ObamaCare and cleared the way for the completion of
the Keystone XL Pipeline.
I have also introduced bills to help
kids with complex medical conditions and to repeal the 40 year old ban on
crude oil exports.
To learn more about each of the topics
click on the headlines below. Also take time to answer the poll
question to the right so I know what you think about using military force
against ISIS.
