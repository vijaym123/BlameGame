Dear Friends,
This week the Pentagon announced the capture of the alleged terrorist
ringleader of the 2012 attack on our special mission in Benghazi that
resulted in the death of our ambassador and three other Americans. I
spoke about his capture and the ramifications of emboldened Islamic
extremists abroad on Fox News. You can watch the interview below.
The deterioration of Iraq is a direct result of the President's
inability to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi
Government. The Administration must now address this head on with our
partners in the region to prevent terrorists from establishing another
safe haven and to ensure America's sacrifices there have not been in
vain.
This administration is wringing its hands while Iraq is in danger and
its government faces threats from Islamist extremists. President Obama
is not providing leadership. As the situation worsens, the threat of an
unstable Iraq has serious implications for Americans abroad and at
home. I discussed this last Sunday on ABC's "This Week." You can watch
the interview below.
Without financing, terrorism wouldn't have the means to achieve its
goals. One of the main concerns with the Bergdahl-Taliban Five prisoner
exchange was that Qatar, the country where some of the biggest
financiers of terrorism live, helped negotiate the deal and is
responsible for watching the released detainees for the next year. I
spoke about this with Erin Burnett on CNN's "OutFront."
This week I supported legislation that passed the House
to fully fund our
troops and to ensure they have the equipment and funding they need to
carry out their missions both at home and when fighting terrorism
overseas.
I also joined several colleagues in signing a letter to President Obama
about the crisis of unaccompanied minors crossing our border from
Mexico. I urge the president to enforce the immigration laws of this
country and stop this from continuing. You can read the letter here
