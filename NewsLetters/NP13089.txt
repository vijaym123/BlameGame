A
Return to Regular Order in
Congress?
The Ryan/Murray budget agreement that passed in December was hailed
on a bipartisan basis as a return to regular order.
After
shutdowns and showdowns, Congress could once again get back to approving
appropriations bills that cut the deficit and reduce our debt.
I
support a return to regular order and voted for the budget agreement
last month--the first Congress has enacted in 4
years.
However, once again, the House was then asked to sign off on
over $1 trillion in spending on January 15 with less than 48 hours to
review the bill and no opportunity for individual amendments.
There are literally
thousands
of individual issues wrapped into this massive bill that deserve
careful consideration and debate.
The federal government is simply too
large for an omnibus bill to be adequately vetted by Members in a
short period of time, and therefore, I voted against it.
We need
to get back to the regular consideration of 12 separate appropriations
bills with the opportunity for bills to run their course through the
committee process and for amendments to be considered on the House
floorwhich I hope we can do as we begin to consider next years
appropriations.
Obamacare
Oversight
On January 9,
the House passed a
bill
(H.R. 3811) to require that the government immediately notify anyone
whose information has been compromised through a health care exchange.
Our personal information needs to remain private, and this
commonsense bill will ensure that individuals know when their information
has been stolen.
The following week, in order t o improve
transparency during the implementation of Obamacare,
the House passed another bill
(H.R. 3362) on January 16 that
requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide weekly
reports on the status of healthcare.gov.
After the botched rollout
of the website, I think many would agree that we need to be sure
policymakers and the American people can evaluate the progress being made.
These are
commonsense improvements that were
passed with bipartisan
support , and Im glad we were able to move them forward.
Now
it is up to the Senate to move them to the President's
desk.
Coming up
Soon
Farm Bill
-
Negotiators are still hopeful a bipartisan Farm Bill can be
brought to the floor before the end of the month, which is when the current
extension runs out.
By Thursday, January 16, House Agriculture
Committee Chairman Frank Lucas and Ranking Member Collin Peterson
confirmed that they were close to a deal with their Senate counterparts
but that the most contentious provisions were still being discussed.
The disagreement centered around dairy and payment limits on farm
subsidies.
Farmers across America, especially here in Wisconsin,
need the certainty that this Farm Bill would offer, and I hope a final
version will be ready for the House to vote on later this month.

Peace Corps Bill Passes House
with Petri Support, Heads to President's
Desk
On January 13, the House passed
S. 230 and sent it to the President for his signature.
This bill
authorizes the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation to use private
funds to build a memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor the Peace Corps
and the thousands who have carried American ideals to developing
nations around the
world.
As a returned Peace Corps volunteer in Somalia myself, I was proud
to be an original cosponsor of the House version of S. 230, which was
sponsored by Congressman Joe Kennedy III.

bill.
On
January 8, I attended a robotic technology fair in Washington, D.C.,
sponsored by the defense research agency, DARPA.
It was great to
learn how these developing technologies help our injured vets lead
better lives.
I was invited by Kent Pankratz (far right), who I
nominated to West Point in 1982.
He is originally from Manitowoc,
and is now
a contractor for DARPA .
