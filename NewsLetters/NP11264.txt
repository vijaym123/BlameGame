Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Recognizing Women's History Month
Throughout March, people across the nation have taken time to recognize the tremendous contributions of American women in honor of Women's History Month.
Recently, I took some time to recognize one of the 10th District's great women, Gastonia native and UNC women's basketball coach Sylvia Hatchell.
Coach Hatchell has been extremely successful during her tenure in Chapel Hill and it was a pleasure to highlight both her leadership on the court and her bravery off it as she has fought cancer.

Internships With My Office
One of the best ways to learn about our government and the political process is by working in it.
My office offers that chance to high school and college students via internships in my Washington, Hickory, and Gastonia offices.
Those working in Washington have a great chance to learn about the legislative process, while district interns learn about the important role Congressional offices play in assisting our constituents.
Further information about internships with my office can be accessed by clicking the image below.
If you know of a young man or woman that might be interested, please pass this along and encourage them to apply.
Proud to Support
The negative consequences of Obamacare have been numerous and well documented.
One that is often overlooked though, is the impact the law's employer mandate could have on volunteer fire departments.
The mandate's fines could be extremely harmful to these departments, leading them to possibly scale back operations or even close.
Volunteer fire departments are crucial to the safety and well being of millions of Americans living in rural communities, like those in the 10th District.
Last week I was proud to vote for H.R. 3979 to ensure that volunteer firefighters and first responders are not counted as full-time employees under Obamacare.
You can learn more about the legislation, which passed with wide bipartisan support by clicking the image below:
What I Have Been Reading
O-Care Premiums to skyrocket
The Hill
President Obama claimed his healthcare law would decrease healthcare costs for a majority of Americans.
Sadly, like many of the claims associated with Obamacare, that claim has proven false.
North Carolinians who had the plans they liked cancelled are now paying more and that amount will likely increase in 2015 as premiums rise again.
Fiber company's network activation latest in line of county tech developments
Shelby Star
In the tech-driven world we now live, access to high speed internet access is critical and Cleveland County is helping our area keep up.
The article above is a great overview of one project that should greatly increase internet speeds for local residents and how these projects bring needed jobs and investment to the area.

incubator helps launch manufacturing business
Hickory Daily Record
Every day Americans across the country have great ideas for new businesses.
However, many of these people do not have access to the funds or tools needed to get their ideas off the ground.
Fortunately, there are places like small business incubator at the Manufacturing Solutions Center at Catawba Valley Community College to assist, like they did for a local Hickory man.
