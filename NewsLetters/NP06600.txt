Promoting Service
Academies
On Saturday,
I hosted my annual Service Academy Day event.
It featured
representatives from Americas Service Academies and LSU and Southern ROTC
units.
Students who attended learned about what these academies
and programs offer.
If you know a high school student who
is interested in attending a Service Academy, please have them visit my
website .
Securing our Borders
President
Obama said Sunday that he postponed a decision to grant executive
amnesty to illegal immigrants.
The President is again saying he has
no problem bypassing Congress to act on his own and playing politics
with important issues.
He's just saying he'll consider doing it at
a later date.
I voted for legislation in the House to
secure our borders, and I urge the Senate and President to act on this
legislation.
Sanctioning
Venezuela
Last week, I wrote
an op-ed with Florida Senator Marco Rubio for the Lafayette
Daily
Advertiser , in support of U.S. sanctions against
Venezuela.
You can read the op-ed
here .
Thousands of innocent Venezuelans have been jailed and killed for protesting
a failed regime.
The sanctions were unanimously approved by the
House and are designed to punish individuals, not companies.
They would have no effect on U.S. jobs.
I will urge the Senate to
support this legislation.
