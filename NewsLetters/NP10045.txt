YouTube
sensation
Kid President
also known as Robby Novak, 10
to Capitol
Hill yesterday. Following a tour of the U.S. Capitol, Novak toured
Corkers office and spoke with the senator, who was in Tennessee, by
phone.
Our office was proud to welcome Robby, a fellow
Tennessean, to Capitol Hill, said Corker. His focus on making the world a
better place has inspired children and adults all across the country,
and candidly, Washington could learn a thing or two from Robby about
bringing people together. I thank him for the example he is setting and
wish him all the best in the future.
During his visit,
Novak also received a handwritten letter from Senator
Corker.
Weve got some more work to do. Theres still lots of problems
to solve
and youre the guy to do it. Lets keep bringing people
together, wrote Corker in his letter to Kid President.

Housing Finance Reform
Progress
Over five years after taxpayers footed a $188 billion bailout to
rescue mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Senate Banking
Committee on Tuesday announced it will continue discussions and in the
near future vote on the
H ousing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protect Act (S.1217) , a bill
introduced last year by Senators Corker and Mark Warner (D-Va.) and
cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 10 senators.
The work
weve done to craft a bipartisan bill to strengthen our housing finance
system is a model for what can happen when legislators put politics
aside and come to the table committed to solving the big problems
facing our nation, said Corker. After a dozen hearings on housing finance
reform, there is broad bipartisan support to wind down Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac to protect the American taxpayer from future bailouts. I
look forward to continuing constructive talks to finalize the
bill.
In June 2013, Corker and Warner introduced S.1217 to
strengthen Americas housing finance system by replacing government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a privately
capitalized system that preserves market liquidity and protects taxpayers
from future economic downturns.
In 2008, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac were taken into government conservatorship and given a
$188 billion capital injection from taxpayers to stay afloat. As a
result of this bailout, the private market has almost completely
disappeared, and so nearly every loan made in America today comes with a full
government guarantee. Despite this unsustainable situation, there still
has been no real reform to our housing finance system since the
financial crisis.
This week, the Federal Housing Finance Agency
projected that without reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could require
taxpayers to inject $190 billion to keep them afloat during a future
crisis. Read more

Russia Aggression Prevention
Act

At a
news
conference
on Wednesday, Senator Corker, ranking member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senate Republicans announced new
legislation providing a strategic U.S. response to Russian aggression
in Europe, which threatens regional security and prosperity that is
critical for maintaining economic growth in the United
States.
Rather than react to events as they unfold, which has been the
policy of this administration, we need to inflict more direct consequences
on Russia prior to Vladimir Putin taking additional steps that will
be very difficult to undo, said Corker. Our legislation takes a
three-prong approach to prevent the situation from becoming far worse. This
bill will strengthen NATO, impose tough sanctions to deter Russia and
support non-NATO allies of Ukraine, Moldova and
Georgia.

April Jobs
Report
Senator Corker released the following statement on the
jobs report
released yesterday by the Department of
Labor.
I am pleased the economy is showing some concrete signs of
improvement, said Corker. Economic growth leads to good paying jobs
for Tennesseans and families across the country, so Congress and the
administration still must work to put in place sound fiscal policies
that focus on addressing our countrys long-term fiscal solvency and
getting more Americans back into the workplace to unleash sustained
economic growth.
According to the report, the economy added
288,000 jobs in April and the national unemployment rate fell from 6.7
percent to 6.3 percent.
