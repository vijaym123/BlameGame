&ldquo;...the midterms will have major consequences for our nation's politics, particularly if Republicans do retake the upper chamber.&rdquo;
- Washington Post , 10/6/2014
Dear Friend,
We know that Republicans have an advantage right now in the polls. We just don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to stick.
But here&rsquo;s something I do know: I know our organization can make a huge difference for Democrats in Massachusetts and across the country. I know your grassroots support is the key to victory.
And I know that we will not stop fighting until the last precinct closes on Election Day. Help fund our efforts with a $5 contribution in the last month of the campaign.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We all know the battle for the Senate is going to be close -- really close. And we also know that the Koch brothers are spending close to $3OO million to boost their candidates and attack Democrats. Grassroots networks like ours need to redouble our efforts.
We&rsquo;re not going to be able to match the Koch brothers&rsquo; spending, but we can beat them like a drum when it comes to the work we do out in the field. But our field work -- that&rsquo;s all of our GOTV efforts between now and November 4th -- relies on supporters like you. Give our team the resources we need to win by chipping in $5 today.
Thanks for your help.
Colleen
