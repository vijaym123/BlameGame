LEGISLATION
June 21, 2015
Dear David,
This past week, construction on High Speed Rail began in a
29-mile stretch from Madera County to downtown Fresno . This
first stage of construction projects includes several viaducts and a
dozen grade separations. Californias High Speed Rail was described to
voters in 2008
as costing $34
billion to reach from San Francisco to Los Angeles, but today the
section from Fresno to Bakersfield alone is expected to cost
$29 billion . Of the $68 billion total cost,
California just has $13 billion available
far less than the amount
needed to complete the route promised to voters.
Earlier this
month, Rep. Denham and I passed an amendment to
H.R. 2577 , the 2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development Appropriations measure, prohibiting tapered matching, in
which the state spends federal funds without concurrently providing
the required state matching funds until a later date. To learn more,

Please
share your thoughts regarding Californias High Speed Rail with me
below.
The
price tag for High Speed Rail is currently $68 billion. Do you believe
this is a responsible use of Californias revenue? Yes.
No.
Need More Information. If not, what would you
prefer California prioritize funding? California High Speed Rail is set to run 500 miles, stretching from San
Francisco and Sacramento to Los Angeles and San Diego, and has acquired only
one-fifth of over 1, 300 properties it needs to construct phase 1. Do
you believe that the CA High-Speed Rail Authority should have the
ability to seize control of privately owned land, using the power of
eminent domain, in order to build these routes? Yes.
No. Need More Information. Please share any additional
thoughts you may have. *By

district.
May you and your loved ones enjoy a happy Father's
Day!
