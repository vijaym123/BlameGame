Hurricane Hugo 25 Years Later
Hurricane Hugo's landfall in the Lowcountry
twenty-five years ago made an indelible mark on our
state. At the time it was the most damaging hurricane our nation had
ever seen, and we continue to mourn those who lost their lives.
My overwhelming memory of Hugo and the days after, however, is not of
tragedy but of kindness. Not of terror but of friendship. Not of homes
being ripped apart, but of communities coming together. Our state may
have gotten knocked down, but we stood back up, dusted ourselves off,
and worked together to rebuild.
That is what makes South Carolina great, and what makes me proud to
call it home.
Interested in a Military Service Academy?
If so, please come to one of 11 academy nomination information sessions
across the state! More info here
.
Our nation's five service academies continue to produce some of
America's best and brightest service men and women.
I encourage any
South Carolinian interested in serving their country, receiving a
quality college education and developing their leadership skills to
attend one of the workshops or office hours my staff is hosting to
learn more about our nation's service academies and the application
process.
Students interested in being considered for a nomination must submit an
application, SAT/ACT scores, high school transcripts, and three letters
of recommendation by October 31, 2014.
For more information about the
Service Academy nomination process, click here
or call my
Service Academy Coordinator at (803) 771-6112.
Helping Victims of Sexual Assault
I am proud to support the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act
. The act, which supports those who
have suffered sexual assault by easing the backlog of DNA samples from
victims, passed the Senate last week.
People who suffer from sexual assaults must be able to trust that if
they are willing to go through the painful experience of coming
forward, our justice system will do absolutely everything in its power
to bring their attacker to justice, and to make sure that they are not
able to hurt anyone else.
The President should sign this important legislation into law without
delay.
Celebrating our Land
Tomorrow, Saturday, September 27, is National Public Lands Day!
This
is a great opportunity to get out with the family to enjoy any of our
six beautiful national parks
, and all park entrance
fees will be waived.
For anyone looking to get involved, National Public Lands day is also
an opportunity to volunteer on one of the many conservation projects
happening at the parks
in our
state.
South Carolina is truly blessed with amazing natural spaces, and I
encourage you to spend Saturday outside!
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate, and
I encourage to contact me at (843) 727-4525 or email me here
with any suggestions, concerns, or if
we can be of service to you!
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
