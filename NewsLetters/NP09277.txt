FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Rigell Calls on President
to Lead in Solving VA Crisis
Urges replacement of Shinseki; application of sound leadership principles
Washington, D.C.
Representative Scott Rigell (VA-02) released the following statement regarding the interim report released this week by the Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General:
The interim IG report released this week confirmed that the dysfunction of the VA extends well beyond poor patient care.
A perverse culture --- in which patient data is purposely falsified -- has taken hold of the institution whose sole mission is to provide medical care for those who defended our freedom.
No organization can excel when this type of culture takes root.
Given the breadth and severity of the dysfunction, new leadership is required.
While my gratitude for General Shinsekis service to our country is undiminished, I urge the President to replace him immediately.
This problem does not begin or end with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The President, dating back to his presidential campaign in 2008, said he would address issues at the VA, and has failed to do so.
I continue to be alarmed by the mismanagement and lack of accountability that has become a pattern in the Obama Administration. One of the primary roles of the President is to properly oversee and effectively manage the various agencies of the federal government. I urge President Obama, who holds the title and responsibilities of our nations Commander in Chief, to stop the idle talk and his spectator approach to leadership and choose instead to lead, and lead from the front.
I encourage the President to clear his calendar of all extraneous appointments and engage directly in identifying and elevating new leadership for the VA.
He must fully understand the system and reporting failures that led to a cancerous culture of deliberate deception that took hold of such a critical agency charged with such a worthy mission.
To honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans and their families, I ask you to lead, Mr. President.
Lead.
