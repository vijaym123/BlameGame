Dear
Neighbor,
As your Congressman, I occasionally send out e-mail
newsletters to keep you informed on my work in Washington and throughout
Virginias 11 th
District. These e-newsletters cover a variety of
topics ranging from district and community events to legislative
updates.
I am writing to alert you that due to U.S. House of
Representatives rules concerning communication before elections, there will
be an upcoming blackout period beginning August 6th. During this
period, I will be limited in the ways I can communicate with
you.
In order to stay up to date on important information, including my
work on your behalf, I encourage you to
sign
up and opt-in
to receive my e-mails by August 6th. By
opting-in
you will be able to
continue receiving my e-mail newsletter even during the blackout
period. Please know that if you opt-in to receive emails, you can
opt-out at any time.
Click here to
opt-in.
I look forward to keeping you informed of my efforts
in the House on behalf of Northern Virginia.
Sincerely,
Gerald E. Connolly
