Please just take a few seconds to read this:
The big races for Congress are neck-and-neck
Deep-pocketed special interests are giving HUGE sums of money to GOP candidates across the country
Unless we fight back right now, Democrats will be left in the dust
Let me be clear: this isn&rsquo;t just about wins and losses. It's about the policies you and I promised we would fight for -- from raising the minimum wage, to expanding health care access and helping working families get back on their feet.
During my first term in Congress, I've watched the GOP ignore these critical priorities and instead grind our government to a halt. That's not the kind of system I believe in.
So I'm coming to you. Will you please answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action -- while there&rsquo;s still time for us to come out ahead? All Donations to Joe Kennedy&rsquo;s Email
