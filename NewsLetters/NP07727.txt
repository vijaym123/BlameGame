Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Nearly two-hundred
thousand Americans hunt and fish in Nevada every year, bringing over
$1 billion to the state and local economies. People come to Nevada to
hunt for game like antelope, elk, bighorn mountain sheep, and big horn
desert sheep. We dont have a lot of lakes and rivers, but what we do
have is really terrific, and fisherman come from around the country
to fish in Nevada. As a young man, I spent countless hours hunting and
hiking in the Southern Nevada desert and I understand the special
place hunting and angling have in our heritage.
Last week, the
Senate voted on the
Bipartisan Sportmens Act of 2014 . The
sportsmens legislation represented years of bipartisan work, combining
some 20 bills important to the sportsmens community. This legislation
would expand opportunities for sportsmen, promoting an industry that
contributes almost $200 billion annually to our nations
economy.
The Sportmens Act would promote hunting, fishing and
recreation, all while fostering habitat conservation through voluntary
programs. The bill was co-sponsored by 25 Republicans and 19 Democrats, and
had the support of more than 50 national sportsmen and conservation
groups nationwide. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans blocked this
legislation from passing. All 26 Senate Republicans who co-sponsored the bill
actually voted against it. Despite this setback, be assured that I
will continue to work across the aisle to try to get things
done.
I am pleased the Senate confirmed Julin Castro to lead the
Department of Housing and Urban Development last week. Julin worked hard as
Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, to improve the lives of those he served.
I look forward to him putting those talents toward improving the
lives of Nevadans and all Americans. Secretary Castro understands the
challenges faced by our middle class. His experience and leadership will
ensure that Nevadas economy and housing sector continue to recover and
grow.
Last
week, I met with Julin Castro who was confirmed to lead
the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

On July
2 nd , I joined Hispanics In Politics at their monthly breakfast
meeting where I had a great time catching up with old friends, and
speaking about the economy, immigration, and other issues that are
important to the Latino
community.
I had the pleasure of visiting the
new facility of El Mundo Newspaper and meeting with their talented
staff.
Congresswoman Dina Titus and I had a wonderful time
meeting with leaders of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in
Las Vegas where we spoke about the need for commonsense immigration
reform.
