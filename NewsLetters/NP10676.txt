Dear Friend:
Two leading public health organizations - the American Public Health Association (APHA) and National Association of County &amp; City Health Officials (NACCHO) - recently joined me in asking the Obama administration to conduct a comprehensive human health study on the Keystone XL pipeline.

We already know that Keystone XL would worsen climate change, but there has not been enough focus on the human health impacts of tar sands oil and the proposed pipeline.
That is why Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and I
previously
urged Secretary of State John Kerry to not make a decision on Keystone until a thorough study of its human health risks has been completed.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
