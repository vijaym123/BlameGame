Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
It was a pleasure to go to Oakland Avenue Charter School where Youth Eyecare Services (Y.E.S.) launched their Vision &amp; Literacy program last Saturday. The Youth Eyecare Services provide vision exams to the community, with a special emphasis on providing school children with eye care in order to enhance their academic performance in reading and provide the opportunity for success.

Last Saturday evening I was asked to give the keynote address for the Lake County Cattlemans Association Annual Dinner at the Lake County Agricultural Center in Tavares. Agriculture is the backbone of Floridas economy, with food from our farms and ranches being distributed around the world.
This week in Washington, I supported the Agriculture Act of 2014, which eliminated outdated programs and reformed current policies while saving 23 billion taxpayer dollars. The legislation also establishes a trust fund with $25 million in annual funding dedicated to finding a solution for citrus greening. This bill will allow producers to plan for the future while providing relief from onerous regulations, and make federal agriculture guidelines more effective and efficient.

On Sunday, I had the privilege of returning to the New Bethel African American Methodist Episcopal Church in Winter Haven. In August, New Bethel had invited me to join them in celebrating their 105th Anniversary Sunday, and I was happy to accept the recent invitation for their annual pew rally program. It was a pleasure to be a part of this memorable event with their church.

In Washington this week, I welcomed Sherri Brun, representing the National Federation of the Blind of Florida, to my office. Sherri has been to my office before, and we discussed the Fair Wages for Workers with Disabilities Act, which I co-sponsored last year. It has been a privilege to work with the National Federation of the Blind and other local organizations that are assisting those who are visually impaired.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent who my office had assisted last year learned that his brother-in-law had not yet received his refund from the IRS. The brother-in-law, who is also a constituent, contacted my office and we submitted a Congressional inquiry. After review, the IRS found that the delay involved an accounting issue that was quickly resolved and within three weeks, the constituent received the appropriate refund.

Legislative Update:
This week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which I supported and co-sponsored. This legislation does not affect the legality of abortion, but does exactly what its title promises: it reaffirms that tax dollars are not used to support abortions or abortion services.
It prohibits federal funding from being used to purchase health insurance policies that provide elective abortion coverage. The bill also amends Obamacare to prevent the federal government from making employer contributions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program to plans that offer elective abortion coverage.
