Cole Hard Facts:
Budget Negotiations Begin
Along with the short-term funding agreement that reopened the government and protected the full faith and credit of the United States a few weeks ago, lawmakers approved the formation of a budget conference committee. As one of the House Republican conferees, I am encouraged by the opportunity to negotiate real reforms and hope we can work together to find common ground.
Now the challenges we face on this committee are significant. The task ahead will not be easy. But as Ive said before, if we have any chance at a solution, we need to start where we agree. We also need to realize that negotiations dont end in this committee. Rather, the discussion should be the starting point that encourages lawmakers and the president to acknowledge and address our debt.
On Wednesday of this week, we had our first joint meeting between House and Senate conferees. To read my opening remarks from the meeting, click
