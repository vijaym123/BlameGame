Photo of the
Week:
This week we flashed back to this screenshot of the Healthcare.gov
website from October 1, 2013. A year later, the website is up, but
Obamacare is still
broken.
This week marked the
1-year anniversary since the disastrous launch of HealthCare.gov.
According to a CBS/New York Times poll
released two weeks ago, a whopping 51% of Americans still disapprove of
the Affordable Care Act. In this past year alone, millions of
Americans had their preferred plans canceled and premiums triple. Many 2nd
District constituents were hit particularly hard by Obamacare, and I
have worked tirelessly to repeal this law.
Also this week, I
had the opportunity to discuss the Ebola outbreak in an interview
on Newsmax TV . I truly feel the
Obama Administration made a mistake
when they announced Wednesday
that they would not impose any travel
restrictions on individuals entering the U.S. from Ebola-stricken
countries-- despite this being the largest Ebola outbreak in history.
Moving forward, I believe we need to exercise caution by imposing travel
protections on individuals traveling from countries where this epidemic
is most prevalent. We must protect public health and ensure the safety
of all Americans.
Lastly, dont forget to inform your
friends and high school students in the district that applications for
Service Academy Nominations are due on October 31. If you would like
additional information on the application process or have questions, do
not hesitate to call my Dunn Office at
910-230-1910.
It is an honor to be your
voice in Congress, and I hope you will let me know if there is ever
anything I can help you with.
We Are
Here to Serve You

National Manufacturing Day 2014
Members
of my district staff attended events in Lee and Harnett counties on
Friday in celebration of National Manufacturing Day. Mertek Solutions in
Sanford held a Manufacturing Day Open House where attendees,
including many area students, learned more about this important
industry.
In
the photo above, Pat Godwin, Sr., owner of Godwin Manufacturing in
Dunn, speaks at an event his company hosted to celebrate manufacturing in
North Carolina. Governor Pat McCrory and Commerce Secretary Sharon
Decker also spoke at the event.
Listen to My
Interview!
I really enjoyed
speaking with
Ed Berliner on Newsmax TV
this week. I had an opportunity to
discuss my concerns on the Ebola outbreak, and called out the Obama
Administration on their decision not to restrict travel for individuals
entering the U.S. from Ebola-stricken countries.
