[David Johnson] THIS IS AN INSTANT POLL. PLEASE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE IS COUNTED. QUESTION:
Should Congress act to ensure equal pay for men and women?
YES &gt;&gt;
NO &gt;&gt;
David --
It&rsquo;s outrageous that in 2015, women nationwide are still earning only 78 cents for every dollar men earn --
and only 73 cents in our district.
What&rsquo;s even more outrageous: Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans refuse to pass common sense legislation that would help guarantee paycheck equality. Cheri believes it&rsquo;s time for Congress to fix this injustice. But David, we want to hear what you think.
QUESTION:
Should Congress act to ensure equal pay for men and women?
YES &gt;&gt;
NO &gt;&gt;
Cheri is proud to be serving during a time when women have more opportunity than ever before. But we need to make sure that extends to paycheck equality.
That means Congress needs to do its part. David -- do you agree Congress needs to act to ensure paycheck equality?
Thanks for your input.
