Dear
David,
This Tuesday, the President will give his speech on the State of the
Union.
I don't know what he will say, but based on
what he has said in the past, I expect him to tell us that the economy
is improving, that Obamacare is working, and that things are going
well under his administration.
But when I spend time in New Mexico,
talking to people like you, I hear a different story.
On
Tuesday, I hope the President talks about what New Mexicans are talking
about.
New Mexicans want jobs.
We
keep hearing from the White House that the economy is improving, but
just last month, we saw hundreds of thousands of people give up on
looking for work. The labor force participation rate is the lowest it's
been in 36 years.
I don't want the President to give us the silver
lining, I want to know when he is going to admit that his policies
aren't working and consider a different approach to promote
jobs.
New Mexicans want answers about Obamacare.
The President has spent a lot of time trying to convince Americans
that his new law is working, but has kept key details on the rollout
secret.
I voted earlier this month for a bill to require
transparency and accountability in healthcare, but it shouldn't take an act of
Congress to get honest answers.
I've heard from countless New
Mexicans who have lost insurance or seen their premiums go through the
roof--and many who are still struggling to even sign up.
I want to
know how the president is going to make this
right.
New Mexicans want
to get
the
country out of debt.
On a recent telephone town hall, I asked
you what issue is most important to you in 2014.
Over 30
percent of callers answered "Budget and Debt," more than any other
issue.
Addressing our debt must be a top priority if we are ever
going to put our country on the right path.
But the President
continues to promote budgets and spending proposals that keep driving us
deeper into debt.
New Mexicans want immigration
reform.
The President talks a lot about immigration,
but here in New Mexico, we expect more than talk.
We want
solutions.
I've introduced a bipartisan bill with Congressman O'Rourke
from El Paso to address a small piece of the immigration debate.
It's only a start, but I am hopeful that other members of
Congress will come together in the same way.
I welcome the President
to join us in our efforts--this could be the year we really get
something done.
What other issues do you want hear from
the President about on Tuesday?
I want to hear from
you!

I'll be giving my own reaction to the speech on
YouTube immediately following the President's remarks, so be sure to
tune in, or listen on the radio later in the week as I discuss the State
of the Union on "Congressional Review."
God bless you, and
God bless America.
Until next week,
