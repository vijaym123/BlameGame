The FAIR Act: Protecting Property Rights
The month of January is coming to a close, and the House has accomplished a lot in just four weeks. We passed 27 different pieces of legislation in 13 legislative days, focusing on bipartisan bills to grow a healthy economy from the bottom up. I have also been busy in January traveling across south-central Michigan holding constituent coffees, touring small businesses, and meeting with local leaders. Please follow me on
