Hi David,
I hope you&rsquo;re having a nice weekend. I bet it&rsquo;s going differently than mine! Yesterday, Karl Rove&rsquo;s new attack ad hit the Chicago airwaves.
He&rsquo;s committed over $640,000 against me and it&rsquo;s likely just the start.
Look, we&rsquo;re never going to have as much money as right-wing outside groups -- and that&rsquo;s okay. But we need enough resources to spread our message to Illinois voters.
That starts with you, David. So far, over 14,000 supporters own a piece of this campaign. Thank you!
But we need to keep going, because Republican attacks are just getting started.
So quick favor: will you make a small donation today to help us go on offense?

Thanks for having my back,
Brad
