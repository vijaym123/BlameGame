The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of February 24 - 28, 2014
This week, the House approved several measures to hold the Obama
Administration accountable for circumventing Congress and the
constitutional lawmaking process. The Administration's abuse of power
and excessive regulation stifles job creation, weakens our economy, and
threatens Americans' trust in our government.
Currently, total regulatory burden costs Americans nearly $1.8 trillion
per year. In 2013 alone, new federal regulations added $112 billion in
indirect costs to the economy and increased the paperwork burden by
157.9 million hours.
This massive burden of regulation is harming
families and small businesses across our country. Yet, at the end of
2013, the Obama Administration was considering the implementation of
4,000 new federal regulations.
Americans need jobs, not more Washington bureaucracy. That is why I
supported bills this week that are aimed at rolling back red tape,
reining in an out-of-control bureaucracy, and increasing much-needed
transparency and accountability. By getting Washington out of the way,
we can allow the free-enterprise system to flourish and give the
American people the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act
Also this week, the House approved the Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act in response to the recent IRS scandal and new
regulations proposed by the agency. As you may remember, the IRS
blatantly abused its power by intentionally targeting conservative
groups and political opponents of the president.
Now, the IRS has proposed new regulations that would allow for the
continued targeting of non-profit organizations based solely on their
conservative principles. I believe that Americans should not have to
worry about retribution from the Obama Administration for voicing their
opinions and that the IRS should be held responsible for its
politically-motivated behavior.
The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act requires the IRS
to use the same standards for processing applications for tax-exempt
organizations that it used on January 1, 2010, which was before the IRS
began flagging conservative groups for surveillance. Further, this bill
would halt the IRS' regulations until Congress completes its
investigations into the original targeting cases.
I was proud to vote
for this common-sense legislation that will protect North Texans' First
Amendment rights. To read the bill, click here

Texans in DC
While in Washington for legislative business, I always enjoy the
opportunity to meet with constituents that are visiting our nation's
capital.
On Wednesday, I met with representatives from several North
Texas Credit Unions. During our meeting, we discussed the impact of the
growing regulatory burden that is being placed on Texas businesses, as
well as other important issues impacting their industry.

On Thursday, I had the pleasure of meeting with the new President of
Parker University, Dr. Brian McAuley. Parker University is a private,
nonprofit university that offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate
degrees in a number of heath care based programs. This Dallas-based
school is a leading comprehensive institution that focuses on providing
students with the tools needed to be successful in the health care
field. I was happy to have the opportunity to discuss the important
role Parker University plays in North Texas.

National Down Syndrome Society
On Thursday, I was honored to receive the 2014 Champion of Change Award
from the National Down Syndrome Society. The Champion of Change award
recognizes Members of Congress who work as advocates for individuals
with Down syndrome. As the father of a young man with Down syndrome,
Alex, and an active advocate for all individuals with disabilities in
Congress, I have supported multiple legislative initiatives that would
enhance the quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome.

In the 113th Congress, I am proud to again be a co-chair of the Down
Syndrome Caucus, as well as an original co-sponsor of the Achieving a
Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act. The ABLE Act would ease many
financial strains that families face by allowing them to create tax
free savings accounts to cover expenses such as education, housing, and
transportation for their loved ones with intellectual disabilities. I
will continue to support initiatives such as the ABLE Act to ensure
individuals with Down syndrome develop to the best of their abilities.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

A
Weekly
Newsletter
from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week
of
February
24
&#8211;
28,
2014
This
week,
the
House
approved
several
measures
to
hold
the
Obama
Administration
accountable
for
circumventing
Congress
and
the
constitutional
lawmaking
process.
The
Administration&#8217;s
abuse
of
power
and
excessive
regulation
stifles
job
creation,
weakens
our
economy,
and
threatens
Americans&#8217;
trust
in
our
government.
C urrently,
total
regulatory
burden
costs
Americans
nearly
$1.8
trillion
per
year.
In
2013
alone,
new
federal
regulations
added
$112
billion
in
indirect
costs
to
the
economy
and
increased
the
paperwork
burden
by
157.9
million
hours.
This
massive
burden
of
regulation
is
harming
families
and
small
businesses
across
our
country.
Yet,
at
the
end
of
2013,
the
Obama
Administration
was
considering
the
implementation
of
4,000
new
federal
regulations.
Americans
need

not
more

That
is
why
I
supported

this

that
are
aimed
at
rolling

the

Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
Also
this
week,
the
House
approved
the
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
in
response
to
the
recent
IRS
scandal
and
new
regulations
proposed
by
the
agency.
As
you
may
remember,
the
IRS
blatantly
abused
its
power
by
intentionally
targeting
conservative
groups
and
political
opponents
of
the
president.
Now,
the
IRS
has
proposed
new
regulations
that
would
allow
for
the
continued
targeting
of
non-profit
organizations
based
solely
on
their
conservative
principles.
I
believe
that
Americans
should
not
have
to
worry
about
retribution
from
the
Obama
Administration
for
voicing
their
opinions
and
that
the
IRS
should
be
held
responsible
for
its
politically-motivated
behavior.
The
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
requires
the
IRS
to
use
the
same
standards
for
processing
applications
for
tax-exempt
organizations
that
it
used
on
January
1,
2010,
which
was
before
the
IRS
began
flagging
conservative
groups
for
surveillance.
Further,
this
bill
would
halt
the
IRS&#8217;
regulations
until
Congress
completes
its
investigations
into
the
original
targeting
cases.

to
