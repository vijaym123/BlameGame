Legislation
Will Help Prevent Future Meningitis
Outbreaks
Senator Corker made the following statement on Monday after the
Senate passed legislation to make injections of compounded sterile drugs
safer. The bill passed the House of Representatives on September
29.
The improved oversight included in this legislation will
help prevent another deadly meningitis outbreak that infected hundreds of
Americans and killed 16 Tennesseans in 2012. I thank Senator
Alexander for his leadership on this issue and hope the president will quickly
sign these reforms into law, said Corker.
In 2012, in
response to the deadly, nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis linked
to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based New
England Compounding Center (NECC), Corker and Alexander sent a letter to FDA
Commissioner Margaret Hamburg asking for clarity regarding existing
laws governing oversight of compounding pharmacies like NECC and
information about any inspections of NECC and actions taken since the FDA
warned the center in December 2006. A copy of the letter can be
found
here .
Keeping Pressure on
Iran
Following a meeting at the White House on Tuesday with President Obama and top
congressional leaders to discuss ongoing negotiations to halt Irans
path to a nuclear weapon, Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, raised concerns about the Obama
administrations failure to articulate an end-state for the Iranian nuclear
program and said he is still concerned we will trade away our leverage
without ever forcing Iran to fully comply with its existing
international obligations.
On Thursday, Corker introduced a bill
setting conditions for an acceptable final agreement with Iran that would
restrict sanctions relief until Iran agrees to eliminate the threat
of its nuclear program.
Its important for the Senate to
proceed with this debate and keep the pressure on Iran during
negotiations over their illicit nuclear program, said Corker. Many of us have
concerns that an interim agreement in Geneva will diminish U.S.
leverage without Iran meeting its existing international obligations. That
outcome could result in the interim deal becoming the final deal,
legitimizing Irans enrichment activities in violation of numerous U.N.
Security Council resolutions."
Ive offered legislation that
would ensure Iran is in full compliance with any interim agreement and
agrees to the essential terms of an acceptable final deal before the
U.S. could further lift sanctions."

PEPFAR Bill Passes the
Senate
Senator Corker said legislation unanimously passed by the Senate
Tuesday will reinforce PEPFARs (the U.S. President's Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief) success in combating HIV and AIDS globally. PEPFAR was
initiated by President George W. Bush.
PEPFAR has saved
millions of lives in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, and this
legislation will help reinforce those gains as the program transitions from
an emergency U.S.-led effort to one in which recipient countries
increasingly sustain the program themselves, said Corker.
The
PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act , coauthored
by Corker, extends certain program authorities and strengthens
oversight to ensure prevention and treatment services remain available to
those in need.
