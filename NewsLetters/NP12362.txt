As the son of a
Marine, I understand the service and sacrifice made by our veterans.
Though we cannot repay the debt we owe our servicemen and women, it is
critically important we uphold the promises we have made to
them.
That's why I
voted
to restore veterans benefits after the Ryan-Murray budget
forced blunt cuts to their pensions. It was simply irresponsible to pay
for Washington's spending on the backs of our selfless veterans, and it
is critical that we keep our promise to care for our veterans when
they return home. Allowing Washington's priorities to outweigh the
promises weve made to our veterans is not a policy I can support, and
that's why I also helped
introduce
legislation to
restore these cuts.
I firmly
believe that we must maintain the commitment we have made to our
veterans. As youre voice in Congress, it is not only my priority but also
my job to represent your interests as your voice in Washington. Please
take a moment to answer the question below so I can better serve
you.
Do you support restoring the pension cuts forced on our veterans as a
result of the Ryan-Murray budget? Yes - Our veterans should never be forced to sacrifice
their pay for Washington's spending No - These cuts were necessary Unsure *By answering this survey, you are
