January 17th, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week, after years of gridlock, large majorities of both parties in
Congress came together to pass a bipartisan bill to fund the government
through 2014. The bill includes a number of provisions that will help
Memphis and the citizens of the Ninth District, like increased funding
for Head Start programs, Section 8 rental assistance renewals, and the
TIGER grant program which is currently helping fund the Main2Main
project. Keep reading to learn more about the bill and about what else
happened this week.

Working Across Party Lines to Improve Our Country
In any true compromise, no one gets everything they want-and that is
true of the bipartisan government funding agreement that Congress
passed this week. But this bipartisan agreement is a responsible
compromise that reduces the threat of government by crisis, provides
stability for our economy, alleviates some of the crippling effects of
sequestration, and restores funding for our disabled veterans. Many,
including me, don't support every provision in the bill but taken as a
whole it is the right and necessary thing to do for our country.
Observing Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Day of Service with Pastor Kenneth
T. Whalum, Jr.
Monday marks Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, and I will be observing the
Day of Service by collaborating with Pastor Kenneth T. Whalum, Jr. and
Seedco Mid-South to host an education and volunteer training event for
Memphians to learn more about the Affordable Care Act and how they can
help their communities enroll and take advantage of the law's many
benefits. I hope you will join me at Pastor Whalum's New Olivet Baptist
Church (3084 Southern Avenue) from 10 a.m. to noon on Monday (January
20th) to get trained as a volunteer so that you can help make
affordable healthcare a reality for more citizens of the Ninth
District. All citizens should have access to good, affordable health
care.
Extending a Lifeline to the Unemployed
The government funding agreement that was reached this week makes good
progress towards helping Memphians and all of the American people, but
there is still much more we can-and should-do. The agreement did
nothing to help the 1.5 million Americans, including 21,000
Tennesseans, who have lost their unemployment insurance in recent
weeks. We must immediately extend the unemployment insurance program
and extend this critical lifeline for people who have fallen on hard
times. Workers, families and children across this country cannot afford
another day of delay. I will continue to work with my colleagues in
Congress to extend unemployment benefits.
Ensuring the Right to Vote Is Not Infringed
Yesterday, a bipartisan bill was introduced
to fix the portions of the Voting Rights Act that were struck
down by the Supreme Court last year. The right to vote is one of the
most sacred constitutional rights we have, and discrimination based on
race has no place in our electoral process. I am glad that this bill
has been proposed and I have asked to be a sponsor.
Fighting for the National Institutes of Health
While $1 billion in sequestration cuts to the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) that this week's funding agreement restored will help
continue important research into cures for some of the worst diseases
and illnesses known to man, I regret that the NIH was not funded at the
level it should be. As the nation's true "Department of Defense"
against threats to health, the NIH deserves to be protected from all of
sequestration's cuts and its funding should be significant increased. I
will continue doing all that I can to adequately fund the NIH so that
it can fund cures for diseases like cancer, stroke, heart disease,
diabetes and AIDS.
Celebrating the Success of the Tennessee Lottery Scholarship Program
Monday is the 10 year anniversary of the establishment of the Tennessee
Education Lottery. For twenty years as a Tennessee State Senator, I
worked to create the Tennessee Education Lottery and provide
scholarships to help Tennessee students and their families pay for
their college education without amassing burdensome debt It took two
decades, but the lottery to fund the scholarship program was finally
established in January of 2004. Ten years later, the lottery has raised
over $2.8 billion for Tennessee students and has proven itself an
absolute success. Still, lottery scholarships need to be fully funded
as I always intended. It is my hope the legislature will see to it that
fully funded scholarships are at the top of the list for spending
lottery revenues. That's what Tennesseans expect. Before Congress
finished its work for the week, I spoke on the House floor about how
critical it is that we provide our students with opportunities to
improve their lives like the Tennessee Education Lottery. You can watch
my speech here
.
Taking Advantage of the Affordable Care Act
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A
recent New York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer." A primary
reason for the high mortality rate is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. If you are at
risk, please take a moment in the coming weeks to take advantage of
provisions of the Affordable Care Act and get screened for breast
cancer-it can help save your life.
Protecting Taxpayers from Waste, Fraud, and Theft
This week's appropriations agreement included a provision-similar to
legislation I proposed last year-to limit the risk of taxpayer dollars
being wasted or stolen in Afghanistan by cutting $80 million from the
Afghan Infrastructure Fund. The provision signifies that Congress
recognizes that it is time for us to bring our troops home, for the
United States to focus on our own infrastructure here at home, and for
Congress to do a better job ensuring that taxpayer money is spent
wisely. I'm glad we have this opportunity to reduce the U.S. role in
Afghanistan, cut our deficit, and limit the risk of waste, fraud, and
theft overseas.
Sheryl Lipman Moves Another Step Closer to the Federal Bench
On Wednesday, President Obama's nominee to fill a vacancy on the
District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Ms. Sheryl
Lipman, was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is tasked
with reviewing nominations to the federal bench. It was my pleasure to
recommend Ms. Lipman to the President based on the agreement of a
diverse and bipartisan screening committee that I formed to conduct
interviews of nine potential candidates for the position.
Sheryl Lipman has proven herself a stellar attorney and I am confident
that she will be a superb judge. Her breadth of experience, strong work
ethic, and unimpeachable integrity easily made her the overwhelming
first choice of the screening committee of local attorneys.
I am glad the President took my recommendation and nominated such a
skilled Memphis attorney to the federal bench, and I am glad that the
Senate Judiciary Committee has sent her nomination to the full Senate
for final confirmation. When confirmed, she will serve the Western
District of Tennessee with distinction and the people of Memphis well.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not
had access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to
afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in
Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. Open enrollment for coverage in 2014 will
continue until March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance
coverage, you may also be eligible to save money on your health care
premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901)
528-8341. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage
option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need
health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and they will be hosting an informational session at Christ Missionary
Baptist Church (480 S. Parkway East) from 6 to 8 PM on Tuesday evening.
If you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my office
at (901) 544-4131.
Supporting Healthy Diets and Reducing Hunger
I am proud to be able to tell you that I received a 100% on Food Policy
Action's scorecard for my record of supporting healthy diets, fighting
hunger, improving public-health and reducing food-borne illnesses, and
improving access to and affordability of food. As the only Tennessee
federal legislator to receive a 100% score, it is an honor to be
recognized for my work on these important issues. You can take a look
at my scorecard here
.
Funding the Arts
With federal and state funding being cut from programs across the
board, it is good to see that specialty license plates are continuing
to provide significant funding for Tennessee arts programs
-more than any other state in the nation. Roughly two-thirds of
state funding for the arts in Tennessee comes through the sale of
specialty plates. Arts plates were created by legislation that I passed
while in the Tennessee Senate and I spent many years working to ensure
that the funding was not siphoned away from the Tennessee Arts
Commission that has always worked so hard to promote the plates. In
difficult economic times, arts funding is even more important. Artistic
development pays great dividends in students' academic success from
language to science and math. I have continued support of arts
legislation in Congress and I applaud the fine work of the Tennessee
Arts Commission.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

The

agreement
that
was
reached
this

makes
good
progress
towards
helping
Memphians
and
all
of
the
American
people,
but
there
is
still
much
more
we
can&#8212;and
should&#8212;do.
The
agreement
did
nothing
to
help
the
1.5
million
Americans,
including
21,000
Tennesseans,
who
have
lost
their
unemployment
insurance
in
recent
weeks.
We
must
immediately
extend
the
unemployment
insurance
program
and
extend
this
critical
lifeline
for
people
who
have
fallen
on
hard
times.
Workers,
families
and
children
across
this
country
cannot
afford
another
day
of
delay.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
extend
unemployment
benefits.
Ensuring
the
Right
to
Vote
Is
Not
Infringed
Yesterday,
a
bipartisan
bill
was
introduced
to
fix
the
portions
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
that
were
struck
down
by
the
Supreme
Court
last
year.
The
right
to
vote
is
one
of
the
most
sacred
constitutional
rights
we
have,
and
discrimination
based
on
race
has
no
place
in
our
electoral
process.
I
am
glad
that
this
bill
has
been
proposed
and
I
have
asked
to
be
a
sponsor.
Fighting
for
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
While
$1
billion
in
sequestration
cuts
to
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
that
this
week&#8217;s
funding
agreement
restored
will
help
continue
important
research
into
cures
for
some
of
the
worst
diseases
and
illnesses
known
to
man,
I
regret
that
the
NIH
was
not
funded
at
the
level
it
should
be.
As
the
nation&#8217;s
true
&#8220;Department
of
Defense&#8221;
against
threats
to
health,
the
NIH
deserves
to
be
protected
from
all
of
sequestration&#8217;s
cuts
and
its
funding
should
be
significant
increased.
I
will
continue
doing
all
that
I
can
to
adequately
fund
the
NIH
so
that
it
can
fund
cures
for
diseases
like
cancer,
stroke,
heart
disease,
diabetes
and
AIDS.
Celebrating
the
Success
of
the
Tennessee
Lottery
Scholarship
Program
Monday
is
the
10
year
anniversary
of
the
establishment
of
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery.
For
twenty
years
as
a
Tennessee
State
Senator,
I
worked
to
create
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery
and
provide
scholarships
to
help
Tennessee
students
and
their
families
pay
for
their
college
education
without
amassing
burdensome
debt
It
took
two
decades,
but
the
lottery
to
fund
the
scholarship
program
was
finally
established
in
January
of
2004.
Ten
years
later,
the
lottery
has
raised
over
$2.8
billion
for
Tennessee
students
and
has
proven
itself
an
absolute
success.
Still,
lottery
scholarships
need
to
be
fully
funded
as
I
always
intended. It
is
my
hope
the
legislature
will
see
to
it
that
fully
funded
scholarships
are
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
spending
lottery
revenues. That&#8217;s
what
Tennesseans
expect.
Before
Congress
finished
its
work
for
the
week,
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
about
how
critical
it
is
that
we
provide
our
students
with
opportunities
to
improve
their
lives
like
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery.
You
can
watch
my
speech
here .
Taking
Advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
recent
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
If
you
are
at
risk,
please
take
a
moment
in
the
coming
weeks
to
take
advantage
of
provisions
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
get
screened
for
breast
cancer&#8212;it
can
help
save
your
life.
Protecting
Taxpayers
from
Waste,
Fraud,
and
Theft
This
week&#8217;s
appropriations
agreement
included
a
provision&#8212;similar
to
legislation
I
proposed
last
year&#8212;to
limit
the
risk
of
taxpayer
dollars
being
wasted
or
stolen
in
Afghanistan
by
cutting
$80
million
from
the
Afghan
Infrastructure
Fund.
The
provision
signifies
that
Congress
recognizes
that
it
is
time
for
us
to
bring
our
troops
home,
for
the
United
States
to
focus
on
our
own
infrastructure
here
at
home,
and
for
Congress
to
do
a
better
job
ensuring
that
taxpayer
money
is
spent
wisely.
I&#8217;m
glad
we
have
this
opportunity
to
reduce
the
U.S.
role
in
Afghanistan,
cut
our
deficit,
and
limit
the
risk
of
waste,
fraud,
and
theft
overseas.
Sheryl
Lipman
Moves
Another
Step
Closer
to
the
Federal
Bench
On
Wednesday,
President
Obama&#8217;s
nominee
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
District
Court
for
the
Western
District
of
Tennessee,
Ms.
Sheryl
Lipman,
was
approved
by
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee,
which
is
tasked
with
reviewing
nominations
to
the
federal
bench.
It
was
my
pleasure
to
recommend
Ms.
Lipman
to
the
President
based
on
the
agreement
of
a
diverse
and
bipartisan
screening
committee
that
I
formed
to
conduct
interviews
of
nine
potential
candidates
for
the
position.
Sheryl
Lipman
has
proven
herself
a
stellar
attorney
and
I
am
confident
that
she
will
be
a
superb
judge.
Her
breadth
of
experience,
strong
work
ethic,
and
unimpeachable
integrity
easily
made
her
the
overwhelming
first
choice
of
the
screening
committee
of
local
attorneys.
I
am
glad
the
President
took
my
recommendation
and
nominated
such
a
skilled
Memphis
attorney
to
the
federal
bench,
and
I
am
glad
that
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
has
sent
her
nomination
to
the
full
Senate
for
final
confirmation.
When
confirmed,
she
will
serve
the
Western
District
of
Tennessee
with
distinction
and
the
people
of
Memphis
well.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Open
enrollment
for
coverage
in
2014
will
continue
until
March
31st. And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care

The

already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000

now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid

medications
as

Supporting
Healthy
Diets
and
Reducing
Hunger
I
am
proud
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
I
received
a
100%
on
Food
Policy
Action&#8217;s
scorecard
for
my
record
of
supporting
healthy
diets,
fighting
hunger,
improving
public-health
and
reducing
food-borne
illnesses,
and
improving
access
to
and
affordability
of
food.
As
the
only
Tennessee
federal
legislator
to
receive
a
100%
score,
it
is
an
honor
to
be
recognized
for
my
work
on
these
important
issues.
You
can
take
a
look
at
my
scorecard

Funding
the
Arts
With
federal
and
state
funding
being
cut from
programs
across
the
board,
it
is
good
to
see
that
specialty
license
plates
are
continuing
to
provide
significant
funding
for
Tennessee
arts
programs &#8212;more
than
any
other
state
in
the
nation.
Roughly
two-thirds
of
state
funding
for
the
arts
in
Tennessee
comes
through
the
sale
of
specialty
plates.
Arts
plates
were
created
by
legislation
that
I
passed
while
in
the
Tennessee
Senate
and
I
spent
many
years
working
to
ensure
that
the
funding
was
not
siphoned
away
from
the
Tennessee
Arts
Commission
that
has
always
worked
so
hard
to
promote
the
plates. In
difficult
economic
times,
arts
funding
is
even
more
important.
Artistic
development
pays
great
dividends
in
students&#8217;
academic
success
from
language
to
science
and
math.
I
have
continued
support
of
arts
legislation
in
Congress
and
I
applaud
the
fine
work
of
the
Tennessee
Arts
Commission.
