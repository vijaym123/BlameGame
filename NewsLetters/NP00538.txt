Kansas School for the Deaf Commencement Address
Click here to
watch Congressman Yoder's commencement address on
YouTube.
As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Deaf Caucus and a board
member of Gallaudet University, I pride myself on being a champion for
the deaf community. So it was an honor to be invited to give the
commencement address for the 2015 graduating class from the Kansas School
for the Deaf in Olathe last week. I wish I could have attended the
ceremony in person, but votes in Washington unfortunately kept me in
DC.
Special thanks to our district office intern Renate
Rose for the invitation and Steve Phan of the Office of Congressional
Accessibility Services at the US Captiol for signing the
speech.
Congratulations, graduates!
Providing ID Cards to
Veterans
On Monday, with my support, the House of
Representatives passed HR 91 - the Veterans ID Card Act. I was an
original cosponsor of this important legislation, which directs the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide an ID card to any honorably
discharged veteran.
Right now, many veterans are unable to
document their service without carrying around their official military
service records. The problem is these forms contain sensitive personal
information including social security numbers and service history, which
leaves veterans at a higher, unnecessary risk for identity
theft.
Country of Origin Labeling Repeal
Last
week, the World Trade Organization (WTO) again ruled United States
country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for meat are non-compliant
with international trade obligations, which could lead to billions of
dollars in economic retaliation by Canada and Mexico. The ruling
stated that COOL unfairly discriminates against Canadian and Mexican
livestock producers by requiring labels of muscle cuts of meat to state
where the meat-producing animal was born, raised, and slaughtered.
Click here for more information on
the WTO's
ruling and its potential
impact.
COOL provides no tangible benefit to American consumers
while presenting Kansas farmers, ranchers, and small business owners
with a host of legal and economic problems. The U.S. Department of
Agricultures Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which enforces COOL,
has repeatedly stated that, the COOL program is neither a food safety
or traceability program, but rather a consumer information program.
According to AMS, the first year-incremental costs for growers,
producers, processors, wholesalers, and retailers are $2.6
billion.
I commend Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX)
and the rest of the House Agriculture Committee for acting swiftly in
response to last weeks World Trade Organization ruling by voting to
repeal COOL. The tariffs Canada and Mexico are threatening to impose
after this ruling would deal a huge blow to the Kansas economy, on top
of the already added costs imposed by these unnecessary
requirements.
I urge my colleagues in the House
to follow the Agriculture Committees lead and take action quickly to
ensure this needed fix becomes law as soon as
possible.
Legislative Branch Appropriations
On Wednesday, with my support, the House of Representatives passed the
2016 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. This bill represents a
zero percent increase in spending from last year and
continues
the pay freeze for Members of Congress
in existence since
Republicans took control of the House in
2010.
It provides $3.34 billion for House Member offices, the support
agencies of Congress, security, services for visitors, and Capitol
operations and maintenance. It spends $172 million less than the
President's Budget Request.
$1.18 billion for the
U.S. House of Representatives
$369 million for the Capitol
Police
$21 million more than 2015 level and $9.9 million
less than the Presidents Budget Request
$47.3 million
for the Congressional Budget Office
$495.9 million for the
Architect of the Capitol
$10.1 million less than the 2015
level and $81.1 million less than the Presidents Budget
Request
$591.4 million for the Library of Congress
$33.1
million less than the Presidents Budget Request
$110.2
million for the Government Publishing Office
$9.8 million
less than both the 2015 level and the Presidents Budget
Request
$522 million for the Government Accountability
Office
$31.1 million less than the Presidents Budget
Request
$1 million for Open World Leadership Center Trust
Fund
$4.7 million less than the 2015 level and $7 million less than the
Presidents Budget Request
The money allocated in
this bill allows Member offices to provide the best and most efficient
service to their constituents.
