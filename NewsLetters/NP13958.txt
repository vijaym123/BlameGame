Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
Last week, the House welcomed its newest member - a Louisiana
businessman named Vance McAllister, who - with help from Duck Dynasty
star Willie Robertson - just the other week won the special election to
fill the vacancy for Louisiana's 5th congressional district.
McAllister was sworn into office alongside four of his children and
before the rest of the members of the House.
It was a nice moment.
While he was taking the oath of office, I was reminded of the foremost
duty, as reflected in the oath, that all members of Congress undertake
upon assuming office: support and defense of the Constitution.
As we see the widespread upheavals spawned by the President's health
care law, it is striking the extent to which the law that was actually
(and narrowly) passed by Congress in 2010 is not the same law that is
being implemented today.
The President has delayed, suspended, and
ignored key provisions of ObamaCare, not to mention issuing waivers
designed to shield favored constituencies from the law's negative
effects.
These actions do not reflect constitutional government properly
understood.
Per Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the
President has a duty to take care that the laws enacted by Congress are
faithfully executed; he cannot suspend, delay or amend duly-enacted
laws by executive fiat. Yet, the President has delayed the
implementation of ObamaCare's employer mandate and has publicly
declared that the administration will "extend" the legislation's
grandfather clause to those insurance plans not covered by the statute's
text. When the House has passed bills designed to shield Americans from
the law's harmful effects, such as by grandfathering in all existing
plans, the White House has responded by issuing veto threats.
This week, I introduced a House resolution disapproving of the failure
of the President to fulfill his duty under Article II, Section 3 of the
Constitution to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" and
his usurpation of the legislative authority of Congress.
If the other
branches of government remain silent in the face of this aggressive
executive action, then this course of conduct will become accepted
practice - and this will have ramifications far into the future.
The separation of powers represents a fixed star in our constitutional
constellation, and the Constitution is clear that "all legislative
Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
States.'" The Constitution's structural safeguards are designed to
protect individual liberty and to preserve the rule of law. The House
must express its disapproval of the President's actions and defend its
constitutional prerogatives.

I spoke on the House floor regarding this resolution, and you can watch

I think everyone can agree with this
simple proposition: if you take an oath to the Constitution, you should
keep your oath to the Constitution.

preservation of the Constitution's separation of powers is essential

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Last week,
the
House
welcomed
its
newest
member
&#8211;
a
Louisiana
businessman
named
Vance
McAllister,
who
&#8211;
with
help
from
Duck
Dynasty
star
Willie
Robertson
&#8211;
just the
other week
won
the
special
election
to
fill
the
vacancy
for
Louisiana&#8217;s
5th
congressional
district.
McAllister
was
sworn
into
office
alongside
four
of
his
children
and
before
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
House.
It
was
a
nice
moment.
While
he
was
taking
the
oath
of
office,
I
was
reminded
of
the
foremost
duty,
as
reflected
in
the
oath,
that
all
members
of
Congress
undertake
upon
assuming
office:
support
and
defense
of
the
Constitution.
As
we
see
the
widespread
upheavals
spawned
by
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law,
it
is
striking
the
extent
to
which
the
law
that
was
actually
(and
narrowly)
passed
by
Congress
in
2010
is
not
the
same
law
that
is
being
implemented
today.
The
President
has
delayed,
suspended,
and
ignored
key
provisions
of
ObamaCare,
not
to
mention
issuing
waivers
designed
to
shield
favored
constituencies
from
the
law&#8217;s
negative
effects.
These
actions
do
not
reflect
constitutional
government
properly
understood.
Per
Article
II,
Section
3
of
the
Constitution,
the
President
has
a
duty
to
take
care
that
the
laws
enacted
by
Congress
are
faithfully
executed;
he
cannot
suspend,
delay
or
amend
duly-enacted
laws
by
executive
fiat.
Yet,
the
President
has
delayed
the
implementation
of
ObamaCare&#8217;s
employer
mandate
and
has
publicly
declared
that
the
administration
will
&#8220;extend&#8221;
the
legislation&#8217;s
grandfather
clause
to
those
insurance
plans
not
covered
by
the
statute&#8217;s
text.
When
the
House
has
passed
bills
designed
to
shield
Americans
from
the
law&#8217;s
harmful
effects,
such
as
by
grandfathering
in
all
existing
plans,
the
White
House
has
responded
by
issuing
veto
threats.
This
week,
I
introduced
a
House
resolution
disapproving
of
the
failure
of
the
President
to
fulfill
his
duty
under
Article
II,
Section
3
of
the
Constitution
to
&#8220;take
Care
that
the
Laws
be
faithfully
executed&#8221;
and
his
usurpation
of
the
legislative
authority
of
Congress.
If
the
other
branches
of
government
remain
silent
in
the
face
of
this
aggressive
executive
action,
then
this
course
of
conduct
will
become
accepted
practice
-
and
this
will
have
ramifications
far
into
the
future.
The
separation
of
powers
represents
a
fixed
star
in
our
constitutional
constellation,
and
the
Constitution
is
clear
that
"all
legislative
Powers
herein
granted
shall
be
vested
in
a
Congress
of
the
United
States.&#8217;&#8221;
The
Constitution&#8217;s
structural
safeguards
are
designed
to
protect
individual
liberty
and
to
preserve
the
rule
of
law.
The
House
must
express
its
disapproval
of
the
President&#8217;s
actions
and
defend
its
constitutional
prerogatives.
