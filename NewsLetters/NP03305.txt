It&rsquo;s only been a week and the Republicans&rsquo; control of both houses of Congress is an unmitigated disaster. They&rsquo;ve already attacked Social Security, the President&rsquo;s immigration actions, and Obamacare! The
Washington Post
called it a &ldquo;tellingly scary&rdquo; first week.
And here&rsquo;s the REALLY frightening part: Republicans could take control of both the White House AND Congress in 2016. They&rsquo;re already starting to rake in the corporate bucks. If Democrats fall behind in early donations, the GOP could gain an insurmountable lead!
Please don&rsquo;t let that happen. Renew your membership by Friday (tomorrow) and we&rsquo;ll use every cent to hold the GOP accountable and elect Democrats in 2016.
Republicans might have the Koch Brothers and their deep pockets, but we have the Democratic base -- and you ALWAYS have our backs. We&rsquo;re counting on you.
Thanks,
DSCC Membership Team
