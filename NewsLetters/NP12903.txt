Huge Crowds at March For Life in Washington,
DC.
"Despite the bitterly cold weather that covered
the Eastern portion of the United States, the 2014 March for Life was
a great success.
This was another opportunity to remind the
world of the lives that have never lived because of that fatal case
handed down by the Court.
"On this day, however, thousands
upon thousands of dedicated and concerned Americans joined together
from across the country to exercise our right of saying enough is
enough!
"Too many children have never been born; too many lives
have never blossomed.
Many thanks and blessings to the many South
East Texans who joined our staff on this year's March for Life."
Congressman Stockman
Since the Supreme Court Roe
v. Wade decision in 1973, the March for Life has rallied hundreds of
thousands of people annually to march to the Supreme Court to "bring
attention to the tragedy of abortion and the beauty of a culture of
life, and to remember the 56 million unborn lives that have been lost
because of abortion."
The theme of this year's March was
promoting adoption. Plan now to join the March next year on January 22, 2015.

Locally, the Houston
Coalition for Life is holding the annual
40 Days for Life
from
March 5 to April 13. Activities include prayer vigils and sidewalk
counseling. Join in and you can help save unborn babies.
