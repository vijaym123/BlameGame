I'm pleading david
David, I wouldn&rsquo;t email you 3 times in 2 days if it wasn&rsquo;t so important. Speaker Boehner just added another $420,000 to an already massive negative ad blitz.
I don&rsquo;t mean to alarm you, but the pile-on of outside spending we're seeing could determine the fate of my first re-election campaign. So David, I&rsquo;m pleading.
Please chip in to our campaign tonight -- before it&rsquo;s too late.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thank you,
Brad
