THE 12TH DISTRICT
|
LEGISLATION
Dear David,
Working in Florida
The district work period in August has always
provided me a great opportunity to spend uninterrupted time with my
constituents in one-on-one meetings, visiting businesses or interacting
at townhall meetings. For instance, over the past two weeks, I have
held three public forums to hear from my constituents. The first two
events, held in Lutz, were centered on how to help sick patients
suffering from a rare or chronic disease, and the third event, in New Port
Richey, focused on improving Veterans access to
care.
Access to
Care
This week I held a Veterans Town Hall, to solicit
opinions from the most important stakeholders
Veterans
regarding the
location of the new VA facility in Pasco County. The VA reform bill that
was recently signed into law represents a positive first step towards
reforming the VA and providing Veterans with timely access to quality
care.
A provision
providing funding for a new, consolidated VA clinic in Pasco County was
included in that legislation. A consolidated clinic means one, single
point of care to meet the health care needs of Tampa Bay
area-Veterans.
Although the final
decision on the location of the new facility is in the hands of the VA, I
felt obligated to hear from local Veterans about their opinions and
thoughts of the location of the new facility, and do all I can to
advocate on their behalf.
The
Patient Perspective
The first 21 st
Century Cures Initiative roundtable hosted
featured exclusively patients and patient advocates
I wanted their
direct input about reforms that may get cures and treatments to them more
quickly. Michael and Gretchen Church, who represented the Parkinsons
Action Network, said the highlight of the experience was, The fact
that we got to address each question and that a Member of Congress, who
sits on key committees, took 3.5 hours out of his busy schedule to
listen to the concerns of patients. I heard moving and touching stories
from patients that I will take back to Washington with
me.
Cures through
Innovation
The second 21 st
Century Cure Initiative roundtable was composed of health care providers
researchers, clinicians, physicians, diagnosticians, and
representatives from medical device companies. Many of them are trying to help get
treatments and cures to patients, but burdensome regulations prevent
them from doing so. All treatments, drugs or devices, need to be safe,
but there is more we can do to help patients. I am committed to
helping sick people get better treatments more
quickly.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of
Congress
