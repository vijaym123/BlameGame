Dear Friends:
Happy Memorial Day! Im proud to report that Im spending this day with the men and women of our military stationed overseas.
As part of a bipartisan Congressional Delegation (CODEL) led by my colleague, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-MN), were meeting with troops on the ground to hear their concerns and to thank them for their service to our country.
Since I cant be in the district to take part in any of the many events to honor our nation's heroes, I wanted to send a special note of thanks to the thousands of veterans and active duty members of the military we have in the 12th District.
Not just today, but every day, we owe a special debt of gratitude to all the service members who sacrifice so much for this country.
What you all have done and continue to do will never be forgotten.
I also ask everyone to say a special prayer for the families of those who serve, and especially those families of the men and women who have given their lives for our country.
This time of year is especially difficult for the families of the fallen, but the memory of their loved ones lives on in everything we do.
We honor their memory every time we raise the American flag or sing our national anthem, and well never forget the sacrifices they made.
I hope you all have a wonderful Memorial Day, and Ill be sure to share some photos of my visit with the troops when I return.
As always, please dont hesitate to call on me if I can ever be of help.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
