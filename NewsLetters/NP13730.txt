Dear
David,
First, I want to wish you and your family a Merry
Christmas and Happy Holidays.
As you enjoy the holiday season please
remember those Minnesotans who serve in our armed forces and are away
from their families.
Between meetings and votes I took a moment
to record a short message on the Armed Forces Network to thank all of
our veterans and service members who have dedicated themselves to our
country.
As always, please feel free to contact me if I can
assist you or your family in any way. Also, please join the
conversation online by visiting my
website ,
Facebook page ,
Twitter , and don't forget to watch my weekly video,
Erik's Correspondence

Newest Budget
Deal
Im disappointed that the latest budget deal doesnt do more to address
our countrys long-term financial problems. However, its a step in
the right direction and reduces the deficit under a bipartisan
agreement.
I supported the agreement and here are a couple of key
points to highlight:
It replaces arbitrary spending cuts with
smarter spending cuts on the mandatory side of the ledger
where the
real problem is
without raising taxes.
It eliminates waste, cuts
corporate welfare and takes steps toward real reform.
The
agreement also removes the prospect of another government
shutdown.
The Kids First Research Act
Heres some good news from Washington:
the Gabriella Miller Kids First
Research Act
passed the House with bipartisan support.
I cosponsored this legislation, which eliminates taxpayer financing
of presidential campaigns and party conventions and instead targets
these funds to expand pediatric research at the National Institutes of
Health through the NIH Common
Fund.
Minnesota has always led the way in the research of childhood
diseases and our steadfast exploration for cures
but more can be done. One
in every 330 children in the United States develops cancer before the
age of nineteen.
We can accomplish so much by ending wasteful
spending and redirecting those funds toward national priorities like
advancing our knowledge of pediatric diseases and finding cures for
countless young Americans.
The
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act is named after a ten-year-old
Virginia girl who died in October after being diagnosed with an inoperable,
cancerous brain tumor.

In Our
Community
I spent time last Friday with nearly 30 of
our local fire chiefs to touch base on issues important to
firefighters.
One issue that came up was the financial penalties under the
Presidents new health care law that could hit municipalities with
volunteer fire departments whose firefighters volunteer over 30 hours a
week
another consequence of passing legislation without first reading
it and understanding whats in it.
Also last week, I
gathered with my Small Business Advisory Committee for a roundtable
discussion on jobs and the economy.
It was helpful to listen and learn
about some of the challenges they face from onerous regulations.
They like my proposals for comprehensive tax reform to make the tax
code simpler, fairer and more competitive.
Small businesses are
the engine of our economy!
