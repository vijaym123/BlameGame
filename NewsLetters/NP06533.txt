Capitol Corner: Westmoreland Notifies Students of Academy
Nomination Deadline
One of the roles of a
Member of Congress is to provide nominations for high school students to
attend service academies, including: the United States Military Academy
at West Point, United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force
Academy, and United States Merchant Marine Academy. Some of the finest
graduates come from Georgias Third District and I am proud of the men
and women they have become
today.
The Third District traditionally has a large number of
applicants and interest for each of the academies. It is a detailed and
difficult process, and every student that shows the commitment to complete
it should be commended. I always enjoy getting to meet these students,
and it is a privilege to get to know each of these future leaders and
their families.
Now is the time
to make sure you are aware of the upcoming deadline for nominations.
High school seniors from the Third District can apply for a nomination
through my Newnan office no later than October 3. This needs to be done
in addition to applying directly to the academies. After the
completed applications are received, the academy boards will interview each
candidate in November and the office will provide the list of nominees
to each academy. I encourage any interested high school student to
visit my website at www.Westmoreland.House.gov or contact Avery Raptis in
my Newnan office at 770-683-2033 for more information on the
application process.

Atlanta: U.S. Foreign Policy is Non-Existent, Westmoreland
Says
Georgia Congressman
Lynn Westmoreland says the whole world knows America has no strategy
to combat the Islamic terrorist group known as
ISIS.
The group released a video Tuesday showing the
apparent execution of another American journalist, Steve
Sotloff.
"Right now, we're a rudderless
ship at sea, in terms of foreign policy," Westmoreland said. "It's not
a place that we as Americans are used to being
in.
"Our foreign policy is non-existent," he says.
"The world knows that and our foes and allies really don't know what,
if anything, that President Obama is going to
do."
Last month ISIS released a video that showed
journalist Jim Foley being
beheaded.
