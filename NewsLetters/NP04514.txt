Constituent Corner
Recently, a constituent from Leesburg contacted my office regarding a delay in receiving her disability retirement payment from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
The constituents disability request had been approved, but she was still only receiving interim payments rather than the full amount for which she was eligible.
The constituent was facing a severe financial hardship and called my office. We contacted OPM to find out what was causing the processing delay, and discovered that they were missing information. Upon further review, however, it was discovered that the constituent actually had sent in the requested information. My office verified that OPM had received the necessary paperwork and continued to follow up and monitor the case until we received notification that it was finalized.
Survey
Last month, President Obama said, Make no mistake: [My] policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.
Do you believe that the American people rejected President Obamas policies by their votes last Tuesday?
Legislative Update
Next week, the House will resume our work in Washington to advance good public policy and an environment that will create jobs and keep our economy growing. I am humbled by the trust that you have placed in me, and look forward to serving Central Florida not only for the remainder of this year, but for the next Congressional term as well. Thank you for the continued opportunity to represent you in Washington.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster

Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
It was a privilege to participate in Lake County's 13th annual Golden Triangle YMCA Thanksgiving Prayer Breakfast and thank the staff and supporters for their work to strengthen our communities. The federal government specializes in cookie cutter programs that dont fit the unique needs of an area. It was great to be among a group of individuals who came together for prayer and thanksgiving as they seek to meet local needs. I am honored to partner with so many dedicated people who are committed to building up our community.

On Saturday, Belle Isle celebrated their 90th Anniversary and Veterans Day Celebration. It was a pleasure to join them in commemorating their long heritage by participating in their parade and presenting them with a copy of the Congressional Journal recognizing their history.
Founded in 1924 to preserve Lake Conway and the surrounding chain of lakes, the name Belle Isle was selected to resemble the French phrase beautiful island. The local natural resources, including parks and extensive waterways, facilitate Belle Isle residents active outdoor culture. Belle Isle is home to nearly 100 businesses that include iconic local restaurants and stores.
Small communities like Belle Isle are the cornerstones of American culture and economy, and it is a privilege to serve the residents of Belle Isle and thank them for their tremendous contributions to the Central Florida community.
