VISITING DC
January 16, 2015
This week I introduced legislation with Senators Ayotte, McCain, and
Graham that would restrict transfers of detainees from Guantanamo Bay
in order to best protect Americans and our national security.
The Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of 2015 would suspend
international transfers of high and medium risk detainees, prohibit
transfers of Guantanamo detainees to Yemen, extend the current prohibition
on transfers to the U.S., and increase transparency regarding risk
assessments of the remaining Guantanamo detainees.
Instead of
working with Congress to develop common-sense policies to enable our
national security personnel to detain and interrogate terrorists, this
Administration continues to irresponsibly release detainees from
Guantanamo Bay. Many of these detainees have returned to the battlefields
from which they came and are looking for ways to kill Americans and our
allies. The detainees that remain at Guantanamo are the worst of the
worst, and their continued release will only further damage our
national security.
Safety is my utmost concern, and a two year
prohibition on transferring the detainees with the highest risk should give
Congress and the Administration time to develop a long-term plan for
keeping this country safe.

The
Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of
2015
Friday of last week, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report
which examined the potential that C-123 aircraft flown and maintained
by Air Force Reserve crews from 1972 to 1982 were contaminated by
Agent Orange residue from their service in Vietnam and that those crews
and maintainers were likely exposed to unsafe levels of Agent Orange
dioxin.
The IOMs report concurs with earlier findings from the
CDC, which found that the contamination during that ten year period
would have posed a significantly higher health risk for Air Force
Reserve personnel.
In 2012, I asked the VA Inspector General to
take a close look at whether or not VA had an unwritten policy of
blanket denial for the C-123 veterans.
The VA Secretary assured me
there was no such policy; however, with the exception of one veteran
who was granted disability in 2013, no other veteran has been approved
without their case being decided by the Board of Veterans
Appeals.
These delays from VA have gone on long enough.
Instead of
ignoring widely accepted science for three years and then
commissioning an expensive study of that well founded science, the VA could have
been caring for these veterans. They now have what they need to start
helping these veterans.

Last Sunday,
I joined George
Stephanopoulos on This Week
to discuss the attack on Paris and its
implications for the international community.
The biggest takeaway: It
doesnt matter which terrorist group we insert into the blank, theyre
out to kill innocent people.
Whether it happens in Paris,
London, or New York, weve got to collectively do our best to make sure we
thwart those attacks.
I
also joined Jake
Tapper on The Lead
Tuesday evening. Click below to watch videos of
both appearances.
Finally, Ill be joining
CNNs Sunday morning show State of the Union

Blitzer
