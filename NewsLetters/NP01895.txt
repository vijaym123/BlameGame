President Obama has emailed you.
And now I&rsquo;m emailing you.
We wouldn&rsquo;t both email if it wasn&rsquo;t serious.
John Boehner just raked in $17.5 million dollars in ONE NIGHT.
If we fail to respond right now, the Republicans will bury us in cash and demolish everything President Obama has accomplished.
Can you chip in before the fundraising deadline tomorrow? You can&rsquo;t let us fall behind in this urgent moment.
