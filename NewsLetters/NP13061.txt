Dear David,
It may be a new year, but some of the same old scams are still out there. Before you finalize any of your resolutions, make sure you're not getting tricked into using a phony diet product.
The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's top consumer protection agency, just
announced $34 million in settlements
against makers of bogus weight-loss products who deceived consumers with baseless claims for fake remedies that include food additives, skin creams, and dietary supplements.
As the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, I think these new guidelines are a good step, but I refuse to believe these are the only fraudsters out there.
That's why I'm asking you for your personal stories about these types of scams, so we can raise the curtain on these deceptive practices, and rein them in. If you've experienced a diet or weight-loss scam, tell your story (confidentially) on my website, at
www.McCaskill.senate.gov/SubmitYourScam .
As
I told CNN
when they covered my investigation last week, many of the promises made by these fraudsters are nothing more than "good ol' fashioned horse manure."
In addition to settlements against these deceptive companies,
updated guidance
has been issued for media outlets on how to spot phony weight-loss claims when screening ads for publication, and I'm calling on publishers and broadcasters to quickly implement the new guidelines. Importantly, the Bureau of Consumer Protection issued " Gut Check: A Reference Guide for Media on Spotting False Weight Loss Claims ." If you ever see an ad for a product that claims any of the following, you can be sure it's a scam:
A product you can rub on your skin that will, by itself, reduce your weight
A product that causes substantial weight loss no matter what or how much you eat
A product that causes permanent weight loss even after you stop using product
A product that safely enables you to lose more than three pounds per week for more than four weeks
If you come across any of these claims be sure to let me know on my website at
www.McCaskill.senate.gov/SubmitYourScam .
Losing weight and improving our health is tough enough as it is, and the last thing consumers need is a dead-end product that delays goals of a healthier life.
All the best,
P.S. I want to hear from you. In addition to my " Submit Your Scam " page, you can contact me via
