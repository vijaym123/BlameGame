Dear Friend,
Last fall, I wrote to you about a
world in crisis
when each new day brought headlines with news of escalating violence and the acts of truly bad men working to destabilize the civilized world.
Unfortunately, we have only seen more of the same since then. The situation between Ukraine and Russia is becoming more violent and unstable. Pakistani Taliban militants brutally murdered 150 children and teachers at a school in Western Pakistan in December. Last month, men and women in Paris, France, were gunned down in broad daylight by men claiming to act on behalf of ISIS and al Qaeda in Yemen. Hundreds, possibly thousands, were reportedly massacred in Nigeria at the hands of Boko Haram. And in the past week, we watched as ISIS beheaded a Japanese hostage and burned a Jordanian pilot alive.
The American response to all of this has been inadequate at best. History has shown us time and again that when good people ignore or hide from evil, evil will continue to spread and grow in strength. And when it must be confronted, a much higher price must be paid. That does not mean that the U.S. must solve all the problems of the world. But it does mean that America is a unique force for good, and without our leadership, the world is a more dangerous place.
However, bombs and bullets alone cannot defeat groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and al Qaeda. Muslim leaders and clerics around the world must step up to fight ISIS and other terror groups on both the physical and ideological fronts. People of the Islamic faith must stand up to these extremists, or they will continue to commit these heinous acts against Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Working with and through partner nations is crucial. But they have to know that they can trust us and that we will keep our word.
We need to push our allies in the Middle East to stand up to the extremists within their religion just as King Abdullah in Jordan is doing or as Egyptian President Abdel el-Sissi did in December when he told Muslim clerics they must stop justifying violent Islamic extremism and to revolutionize their religion. But that will be hard to do as long as our President refuses to see this ideology for what it is. Sadly, he seems content to try to wait all of this out and pass along these problems to the next president.
Thankfully, we have the greatest military in the world standing ready in our defense. I will continue to do everything I can in my role as your Congressman and as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee to support our military and see that it has the resources it needs carry out its mission. I hope you all will pray for our nation, our men and women in uniform, and the many innocent people around the world who continue to suffer at the hands of such evil men.
