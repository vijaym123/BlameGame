Dear David,
I&rsquo;d like to invite all of my constituents who attend high school in Washington&rsquo;s 7th Congressional District to participate in the first ever House App Contest sponsored by the U.S. House of Representatives!
Students can form teams of up to 4 and submit prototypes (also known as wireframes) of mobile device apps to my office for a chance to have their app featured in the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. Learn more about how to enter a submission by
visiting my website .
The contest is open for submissions through April 30th, after which the judging will occur and a winner will be named. Any questions should be directed to my district office at (206) 553 7170.
Good luck to all!
Sincerely,
Congressman Jim McDermott
