Friend,
I need your help.
The national Republicans have already made my race a top priority for 2016
and they will to do whatever is necessary to win.
That&#39;s why our first deadline of the year-- less than a week away -- is so important.
It&#39;s our first chance to
show them that we&#39;re ready for another hard fight.
And today we have great news:
two of my long time supporters have decided to match EVERY donation dollar-for-dollar until our deadline on March 31st.
That means that your early investment will have twice the impact-- all donations, up to $10,000, will be matched until midnight on Tuesday.
Let&#39;s show them that our momentum is as strong as ever.
Pitch in $5 or more by clicking here and your contribution will be matched.
Speaker Boehner and his friends are already recruiting potential opponents for our race, so it&#39;s critical that we show the strength of our grassroots team.
If you have the ability to provide a donation, now is the time to do it.

Thanks for all you do.
Be well,
Ami
P.S. Janine told me that this year, I should try to win on election night so we can actually enjoy the party&mdash;but again, our race is being targeted as a national priority. The best way to avoid another close call in 2016 is to lay the groundwork now.
