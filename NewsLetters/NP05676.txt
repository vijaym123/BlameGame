Letter To Secretary Kerry, Ambassador Power, Urging U.S. Opposition to
Venezuelas Inclusion on UN Security
Council
September 25,
2014

Council. Nicolas Maduro and his regime have been the cause of instability

regime and give it a platform from which it will attempt to undermine U.S.
national security interests as well as global security.

Florida Republican: Don't give Venezuela seat on UN security
council
"The world is facing many serious
security threats, from ISIL in Iraq and Syria and the Iranian nuclear
program to Russias aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere; a Venezuelan
seat on the Security Council would allow it to advocate for its allies
like Syria, Iran and Cuba at a time when we need a united approach to
confront these challenges," Ros-Lehtinen
said.
