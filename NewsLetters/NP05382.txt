The Republicans are exploiting fears of terrorism to attack Democrats. It was wrong when Republicans did it during the George W. Bush administration. And it&rsquo;s wrong now.
Don&rsquo;t let them get away with it. Add your name to help us reach 1OO,OOO strong denouncing Republicans&rsquo; reprehensible fear mongering: Supporter:

Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves: Political campaigns can get ugly in the final stretch to Election Day. But the Republicans&rsquo; last-minute strategy to tear down Democrats is downright disgusting:
THE REPUBLICANS ARE USING ISIS BEHEADINGS TO SCARE VOTERS
Just look at the fear-mongering script of Republicans&rsquo; latest TV ad:
&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s on fire. Bad guys everywhere. Killings on the streets, beheadings abroad.&rsquo;&rsquo;
Plain and simple: Republicans know they can&rsquo;t run on their records -- so they&rsquo;re using scare tactics to try to win this election. It&rsquo;s appalling.
David -- the Republicans aren&rsquo;t going to pull these disgusting ads off the air unless we stand together and force their hand. That&rsquo;s why we want to reach 1OO,OOO signatures to our petition calling on Speaker Boehner to pull down his fear-mongering ads -- and denounce Republican candidates who use deceptive scare tactics.
