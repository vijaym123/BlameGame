Dear David,
On
December 28, 1.3 million 1
Americans were cut off from
getting the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) benefits they have
earned. Its not just our families and friends who have suffered, but
our local businesses who depend on their customers who contribute to
our local economy. As our country climbs out of the worst recession
since the Great Depression, extending unemployment insurance to nearly
214,000 1
unemployed Californians
who will use it to buy
groceries, put gas in their cars, or keep the lights on
would save
46,441 1
jobs in California
alone.
As Ventura Countys representative in Congress, I believe that Congress
must extend this critical program, and I have urged Speaker Boehner
to allow the House to vote on legislation to extend emergency
unemployment compensation benefits.
Please view my
remarks on the House Floor urging Speaker Boehner to extend these
crucial benefits for the many Ventura County families struggling to make
ends meet.
*1. According to the Department of Labor
Congresswoman Brownley speaks on the House
Floor urging Congress to pass an extension to emergency unemployment
compensation benefits.
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of
Congress
Should Congress Extend Emergency
Unemployment Compensation Benefits? Yes, it is the morally and economically right thing to
do. Yes, but only if we find
other areas of government spending to cut. No, 26 weeks of unemployment insurance should be
enough for people to get back on their feet. Other *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to
