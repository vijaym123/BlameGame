We&rsquo;re running out of time -- so we'll get straight to the point. A brand new poll shows us in a DEAD HEAT with Republican Bob Dold.
With just 48 hours to go, GOP groups are
pounding
the Chicago airwaves hoping to squeak out a win. If we get outspent now -- if we get
outworked
now -- the damage could be irreversible.
We need 316 more donations by 11:59 PM to hit our GOTV goal and respond to Boehner's attacks. So David, if you were planning to chip in for Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign, it&rsquo;s critical you do so immediately.
