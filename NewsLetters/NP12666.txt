Farm Bill Passes Congress
I am pleased that after months of deliberation with the Senate, the House has voted to pass a five-year farm bill conference report that reforms and strengthens critical agriculture and nutrition programs.Specifically, the House and Senate agreement cuts an additional $23 billion in mandatory spending by repealing outdated programs and consolidating duplicative programs.While this bill was certainly not perfect and there were provisions that I would have included, I am proud of this bipartisan effort that continues to support our strong agriculture community in Michigan.
State of the Union
I was disappointed that instead of taking an opportunity to talk about reaching across the aisle to turn the tide on this economy, create jobs, and keep America safe, the President has insisted on more Congressional blame.I spoke with Spoke with

We congratulated her on GMs clean sweep of the influential North American Carand Truck of theYear and look forward to working together to ensure that the best cars are made in Michigan.
Howell Hero
I wanted to share a story of local act of heroism by ten-year-old, Howell Resident, Danny DiPietro who saved Kathleen St. Onge's life last Saturday night. His actions remind us the true beauty of the American spirit, especially at such a young age. Read Dannys story HERE
