UPDATE: We have some great news! You&rsquo;re going to want to read this whole email:
We just got back a new set of polls from the key races that Boehner&rsquo;s targeting.
And guess what? Not only are we holding our own... NEW opportunities are popping up just in time for Election Day. We could even win seats in states like Nebraska, West Virginia, and Arkansas. And that&rsquo;s not all: Here&rsquo;s a double-dose of great news!
A group of supporters have agreed to triple-match up to 1O,OOO donations today. That means we have a chance to fight Boehner&rsquo;s attacks and expand our get-out-the-vote operations just in time for Election Day. David -- we can&rsquo;t pass up this opportunity! Can you chip in $5 or more before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline?
TRIPLE-MATCH DONATIONS REMAINING:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re putting Republicans on the defensive:
Our local community organizers have reached out to over 20 million(!) voters. And all that hard work is paying off. When we remind voters that the Republicans have been bought-and-paid-for by billionaires and corporate special interests, voters flock our way.
We don&rsquo;t want to overstate things -- the race for Congress is still a dead-heat. We still have Democratic campaigns getting pummeled by Obama-bashing attacks. But if we can expand our get-out-the-vote program,
we can tip too-close-to-call races in our direction.
The election is in just 11 days so if we&rsquo;re going to go BIG for the final week of this election, we have to pull together the funding today.
What do you say, David? Can you chip in a few bucks? https://secure.dccc.org/Critical-Deadline
