Underwriters, AETN, Ryan Burdick of Fayetteville, the Arkansas Surgical
Hospital, Kelley Bass of Bentonville, the Arkansas Rice Federation, the

Great
to see you, and safe travels home!
On Tuesday,
President Obama showed his cards by issuing a veto of the
Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 1), a bill which passed the House
and the Senate with broad bipartisan support and authorized the
construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL
pipeline. Instead of being willing to work with Congress in a
bipartisan fashion, he folded to extreme environmental groups, putting
radical interests above those of honest Americans, their jobs, and their
economy.
On Wednesday, the
House passed
H.R.
529 , a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to
improve 529 Plans, by a vote of 401-20.
(See
Roll Call #90 )
H.R. 529
amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand, strengthen, and modernize
529 college savings accounts.
On Friday, the House approved the motion to go to Conference on
the House-passed version of
H.R. 240 , the Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act, 2015, by a vote of 228-191.
(See
Roll Call #102 )
Finally, the House passed
the
Senate Amendment to H.R.
33 , a bill making further Continuing Appropriations for
Fiscal Year 2015, and for other purposes, by a vote of 357-60.
(See
Roll Call
#106 )
The Senate Amendment continues current funding levels
for the Department of Homeland Security through March 6, 2015.
Next week, in addition
to suspensions the House will consider the Passenger Rail Reform
and Investment Act of 2015 (H.R. 749), the EPA Science Advisory
Board Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 1029), and the Secret Science Reform
Act of 2015 (H.R. 1030).

legislation related to funding for the Department of Homeland
Security.
