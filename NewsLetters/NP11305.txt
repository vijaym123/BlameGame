David -- It&rsquo;s safe to say the general election is officially underway.
This weekend, we learned Speaker Boehner is deploying his TOP deputy to Illinois to host a huge fundraiser for my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling.
Boehner&rsquo;s eager to defeat me. In the last election, his group spent $2.2 million attacking me. We won, but now Boehner&rsquo;s back to make good on his investment.
David, make no mistake. We&rsquo;re in a tough race. Really tough.
The
Washington Post
named us as one of their top ten most competitive matchups nationwide.
Schilling&rsquo;s big fundraiser is Friday. We&rsquo;re trying to raise $10,000 before the big event to show Boehner and Schilling we&rsquo;re ready for everything they&rsquo;ve got. Will you chip in $8 or whatever you can for our Illinois Rapid Response Fund?

I want to send a loud and clear message to our opponents. I hope you&rsquo;ll join me.
Thanks,
