As we
approach the end of the year, I wanted to reach out and hear from you on
the issues that are most important to
you.
In Washington, important challenges like excessive
government spending, a broken healthcare system, and the ever increasing
intrusion from the federal government into our daily lives still require
our attention and demand
action.
Our national debt has reached $17 trillion, our broken healthcare
system has led to thousands of Montanans losing their health care
insurance, and very few are optimistic that the next generation will be better
off than todays.
In
Washington, I am working tirelessly to protect Montanans way of life and
ensure that Montana values are reflected in the decisions I make. As your
voice in Congress, it is not only my priority, but also my job to
represent your thoughts on these important
issues.
Please take a minute to answer the questions below and
share your views with me so that I can better serve
you.
Should we
rein in government spending? Yes No Unsure Should we repeal
Obamacare? Yes No Not entirely
Do federal agencies like the National Security Agency and other
surveillance agencies require more oversight? Yes No Unsure *By
