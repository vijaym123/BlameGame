A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
November 10, 2013
Dear friends,
This week I appreciated the opportunity to hear from many job creators
and job holders in our district. We talked a lot about the impact that
burdensome regulations are having on our businesses and that Obamacare
is having on many of our lives. When I return to Washington this week I
will keep those conversations in mind and continue to pursue
legislative options that will bring Americans much needed relief.
This week our nation will also pay special tribute to our Veterans. To
show our thanks, keep reading to learn about a few things my office and
I are doing to celebrate our Veterans and ensure they receive the
credit and care they deserve.
Ensuring their legacy: The history of our nation has always
included stories of our heroic men and women who have defended her. As
proud Americans, we have an opportunity and a duty to make sure their
stories are preserved so that future generations may always know that
the freedom they enjoy was not free. In partnership with the Library of
Congress, the Veterans History Project of the American Folklife Center
collects, preserves, and makes accessible the personal accounts of
American war Veterans so that future generations may hear directly from
Veterans. If you live in the Hudson area and would like to help a
Veteran tell his or her story, please spend part of your Veterans' Day
with us or see the column on the right for more details. at our Veteran
Oral History Workshop. Click here
Hearing the call and answering the need: Roger, from Loyal, WI, told me
he has to drive 90 minutes each way to see a VA audiologist in Tomah.
When his hearing aids quit, he was told they could not fit him in for
six months. Roger couldn't wait that long and needed the benefit of
someone local. He went to a nearby hearing aid specialist and paid
out-of-pocket for the hearing aids.
According to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), both our aging
Veterans and younger Veterans returning from the battlefield are
seeking help from the VA for hearing loss more than any other
disability facing them today. VA audiology clinics can't keep up with
the increased demand and frustrated Veterans are living in a
non-hearing world with limited options. Roger, and Veterans like him,
earned these Veterans benefits, and deserve better.
In an effort to help reduce the backlog, I plan to introduce
legislation that would allow the VA to begin utilizing hearing
instrument specialists in addition to audiology doctors. My bill will
allow VA audiologists to focus on more complex cases and give our
Veterans increased access to the care they need.
Most importantly - my
bill will give our Veterans even more access to professionals who can
help them with hearing loss.
Keep Your Healthcare Plan Act: The President broke his promise to the
American people. We deserve better. This week the House will take up
the "Keep Your Healthcare Plan Act" in an effort to ensure that
millions of individuals who have received policy cancelation notices as
a result of Obamacare could have the option to keep their policies in
2014. I am a cosponsor of this bill and will continue to keep you
updated on its progress.
Do you have a job opening? We still have a few booths available for
December's jobs fair in Wausau. If you are a job creator in our area,
please click here
for more details about how to get
involved!
To all of our Veterans and to the men and women who continue to serve
our nation, Thank you. My family and I are forever grateful for your
service and will offer a special prayer of thanksgiving tomorrow.
Thanks for reading this week's update and for the continued honor of
representing you in Congress.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friends,
This

I
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
hear
from

We

about
the
impact
that
burdensome
regulations
are
having
on
our
businesses
and
that
Obamacare
is
having
on
many
of
our
lives.
When
I
return
to
Washington
this
week
I
will
keep
those
conversations
in
mind
and
continue
to
pursue
legislative
options
that
will
bring
Americans
much
needed
relief.
This
week
our
nation
will
also
pay
special
tribute
to
our
Veterans.
To
show
our

The

proud

we have
an
opportunity

a

to
make
sure
their
stories
are
preserved
so
that
future
generations
may
always
know
that
the
freedom
they
enjoy
was
not
free.
In

the
