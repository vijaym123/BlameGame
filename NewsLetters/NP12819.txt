Dear
Friends,
I'm pleased to announce that the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee will hold a field hearing, The Charleston, W.Va., Chemical
Spill: Cause, Response and Prevention, at 9 a.m. Monday, Feb. 10, at
the Kanawha County Courthouse.
As a member of the
committee, I asked House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill
Shuster to hold a full committee field hearing in Charleston to examine how
this chemical spill occurred and how such a spill can be prevented in
the future.
Residents of the Kanawha Valley deserve
answers, and this hearing will allow Congress to question key witnesses,
learn how this spill occurred, get answers to critical questions, and
examine what we can do to safeguard our water supply. I thank Chairman
Shuster for his interest in this issue and look forward to welcoming him
and other members of Congress to Charleston for this important
hearing.
FLOOD INSURANCE
I've signed on as a cosponsor
of legislation to help West Virginia homeowners facing exorbitant
increases in their flood insurance premiums.
H.R. 3370, the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, would delay the
implementation of new flood risk rates until the Federal Emergency Management
Agency completes an affordability study. This bipartisan bill has more
than 180 cosponsors.
Ive heard from West Virginians facing
astronomical increases in their flood insurance premiums, and I am
concerned that some homeowners may be forced to choose between paying
their mortgage or paying their insurance. I will be holding roundtables
with affected homeowners in the coming weeks to listen to their concerns
and find ways to resolve this issue. I will continue my efforts to
make flood insurance premiums more affordable for homeowners in flood
zones while also reducing the strain on the Flood Insurance Trust
Fund.
FARM BILL
I voted yes this week on a five-year
farm bill that improves agriculture programs, maintains critical food
assistance to families in need, and provides certainty to Americas
farmers and ranchers, all while saving $16 billion in mandatory spending,
according to the Congressional Budget Office.
It also
makes the first reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(colloquially known as food stamps) since the 1996 welfare reform
act:
Ensures illegal immigrants, lottery winners,
traditional college students and the deceased cannot receive
benefits
Stops SNAP recipients from receiving benefits in multiple
states
Prohibits the U.S. Agriculture Department from
advertising SNAP benefits on TV, radio, billboards and through foreign
governments.
This bipartisan agreement provides
much-needed certainty to farmers in West Virginia and across the United
States. After relying on extensions, farmers, ranchers and food producers
will now have certainty in their operations and federal farm policy.
This five-year bill saves taxpayers money, reforms outdated policies,
consolidates duplicative programs, increases assistance for food
banks, and shores up the safety net for families depending on food
assistance to feed their families.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and

Sincerely,
