Rubio Condemns Removal Of Cuban
Regime From State Sponsors Of Terrorism
List
Earlier
this week , Marco condemned the Obama
Administrations removal of Cuba
from the State Sponsors of Terrorism
List. Read an excerpt of Marcos
remarks below and watch his full remarks
here
in English and
here
in Spanish.
Rubio: Well, the decision made
by the White House today is a terrible
one, but not surprising unfortunately.
Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.
They harbor fugitives of American
justice, including someone who killed a
police officer in New Jersey over 30
years ago. Its also the country
thats helping North Korea evade
weapons sanctions by the United Nations.
They should have remained on the list of
state sponsors of terrorism, and I think
sends a chilling message to our
enemies
abroad that this White House is no
longer serious about calling terrorism by
its proper name.
Earlier this year, Marco joined
Senators David Vitter (R-LA) and Ted Cruz
(R-TX)
in
a letter to Attorney General Eric
Holder
pressing for answers on the status
of the fugitives the Castro regime is
harboring, as well as the threats posed
to the U.S. legal system by the
administrations removal of Cuba
from the State Sponsors of Terrorism
List. Holder has yet to respond to the
Senators letter. Marco also
highlighted the Castro regimes
harboring of fugitives like Fuerzas
Armadas de Liberacion Nacional
Puertorriquenas (FALN) bomb maker
William Morales, and its support of
terrorist groups like the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the
Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) in
a
letter to Secretary of State John
Kerry
last month.
Rubio, Lee Discuss Tax Reform Plan
on Tax Day
On Tax Day, Marco joined Senator Mike
Lee (R-UT) at the Heritage Foundation to
discuss their Economic Growth and Family
Fairness Tax Reform Plan.
Introduced
last month , the plan would eliminate
the bias in the tax code against parents
and families, encourage economic growth
to create more jobs and better wages, and
enhance the ability of businesses to
compete globally. Watch Marcos
remarks and the Q&amp;A session at the
event
here .
Marco also talked to FOX News about
his plan and why it will best work for
America. An excerpt of the interview is
below and you can watch the full
interview
here .
Rubio: Its the most
dynamic pro-growth tax plan that anyone
has put out, and thats the key
to our future. Thats the key to
bringing the national debt under
control, thats the key to being
globally competitive, thats the
key to creating millions of better
paying jobs.
Rubio Commemorates The 54th
Anniversary Of The Bay Of Pigs
On
Friday , Marco commemorated the 54
th
anniversary of the Bay of
Pigs invasion when 1,500 brave men
volunteered for a mission to liberate
Cuba from Fidel Castros grip.
Rubio: Fifty-four years after
their sacrifice, at a time when the
Obama Administration continues to turn
a blind eye toward the brutality of the
Cuban regime, we must remember the
sacrifices of Brigade 2506, and of the
thousands of dissident activists who
since then have carried the torch and
taken up the cause of a free Cuba. We
must recommit ourselves to the
universal right of every man, woman and
child to be free
in Cuba and
elsewhere around the world.
Cuba has done nothing to earn
the legitimacy President Obama
continues to bestow on the regime. Just
last week, days before President Obama
was set to meet with Cuban President
Ral Castro, Cuban regime thugs
beat up several Cuban dissident leaders
and American citizens visiting Panama
for the Summit of the Americas.
I call on the Obama
Administration to not let the
sacrifices of the men who died on this
day 54 years ago, and of the thousands
who have taken up the cause since then,
to be in vain. As normalization talks
move to the next phase, President Obama
should demand full respect for the
Cuban peoples human
rights.
For The Third Time, Rubio Urges
Obama To Expedite Congressional Gold
Medal Following Death Of Another
Borinqueneer
Following
the death of Pedro Marti Arguinzoni ,
a Borinqueneer veteran from Melbourne,
Florida, Marco urged President Obama to
expedite the awarding of the
Congressional Gold Medal to the
Borinqueneers, an Army unit that fought
in World War I, World War II and the
Korean War. Marco made the same request
in
February
and
again
in March . Since signing the law
awarding this medal last year, several
Borinqueneers have died, including six
with ties to Florida.
Rubio: My wife Jeanette and I
send [Pedros] family our
condolences and thank them for their
service to the United States.
As another Borinqueneer
passed away before receiving his
Congressional Gold Medal, we are once
again reminded of why time is truly of
the essence. Although Pedro lived a
full life, unfortunately, he did not
live to receive his Congressional Gold
Medal. For the third time, I urge the
President to do everything he can to
make sure each of the remaining
Borinqueneers living today receives his
Congressional Gold Medal as soon as
possible.
Constituent Casework Corner
Our office was contacted by a Tampa
constituent with a pending employment
authorization who was about to be
terminated by his employer unless he
received his new employment authorization
card. After providing a letter from his
employer, Senator Rubios staff
contacted United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) requesting
that his application be expedited. His
case was expedited and he received his
authorization in time not to lose his
job.
