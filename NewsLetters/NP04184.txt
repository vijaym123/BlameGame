Dear Friend,
With the holiday season in full swing, many parents, grandparents, and friends are busy shopping for the special children in their lives.
On the top of many of those lists are toys. With thousands of children&rsquo;s products on the market each year, it is important to make sure no one gets hurt from an unsafe toy.
Over the past several years, stronger rules have helped get some of the most dangerous children&rsquo;s products off the market.
Improvements made by Congress to the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act have tightened lead limits and phased out dangerous phthalates.
These safeguards, along with safety-conscious steps taken by many toy makers and sellers have led to 30 toy recalls in fiscal year 2014, compared to 172 recalls in 2008.
Keeping our children safe and healthy will ensure a more joyous holiday season for everyone. To learn more about product recalls or to report a dangerous product, go online to
www.saferproducts.gov
or call the Consumer Product Safety Commission Hotline at (800) 638-2772.

I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Hoosier families like yours.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Andr&eacute;
INSIDE SCOOP

This Thanksgiving, my daughter and I joined thousands of Hoosiers at the annual Mozel Sanders Thanksgiving dinner.
With the help of over 2,000 volunteers, 40,000 meals were delivered to people throughout Central Indiana!
COMING UP:
One of the most rewarding aspects of being your Representative is having the opportunity to help you cut through red tape with federal agencies.
While my district office is centrally located, I realize it can be difficult or inconvenient at times to visit.
That is why I am committed to ensuring the resources my office offers are more accessible by bringing these services closer to you.
This week, my staff will be holding office hours on
Thursday, December 4, from 4-6 p.m at the Indianapolis Public Library - Wayne Branch.
( 198 S. Girls School Road Indianapolis, IN 46231)
My office is able to assist with a range of issues dealing with any federal agency, including the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security, Medicare, Immigration, and others.
Hope to see you there!
