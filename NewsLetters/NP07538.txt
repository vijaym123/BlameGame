Dear Friend:
I am so proud that President Obama signed my legislation today to designate the Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial at Riverside's March Field Air Museum as a national memorial. This designation will give long-overdue recognition to the courageous military aviators in California and across America who have distinguished themselves by heroism in aerial flight.
