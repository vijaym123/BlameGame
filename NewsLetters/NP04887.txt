Friend --
President Obama emailed this morning. Now I&rsquo;m following up.
It&rsquo;s because we have a mere 72 hours left until the election, and so much is still at stake:
12 races are polling within single digits. TWELVE!
Republicans only need to win six of them to take Senate control.
That makes our chances 50% -- too even for my liking.
I need your help right away.
With three days left, there&rsquo;s still so much to do: Find every single Democratic voter and get them to the polls. Defend our candidates against malicious GOP attacks. Fight back against Republicans&rsquo; voter suppression efforts.
Here&rsquo;s the brutal truth: We can&rsquo;t do it all without your help. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you, again:
Will you pitch in to defeat the GOP and keep the Senate blue? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift today!

Thank you,
Harry Reid
