Online Gambling Debate Deserves a Public Hearing
Attaching a casino to every smartphone in America is a bad idea. On
December 23, 2011, the Department of Justice published an opinion that
reversed the long-standing interpretation of the Wire Act, which opened
the door to Internet gambling. Fundamental changes like these need to
go through Congress. That is why I introduced bipartisan, bicameral
legislation,
along with Rep. Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Graham
(R-SC) that will allow us to have this debate.

Demanding DHS Come Clean on Libya Policy Reversal
I'm very concerned that the Obama Administration wants to allow Libyan
nationals into the United States to study nuclear sciences and
aviation. The current situation in Libya is far from normal and remains
vulnerable to unchecked terrorist activity. The Department of Homeland
Security has ignored repeated requests for information from my
colleagues and I. As a result, we sent a follow-up letter to DHS
demanding they release this information.

Subpoenas Are Not Optional In This Country
In a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing
, I
questioned the Commissioner of the IRS regarding his compliance with a
duly issued subpoena from the Committee. He was never able to give me a
solid answer on when documents important to the IRS targeting scandal
would be released.
