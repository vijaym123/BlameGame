Friends,
You may have heard by now that Speaker Boehner asked me to serve
on the House Select Committee on Benghazi - a solemn and
significant responsibility that I accepted.
The Benghazi attack was a terrible tragedy, and we still mourn the four
Americans that were brutally murdered that day. However, the
Administration's explanation for exactly what happened that day and why
has been far from clear, both in the immediate aftermath and months
later.
It is the duty of Congress to seek answers
on the activities of the government on behalf of the American
people. Lingering questions about the Benghazi attack and continued
White House obstruction compel us to form this Select Committee and
continue the search for truth.
Benghazi is a familiar subject for me. During my time as chairman of
the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,
I led the inquiry
into military activities surrounding the attack. Our
jurisdiction was limited to the Department of Defense, but there are
many more layers to the Benghazi story, including our intelligence
community, the State Department, and, of course, the White House. A
select committee with broader jurisdiction will better connect these
dots and provide a clearer picture.
I am committed to working with Chairman Gowdy
and
my colleagues on the Select Committee to conduct a thorough, judicious,
and unbiased pursuit of facts. As can be the case in Washington,
tension over the Benghazi attacks has at times become a political issue
on both sides. As Chairman Gowdy said, politics will have no place in
this process. Facts aren't Republican or Democratic. Facts are
stubbornly impartial, and I'm committed to pursuing the facts wherever
they may lead.
Getting Answers on the IRS Scandal
There's an old saying that, in life, nothing is certain but death and
taxes. It's true that paying taxes is a fact of life, one that ordinary
Americans accept and dutifully take care of every year. We play by the
rules when interacting with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and if
we step out of line there are consequences. So shouldn't we demand the
same accountability for those serving in the IRS?
Of course we should. That's why the stonewalling from Lois Lerner,
former IRS Director of Tax Exempt Organizations, is especially
troubling. You probably remember last year it surfaced that the IRS was
targeting
certain
groups for extra scrutiny based solely on their political beliefs.
Actually, a group from Alabama was among those singled out: the
Wetumpka Tea Party, based in Elmore County. Whether or not you agree
with the group's views, we can all agree they should be able to express
those views without fear of selective targeting from the federal
government.
Numerous emails from Lerner indicated that she was actively involved in
the targeting and that it was not just "rogue" employees, as some had
suggested. Given her clear role in the IRS targeting scandal, Lerner
was called to testify before Congress. During the hearing, Ms. Lerner
elected to exercise her right to avoid self incrimination under the
Fifth Amendment, though many believe she had previously waived that
right. The better question is this: if Ms. Lerner did nothing wrong, as
her lawyers allege, then why is she so unwilling to share the facts and
clear her name?
Lois Lerner was trusted with immense responsibility to ensure fairness
under the rule of law, and instead it appears she used her position of
authority to project a political agenda. Even now she continues to hide
information from Members of Congress who are simply seeking the truth.
Her actions left us no choice but to act. Last week, the House of
Representatives passed a resolution
finding Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress, making her one of
only five government officials to be found in contempt by the full
House of Representatives.
I wish it hadn't come to this. I wish Ms. Lerner had been forthcoming
from the beginning about why her agency targeted groups and individuals
because of their political beliefs. By dodging questions and
obstructing the truth, Ms. Lerner left us no choice but to publicly
condemn her behavior and hasten the Justice Department to act.
I believe in the rule of law because it ensures fairness for everybody.
If ordinary Americans have to play by the rules, then so must
government officials. No one is above the law, and it's my
responsibility as your Representative to make sure those who abuse
positions of trust and power are held accountable.
Busy Week in DC
It was certainly a busy week in Washington with many groups around the
Capitol for meetings. We had many guests in our office on Wednesday
from the Alabama Rural Electric Cooperatives Association, which
included representatives from the Central Alabama, Covington, Dixie,
Pea River, Pioneer, South Alabama, and Wiregrass electric co-ops.
Together, they provide power for almost 300,000 people in the Second
Congressional District.
I also had meetings with the Alabama Chapter of the US Society of
Anesthesiologists, the US Army War College, Judge William Filmore and
his wife Angela from Dale County, the Alabama Hospital Association, and
the Alabama ALS Society. Thanks to all of those who came by!
Whether it is issues relating to defense or the national budget, I want
to hear from you. Make sure you are following me on Twitter

anytime on my website
. The more I hear from you, the better I am able to
serve as your voice in Congress.

You
may
have
heard
by
now
that
Speaker
Boehner
asked
me
to
serve
on
the
House
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi
&#8211;
a
solemn
and
significant
responsibility
that
I
accepted.
The
Benghazi
attack
was
a
terrible
tragedy,
and
we
still
mourn
the
four
Americans
that
were
brutally
murdered
that
day.
However,
the
Administration&#8217;s
explanation
for
exactly
what
happened
that
day
and
why
has
been
far
from
clear,
both
in
the
immediate
aftermath
and
months
later.
It
is
the
duty
of
Congress
to
seek
answers
on
the
activities
of
the

on
behalf
of
the
American
people.
Lingering
questions
about
the
Benghazi
attack
and
continued
White
House
obstruction
compel
us
to
form
this
Select
Committee
and
continue
the
search
for
truth.
Benghazi
is
a
familiar
subject
for
me.
During
my
time
as
chairman
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Subcommittee
on
Oversight
and
Investigations,
I
led
the
inquiry
into
military
activities
surrounding
the
attack.
Our
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
the
Department
of
Defense,
but
there
are
many
more
layers
to
the
Benghazi
story,
including
our
intelligence
community,
the
State
Department,
and,
of
course,
the
White
House.
A
select
committee
with
broader
jurisdiction
will
better
connect
these
dots
and
provide
a
clearer
picture.
I
am
committed
to
working
with
Chairman
Gowdy
and
my
colleagues
on
the
Select
Committee
to
conduct
a
thorough,
judicious,
and
unbiased
pursuit
of
facts.
As
can
be
the
case
in
Washington,
tension
over
the
Benghazi
attacks
has
at
times
become
a
political
issue
on
both
sides.
As
Chairman
Gowdy
said,
politics
will
have
no
place
in
this
process.
Facts
aren&#8217;t
Republican
or
Democratic.
Facts
are
stubbornly
impartial,
and
I&#8217;m
committed
to
pursuing
the
facts
wherever
they
may
lead.
Getting
Answers
on
the
IRS
Scandal
There's
an
old
saying
that,
in
life,
nothing
is
certain
but
death
and
taxes.
It's
true
that
paying
taxes
is
a
fact
of
life,
one
that
ordinary
Americans
accept
and
dutifully
take
care
of
every
year.
We
play
by
the
rules
when
interacting
with
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
and
if
we
step
out
of
line
there
are
consequences.
So
shouldn&#8217;t
we
demand
the
same
accountability
for
those
serving
in
the
IRS?
Of
course
we
should.
That&#8217;s
why
the
stonewalling
from
Lois
Lerner,
former
IRS
Director
of
Tax
Exempt
Organizations,
is
especially
troubling.
You
probably
remember
last
year
it
surfaced
that
the
IRS
was
targeting
certain
groups
for
extra
scrutiny
based
solely
on
their
political
beliefs.
Actually,
a
group
from
Alabama
was
among
those
singled
out:
the
Wetumpka
Tea
Party,
based
in
Elmore
County.
Whether
or
not
you
agree
with
the
group's
views,
we
can
all
agree
they
should
be
able
to
express
those
views
without
fear
of
selective
targeting
from
the
federal
government.
Numerous
emails
from
Lerner
indicated
that
she
was
actively
involved
in
the
targeting
and
that
it
was
not
just
&#8220;rogue&#8221;
employees,
as
some
had
suggested.
Given
her
clear
role
in
the
IRS
targeting
scandal,
Lerner
was
called
to
testify
before
Congress.
During
the
hearing,
Ms.
Lerner
elected
to
exercise
her
right
to
avoid
self
incrimination
under
the
Fifth
Amendment,
though
many
believe
she
had
previously
waived
that
right.
The
better
question
is
this:
if
Ms.
Lerner
did
nothing
wrong,
as
her
lawyers
allege,
then
why
is
she
so
unwilling
to
share
the
facts
and
clear
her
name?
Lois
Lerner
was
trusted
with
immense
responsibility
to
ensure
fairness
under
the
rule
of
law,
and
instead
it
appears
she
used
her
position
of
authority
to
project
a
political
agenda.
Even
now
she
continues
to
hide
information
from
Members
of
Congress
who
are
simply
seeking
the
truth.
Her
actions
left
us
no
choice
but
to
act.
Last
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
resolution
finding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress,
making
her
one
of
only
five
government
officials
to
be
found
in
contempt
by
the
full
House
of
Representatives.
I
wish
it
hadn&#8217;t
come
to
this.
I
wish
Ms.
Lerner
had
been
forthcoming
from
the
beginning
about
why
her
agency
targeted
groups
and
individuals
because
of
their
political
beliefs.
By
dodging
questions
and
obstructing
the
truth,
Ms.
Lerner
left
us
no
choice
but
to
publicly
condemn
her
behavior
and
hasten
the
Justice
Department
to
act.
I
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
because
it
ensures
fairness
for
everybody.
If
ordinary
Americans
have
to
play
by
the
rules,
then
so
must
government
officials.
No
one
is
above
the
law,
and
it's
my
responsibility
as
your
Representative
to
make
sure
those
who
abuse
positions
of
trust
and
power
are
held
accountable.
Busy
Week
in
DC
It
was
certainly
a
busy
week
in
Washington
with
many
groups around
the
Capitol for
meetings.
We
had many
guests in
our

on
Wednesday
from
the
Alabama

which
included
representatives
from
the
Central
Alabama,
Covington,
Dixie,
Pea
River,
Pioneer,
South
Alabama,
and
Wiregrass
electric
co-ops.
Together,
they
provide
power
for
almost
300,000
people
in
the
Second
Congressional
District.
I also
had
meetings
with
the
Alabama
Chapter
of
the
US
Society
of
Anesthesiologists,
the
US
Army
War
College,
Judge
William
Filmore
and
his
wife
Angela
from
Dale
County,
the
Alabama
Hospital
Association,
and
the
Alabama
ALS
Society.
Thanks
to
all
of
those
who
came
by!
