Friends,
Like you, I am absolutely outraged at
President Obamas my way or no way approach to the serious issues
facing our nation.
From unilaterally picking and choosing which
parts of Obamacare to enforce, to enacting sweeping illegal amnesty
policies, the President has continually overstepped his legal authority by
enacting unconstitutional phone and pen policies.
These
policies are neither ones that our community wants nor what our country
needs to get back on track.
As
you know, last November President Obama took unprecedented executive
action to grant amnesty to more than 5 million illegal immigrants.
Ever since then, I have been working with my colleagues in
Congress to find the best tactic to successfully block the Presidents
illegal actions.
With the new Republican majority in the Senate
and the biggest Republican majority in the House since the 1920s, we
have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us
an opportunity to actually
pass meaningful legislation by both chambers working together, the way
things were intended to
operate.
But more than that, we have an opportunity to send President Obama
legislation that advances your priorities. Now, with the
Republican-controlled Congress, its time to continue the fight, see this through
and block the Presidents illegal amnesty.
Thats why I led my
like-minded conservative colleagues in sending a
letter
to House Leadership demanding that we stand firm in our efforts
to oppose the Presidents executive action and restrict funding for
its implementation as soon as possible.
Leadership promised
that the House would stand its ground against the Presidents
unconstitutional actions in January, and
I am committed to holding
them accountable on this promise.
I am hopeful we will take
immediate action and use our constitutionally given power of the
purse to eliminate all funding for the Presidents illegal executive
amnesty.
As Ive said
before, I recognize our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed
and this starts with securing the border.
The Presidents
go it alone actions make things worse by rewarding those who come here
illegally at the expense of legal immigrants waiting in line. The
Presidents actions also threaten American jobs by giving work permits to
illegals who dont have Obamacare costs associated with them.
Finally, the Presidents actions make it harder to deport convicted child
predators by reclassifying them and downgrading their priority for
deportation.
But the crisis
threatening the future of our nation isnt simply about immigration; it is
about defending the separation of powers and the rule of law. The bottom
line is the Presidents actions are unconstitutional. As established
by our founding fathers in the Constitution, only Congress has the
power to establish the rule of naturalization, make, or change the laws.
Therefore it is incumbent on us to honor the Constitution, and
respect the will of the people, by using the power of the purse to
rein in the Presidents
actions.
I made a promise that I would fight to block the
Presidents unconstitutional actions and will continue to do everything I
can to ensure that we have a strong bill that does just that.
Its time to continue the fight and send President Obama legislation
that forces him to make a choice: does he stand with the American
people, or does he continue to push his unconstitutional executive amnesty
that punishes legal immigrants and Americans looking for
work?
I ran for Congress because
I want to fight to make our priorities Washingtons priorities and
pursue a conservative agenda that reins in President Obamas harmful
policies, promotes job creation and truly changes the direction of our
country.
Rest assured, I will continue to stand up for our
community when President Obama stands in the way of our
priorities.
Until next week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
Holding Washington
Accountable
I made a promise that I would fight to cut
wasteful government spending and help alleviate Washingtons heavy
taxing hand.
This week, I
introduced
the
Sunset Act
and the
FACT Act
because I am committed to keeping that promise and championing our
communitys priorities.
These
commonsense measures help deliver to taxpayers what they deserve - a
smaller, more limited government that is effective, efficient and
accountable.
_______________________
America's New
Congress
This week, the
House took the first steps in pursuing a conservative agenda that reins in
President Obamas harmful policies, promotes job creation and truly
changes the direction of our
country.
I voted to prevent Obamacare's employer mandate from
threatening
veterans' jobs , to
restore
the 40-hour work week , and to approve construction of the
Keystone XL pipeline .
This critical, pro-jobs legislation sat stuck in the Senate
for the last two years, but
now we will put it on President
Obamas desk and force him to choose between two different
paths.
