PROTECTING COPS GRANTS: I was pleased last week to be part of a bipartisan effort to prevent a 60 percent cut to the U.S. Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office and restore $110 million to the program. Had the cut been approved, it would have resulted in the loss of 1,000 new officer jobs. The COPS program is a cornerstone of the federal effort to support state and local law enforcement. These grants enable cash-strapped state and local governments to hire the public safety officers needed to protect our citizens. For more, click HERE .
EPA PLAN TO CUT CARBON EMISSIONS: The clean power proposal announced this week is not just a common-sense plan to cut carbon pollution for public health and to slow climate change, but it also represents bold leadership that will encourage innovation at home and around the world. This policy alone will not solve the climate crisis, but if it coaxes more ambitious goals from other nations around the globe, it could be a turning point in saving the planet. Here at home, this new policy will put American ingenuity to work developing the clean energy technologies that will power our homes and economy of the future. For more, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am honored to represent Georgia this week as part of a Congressional delegation to Normandy, France, where we are celebrating in the 70th anniversary of the Allied invasion on D-Day.
It has been a humbling experience to lay wreaths and pay homage at the Normandy American Cemetery during memorial ceremonies at Omaha and Sword beaches 70 years after the pivotal June 6, 1944, battle.
Seventy years later we come to pay tribute to the soldiers who fought and died here to secure our liberty. The Allied invasion on the beaches of Normandy was a turning point in modern history, and set the stage for the freedom and progress
we enjoy today. Looking out over Omaha and Sword beaches, I&#8217;m humbled and awed by their sacrifice and can say with all sincerity that these men &#8211; seven decades ago &#8211;
saved the world.
Men like civil rights icon, The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy of Atlanta, and Stone Mountain&#8217;s Nimrod McNair, who fought during World War II with valor so we could all live free. To all the men and women of Georgia,
the United States of America and the world who fought on D-Day and throughout the war &#8211; we commemorate this day in your honor &#8211; we salute those who sacrificed their lives to secure peace and dispatch the reign of history&#8217;s most destructive dictatorship.
