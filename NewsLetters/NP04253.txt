Congressman Lamborn Statement on Hagel
Resignation
11/24/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05) released the following statement after the
announcement that Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel had been asked to
resign by President Obama:
Even though I have disagreed
with many of his policies, Chuck Hagel is an honorable man who has served
during tough times. Unfortunately, I think any serious Secretary of
Defense is going to clash with President Obama. Obama and his team have
failed on foreign policy, have gutted the defense budget, and have
injected their social agenda into the military. I am doubtful that
a new Secretary of Defense will be able to change the fundamentally
misguided policies emanating from the Obama White House.
