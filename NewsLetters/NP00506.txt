Memorial
Day
On Memorial Day we honor the lives of those who
have so bravely answered the call to serve and defend this great
nation. As a daughter of a U.S. Marine, I am eternally grateful for the
service and sacrifice our troops make - all in the name of freedom. I hope
you will join me today in honoring our brave veterans who have paid
the ultimate price to keep our country safe and
free.
A Tribute to a Local
Hero
Last week, I had the
pleasure of paying tribute to a war hero that I have the honor of
representing in Congress, Corporal Fred Whitaker Sr.. Corporal Whitaker, a
World War II veteran, proudly served our nation in the Combat Infantry
from 1943 to 1946. He participated in several campaigns including:
Saar, Rhineland, Central Europe, and the historic Battle of the Bulge. I
thank him for his sacrifice to our nation and for the sacrifice all
military personnel make to keep our country safe and free. We are
forever indebted to this true hero of the Greatest Generation.

Women in the Military Wreath Laying
Ceremony
Recently, I was pleased to participate in the
Congressional Women's Caucus Wreath Laying Ceremony. This ceremony, which
took place at Arlington National Ceremony, honored our female
military heroes for their brave service and achievements. I had the pleasure
of honoring Gunnery Sergeant Anna Lloyd, a native of Michigan City,
Indiana. Gunnery Lloyd, enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1997 and has
served in numerous deployments, including Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom. I was pleased to honor this remarkable woman
at the 18th Annual Women in the Military Wreath Laying
Ceremony.
