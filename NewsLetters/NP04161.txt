Our campaign finance system is completely broken -- and this last election proved it.
Friend -- Our campaign finance system is completely broken -- and this last election proved it.
Thanks to the
Citizens United
Supreme Court decision, Republican &ldquo;dark money&rdquo; groups spent $94 MILLION in this election. That&rsquo;s more than THREE TIMES the spending from progressive groups, according to the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation.
These dark money groups literally bought the GOP control of the Senate, and now Republicans are planning to wreak havoc on the middle class.
It&rsquo;s outrageous, and the FIRST step to restoring our Democracy is passing a Constitutional Amendment that overturns
Citizens United.
ADD YOUR NAME: Stand with Democrats today and support an end to
Citizens United
and dark money in politics &gt;&gt;

Citizens United:
Signature pending &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;ve already had 450,000 Democrats sign on to say they want an END to dark money in politics.
If we can get to 500,000 grassroots signatures by midnight, it&rsquo;ll send an urgent message: Americans are DEMANDING that this corruption ENDS.
It won&rsquo;t be easy -- we badly need you on board! Sign your name and demand an END to
Citizens United.
Thanks for your support,
