Questioning Secretary Burwell
On The Presidents Healthcare Law:
This week I
questioned Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell about the
disastrous implementation of the Presidents healthcare law. I
specifically highlighted the legality of the subsidies it involves, which is
at the heart of the King v. Burwell case currently before the Supreme
Court. I am extremely frustrated about the issue as I raised concerns
over whether the healthcare laws subsidies were legal back in 2012 to
then-HHS Secretary Sebelius.
Despite a promise from
Secretary Sebelius to get me an answer in writing, I never received a reply.
This administration once again chose to ignore real, legitimate
concerns about its policies in favor of playing politics with the healthcare
system of folks across America. Three years later the problem hasnt
gone away and it is now up to the Supreme Court to finally weigh in on
it.
The Topeka Capital-Journal
reported : In U.S.
House testimony Wednesday, Rep. Lynn Jenkins made reference to questions
she raised more than three years ago that broached the subject of
federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, the issue at the core of
an anxiously awaited Supreme Court ruling.

Putting Congress &amp; The American People In The
Drivers Seat On Trade:
This Friday, Congress voted
to approve Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, but failed to pass the
overall bill due to a procedural rule. TPA is not a trade agreement,
but merely a Congressional process where Congress authorizes the
President to negotiate, but also places extensive restrictions on those
negotiations so he cant negotiate a bad deal for America. Once the
President agrees to a trade agreement, TPA mandates that every detail of a
future agreement be public for anyone to read for at least 60 days
before it can be approved.
It is no secret that I disagree with
the President and this Administration on many issues.They have proven
they cant always be trusted to act in the best interest of Kansans.
That is why TPA is so important because it holds the President
accountable and puts Congress and the American people in the drivers seat so
the President cant unilaterally put immigration laws or climate
change laws in a trade agreement.
Meeting with the Future Farmers

It was great to speak with FFA
students from all over Eastern Kansas in DC this week! As a farm girl, it is
always great to hear about the work they are doing for the future of
Ag in Kansas and our country!

I enjoyed meeting with the Kansas Bankers Association this
