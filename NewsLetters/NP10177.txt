Rubio, Senate Republicans Introduce
Strategic U.S. Response To Deter Russian
Aggression In Europe
In a
press
conference Wednesday , Marco, a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
introduced legislation with 20 Senate
Republicans providing a strategic U.S.
response to deter Russian aggression in
Europe, which threatens regional security
and prosperity that is critical for
maintaining economic growth in the United
States.
We live in a global economy. As
Americans, our ability to sell goods and
services to other nations is critical to
our economic future and to the creation
of jobs. We cannot allow the world to
become a place where countries become off
limits to us, as markets, because they
are afraid of a more powerful neighbor
taking actions against them,
said Rubio . And
thats precisely whats
happened here. And its setting a
precedent, especially for countries like
Russia and potentially China, that if you
dont want a neighboring country to
do more commerce and trade and economic
engagement with the West, you simply
invade them or intimidate them.
What this bill endeavors to do,
these sanctions will do, is it will
change that calculus. It will change that
calculus so that he and the people around
him realize that the costs of having
taken this action now far outweigh any
perceived benefits,
added Rubio . We think
thats what our foreign policy
should be grounded on, and I hope and
urge Senator Reid and the Democrats who
still run this place to give us a chance
to have a vote on this. I think we could
pass it if we did.
Marco discussed Russia sanctions and
free enterprise with FOX News Greta
Van Susteren. Watch the interview

Rubio, Kirk Call On Kerry To Publicly
Reaffirm Conditions On U.S. Aid To The
Palestinian Authority
Marco and Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL)
called on Secretary of State John Kerry to
publicly state that there will be an
immediate cut-off of relevant U.S.
assistance to the Palestinian Authority
should the unity government it is pursuing
fail to comply with the detailed
requirements set forth by the Palestinian
Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006.
In
a
letter to Kerry , Rubio and Kirk
highlighted the counter-productive steps
being taken by the Palestinian Authority
after the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
and
Fatah announced plans to pursue a unity
government with Hamas,
a terrorist
organization that has a stated goal of
wiping Israel from the map.
As you know, the Palestinian
Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 sets detailed
requirements for the continuation of U.S.
assistance should Hamas be brought into
the Palestinian Authority government. The
law is very clear. If Hamas comes to have
a role in governance, there must be
public acknowledgment of the Jewish state
of Israels right to exist as well
as acceptance of all previous agreements
the Palestinians have made with Israel,
the United States, and the international
community,
the senators
wrote . The law also
requires that demonstrable progress be
made toward dismantling of Hamas
terrorist infrastructure and purging of
individuals with ties to terrorism.
Moreover, Hamas would need to halt its
anti-American and anti-Israel incitement.
The bar is high because the stakes are
high and we must make sure to stand
firmly by what we have said. Failing to
do so will diminish the credibility of
the United States.
Unfortunately, we have already
seen reports that influential voices
within Hamas say a unity deal would not
compel Hamas to recognize Israels
right to exist,
they added . It seems clear,
therefore, that the current plans for the
Palestinian Authority continue to
disregard the assurances needed to
support Israels security and move
the Palestinian people further away from
the day when they can live in peace.
Under the unity deal as we
understand it, no effort whatsoever will
be made to disarm Hamas or even request
that it renounce terrorism before joining
the PA. Having an armed terrorist group,
which is still committed to violence
against Israel, as part of the PA
government should make that government
ineligible for American aid,
they continued . We urge you
to state publicly that there will be an
immediate cut-off of relevant U.S.
assistance unless there is full
compliance with the letter and spirit of
all provisions in the Palestinian
Anti-Terrorism Act.
Rubio Extends Thoughts And Prayers To
Floridians Affected By Severe
Flooding
On Wednesday, Marco commented on the
severe and deadly flooding hitting the
Florida Panhandle, extending his thoughts
and prayers to all those affected.
Marco made the following remarks at a
press
conference
on the crisis in
Ukraine:
Just briefly, a moment of
personal privilege. I just want to extend
our thoughts and prayers for those in
Northwest Florida, particularly in
Pensacola, overnight had a massive amount
of flooding, some loss of life,
said Rubio . Weve
been in contact with the Governors
office, also reached out with Senator
Nelson. Were watching very closely
whats happening there. Our
thoughts and our prayers are with
them.
Constituent Casework Corner
Thomas, a small business owner in
Central Florida, contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance because
the IRS was holding his refund without a
clear and definitive reason. When he
contacted the IRS he was not able to
determine why his refund was not released
and he began to wonder if he was the victim
of identity theft. A member of the staff
contacted the Taxpayer Advocate Service to
verify that his account was clear and his
return was filed correctly. Shortly
thereafter, the review was completed and
his refund was released.
