A
Washington that Works for You
During my time spent traveling around northern
Missouri, there is one thing I continuously hear from constituents: people
are frustrated that Washington acts as if it always knows whats best
for them.
In the five years since President Obama took
office, his administration has taken a historically aggressive
approach towards regulating the private sector. Thousands of pages of
regulations have been proposed or finalized under the Obama Administration,
many of which target the energy sector. These regulations stifle
innovation in the industry and increase our reliance on foreign oil. As I
always say, America is an energy rich nation that acts like an energy
poor nation. At a time when gas prices are again on the rise, these
types of regulatory actions out of the White House only make the problem
worse
and are a huge drag on our overall economy.
For
example, last May, the Obama Administration began enforcing a rule that
requires farmers and ranchers to prepare a spill containment plan for
oil products stored on their property. The program requires oil storage
facilities with a capacity of more than 1,320 gallons to make costly
infrastructure improvements to reduce the possibility of oil spills.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, this Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulation would bring more than 70 percent of
farms into the regulatory net, costing farmers both time and money to
comply. It is yet another example of the overly burdensome regulations
weve come to expect from the EPA.
With this in mind, I
helped introduce the
Farmers Undertake Environmental Land
Stewardship (FUELS) Act . This bill modifies the EPAs rule by raising
its exemption levels for fuel storage capacity to better reflect the
spill risk and financial resources of farms. The
FUELS Act
passed the House with bipartisan support earlier this month. With a common
sense approach to regulations, we can avoid placing unneeded burdens
on those who drive our nations economy while still protecting
Americans and our environment.
Washington needs to get back to
working for Americans, rather than against them.
