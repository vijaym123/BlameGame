David, I ran for Congress to fight for you.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disturbing an outside group led by Karl Rove released a deceptive attack campaign targeting me.
We must get out the facts to Illinois voters -- before it's too late to make a difference. So I&rsquo;m asking for your support: please chip in to our Democratic campaign before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline.
