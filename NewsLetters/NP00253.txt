On June 6, 1944, more than 160,000 Allied troops landed
along a 50-mile stretch of beach in Normandy, France. Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower said the operation was one where "we will accept nothing less
than full victory." More than 5,000 Ships and 13,000 aircraft
supported the D-Day invasion. The cost was high. More than 9,000 Allied
soldiers were killed or wounded but by day's end, the Allies had gained a
foot-hold in Continental Europe.
This past weekend, we passed
the 71st anniversary of that fateful day. World War II threatened the
very foundation of our free society. Yet in so many ways, it brought
out the best of what it meant to be an American. As a nation, people
pulled together to support the cause of freedom, from our factory and
dock workers, to the families who rationed their food and grew "Victory
Gardens" and especially our brave men and women in
uniform.
Sadly today, we are losing an estimated 640 World War II veterans
every day. Honor Flight, a non-profit organization created to honor
America's veterans, works to get these heroes to Washington DC to visit
their memorials. It is a great thing when Utah's veterans are able to
come back to DC and visit.
