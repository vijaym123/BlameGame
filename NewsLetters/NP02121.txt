Reducing harmful pollution in our Great Lakes
Dear Friend,
Last week
I joined my colleague Congressman Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, to introduce legislation that would reduce harmful pollution in our Great Lakes. The
Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015
would prohibit the sale or distribution of personal care products that contain synthetic plastic microbeads, effective January 1, 2018.
Synthetic plastic microbeads are small bits of plastic that are used in personal care products like face wash, soap, and toothpaste. They can slip through water treatment systems after they are washed down the drain. As a result, these microbeads often end up in local streams, rivers, and large bodies of water such as the Great Lakes.
Scientists have found evidence of microbeads in numerous bodies of water in the United States, including increasingly in the Great Lakes. In addition to contributing to the buildup of plastic pollution in waterways, microbeads can often be mistaken by fish or other organisms as food. If consumed, the chemicals found in synthetic plastic microbeads can then be passed on to other wildlife and humans.
This common sense, bipartisan legislation is a win-win for consumers and for our Great Lakes ecosystem. As someone who grew up on Lake Michigan and represents a large chunk of Michigan coastline, I understand firsthand how important it is to maintain the beauty and integrity of our Great Lakes.
I will not stand for any actions that put our beloved Great Lakes in jeopardy. I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to reduce this harmful pollutant from entering our waters, our fish, and ultimately us.
God bless,
Fred
