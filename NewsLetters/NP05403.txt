Friend -- I really hate these emails.
I know that Democrats have emailed you a lot in the last few months (I get the emails, too).
And I hate to be the next one to flood your inbox, but there&rsquo;s so much on the line:
The six races that will decide the Senate are a dead heat.
If the GOP wins just three of them, Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s party will take control.
We simply can&rsquo;t risk a Republican Senate that puts millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations ahead of working families.
That&rsquo;s why Democrats are fighting with everything we&rsquo;ve got to win some of our toughest races.
But we need your help TODAY, not later. With the election in just 16 days,
we&#39;re running out of time to make a difference.
Friend, your support will help us to stand up and fight against the GOP and their deep-pocketed donors. Can you pitch in before midnight to help Democrats win?
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
The powerful interests who think they can buy elections just dumped a huge amount of cash into several close battleground races.
They know that spending millions of dollars to influence elections is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions in corporate tax breaks they could get from a Republican-controlled Senate.
But you know what?
We&rsquo;re going to show them that all their Super PAC money can&rsquo;t stand up to the power of the motivated people like you and me.
We&rsquo;re going to show them what real grassroots strength looks like.
And we&rsquo;re going to do it by getting every single Democratic voter we can to the polls on November 4. The result? Deep trouble for the Republicans who think they can buy elections&mdash;but a big win for democracy.
Let&rsquo;s fight for working families &ndash; and fight back against the big-money interests. Please give before midnight to help the Democrats win in November.
Thank you,
Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
