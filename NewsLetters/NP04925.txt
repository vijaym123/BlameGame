This is the
FINAL NOTICE
of your support for Brad Schneider before tonight&rsquo;s final week ad buy deadline.
Chipped in for the Final Week ad buy? ## NO DONATION ##
David -- this is your
LAST CHANCE
to get your support in for Brad before tonight&rsquo;s final week ad buy deadline. If you&rsquo;ve been planning to donate, it&rsquo;s critical you chip in before 11:59 PM.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Sorry to keep repeating ourselves, but we wouldn&rsquo;t email you 4 times in one day if it wasn&rsquo;t important. As of 9:16 PM, we are still $1,213 short of our FINAL WEEK ad buy goal.
If we can hit the mark before midnight, it&rsquo;ll make Boehner think twice about messing with Illinois. But if we don't have the necessary resources, our chances of re-electing Brad to Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district will plummet. David -- rush a last minute donation to help us hit our final week ad buy goal &gt;&gt; Thank you, Schneider HQ
