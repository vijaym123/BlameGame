Dear Friend,
It is an exciting time to be
here in our district. We just held a day honoring our veterans, and I
was also able to speak at a Silicon Harlem Tech Talk about making Harlem
the next tech hub in America. This coming week, I will also be
hosting a career fair which I encourage all job-seekers in the district to
attend. Not only that, but New York has elected its first Democratic
mayor in 20 years, Bill de Blasio.
A
Day to Honor Our Heroes:
Don't forget to thank a veteran on
November 11, Veterans Day, when our nation takes time to remember the
sacrifices of all those who serve and have served in defense of our
freedom. On November 4, I was proud to host "A Day to Honor
Our Heroes,"
at Bronx Community College, whereveterans from
across our district were able to come and hear fantastic presentations on
receiving benefits from Veteran's Affairs, such as health care, college
tuition, assistance for the homeless, and more. As a veteran of the
Korean War, I know firsthand how important it is to work with the VA
when transitioning to civilian life. Attendees were also able to take
advantage of employment resources by the Department of Labor in the form
of training and career counseling. The Veterans History Project was
also there, speaking with our vets and preserving their testimony on
the realities of war for the benefit of future
generations.
Silicon Harlem:
I was extremly pleased
to join many tech enthusiasts to the launch of
Silicon Harlem's "Tech Talk with Charlie &amp; Friends ," to where I
brought my friend David Eun, EVP of the Open Innovation Center, Samsung
Electronics, to share his insights about the future of technology and
innovation and Harlem. Harlem has that special something that has
historically attracted dreamers and visionaries inspire the world. By
fostering creative spaces for synergy and experimentation, I truly believe
that we can bring about a second Harlem Renaissance and transform
Harlem into the next Silicon Valley in
America.
New York City Elections:
I congratulate our new
mayor-elect Bill de Blasio on becoming the first Democratic mayor of New York
in 20 years. I look forward to working with the new administration,
and continuing to ensure that our district is provided the resources it
needs.
