Should the federal government regulate greenhouse gas emissions from
coal-fired power plants?
Yes - We must do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions
Maybe - Each State should decide emission levels for their coal-fired
power plants.
No - Coal-fired power plants have enough regulations as is.

It is always great to be back in the district.
This was a very busy week being back in the district, and it was great
to connect with so many people back home.
Before I delve into this past week, I want to take a moment to join
with Americans around the country in recognizing June as LGBT Pride
Month. It is a time to remember the riots at the Stonewall Inn and the
regrettable policies that have so blatantly violated the human rights
of countless Americans.
Never again shall a country as free as ours suppress the rights of
Americans because of their sexual orientation. One of our greatest
strengths as a nation is our diversity, and we must always strive to
honor and respect that diversity no matter where, or in whom, we find
it.
Because there is still much work to be done in the name of full
equality for all Americans, I echo President Obama's call to eliminate
prejudice everywhere it exists, and I stand with dozens of my
colleagues in Congress who urge for the passage of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would ban employers from
discriminating against workers based on their sexual orientation.
Welcoming Home the Troops
I have the highest respect for our nation's service members; we owe
them the deepest debt for their service. While we must maintain a
strong global presence, I stand with President Obama and his desire to
wind down the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan.
On Tuesday, at the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base, I was
honored to join families and members of the community in welcoming home
nearly 100 soldiers of the California Army National Guard's 216th
Mobility Augmentation Command. The unit was returning home from their
nine-month deployment to the Ghazni Province in Afghanistan where they
were tasked with maintaining roadways and searching for improvised
explosive devices (IEDs). Many of the returning soldiers were Long
Beach residents.
It was such a privilege to meet these brave soldiers, who went into
harm's way every day on the battlefield, as well as their families, who
sacrificed so long without their loved ones on the home front.
My Visit to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
This week I participated in a tour of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service's (USFW) Law Enforcement Office in Torrance.
During the tour, I had the opportunity to meet with the dedicated USFW
staff that ensure prohibited items, such as pelts or clothing from
endangered species and trafficked wildlife, stay off the market.
As a lifelong defender of our wildlife, it was inspiring to see the
dedication of USFW staff and their commitment to protecting endangered
species and the public.
Here is what a typical USFW seizure might entail - figurines made out
of ivory
The tour gave me a direct insight into the important and difficult
tasks given to USFW enforcement offices nationwide. It also gave me a
greater understanding of the role Congress, such as the Natural
Resources Committee I sit on, should play in providing strong support
to the USFW.
Long Beach's Unemployment Rate
According to the California Employment Development Department, Long
Beach's unemployment rate is at a six-year low of 8.4 percent - the
lowest since the Great Recession.
Although there is still much work to be done, both in Long Beach and
across the country, Long Beach's approach to economic and business
development stands as a strong testament to the innovative approaches
that are putting our citizens back to work and getting our communities
and country moving again.

Foster Youth Shadow Day
This was my second year participating in Foster Youth Shadow Day,
organized by the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. I was joined
this year by a young man named Patrick.
Patrick was placed into the foster care system when he was about 9
years old. As a Long Beach resident, Patrick, now 20, participated in
last week's Foster Youth Shadow Day to share his experiences with me
and to help me better understand the perspective of foster youth
throughout our nation. Patrick's advocacy further inspires me to ensure
that we protect our foster youth and ensure that they have the tools
they need to succeed.
Regulating Coal-fired Power Plants
According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 70 percent of Americans
believe the federal government should require limits to greenhouse
gases from existing power plants.
With Congress unable to face and take action on the reality of human
contributions to climate change, President Obama and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed crucial steps to cut carbon
pollution from power plants, which will combat climate change.
You can watch his remarks my clicking here
or on the picture below:
I'm proud to see the president take action on climate change when many
in Congress won't agree that we even have a problem. The President has
taken a big step under the Clean Air Act, but to comprehensively
address this problem Congress will need to show the same leadership.
Ending Gerrymandering For Good
For nearly a year I have been trying to enact legislation in Congress
that will end the unfair practice of gerrymandering. Common throughout
the nation, gerrymandering allows elected officials to draw
congressional district boundaries, often to their benefit and that of
their party.
Last week, I had a great phone interview with the Washington Post about
the need to end gerrymandering once and for all. There is such distrust
in government today,this would be one small step of a long journey to
reestablish that trust.

"Committee Repository"
The U.S. House of Representatives Committee Repository is a collection
of all of the committee and subcommittee hearings that are held on
Capitol Hill. Whether it is the Committee on Veterans' Affairs holding
a hearing on VA staffing, or the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy
and Water Development holding a hearing on appropriate funding levels,
the Committee Repository serves as a resource for staff and the public
to learn about the daily, weekly, and monthly hearings on Capitol Hill.

Do you think Congress should enact a National Ocean Policy?
57.8% Yes - It is critical for the protection and maintenance of the
many uses of our oceans
6.0% Maybe - A National Ocean Policy is critical, but States should
decide their ocean policies
33.7% No - A National Ocean Policy is an overreach of the federal
government, and it will hurt our economy
2.4% I do not know

Never

Long

Unemployment
Rate
According

unemployment
rate
is
at

8.4

since

Although

both
in
Long

and
across
the

Foster
Youth
Shadow
Day
This
was
my
second
year
participating
in
Foster
Youth
Shadow
Day,
organized
by
the
Congressional
Caucus
on
Foster
Youth.
I
was
joined
this
year
by
a
young
man
named
Patrick.
Patrick
was
placed
into
the
foster
care
system
when
he
was
about
9
years
old.
As
a
Long
Beach
resident,
Patrick,
now
20,
participated
in
last
week's
Foster
Youth
Shadow
Day
to
share
his
experiences
with
me
and
to
help
me
better
understand
the
perspective
of
foster
youth
throughout
our
nation. Patrick&#8217;s
advocacy
further
inspires
me
to
ensure
that
we
protect
our
foster
youth
and
ensure
that
they
have
the
tools
they
need
to
succeed.
Regulating

According

70

I&#8217;m
proud
to
see
the
president
take
action
on
climate
change
when
many
in
Congress
won&#8217;t
agree
that
we
even
have
a
problem.
The
President
has
taken
a
big
step
under
the
Clean
Air
Act,
but
to
comprehensively
address
this
problem
Congress
will
need
to
show
the

leadership.
Ending
Gerrymandering
For
Good
For
nearly
a
year
I
have
been
trying
to
enact
legislation
in
Congress
that
will
end
the
unfair
practice
of
gerrymandering.
Common
throughout
the
nation,
gerrymandering
allows
elected
officials
to
draw
congressional
district
boundaries,
often
to
their
benefit
and
that
of
their
party.
Last
week,
I
had
a
great
phone
interview
with
the
Washington
Post
about
the
need
to
end
gerrymandering
once
and
for
all.
There
is
such
distrust
in
government
today,this
would
be
one
small
step
of
a
long
journey
to
reestablish
that
trust.
