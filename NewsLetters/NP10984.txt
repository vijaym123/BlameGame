Dear friend,
This week,
President Obama announced that 7.1 million Americans had enrolled in
the Obamacare exchanges by the March 31 st
deadline.
This was portrayed as a major victory for the President but, not for the
first time, he is missing the point about his signature health care
law.
For starters, most enrollees already had
insurance before Obamacare kicked them off their plan.
While the
Administration wont release an exact number,
McKinsey
estimates that 73 percent of the Obamacare enrollees already had
insurance.
That comes to about 5 million
Americans.
The vast majority of those people liked their health plan.
A
Gallup poll
released before the sign-up deadline
showed that 69 percent of Americans rated their health coverage as either
excellent or good.
But now
thanks to Obamacare
millions
of people find themselves enrolled in a costlier, inferior plan.
Another
Gallup poll
this one released last
month
shows that, among those who have been personally affected by
Obamacare, 70 percent said theyve been hurt by the law.
Among all
Americans, only 10 percent said theyve been helped by it.
Furthermore, when you take a closer look at the 7.1 million
figure, a few
discrepancies
stand
out:
For example,
about 1 million enrollees
have not paid premiums
an
important consideration since insurance wont cover those who wont
pay.
The percentage of Americans without health
insurance has actually gone up since President Obama took
office.
According to
Gallup , it was 15.4 percent in
early 2009; today, its 15.9 percent.
The
percentage of uninsured Americans now covered by Obamacare is
barely one-third
of what the Congressional
Budget Office estimated in 2010.
Four years ago, CBO predicted it
would be 37.3 percent.
Now theyre saying it will be 12.5
percent.
President Obama is fudging the numbers to
hide the real problems with Obamacare. We see those problems every
day
whether they are the higher premiums for working families, the
higher deductibles for individuals, the higher costs for small
businesses, the Medicare cuts for seniors or the infringement on our religious
and civil liberties, as demonstrated in the
Hobby
Lobby case .
While the Administration would prefer to
declare victory and go home, I will continue to draw attention to
Obamacares failures.
I am working hard to repeal the law and
replace it with a market-based solution.
