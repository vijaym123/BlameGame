Dear Friend:
Today, men and women all across the country gather together united with a common purpose: to pray for our nation, our people, and our leaders.
The National Day of Prayer, held annually on the first Thursday of May, was created by Congress in 1952 as a day for Americans to put differences aside, come together, and pray.
Prayer has been a common chord in our nations history, dating back to the Continental Congress in 1775 where our Founding Fathers asked the colonies to pray for wisdom as they shaped our founding principles.
In John Hancocks words, people of all denominations should set apart a day of public humiliation, fasting, and prayer.
From the beginning, America has been grounded in prayer, and we must remain rooted in it, particularly at this time when our country is increasingly divided.
Although you might think differently from your neighbor next door, we all can agree that we are blessed to live in America, the land of the free.
We are blessed to have the freedom to gather openly in our schools, our businesses, and our churches.
We are blessed to be able to speak and worship as we choose.
The bottom line is we are blessed, and today we have the opportunity to stop and give thanks.
Whether you gather at city hall, court houses, businesses, schools, churches, or homes, I encourage you to remember the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to defend these freedoms.
Pray for our troops continued safety and strength and for their loved ones serving here at home.
Pray for our leaders as they make decisions that impact the future and direction of our country.
And pray for our nation to stand further united now and in years to come.
