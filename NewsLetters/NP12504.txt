Sochi and
Obamacare
The Winter Olympics in
Sochi are now underway.
There have been numerous reports about
just how ill-prepared the region was to accommodate the spectators and
athletes at the games.
Hotels where the water is unclean and
rooms lack doorknobs seem to be commonplace, and many manhole covers
hadnt even been set in place before crowds began
arriving.
Its amazing to think that, with as much lead time as Russia had
to prepare, people were spending the final minutes before showtime
screwing in light bulbs.
But then again, weve seen that story here
in the United States with Obamacare.
A three year head
start wasnt enough for the architects of this monstrosity to tighten
the faucets and get the paint job right.
And now were continuing
to see the results of this poor planning.
One report found
that less than 2 million Americans signed up
for Medicaid in the last three months of 2013
many of whom would
have normally enrolled even without
Obamacare.
Additionally,
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
says
that, despite the presidents rosy projections, the law will cost
the economy 2.5 million workers over the next 10 years.
Liberals
have spun this statistic, saying it means more parents will be able to
tuck their children in bed at night.
But what good is that if
they dont have an income to support their family?
While
the Olympics will be over in a matter of days, the failure of Obamacare
will continue to hurt our economy for years to come.
Im
working to stop it before even more damage is done.

Sam Graves
