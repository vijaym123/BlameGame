A Southside
Community Pushes Back Against Federal
Overreach
Dear Friend,
This past week, the people of
Lawrenceville and Brunswick County endured
a tumultuous encounter with the federal
government. It began with a June 12
newspaper
article
indicating that the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) was planning to convert the
recently-closed campus of Saint Paul's
College into a detention center for 500
juvenile illegal immigrants and bring those
juveniles to the campus in a week's time.
They made these plans without informing
community leaders or giving the citizens
any opportunity whatsoever to engage, ask
questions, or express concerns about the
potential public safety and public health
ramifications of such a plan.
This approach was ill-advised, as local
governments bear tremendous responsibility
to provide police, fire, rescue, and health
services - services that would be
dramatically impacted by the establishment
of such a facility. The local elected
leaders and the community conveyed their
significant concerns with this plan to me,
and on June 16,
I
asked HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell
to
halt these plans, allow local leaders to
evaluate how the plans would impact local
services, and provide the citizens an
opportunity to make their voices heard.
Thankfully, HHS paused its process at that
point, allowing the community a chance to
ask important questions.
After HHS spent a few days informing the
public about its plans, a public meeting
took place on June 19 at which a thousand
concerned citizens came forward to share
their views. The overwhelming majority of
those in attendance remained opposed to the
idea, finding the public health and safety
risks far too great. They were also clearly
upset by the manner in which the federal
government tried to force this plan upon
the community. It was apparent that the
community was not satisfied with what HHS
had to say, and that night,
I
called on Secretary Burwell
to withdraw
the plan.
Thankfully, HHS made the right decision,
followed the will of the people, and
withdrew the plan. The people of
Lawrenceville and Brunswick County were
relieved, and I commend the citizens and
their officials for their efforts to engage
and lead throughout a difficult week.
However, it must be said that the manner in
which HHS attempted to impose its plan on
the community without any meaningful input
is a painful reminder of just how
disconnected Washington has become from the
people it is supposed to represent -- a
Washington that always seems to be wiser
and know better than its local elected
leaders and its citizens.
This week also demonstrated the
tremendous frustration that the people of
the Fifth District have with our nation's
immigration policy. What we are seeing on
our southern U.S. border is an undeniable
crisis, and it is a crisis that has been
perpetrated and perpetuated by the federal
government. This administration's refusal
to secure our borders and enforce the laws
of the United States invites persons from
other countries to break our laws and cross
our border illegally, I share the
frustration of my constituents and hope
that this crisis will be a catalyst for a
renewed effort at achieving an immigration
policy that is rooted in the rule of
law.
