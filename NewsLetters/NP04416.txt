ICYMI: Rubio: Honoring Our
Veterans
In Words And Deeds
On Veterans Day, Marco thanked all
veterans for their service and
sacrifices, and highlighted the need to
show our gratitude through both words and
deeds in
an op-ed for The Tampa Tribune
. An excerpt of the op-ed is
below:
On this Veterans Day, we give thanks
to all the brave men and women who have
served our nation in uniform, as well
as their families who have sacrificed
so much.
We also remember their fallen
brothers and sisters in arms, including
Matthew J. LaCourse, a retired
lieutenant colonel flying out of
Floridas Tyndall Air Force Base
who died last week in an F-16 crash.
The United States is a special place
because so many courageous people like
him have defended our country and our
interests abroad.
This past year has been a trying one
for veterans across the country, in
large part because they were victimized
by unspeakable scandals at the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs.
The good news is that despite having
a dysfunctional U.S. Senate, we were
able to pass a law making significant
reforms to the VA.
The bad news is that it took a
crisis to create a sense of urgency to
actually do something.
As we look forward to the next two
years under Republican majorities in
both the House and Senate, we need to
work with a consistent sense of urgency
to get things for our veterans.
This is especially true when it
comes to making sure their medical
needs are met with timely, high-quality
and dignified health care.

Rubio Meets With President Of
Honduras, Urges Continued Cooperation
On Security Issues
On Wednesday, Marco met with the
President of Honduras, Juan Orlando
Hernndez, to discuss U.S.-Honduras
cooperation on combatting drug
trafficking and gang violence,
strengthening democratic order and
independent institutions, and encouraging
greater economic opportunities abroad to
deter illegal immigration, particularly
by unaccompanied minors.
A strong U.S.-Honduras
alliance is key to addressing some of
the most pressing security threats of
our hemisphere,
said Rubio . Working
together to expand cooperation and
strengthen our efforts to stop illicit
human, drug and weapon trafficking is
critical to both Americas
security and that of Latin America.
Given the recent wave of
unaccompanied children, it should be
clear to all that a peaceful,
democratic and prosperous Honduras is
critical to the security and future of
our hemisphere. To end the hopelessness
that contributes to illegal
immigration, we must work together to
address the crushing poverty and deadly
violence that exists in Honduras, in
addition to making sure the Honduran
people do not mistake perceived
ambiguities in our
immigration policies as incentives to
risk their lives coming to the U.S.
illegally,
added Rubio . I look
forward to improving U.S.-Honduras
relations as we work toward achieving
lasting peace and stability in the
region.

Rubio Comments On President
Obamas Net Neutrality
Announcement
Marco, a member of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, issued the following
statement regarding President
Obamas call for increased Internet
regulation:
The Internet is one of the
greatest economic stories in all of
history, one whose openness has given
people unprecedented opportunities to
innovate and create jobs. President
Obamas announced support for
more government regulation of the
Internet threatens to restrict Internet
growth and increase costs on Internet
users. Furthermore, applying
heavy-handed Title II classification to
Internet service sends the wrong
message to international stakeholders
that look to the United States for
leadership in Internet governance, and
undermines our support for an open
Internet, free of government
intervention.
Instead of reclassifying
Internet service under Title II of the
Telecommunications Act, the FCC should
allow Congress to update this law. I
believe it should be a top priority of
the new Congress to provide clarity on
the FCCs role in the modern
communications landscape.

Agency Updates
Scam Phone Calls Continue; IRS
Unveils New Video to Warn Taxpayers
IRS YouTube Video:
Tax Scams:
English
As incidents of an aggressive
telephone scam continue across the
country, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) unveiled a new YouTube video with a
renewed warning to taxpayers not to be
fooled by imposters posing as tax agency
representatives.
The new Tax Scams video describes some
basic tips to help protect taxpayers from
tax scams.
These callers may demand money or may
say you have a refund due and try to
trick you into sharing private
information. Here are five things the
scammers often do but the IRS will not
do. Any one of these five things is a
tell-tale sign of a scam. The IRS will
never:
Call to demand immediate payment,
nor will the agency call about taxes
owed without first having mailed you a
bill.
Demand that you pay taxes without
giving you the opportunity to question
or appeal the amount they say you
owe.
Require you to use a specific
payment method for your taxes, such as
a prepaid debit card.
Ask for credit or debit card
numbers over the phone.
Threaten to bring in local police
or other law-enforcement groups to have
you arrested for not paying.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS and asking
for money, heres what you should
do:
If you know you owe taxes or think
you might owe, call the IRS at
1.800.829.1040. The IRS workers can
help you with a payment issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to believe that
you do, report the incident to the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA) at
1.800.366.4484 or at
www.tigta.gov .
If youve been targeted by
this scam, also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their
FTC Complaint Assistant
at FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
Remember, too, the IRS does not use
email, text messages or any social media
to discuss your personal tax issue. For
more information on reporting tax scams,
go to
www.irs.gov
and type
scam in the search box.
Additional information about tax scams
is available on IRS social media sites,
including YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/user/irsvideos
and Tumblr
http://internalrevenueservice.tumblr.com ,
where people can search
scam to find all the
scam-related posts.
