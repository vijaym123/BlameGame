David --
President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law six years ago tomorrow.
Make no mistake -- it was a major step towards ensuring equal pay. But our work isn&rsquo;t done. Women STILL earn less than men for the same work. In our district, the pay gap is a shocking 73 cents on the dollar.
Cheri won&rsquo;t stand for it. But if we&rsquo;re going to convince Congress to pass an equal pay bill, it&rsquo;ll take a tremendous grassroots effort.
Sign your name to demand Congress pass an equal pay bill &gt;&gt;
Without equal pay, hardworking families will continue to struggle to put food on the table, gas in their cars, and even just pay the bills.
It&rsquo;s just not right. Add your name if you agree women deserve equal pay for equal work: http://action.cheribustos.com/Equal-Pay
