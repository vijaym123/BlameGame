WEEK IN
REVIEW
After a successful Memorial Day district work period, it was
back to Washington this week. Thanks to all of the Arkansans who visited
my office during their visits to our nations capital, including Don
and Shannon Walker of Springdale, Philander Smith College President
Dr. Smothers, Farm Credit Services of Western Arkansas, Kristy Nichols
of Jonesboro, Elizabeth Shackelford of Springdale, the Arkansas
Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, Wesley Northey of Rogers, the
Webster family of Rogers, North Arkansas Regional Medical Center CEO Vince
Leist, the Arkansas Catfish Farmers, Dolores DeBiak of Bentonville,
Pipelife Jet Stream, Daniel Robbins of Russellville, the Arkansas
Missouri Railroad, the Becker family of Gravette, Pace Industries CEO Scott
Bull, the Scott family of Bella Vista, Apple Blossom Brewing Company,
and the Stitt family of Rogers. Safe travels back
home!
On Monday,
the House passed the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing
Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act ( H.R. 1335 ) by a vote of
225-152 ( Roll Call
#267 ). H.R. 1335 amends and reauthorizes the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act to provide increased
flexibility in fisheries management. The bill also includes a number of
provisions to improve local control and flexibility, improve data
collection, protect the privacy of fishermen, implement programs to increase
cooperative research, and prevent executive branch overreach and
overregulation.
On Tuesday, Senator Boozman, Senator Cotton, Congressman Crawford
(AR-1), Congressman Hill (AR-2), Congressman Westerman (AR-4), and
I
received word that 11 Arkansas airports have been awarded
more than $6.5 million from the Department of Transportation to support
facility upgrades and expansions. This includes Russellville Regional
Airport, which will receive $124,184 to acquire land for approaches. In
the state of Arkansas, rural communities matter, and I am excited
about these Federal Aviation Administration grants which ensure our rural
communities
and especially Russellville, which is uniquely situated
to become one of Arkansass most dynamic cities
can remain
accessible through safe and modernized municipal airports and continue to
grow.
On Wednesday, the House passed the Commerce, Justice, Science, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016 ( H.R. 2578 ) by a vote of 242-183
( Roll Call
#297 ). H.R. 2578 provides a total of $51.4 billion in
discretionary budget authority in fiscal year 2016
an increase of
$1.3 billion over the fiscal year 2015 level and $661 million below
the Presidents request
for programs funded under the bill, which
prioritizes funding for law enforcement, national security, science, and
space exploration programs. The bill also makes reductions to several
lower-priority programs for a savings of more than $400 million
compared to fiscal year 2015 and rescinds $375 million in unused prior year
funds. Furthermore, the bill contains several policy provisions,
including prohibiting the transfer or release of certain
Guantanamo detainees into the U.S., protecting Second Amendment rights,
prohibiting funds for exports to the Cuban military officers or their
families, and protecting the sanctity of life.
Today, Im back in the
Third District and joined the Fort Smith Chamber for their First Friday
Breakfast this morning! And tomorrow, I will host a send-off picnic
honoring the Service Academy appointees. All appointed students
as well
as 2015 service academy graduates, any other alumni residing in
Arkansass Third District, and their families
are invited to attend. Those
interested in coming may contact
my Rogers
office
at (479) 464-0446.
Next week, the House will complete
consideration of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016 (H.R. 2577) and will also
consider the Commodity End-User Relief Act (H.R. 2289) sponsored by Rep.
Mike Conaway (TX-11).
