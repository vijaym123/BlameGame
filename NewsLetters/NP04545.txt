Dear Friends,
I hope youre taking some
time this Veterans Day to honor those who have served our
country.
Veterans Day pays tribute to all who have served this great
nation. These men and women have fought or are still fighting for our
national freedoms. Without them, the lives we often take for granted would
not be possible. Veterans have encountered insurmountable odds to
protect us. Today is about honoring that service.
As a
chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, I have had the opportunity of
serving
along side this nations best at Balad Air Base in Iraq. I
was amazed by dedication and determination of those service men and
women. Each had their own unique story, but they were united in their
love for their country.
Bound together in patriotism, veterans
pledge their lives in service to the United States. These men and women
deserved to be celebrated every day of the year.
These
courageous men and women give so much and ask for little in return.
Please, take a moment to thank the Veteran(s) in your life for their
service.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
What an honor to spend my day with
Veterans!
