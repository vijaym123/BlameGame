August Town Hall
Schedule
I wanted to let you know that I have five upcoming town hall
meetings that I will be holding during the month of August.
I plan to
visit Cache County, Salt Lake County, Sanpete County, and Washington
County.
In addition to these visits, I will also be holding a town
hall meeting that will focus on the military and veteran communities
in Utah.
For a full list of the dates, times, and locations of these events,
please visit the
Town Hall Page
of my
Website.
I look
forward to meeting with Utahns across the state to hear your concerns,
answer your questions, and share more information about the solutions
I am working on in Washington DC.
You are all invited to attend
a town hall meeting in your area to be a part of this important
dialogue. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
