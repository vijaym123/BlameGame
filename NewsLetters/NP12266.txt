Dear Friend,
There is a healthcare crisis happening in Texas. As opposed to critics
of the healthcare reform law, the real crisis happening in our great
state is that Texas has the highest rate of uninsured individuals in
the nation.
I aspire for Texas to be a leader on all fronts, including healthcare
coverage. The highest rate of uninsured is a real problem that is due
for a solution, not political rhetoric and standup. This is a problem
affecting families and children who are burdened with exaggerated
healthcare costs and bills in the event of an unforeseen emergency. It
affects our college students who are subjected to pay for their doctor's
appointments out of pocket without insurance, instead of paying for
their college textbooks.
I believe that the Affordable Care Act is the solution to this problem
and the numbers show it. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, many
families, students, and our children have the opportunity for
accessible and affordable health insurance. As of October 1, 2013, over
200,000 Texans have selected a marketplace plan and more continue to
enroll each day.
District report on the Affordable Care Act:
Last Saturday, I participated in a city and county-wide event to
educate and enroll folks in the Affordable Care Marketplace.
14
organizations---from the SA Metro Health Department to the San Antonio
Food bank---brought together hundreds of volunteers to educate San
Antonio. 69 folks, many of them bilingual, assisted to enroll San
Antonians in healthcare plans, as well as provide flu shots and
information on Medicaid. More than 1,500 individuals came out for the
event. Almost 300 people successfully enrolled in healthcare in the 5
hour period, while others got a chance to see the choices that are
available to them and make appointments to enroll before the March 31st
deadline.
I was encouraged by the way our community partnered together
to ensure that all San Antonians have a chance to access affordable
healthcare.
If you missed the event, don't worry, there's still time to get your
coverage. Here are some helpful resources for you and your family:
Deadline to enroll: March 31st deadline for open enrollment in a
healthcare plan under the Affordable Care Act
You can enroll by yourself at your own convenience:
Online: visit healthcare.gov
for information or to enroll in a plan
By phone: call the marketplace helpline 24/7 at 1-800-318-2596 for
information or to enroll
By mail: download an application and instructions from healthcare.gov
In person:
To find someone in your area who can assist you in
enrolling, visit localhelp.healthcare.gov
I enrolled for affordable health care through the marketplace and
encourage all of you to check out your options.
Affordable, accessible
and reliable health insurance is an important lifeline for Texans.
Capitol Hill report:
Time and time again, responsible lawmakers have urged to pass
legislation to ensure our nation pays its bills without any
controversial policy riders that only serve as poison pills. When
lawmakers raise the debt ceiling, it does not equate to more spending -
it is paying bills our nation has already incurred.
Lawmakers came to the consensus that not paying our nation's bills is
not an option. Unprecedented default is also not an option. And putting
the full faith and credit of the United States at risk is not
negotiable for political ideology. I voted in favor of paying our
nation's bills and averting a potential financial crisis. Just like
every American family has to pay its bills, so does our nation. It's
that simple and should not be used as a gambling chip.
Additionally, as a representative of Military City USA, I strive to
ensure that our brave soldiers and veterans are granted the benefits
they deserve and those that were promised to them. Following the
passage of the budget deal in December, there was a provision included
that would cut military retirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)
for working-age retirees in 2015, which I staunchly opposed. Know that
earlier this week I voted in favor of a bill that would repeal this
cut: S. 25, the Military Retiree COLA Restoration Act.
>From San Antonio district events to Washington D.C. weekdays, my goal
is to ensure your voice is heard. It is a privilege to serve as your
Representative.

Joaquin Castro

2014 Dear
Friend,
There
is
a
healthcare
crisis
happening
in
Texas.
As
opposed
to
critics
of
the
healthcare
reform
law,
the
real
crisis
happening
in
our
great
state
is
that
Texas
has
the
highest
rate
of
uninsured
individuals
in
the
nation.
I
aspire
for
Texas
to
be
a
leader
on
all
fronts,
including
healthcare
coverage.
The
highest
rate
of
uninsured
is
a
real
problem
that
is
due
for
a
solution,
not
political
rhetoric
and
standup.
This
is
a
problem
affecting

are
burdened
with
exaggerated
healthcare
costs

the

our
college

who
are

to
pay
for
their
doctor&#8217;s
appointments
out
of
pocket
without

instead
of
paying
for
their
college
textbooks.
I
believe
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
the
solution
to
this
problem
and
the
numbers
show
it.
Thanks
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
many
families,
students,
and
our
children
have
the
opportunity
for
accessible
and
affordable
health
insurance.

over
200,000
