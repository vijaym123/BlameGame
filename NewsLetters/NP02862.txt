President Obama: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love a constitutional amendment to reverse Citizens United&rdquo; Vox, 2/9/15
David --
Citizens United opened the door for the Koch Brothers to spend hundreds of millions to buy the 2014 elections. And now they want to spend nearly a BILLION in 2016. The only way to stop this madness is to overturn Citizens United.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama and everyone who believes in fair elections is calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn it:
