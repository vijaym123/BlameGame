REMINDER: Westmoreland Hosts Social Security and Medicare Information
Workshop
On Thursday, April 24, 2014, I
will host a Social Security and Medicare Information Workshop at the
Asa Powell Expo Center from 9:00am
12:00pm. The Asa Powell Expo Center
is located at 197 Temple Avenue (behind the Waffle House) in Newnan,
Georgia. There will be representatives from the Social Security
Administration and the Area Agency on Aging to discuss the
opportunities and services they provide, as well as an opportunity to speak about
your case with them and with my
staff.
I would like to thank the speakers for giving their time to help
the constituents of Georgias Third District in getting the
information that they need and my staff for arranging this event. This workshop
is an opportunity to get more information on the services out there
and ask local experts your questions to make sure youre getting access
to your benefits.
