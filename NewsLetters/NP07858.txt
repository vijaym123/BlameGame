Last week:
Boehner unveiled his legislation SUING President Obama.
Tomorrow:
House Republicans are holding Congressional hearings to set the lawsuit into motion.
Today:
We face our first major mid-month fundraising deadline.
David -- Our response today will show if we&rsquo;re serious about defending President Obama. If we can&rsquo;t show a huge surge of support right now:
BOEHNER WINS.
All eyes are on us today. But with less than 12 hours to go before our mid-month fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;re still coming up $1OO,OOO short.
We have to hit our goal to prove Boehner made a huge mistake when he decided to sue the President. We need 4,761 more donors to step up today. Will you chip in $5 or more right now? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
