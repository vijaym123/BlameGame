Mayor Melchor A. Mendiola stopped by the Rota Congressional Office this week. We discussed a wide range of issues affecting the people of Rota. Thank you, Mayor, for helping me stay well informed about Rota and for your hospitality.
Federal workers' pay rises
Federal workers in the Marianas and nationwide will see their salaries increase on January 1 for the first time in three years. President Obama signed an executive order before Christmas lifting federal pay by 1 percent. The increase was recommended in the Presidents budget plan for fiscal 2014; and the budget deal that Congress approved in December did not block the cost of living adjustment for federal workers. So the President used his authority to put the pay raise into effect
good news for the many federal employees in the NMI, who have waited a long time for this adjustment, and good news for the Marianas economy, where much of that extra pay will be spent.

Army CPL Jeremiah Reyes stopped in to his Saipan Congressional Office this week, while on leave here to visit his family. CPL Reyes, the son of Joseph and Evangelina Reyes of Obyan, Saipan, is currently stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. Welcome home, CPL Reyes, and thank you for your service to our nation. Hooah!
2014 holds promise for NMI
As the Second Session of the 113th U.S. Congress begins, it is a good time to look ahead to major legislation that could benefit the Northern Mariana Islands:
The FARRM bill
I joined the Agriculture Committee in the 112th Congress with the goal of bringing the Northern Marianas into the national food stamp program, SNAP, doubling benefits for our lower income families and bringing millions of dollars into our island economy. That work may pay off early in 2014. Conferees are close to settling on a bill to send to the House and Senate extending national farm policy and SNAP.
Water Resources Reform and Development Act
Another carryover from 2013 is WRRDA. In addition to providing eligibility for the Northern Marianas for federal funding to protect shorelines and areas vulnerable to flooding, I was able to improve the local match requirement in the House-passed version of the bill, doubling our local match exemption. House and Senate conferees have met. Now a negotiated bill will have to be reported back to each body for a final vote.
2014/15 appropriations
The final vote in the House in 2013 approved a budget for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Spending levels were increased slightly, which could protect some programs from the effects of sequestration, the across-the-board cuts that have reduced funding for the military and for domestic programs such as Head Start. The Appropriations Committees have been working with these new caps, so that 2014 spending bills can be enacted by January 15. Then, the annual appropriations process begins for fiscal 2015, offering new opportunity to work for programs important to the Marianas.
Child nutrition
Although child nutrition programs are not up for reauthorization until 2015, 2014 will be a year for developing the data needed to support parity of funding for school meals in the Northern Marianas. Currently, Hawaii and Alaska receive higher reimbursement rates because of the higher costs of food in those remote areas of the U.S. The Marianas and other territories get the mainland rate. Data gathered in 2014, demonstrating that our school children could be better fed if federal rates matched local costs, will help our efforts during reauthorization in 2015.
Elementary and Secondary Education Act
I moved back to the Education Committee in the 113th Congress because I believe that an educated population is the key to future prosperity in the Northern Marianas. Federal funding for our Public School System is expected to increase by $3 million in fiscal 2014 under Title 1-A of the ESEA. But the Act itself, which sets funding formulas, is in need of reauthorization. This legislation also gives us the opportunity to make PSS eligible to compete for the Race to the Top and Investing in Innovation grants, begun under the Obama administration.
NDAA follow-up
The growing importance of the annual National Defense Authorization Act was demonstrated when we were able to include provisions in 2013 requiring the Air Force to work with the Northern Marianas Governor in choosing Tinian or Saipan for a divert airfield and to report to Congress on the alternatives considered for spending $29.3 million allotted for airfield infrastructure. As the build-up in our region continues, the NDAA will increasingly be a means for us to shape and control military activity in the Northern Marianas.
Immigration reform
The Senate passed legislation in 2013, but the effort for immigration reform stalled in the House. Speaker John Boehner, however, continues to signal that reform is on his agenda, albeit with a more piecemeal approach than the comprehensive Senate bill. The Catholic Church, the Chamber of Commerce, and other large interests are keeping up the pressure for reform for a variety of reasons
to protect the integrity of families, to assure that the economy can continue to grow. But there are also legitimate concerns that borders must be secure and that no one should obtain a green card or citizenship, who has not followed the rules. With the NMI still in the middle of the transition from local to federal management of immigration we will have to be watchful that whatever national policies are enacted they fit our needs.
Healthcare implementation
Polarized, partisan positions on healthcare reform make the opportunity for amendment of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, seem remote. Clearly, however, as the law is implemented, problems have arisen that could be smoothed over with legislative action. One problem area is the partial application of the law to the territories. The Northern Marianas is getting an extra $109 million in Medicaid money at a time when our hospital has been in desperate need. We have a new Community Health Center in Kagman as a result of Obamacare funding. And our insurance industry is being regulated to protect consumers, as never before. But we still have more people in the NMI without health insurance than the national average
and they need the access to affordable care that is our ultimate legislative goal.
Rota Park study
Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and his Republican counterpart Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) have formed a strong working relationship at the head of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That bond led them to introduce my Northern Marianas submerged lands conveyance bill last year, and steer it successfully through the Senate and on to become law. Wyden is widely said to be in line for Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, however, when Senator Max Bachus leaves this year to be our Ambassador to China. Wyden and Murkowski may work even harder before that change happens to clear bills through the Energy Committee. Among those ripe for action is H.R. 674, my bill authorizing a study of the feasibility of creating a National Park to protect the cultural, historical, and natural resources of Rota.
Omnibus Territories Act
Another bill moving forward in the Senate is the Omnibus Territories Act I drafted in collaboration with other territorial Delegates and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. Provisions of most importance to the Northern Mariana Islands include an extension of the immigration transition period, assuring we will have sufficient labor available for economic growth through 2019, and, also, improvements to accountability for the $150 training fee employers pay for each CW-worker hired. I want to make sure that those funds, which added up to $1 million last year, are spent in a way that results in local US workers getting jobs in our islands economy.
