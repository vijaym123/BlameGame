Labor Day: Honoring Americas Working Men and
Women
As we prepare
to enjoy this years Labor Day weekend, it is worth reflecting on the
origins of this holiday and how it has evolved over the years. Labor
Day became an official national holiday in 1894. Linda Stinson, a former
U.S. Department of Labor historian, answers some common questions
about history of Labor Day in this
interesting
Q&amp;A .
Economy
Still Stuck in Neutral
The best way to honor Americas working men and women would
be to create more jobs and opportunities. Unfortunately, the Obama
Administrations economic policies continue to depress economic growth
across America. Among the disturbing data that points to the ongoing
troubles facing American families is the number of people who have to work
two jobs to make ends meet.
This piece
from the
Daily Record
details the challenges families are facing
and how hard they are
working
to survive as the slowest recovery in 70 years continues to
stumble along.
The House
has passed 40 bills that would jump-start the economy and expand
opportunity, but the Senate hasnt considered a single one of them. Its
time for the Senate to get to work and pass these
bills.
WSJ: Chinas Reckless
Military
Having
just returned from leading a Congressional Delegation to the Pacific, I
am well aware of the high level of concern many of our allies have in
the region about Chinas provocative actions to expand its military
influence in the region (see my Special Report on my trip
here ).
This
Wall Street Journal
piece
details what
China is doing and why it is making its Pacific neighbors
nervous.
Tax-Free Savings
Canadian Style
This interesting
article
in the
Wall Street
Journal
explores Canadas Tax-Free Savings Accounts, which are
similar to Roth IRAs, but much more flexible. These accounts, which
were introduced in Canada just five years ago, have been wildly popular
nearly half of all Canadians have signed
up.
This is an intriguing proposal; Id be
interested in your thoughts about it. Visit my website at
Frelinghuysen.house.gov
to send me your
thoughts.
George Will: Use of
force against Islamic State could create a new
void
Writing in the
Washington
Post , columnist George Will
explains
why
limited air strikes will not be sufficient to eliminate the threat posed by
the terrorist Islamic State. Its well worth a
read.
Perry and Shultz: Helping
Ukraine Is a U.S. Imperative"
Two of Americas most respected defense and foreign
policy experts
former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former
Secretary of State George Shultz
make a
convincing
case for United States solidarity with Ukraine as its seeks to
preserve its sovereignty in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.
Salute: Yvonne
Mortello, Sussex County Teacher of the Year
Congratulations to Yvonne Mortello, a
kindergarten teacher in the Hopatcong Borough School District, who was
named
Sussex County Teacher of the Year by the New
Jersey Department of Education.
With the 2014-2015 school year getting underway, I salute Yvonne
Mortello and all the excellent and dedicated educators who make our
schools some of the best in the nation.
Salute: ARC of Essex
County
I salute the ARC of
Essex County on the opening, in Livingston, of its
newest
affordable group home for intellectually and developmentally
disabled adults. This new facility represents a partnership between the
ARC and Livingston. This new home will give its residents an
opportunity to live more independently as members of a caring community.
Congratulations to everyone who helped bring this
about!
