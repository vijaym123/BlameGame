A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
February 13, 2015
Dear Friends,
With the numerous complex threats facing our national security -
ranging from a serious threat by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
and its affiliates, the crisis in Ukraine and the security risks from
Boko Haram - it is essential that we have an efficient and steadfast
Secretary of Defense. I am encouraged that Dr. Ashton Carter, whom I
supported and was confirmed to the position by the Senate this week in
a 93-5 vote, has shown independent judgment and a willingness not to be
a rubber stamp for the White House.
It is important that we continue our mission to combat terrorists
around the globe. I expect Dr. Carter to honestly assess the military's
needs in order to successfully fulfill its mission to degrade and
defeat ISIS. Additionally, I expect Dr. Carter to instill a culture of
accountability at the Department of Defense, and ensure our national
security remains a top priority. As a nation, we need to send our
servicemen and women with the necessary equipment so that they are
prepared to successfully carry out their missions. At a time when we
cannot afford to let Iran gain access to nuclear weapons or allow the
further destabilization of Eastern Europe, it is imperative for us to
ensure that the U.S. military remains the world's premier fighting
force.
Authorization for the Use of Military Force
Congress received a request on Wednesday from President Obama to
authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State of Iraq
and Syria and its affiliates. As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, I will participate in discussions for the best
strategy to confront the threat posed by ISIS.
This issue is not to be taken lightly, and Congress will need to
carefully review this proposal to ensure that any authorization meets
the military's needs in order to successfully fulfill its mission to
defeat ISIS. We cannot equivocate when it comes to protecting our
homeland.
Clay Hunt Act
Yesterday, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act
was signed into law by the president. I am
pleased that the men and women who have served and sacrificed so much
for our nation's freedom will be provided better access to mental
health resources. The passage of the Clay Hunt SAV Act was my first
priority as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
I appreciate all who worked to ensure this important legislation was
passed and signed into law quickly. I am committed to seeing to it that
we change the paradigm at the Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver
a variety of quality services in unique ways that will benefit all
veterans.
Also, I look forward to working with Dr. Keita M. Franklin, who is the
new director of the Department of Defense Suicide Prevention.
Obamacare
On Wednesday, I joined a number of colleagues on the Senate Finance
Committee in sending a letter to the Obama administration questioning
their lack of planning or communication to millions of residents of
Georgia and as many as 35 other states in advance of a significant U.S.
Supreme Court ruling expected in the coming months on an Obamacare
lawsuit known as the King v. Burwell case.
The question before the Supreme Court is whether Obamacare's tax
credits and subsidies are for all consumers or are limited only to
consumers of state-run marketplaces. If the Supreme Court rules that
the Obamacare law may provide tax credits and subsidies only through
exchanges established by a state, that would have a substantial impact
on residents of as many as 36 states - including Georgia - that use a
federal exchange rather than a state-run exchange.
I want to make certain that the government has notified people who have
signed up through the HHS insurance exchange-including the thousands of
Georgians who were forced to enroll after Obamacare cancelled their
health plans-of the potential consequences of the Court ruling against
the government, especially given the fact that the cost of the program
could be significantly increased. Read more here

Union Elections
Also this week, I co-sponsored a resolution to stop a federal labor
board from implementing a new rule that would give union organizers the
upper hand in union representation elections, harming employers and
employees alike. The National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, released
a rule in December 2014 that would fast track union elections and
infringe on employees' privacy. The so-called "ambush election" rule
would shorten the time between when a petition is filed to the day the
election is held from the current median of 38 days to as few as 10
days. This same rule was struck down several years ago by a federal
court because the NLRB did not have a quorum at the time it adopted the
rule.
I have been fighting against these unfair rulings by the NLRB since
President Obama took office and began illegally appointing members
during Senate recess periods. It is only fair to give a company and its
employees enough time to make its case prior to a union election, and
when you compress that time, you create a rush to judgment, or an
"ambush," at a time when our economy and our middle class are trying to
recover from a recession, this is absolutely the wrong thing to do.

The Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the The Amy and Vicky Child Pornography
Victim Restitution Improvement Act
. This will help to provide restitution to the victims
of these horrible crimes, and I am pleased to have co-sponsored this
piece of legislation.

Dear
Friends,
With
the
numerous
complex
threats
facing
our
national
security
&ndash;
ranging
from
a
serious
threat
by
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Syria
and
its
affiliates,
the
crisis
in
Ukraine
and
the
security
risks
from
Boko
Haram
&ndash;
it
is
essential
that
we
have
an
efficient
and
steadfast
Secretary
of
Defense.
I
am
encouraged
that
Dr.
Ashton
Carter,
whom
I
supported
and
was
confirmed
to
the
position
by
the
Senate
this
week
in
a
93-5
vote,
has
shown
independent
judgment
and
a
willingness
not
to
be
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
White
House.
It
is
important
that
we
continue
our
mission
to
combat
terrorists
around
the
globe.
I
expect
Dr.
Carter
to
honestly
assess
the
military's
needs
in
order
to
successfully
fulfill
its
mission
to
degrade
and
defeat
ISIS.
Additionally,
I
expect
Dr.
Carter
to
instill
a
culture
of
accountability
at
the
Department
of
Defense,
and
ensure
our
national
security
remains
a
top
priority.
As
a
nation,
we
need
to
send
our
servicemen
and
women
with
the
necessary
equipment
so
that
they
are
prepared
to
successfully
carry
out
their
missions.
At
a
time
when
we
cannot
afford
to
let
Iran
gain
access
to
nuclear
weapons
or
allow
the
further
destabilization
of
Eastern
Europe,
it
is
imperative
for
us
to
ensure
that
the
U.S.
military
remains
the
world's
premier
fighting
force.
Authorization
for
the
Use
of
Military
Force
Congress
received
a
request
on
Wednesday
from
President
Obama
to
authorize
the
use
of
military
force
against
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Syria
and
its
affiliates.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee,
I
will
participate
in
discussions
for
the
best
strategy
to
confront
the
threat
posed
by
ISIS.
This
issue
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly,
and
Congress
will
need
to
carefully
review
this
proposal
to
ensure
that
any
authorization
meets
the
military's
needs
in
order
to
successfully
fulfill
its
mission
to
defeat
ISIS.
We
cannot
equivocate
when
it
comes
to
protecting
our
homeland.
Clay
Hunt
Act
Yesterday,
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act
was
signed
into
law
by
the
president.
I
am
pleased
that
the
men
and
women
who
have
served
and
sacrificed
so
much
for
our
nation's
freedom
will
be
provided
better
access
to
mental
health
resources.
The
passage
of
the
Clay
Hunt
SAV
Act
was
my
first
priority
as
chairman
of
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee.
I
appreciate
all
who
worked
to
ensure
this
important
legislation
was
passed
and
signed
into
law
quickly.
I
am
committed
to
seeing
to
it
that
we
change
the
paradigm
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
deliver
a
variety
of
quality
services
in
unique
ways
that
will
benefit
all
veterans.
Also,
I
look
forward
to
working
with
Dr.
Keita
M.
Franklin,
who
is
the
new
director
of
the
Department
of
Defense
Suicide
Prevention.
Obamacare
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
a
number
of
colleagues
on
the
Senate
Finance
Committee in
sending
a
letter
to
the
Obama
administration
questioning
their
lack
of
planning
or
communication
to
millions
of
residents
of
Georgia
and
as
many
as
35
other
states
in
advance
of
a
significant
U.S.
Supreme
Court
ruling
expected
in
the
coming
months
on
an
Obamacare
lawsuit
known
as
the
King
v.
Burwell
case.
The
question
before
the
Supreme
Court
is
whether
Obamacare's
tax
credits
and
subsidies
are
for
all
consumers
or
are
limited
only
to
consumers
of
state-run
marketplaces.
If
the
Supreme
Court
rules
that
the
Obamacare
law
may
provide
tax
credits
and
subsidies
only
through
exchanges
established
by
a
state,
that
would
have
a
substantial
impact
on
residents
of
as
many
as
36
states
&ndash;
including
Georgia
&ndash;
that
use
a
federal
exchange
rather
than
a
state-run
exchange.
I
want
to
make
certain
that
the
government
has
notified
people
who
have
signed
up
through
the
HHS
insurance
exchange&mdash;including
the
thousands
of
Georgians
who
were
forced
to
enroll
after
Obamacare
cancelled
their
health
plans&mdash;of
the
potential
consequences
of
the
Court
ruling
against
the
government,
especially
given
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
the
program
could
be
significantly
increased.

Union
Elections
Also
this
week,
I
co-sponsored
a
resolution
to
stop
a
federal
labor
board
from
implementing
a
new
rule
that
would
give
union
organizers
the
upper
hand
in
union
representation
elections,
harming
employers
and
employees
alike.
The
National
Labor
Relations
Board,
or
NLRB,
released
a
rule
in
December
2014
that
would
fast
track
union
elections
and
infringe
on
employees'
privacy.
The
so-called
"ambush
election"
rule
would
shorten
the
time
between
when
a
petition
is
filed
to
the
day
the
election
is
held
from
the
current
median
of
38
days
to
as
few
as
10
days.
This
same
rule
was
struck
down
several
years
ago
by
a
federal
court
because
the
NLRB
did
not
have
a
quorum
at
the
time
it
adopted
the
rule.
I
have
been
fighting
against
these
unfair
rulings
by
the
NLRB
since
President
Obama
took
office
and
began
illegally
appointing
members
during
Senate
recess
periods.
It
is
only
fair
to
give
a
company
and
its
employees
enough
time
to
make
its
case
prior
to
a
union
election,
and
when
you
compress
that
time,
you
create
a
rush
to
judgment,
or
an
"ambush,"
at
a
time
when
our
economy
and
our
middle
class
are
trying
to
recover
from
a
recession,
this
is
absolutely
the
wrong
thing
to
do.

This
