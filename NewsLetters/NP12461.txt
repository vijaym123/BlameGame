Dear
David,
On
February 6, 2014,
new data
were released that shows
the U.S.-South Korea trade imbalance has reached its largest deficit
on record: $20.673 billion, a 56 percent increase from 2011. This
comes just two years after the Korea-United States "free trade" agreement
went into effect. This flawed trade agreement was passed in 2011 under
a process called Fast Track Authority, which prevented me and fellow
Members of Congress from amending the trade deal on behalf of our
constituents. These data only further demonstrate why Congress must not
renew Fast Track Authority and stop the proposed Trans-Pacific
Partnership - another flawed trade agreement that threatens to ship more
American jobs overseas and dump our wages and benefits overboard along the
way.
Instead of pushing
flawed trade agreements, I believe Congress should pass legislation
that supports U.S. manufacturing and will help create middle-class jobs
in America. That is why I have introduced H.R. 3467, the
Reciprocal Market Access Act . This legislation would instruct
U.S. trade negotiators to eliminate barriers that hurt American
manufacturers' ability to sell their goods abroad
before
entering any new "free trade" agreements. In addition, my
legislation would create a tool to quickly reinstate our own barriers if a
foreign government does not allow American businesses to fairly compete
in their markets.
We must finally create a level playing
field for Americans to compete and win through
fair
trade. I remain as committed as ever to transforming U.S. trade
policy so that we can finally create new family-wage jobs in America,
safeguard our environment, maintain consumer protections and grow our
middle class.
