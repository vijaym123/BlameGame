Dear Friends,
Today is a special day across the nation, and especially here in South
Carolina. We are thankful for the courage and sacrifice of our veterans
everyday, and Veterans' Day provides us an opportunity to highlight our
appreciation.
Growing up in a military family myself, and with two brothers currently
in the military, I know that words cannot possibly show how truly
grateful we are to those who have served our nation, as well as their
families who have stayed strong through it all.
Our hearts remain heavy for those who are no longer with us, and we
will never forget them. All it takes is stepping foot on the grounds of
Beaufort National Cemetery, or Florence and Ft. Jackson National
Cemeteries, to truly feel the power of their sacrifice. Earlier this
year we honored our Korean War-era veterans in Spartanburg and North
Charleston, and it was truly an experience I will never forget.

I had the opportunity to celebrate the Marine Corps 238th Birthday on
Parris Island and tour the Beaufort VA Clinic on Friday, and I look
forward to spending today at a ceremony in Walterboro honoring our
veterans.
Please join me today and everyday in thanking our veterans. Their
blood, sweat and tears are the backbone of our nation, and we are
forever thankful.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
