Sorry to email you again, David. (I think it&rsquo;s the 4th time this week?)
I know you&rsquo;ve gotten emails from President Obama and Vice President Biden, as well.
I promise it&rsquo;s all for good reason.
We keep emailing because we have to catch up to Boehner.
This week, he launched $30 million worth of anti-Obama attack ads. And voters around the country will be seeing those ads from now until election day.
The only way we can respond to this barrage of attacks is if you keep chipping in. We&rsquo;re down to our last 6 hours and still coming up $26,629 short. Can I count on you today?

Thanks,
Nancy
