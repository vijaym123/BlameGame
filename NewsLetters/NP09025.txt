Rep. Peter Welch made the following statement today after the Obama
administration announced a plan to reduce power plant
emissions:
Climate change is real and poses a
serious threat to our economy, environment and public health.
And
Vermont is not immune from its effects.
Just ask our farmers, sugar
makers and ski area operators.
They will tell you how climate
change is already upon them.
Across the country, severe weather
events related to climate change, like Tropical Storm Irene, are
becoming more commonplace.
Every day we wait
makes solving this problem much more difficult.
The current
Congress simply cannot find common ground on addressing this issue.
Incredibly, the Republican-led House just passed an amendment banning
the Pentagon from studying the impact of climate change on national
security.
So I am pleased that the President, in the face of
climate change denial by Congress, has taken bold action today, using the
executive authority available to him, to tackle one of the leading
causes of climate change.
EPAs plan is a
flexible, common sense approach to reducingpower plant emissions that
allows states and utilities to tailor remedies to local and regional
circumstances.
I am particularly pleased that this plan promotes
energy efficiency as a key remedy to carbon emissions.
Vermont has
led the nation on energy efficiency and is reaping the benefits of
lower electric bills, good jobs, and a cleaner
environment.
