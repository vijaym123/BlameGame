Dear Friends,
California Republicans had a good day on the House floor yesterday speaking in support of our water bill - the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act (H.R. 3964) - which passed on a 229-191 vote. I made some comments directed toward the bill's opponents, who needed a few things spelled out for them. You can watch my remarks here .
Sincerely,
