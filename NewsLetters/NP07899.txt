Did you see what we posted on
Facebook?
Did you see the
Fox News report
on legislation I helped introduce
earlier this week to protect access to home health
care?
How about
the conversation
we had online focused on key topics of the day like the crisis at our
Southern Border?
Or
thoughts we shared
about the recent Supreme Court
rulings?
All of these items were
posted on our Facebook page at
Facebook.com/RepTomPrice . We want to keep you informed about the legislative and policy
solutions we are engaged in every day, and to do that we hope youll
follow our activities on
Facebook
as well as on
Twitter
@RepTomPrice .
Of course, you can always send a letter, an email or call our
office directly. All of our contact info is available at
tom.house.gov .
Your
input is vital, and we hope youll join us on Facebook and Twitter to
keep an open and constructive conversation
going.
Have a great
day!
