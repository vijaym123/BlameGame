The Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) drug approval process is bulky with bureaucracy and clogged with outdated regulations. Too often it blocks, rather than encourages, potential breakthroughs. Its not easy to measure the impact this has on our medical environment: who can say how many of our nations most innovative researchers attempts to bring groundbreaking new treatments to patients have been crippled by the FDAs clunky process? Lost opportunity is difficult to quantify. But thats all the more reason it is crucial to streamline the FDAs drug approval process and regulations on emerging technologies, and to accelerate the pace of medical innovation.
Recently, the FDA announced it is committed to streamlining its processes in the context of simplifying and accelerating the application process for unapproved investigational drugs. Better, though, would be the simplification and acceleration of the process for drug approval itself
so fewer patients are waiting for treatments tangled up in red tape, and more patients are able to access innovative new cures that have been safely tested.
The bottom line is this :
our medical system will only be successful when it is driven by innovation and discovery, instead of bureaucracy .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released a bipartisan discussion draft with suggestions for reforming the FDAs drug approval process, and multiple Members of Congress have called on the FDA to take action. I will continue to keep you updated on this issue and our progress.
