The Colorado Floods &ndash; Six Months After
For many Coloradans, the last six months were a stressful time of personal hardship, damage assessment and rebuilding. Since September, FEMA, the Small Business Administration and the National Flood Insurance Program paid out $284 million in claims, loans and grants to help Coloradans recover from last September&rsquo;s floods. FEMA designated 18 counties for assistance, including both Adams and Jefferson counties in the 7th Congressional District.
Now we are focused on long-term recovery efforts to ensure Colorado stays on the path to full individual, economic and environmental recovery. Here&rsquo;s is how we are looking forward:

FEMA awarded a Disaster Case Management Grant of $2,667,963 to the State of Colorado. Under this state-administered program, case managers will meet one-on-one with survivors to assess unmet disaster-related needs not covered by other resources.
Disaster Unemployment Assistance and Crisis Counseling
$302,795 was distributed to Coloradans facing unemployment directly because of the disaster.
Counselors talked directly with 18,178 people and provided referrals and other helpful information to more than 88,000.
Hazard Mitigation
More than half of Public Assistance repair projects contain disaster mitigation designs to lessen the impact of similar disasters on publicly owned infrastructure.

CFPB recovers more than $1 million for veterans, service members and their families
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that servicemembers, veterans and their families who contacted the CFPB about financial products or services recovered more than $1 million from July 2011 through January 2014.
The CFPB established the Office of Servicemember Affairs to address specific consumer protection concerns for the nation&rsquo;s military community. I&rsquo;m glad veterans, their families and all Americans see better consumer protection under this law.
In addition to monetary relief, the CFPB can also assist in other financial areas, including:
Cleaning up credit reports
Stopping harassment from debt collectors
Correcting account information
The top three complaints by servicemembers, veterans and their families are mortgages, debt collection, and credit cards.
