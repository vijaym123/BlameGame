28th District
Dear Friend,
Earlier this year, I invited high
school artists from across California's
28 th
Congressional District to participate in the 2014 Congressional Art Competition.
Since the national program began in 1982, thousands of high school
students around the country have submitted their artwork. This year, I
will again be inviting students, their families and constituents to
weigh in and pick the "People's Choice" winner. This winner will have his
or her artwork displayed in my Hollywood District Office.
VOTE HERE FOR YOUR FAVORITE PIECE OF
ART
In addition to the "People's Choice" winner, my
esteemed panel of judges will bestow several other awards at the
28 th
Congressional High School Art Competition Forum &amp;
Exhibit on Sunday, April 27, 2014 at 3:00 p.m. This exhibit will
be held at the Descanso Gardens in La Caada Flintridge at Van de Kamp
Hall. The first place winner's artwork will hang in the U.S. Capitol
for one year, the piece awarded second place will hang in my
Washington, D.C. Office for one year, and the piece awarded third place will
hang in my Burbank District Office for one year.
Voting
will be open from Monday, April 14 th
through Wednesday,
April 23 rd , so please remember to vote. Also, pass this
along to friends and family.
Thanks
for voting.
Sincerely,
Congressman Adam
Schiff
