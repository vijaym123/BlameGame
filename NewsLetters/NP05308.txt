Dear Friends,
My office has fielded many calls this week from
constituents deeply concerned about the failure to contain the single
Ebola case that reached Dallas when Thomas Duncan traveled by air from
West Africa. The infection of two nurses who helped treat Duncan
before his death is tragic. But their cases also raise the alarm about our
readiness to prevent a large outbreak in the United
States.
Last week, I joined 16 colleagues in writing the leaders of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Aviation
Administration. We asked Dr. Tom Frieden of the CDC and Michael Huerta of
the FAA to implement stronger travel safeguards, while still allowing
rescue and aid workers to undertake their courageous
efforts.
I believe a bold step is necessary: a temporary ban on commercial
travel from affected West African countries. Halting travel will help
contain the disease, dispel fear among Americans and give the
government and health care providers time to take additional steps to prevent
any further spread of the virus.
I also hope this step
will help dispel unfounded fears. Its important to remember that this
horrible disease can only be spread by direct contact with the bodily
fluids of a person who is sick or has died from Ebola. It is not
transmitted by air. The two nurses are the only persons to contract the
disease in the U.S.
In congressional testimony Thursday, Dr.
Frieden said none of the other people who came in contact with Mr.
Duncan has developed symptoms. He added that barring a mutation in the
virus, there will not be a large outbreak in the U.S.
The
Dallas cases, however, make it all too clear that protocols for
surveillance, containment and response were insufficient. Hospital workers
werent adequately trained, lacked equipment and did not know how to
properly put on and remove essential safety gear. Our caregivers need time
to learn these live-saving procedures.
More than 4,000
have died in West Africa. The number of those infected is doubling
every three weeks. Travel screening failed in Mr. Duncans case. With more
than 1,000 people flying from the affected countries each week, I
believe a temporary ban is necessary to relieve the pressure on our
public health institutions and make us all safer.
I will
continue to be vigilant in monitoring the federal response. I will also
listen to proposals to give the government any additional tools it needs
to contain this disease and possible further
outbreaks.
Finally, my prayers go out to those stricken by Ebola and their
families. My prayers also are with the brave American troops who are helping
build hospitals in West Africa.
As always, please contact
me with any questions or concerns.
Thank you ,
Washington, D.C.
