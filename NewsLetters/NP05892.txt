Dear
Friend,
In recent
weeks, Ive been recognized by three groups for my voting record protecting
the free market and the principles of limited government and personal
responsibility.
The National Federation of Independent
Business named me a Guardian of Small Business for my 100 percent
record on 10 issues in 2013 and 2014. Among those was my support of
delaying the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act by one year;
approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline without a presidential permit; and
legal sanctions aimed at reducing frivolous lawsuits.
NFIB
conveys the award to members of Congress who vote favorably on
small-business issues at least 70 percent of the time. For the 113 th
Congress, 232 of the 435 House members qualified.
The
second honor was the Taxpayers Friend Award from the National Taxpayers
Union for my votes in support of fiscal responsibility in
2013.
NTU based its assessment on 253 votes on appropriations bills,
authorization bills, budget target resolutions, tax bills, amendments
and procedural votes that could affect the burden on taxpayers. Awards
were presented to those scoring above 83 percent in the House; my score
was 87 percent. Just 45 members of the House received the award,
where the average score was 51 percent.
Finally, my votes on
employment and workforce issues earned the Champion of the Worker
award from the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Founded in 1984, the
non-profit group advocates limited government, free enterprise, privacy
and individual liberty.
I was among 29 House members, all
Republicans, to receive a 100 percent score from CEI on 15 key votes in
2013 and 2014. A perfect score is required for the
award.
CEI scores votes based on increasing employment, creating incentives for
workers, growth in workers incomes and improving worker
freedom.
Among the key votes were measures supporting time-and-a-half
compensatory time as payment in lieu of overtime pay and a prohibition
of action by the National Labor Relations Board pending a U.S. Supreme
Court decision on the constitutionality of recess appointments made
by President Obama.
The NLRB vote on H.R. 1120 was in
April 2013 and passed the House, 219-209; but the bill stalled in the
Senate. In June 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously held that three of the
presidents appointments to the NLRB were
unconstitutional.
Limiting the role of government in the workplace is good for
employees, their families and the overall economy. Small business, individual
initiative and fiscal restraint are vital to our countrys long-term
health.
Its gratifying to be among a growing number of
free-market voices in Congress and I thank you for your support in
helping me carry that message to Washington.
As always, please
contact me with any questions or comments.
Thank
you ,
