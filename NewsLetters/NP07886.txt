Friend,
I wanted to reach out to update you on our recent endeavor,
the Bera for Congress mobile app.
My team has been working hard on it in the past few weeks, and we&#39;re excited to share it with everyone. We&#39;re using a unique new platform, CrowdTilt, in order to fund the project, and we&#39;re still a few donations away from hitting our goal -
can you click here and give $5 or $10 now? If 35 people give $10 each, we&#39;ll hit our goal in no time.
We&#39;re excited about the potential of this app, and we believe we&#39;ll be able to run a much more efficient campaign if our staff and volunteers are able to use it.
But to get it up and running, we need your help - please donate $5 or whatever you can so that we meet our goal before next week.
Thanks for all you do.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - Did you see the video two of our volunteers recorded? They&#39;re the best - and they&#39;re getting great use out of the app. Click here to see them in action, then donate $5 to help us reach our goal.
