Do you think that climate change will occur or have serious impacts in
your lifetime?
Climate change is already happening
It will happen in a few years
It will happen in my lifetime
Not in my lifetime, but will affect future generations
Climate change will not happen
No opinion

Despite rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers, retreating arctic ice,
ocean acidification, changing wildlife patterns, and extreme weather
events worldwide, polls continue to show that a good portion of the
public believe there is significant scientific disagreement as to
whether human actions are contributing to climate change.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Today, there is not a single scientific body of national or
international standing that rejects the findings of human-caused
climate change. Not one.
To further make the point, let me share the latest work from researcher
Dr. James Powell, a geochemist and 12-year member of the National
Science Board appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W.
Bush. Dr. Powell just completed the most recent update to his survey of
the peer-reviewed literature on climate change.
As you can see, Dr. Powell found that out of the 10,885 peer-reviewed
scientific papers published on climate change in all of 2013 only two
papers reject human-caused climate change.
Two out of nearly 11,000. This is not disagreement. This is not a
divided scientific community.
The case is closed. We need to put this illusion of major scientific
disagreement behind us and take action.
Every minute we waste on this "myth of disagreement," is one minute
longer we delay taking concrete action, making any solution more
difficult and more expensive.
Outstanding Students in Long Beach
The Long Beach Gazette Newspapers recently released an update on some
of the city's talented students. A Woodrow Wilson Classical High School
student who received President Barack Obama's Volunteer Service Award,
a Master's student at California State University, Long Beach who
became recognized as a California Sea Grant Fellow, and many more.

students are doing: http://bit.ly/1ekWO6G
Expanding our Public Lands
President Barack Obama will soon expand the California Coastal National
Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands in Mendocino
County, adding about 1,665 acres of Pacific shoreline to the Monument.
A report by the federal Bureau of Land Management estimated that
outdoor recreation on public lands in California contributed nearly
$900 million to the economy in 2012. I thank the President for his
leadership and for working to preserve our public lands for future
generations.

answer your questions.

A Missed Opportunity for Physicians and Seniors
The House of Representatives on Friday passed a bill by a vote of 238
to 181 that would repeal the flawed Medicare physician payment formula,
known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR). Unfortunately, the
legislation also included a 51st attempt to repeal or dismantle the
Affordable Care Act (ACA). Specifically, a provision was added at the
last minute that would delay the individual mandate of the ACA in order
to pay for the new payment formula. This is why I voted no. I believe
Congress missed an opportunity to pass bipartisan and bicameral
legislation to fix the flawed Medicare physician payment system. We
should be focusing on ways to work together, not draw us apart.
The President's Budget
I wrote to you last week about the President's budget, which eliminates
special tax breaks to America's wealthiest individuals in order to pay
for important programs that will move our country forward. The Office
of Management and Budget (OMB), the office responsible for drafting the
budget proposal, released a great video that easily explains the
President's budget.
I encourage you to learn more about the President's 2015 Budget by
watching the video here: http://youtu.be/F82oKU6Url4
Point of Order
A term used in committee and on the floor to object to an alleged rule
infraction and to demand that the chair enforce the rule. The point of
order immediately halts the proceedings until the chair decides whether
the contention is valid. If the chair sustains a point of order against
a measure, amendment, or motion, it may not be considered; against a
provision in a measure, it is immediately deleted; against a conference
report, it is automatically rejected; and if against remarks by another
member, that member must yield or proceed in order.
If the floor manager of a bill concedes a point of order, the chair
immediately sustains the point of order. Otherwise, the chair usually
permits members to present arguments for and against it before
announcing a ruling, but is not required to do so and can cut off
discussion whenever he or she chooses.
With some exceptions, a member may appeal the chair's ruling. Appeals
are rarely demanded in the House and even more rarely succeed. They are
demanded more often in the Senate and are occasionally successful. The
Senate's presiding officer has the option of submitting a point of
order to the decision of the Senate, but must do so when a
constitutional question or certain Senate rules is involved.
Do you agree with the President's decision in his proposed budget to
close tax loopholes enjoyed by only the wealthy and well-connected?
48.6%
Yes - It is unfair for the wealthy and well-connected to enjoy
special tax breaks, especially as millions of middle class Americans
are still struggling to get by
31.4%
Maybe - Closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and
well-connected is a start, but he should instead create a simpler and
fairer tax code for all Americans, regardless of their economic status.
20.0%
No - His budget plan is irresponsible
0.0%

This

I

no.
I

which
eliminates

tax
breaks
to
America&#8217;s

The
Office
of

(OMB),
the
office
responsible
for
drafting
the
budget
proposal,
released
a
great
video
that
easily
explains
the
President&#8217;s
budget.
I
encourage
you
to

the
President&#8217;s

Point
of
Order
A
term
used
in
committee
and
on
the
floor
to
object
to
an
alleged
rule
infraction
and
to
demand
that
the
chair
enforce
the
rule.
The
point
of
order
immediately
halts
the
proceedings
until
the
chair
decides
whether
the
contention
is
valid.
If
the
chair
sustains
a
point
of
order
against
a
measure,
amendment,
or
motion,
it
may
not
be
considered;
against
a
provision
in
a
measure,
it
is
immediately
deleted;
against
a
conference
report,
it
is
automatically
rejected;
and
if
against
remarks
by
another
member,
that
member
must
yield
or
proceed
in
order.
If
the
floor
manager
of
a
bill
concedes
a
point
of
order,
the
chair
immediately
sustains
the
point
of
order.
Otherwise,
the
chair
usually
permits
members
to
present
arguments
for
and
against
it
before
announcing
a
ruling,
but
is
not
required
to
do
so
and
can
cut
off
discussion
whenever
he
or
she
chooses.
With
some
exceptions,
a
member
may
appeal
the
chair's
ruling.
Appeals
are
rarely
demanded
in
the
House
and
even
more
rarely
succeed.
They
are
demanded
more
often
in
the
Senate
and
are
occasionally
successful.
The
Senate's
presiding
officer
has
the
option
of
submitting
a
point
of
order
to
the
decision
of
the
Senate,
but
must
do
so
when
a
constitutional
question
or
certain
Senate
rules
is
involved.
Do
you
agree
with
the
President's
decision
in
his
proposed
budget
to
close
tax
loopholes
enjoyed
by
only
the
wealthy
and
well-connected?
48.6%
Yes
-
It
is
unfair
for
the
wealthy
and
well-connected
to
enjoy
special
tax
breaks,
especially
as
millions
of
middle
class
Americans
are
still
struggling
to
get
by
31.4%
Maybe
-
Closing
tax
loopholes
for
the
wealthy
and
well-connected
is
a

but
he
should
instead
create
a
simpler
and

all
