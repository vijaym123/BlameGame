We know that ground-level smog is harmful to human health and can lead to cardiovascular disease, respiratory ailments like asthma and emphysema, and premature death.
EPA's new proposed standard would save lives and protect children and families from dangerous air pollution.
If you can't breathe you can't work, so clean air is essential for a strong economy.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
