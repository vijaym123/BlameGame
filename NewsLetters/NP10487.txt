Update on the Southern Colorado
National VA Cemetery
4/23/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn
has released the following map and status update on the Southern
Colorado National VA Cemetery, following the recent purchase of land on the
Rolling Hills Ranch site to the south and east of the Colorado
Springs Airport.
Status
Update
The VA Office of
Construction and Facility Management is currently soliciting
contractors to compete for the architectural and engineering contract.
This process is expected to be completed by late summer of
2014.
This Master Planning period is expected to last for 15 to 18
months prior to the beginning of construction, which is slated to
begin in Fiscal Year 2016.
Congressman Lamborn remains dedicated
to continuing his bipartisan leadership to ensure that this project is
fully funded to completion. Congressman Lamborn is grateful for the
work that has been done by Retired Army Colonel Vic Fernandez and his
team on the Pikes Peak National Veterans Cemetery Committee. They have
worked for many years to help make this dream a reality for Southern
Colorado
veterans.

May 24,
2007 House passes H.R. 1660 and sends to the

authorizes a national veterans cemetery in southern
Colorado.

Administration requests funding for a Southern Colorado VA National
Cemetery
October 13, 2010
H.R. 3219 becomes law (P.L. 111-275), authorizing a national veterans

Future Timeline
Expectations
Master
Planning expected to take place from July 2014 to December
2015.
Construction slated to begin in early
2016.
Typically, the VA offers
first interments about 9-10 months after beginning new cemetery
construction. This timeframe reflects the VAs practice of using early
turnover sections in new cemeteries, in order to ensure that the VA may
provide a burial option for veterans and their families prior to the
total completion of the
cemetery.
The VA is planning to hold a
community meeting later in 2014 to share the proposed construction
timeline and initial renderings of the new national cemetery with the local
community.
