DEADLINE TO FUND OUR LAST-WEEK GET OUT THE VOTE PUSH HITS AT MIDNIGHT!
We&rsquo;ll triple match your gift! Pitch in now! &gt;&gt;
Friend -- You&rsquo;re being absolutely BOMBARDED with emails today.
But there&rsquo;s a very good reason: It&rsquo;s because what YOU do TODAY will decide who wins the Senate in nine days.
The
New York Times
reports, &ldquo;Democrats&rsquo; last chance to hold their Senate majority comes down to a vigorous get out the vote effort.&rdquo;
But how vigorous will it be? Here&rsquo;s the answer:
If we can raise another $54,932 by midnight tonight, we&rsquo;ll be able to deploy at full force in key battlegrounds and absolutely DESTROY the Republicans&rsquo; Senate hopes.
But if you don&rsquo;t help out and we fall short, we&rsquo;ll be looking at two or more years of Majority Leader McConnell. And that&rsquo;s just unacceptable.
Friend, we have until midnight. Please, PLEASE pitch in so we can mobilize EVERY SINGLE VOTER and WIN! We&rsquo;ll TRIPLE MATCH your gift until midnight ONLY!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
