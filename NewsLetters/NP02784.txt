Forbes Receives True Blue Award for Support of
Family, Faith, Freedom in America
Washington, D.C .
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Founder and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, was honored with the True Blue Award for his strong commitment to family values issues and his leadership in defending the constitutionally protected right to the free exercise of religion.
The True Blue award is given by FRC Action, the legislative arm of the non-profit Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family Action. This award is presented to Members of Congress who have consistently supported policies that are pro-family, pro-marriage, and protect the sanctity of human life.
Faith, family, and freedom are the pillars upon which this grand idea
this experiment in self-governance we call America
was built, said Congressman Forbes. Our dedication to these three ideals will define the direction of our future. Im grateful for organizations like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family Action, who do an outstanding job of fighting for our nations rich heritage of faith freedom. Americas tomorrow depends on our willingness to take a stance today.
