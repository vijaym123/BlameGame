Over the past few weeks,
weve seen firsthand the troubles plaguing the Obamacare rollout and
the consequences - including the thousands of Montanans who are losing
their current healthcare plan as a result of this
law.
I recently heard from a hard-working mom and dad in
northwestern Montana, who are parents to a son with autism and a
daughter with muscular dystrophy. They just received word that their monthly
premiums and deductibles have been increased, resulting in this
family having to bear an extra
$4,500
in health care costs next
year alone. Unfortunately, families like this, and millions more across
the country, are also seeing these increasesor having their plans
canceled altogether. More than 20,000 Montanans have received these
cancellation notices, which now requires many of them to purchase an
insurance plan they dont want from a website that doesnt work. The flood
of reports last week even prompted President Obama to
apologize
to the individuals losing their
insurance.
This is why I recently cosponsored
H.R. 3350, the Keep Your Health Plan Act , which will allow
your current health plan to continue and be unaffected by Obamacare. The
Keep Your Health Plan Act
would grandfather in any health
plan that was in effect as of January 1 this year and would no longer
mandate that Americans with plans they like to purchase insurance from
the Obamacare exchange website. In doing so, the bill will make it
possible for millions of Americans to keep their health plan if they like
it.
To best serve and represent you in
Congress, it is important to me to hear your thoughts on important
