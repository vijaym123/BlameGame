News from Representative John Delaney
April 22, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write to you today with an update on my work to reform our housing
finance system. Addressing housing policy remains one of the major
items on Washington's to-do list in the wake of the financial crisis.
The fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were bailed out, is still
not resolved. Right now, the government backs roughly 90% of the
mortgages in the country, which isn't sustainable long-term.
Working with my colleagues Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut and
Congressman John Carney of Delaware, I've put forward a proposal that
would preserve the 30-year mortgage and increase taxpayer protections
by reducing the role of the federal government.
This week I published an op-ed in the Financial Times explaining why
this is such an important issue
.
Currently, the House and Senate are both considering housing reform
proposals. However, these bills are very far apart. My housing plan
establishes a compromise; it gives the government a smaller role than
that advocated in the Senate, but a larger one than has been suggested
in the House. My plan maintains affordable fixed-rate 30-year
mortgages, which are essential to a strong middle class. At the same
time, it combines a gradual transition to private finance in the
housing market, ending the government's counterproductive role in
setting the price of mortgages.
My work to find common ground has been called "key" to getting a deal
done by Financial Times reporter Gina Chon.
Having worked as an entrepreneur for twenty years, I believe that on
economic policy, we have to find common ground. That's been my approach
on infrastructure, on deficit reduction, on job creation, and on
financial policy. I feel it's the only way we can move forward and
tackle the big issues impacting working families every day.
Please take a look at my op-ed
and let me know what you think. I
welcome your feedback
.
Sincerely,
John

Dear
Friend,
I
write
to
you
today
with
an
update
on
my
work
to
reform
our
housing
finance
system.
Addressing
housing
policy
remains
one
of
the
major
items
on
Washington&#8217;s
to-do
list
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis.
The
fate
of
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac,
which
were
bailed
out,
is
still
not
resolved.
Right
now,
the
government
backs
roughly
90%
of
the
mortgages
in
the
country,
which
isn&#8217;t
sustainable
long-term.
Working
with
my
colleagues
Congressman
Jim
Himes
of
Connecticut
and
Congressman
John
Carney
of
Delaware,
I&#8217;ve
put
forward
a
proposal
that
would
preserve
the
30-year
mortgage
and
increase
taxpayer
protections
by
reducing
the
role
of
the
federal
government.
This
week
I
published
an
op-ed

the
Financial

explaining
why
this
is
such
an
important
issue .
Currently,
the
House
and

My

but

My

maintains

fixed-rate
30-year

which
are
essential
to
a
strong
middle
class.
At
the

it

a
gradual
transition
to
private
finance
in
the
housing
market,
ending
the
government&#8217;s
counterproductive
role
in

on

I
feel
it&#8217;s
the
only
way
we
can
move
forward
and
tackle
the
big
issues
impacting
working
families
every
day.
Please
take

at
my
op-ed
and

me

what
you
