Dear Friend,
This week, two important pieces of legislation passed out of the Ways &amp; Means Committee and are now headed for a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives.
First, we passed a bill to extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which I spearheaded along with President Bill Clinton in 2000. AGOA's success in spurring growth in Africa through trade has been historic, as exports have tripled under the program. Not only does AGOA benefit people in Africa, it also creates jobs here at home.
Second, legislation giving President Obama the power to negotiate a free trade agreement as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership passed. I voted NO because my position has always remained constant:
Show us the jobs!
As a Korean War veteran, I am also proud to announce that my bill to create a pathway for family reunions between Korean Americans and North Koreans has passed the House Foreign Relations Committee. Nothing is more tragic than the separation of families and loved ones. We have to keep trying to reunite some of our Korean American friends who have not been able to meet their families for the past sixty years.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
