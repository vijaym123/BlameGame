Dear Friend,
As you know, California is facing an unprecedented drought affecting everyone &ndash; from farmers to businesses to you and your family.
In Congress, I&rsquo;m working on long-term, comprehensive solutions for securing water access and storage. I have supported efforts to improve California's water system and increase the deliverable water supply in Orange County, including my 2009 bill that helped fund the Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System. When complete in 2015, the project will produce an additional 30 million gallons a day, making it possible for our community to produce its own water - rather than depend on imported water from Northern California and the Colorado River.
Throughout this emergency, I will continue to partner with local, state and federal officials so our resources and relief are coordinated for the benefit of every Californian.
Learn more about California&rsquo;s drought &amp; what you and your family can do to save water here .
And, as always, please feel free to email me or contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Even if we cannot directly assist you, we may be able to connect you to someone who can.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
