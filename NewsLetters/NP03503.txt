Joining the
Conservative Call to Stand Firm Against Illegal Immigration
Actions
1/9/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined
dozens of his conservative colleagues in a letter to Speaker Boehner
calling on, "the House to stand firm in its efforts to oppose the
President's executive action and place comprehensive restrictions on the
funding for its implementation as soon as possible in the 114th Congress"
and to "bring the FY2015 Department of Homeland Security appropriations
bill to the floor, with language removing all available funding
streams to implement the President's executive
action."
"I will never support amnesty for illegal
immigrants. I will continue to push Speaker Boehner to stand up against
these lawless actions of the President and to stand with the
conservative principles that support and defend the rule of law. The time is now
to strongly push back against the policies of the Obama
Administration."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
