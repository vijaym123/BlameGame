New York Times : &quot;Concerns Mount as Homeland Security Shutdown Looks Likely&quot;
David -- Republicans are playing a dangerous game with our nation&rsquo;s security. If the GOP doesn&rsquo;t step back from its threats, the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funds FRIDAY.
The entire department, which is responsible for preventing attacks on America, would go into shutdown mode.
More than 240,000 workers would have to stay home or be forced to work without pay. All because Republicans don&rsquo;t like President Obama&rsquo;s executive actions on immigration and are willing to hold this critical agency hostage to get their way.
Tell Republicans to stop playing games with our nation&rsquo;s safety. Let&rsquo;s get 100,000 signatures before Thursday!

We knew John Boehner and Ted Cruz were willing to go to great lengths to undermine President Obama&rsquo;s sensible immigration relief measures.
But it makes no sense to withhold Homeland Security funding
to try to force bad immigration policy! It&rsquo;s unconscionable that the GOP could put our national security at risk just to try to get their way.
Let&rsquo;s send Republicans a strong message. Homeland Security funding runs out on FRIDAY -- we need you before then. Sign on in the next 48 hours!
