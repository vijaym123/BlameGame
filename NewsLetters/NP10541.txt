Congressman
Lamborn Leads the Fight For More Religious Freedom in the Air
Force
This week,
Congressman Doug Lamborn authored a letter calling on Secretary of the Air Force
Deborah Lee James to update the Air Forces regulations regarding
religious freedom in the Air Force. Unfortunately, the August 2012 Air
Force regulations that govern religious freedom and expressions are the
most restrictive of any branch of the military and are inconsistent
with current law and the Constitution. This Air Force regulation
establishes limits on free speech and religion for those in leadership
positions. The right to free speech and religion is a self-protecting right.
It is not grounds for a bystander to silence a leader's speech simply
because the bystander objects to certain opinions.
These restrictive regulations are a driving
force behind many of the Air Forces recent violations of religious
freedom, such as the recent white board incident at the Air Force
Academy.
Congressman Lamborn, along
with twenty-two other Members of Congress, is asking the Secretary to,
"immediately revise AFI 1-1 and provide clear guidance on
implementation to ensure that the Air Force adequately protects the
religious freedom of all Airmen."
