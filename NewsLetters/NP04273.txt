The November elections changed the majority in the Senate and both
Republican leadership and President Obama have said they want to try to
work together to solve problems.
Here are four areas where we could get to work for the American people
in a bipartisan way, starting today:
1. Tax Reform - Studies show that 70 percent of the burden of our
uncompetitive business tax code falls on workers in the form of lower
wages and fewer benefits. High tax rates also lock up dollars overseas
that could be invested back in the U.S.
The President has said that he
is open to reform. Let's get it done and help increase middle-class
wages and economic growth.
2. Expanding Exports - Exports support over 25 percent of Ohio
manufacturing jobs and we want more of them, because export jobs pay
more and have higher benefits. The President has asked for authority to
expand exports even further. We should give it to him.
3. Reforming Regulatory Agencies - We need smarter regulations to help
create jobs.
For example, the United States ranks 34th in the world
for the time it takes to get a government green-light to actually build
something, slowing down business growth, sending investment dollars
overseas, and costing American workers jobs. I've introduced sensible
bipartisan legislation to fix that.
4. American Energy Independence - By passing the Keystone XL Pipeline
and my bipartisan energy efficiency legislation, we can move a step
closer to American energy independence, lower the cost of energy for
all Americans, and create more good paying jobs.
5. A Budget - Unbelievably, the current Senate leadership has passed
only one budget in the last five years. Congress should pass a budget
that gets to balance through spending restraint, stopping waste and
growing revenues through economic growth.
American families have to
live within a budget.
American businesses have to have a budget to
stay in business.
The American government should have one, too.
I am hopeful that we can work across the aisle to get these and many
other priorities done for the American people. That's one reason I was
so disappointed in the President's legally questionable unilateral
executive action on immigration. The American people sent a message in
the last election. They are tired of partisan politics, and they want
us to work together. That is exactly what the new Republican Congress
should do. I hope the President is ready to join us at the table and
get to work.

The
November
elections
changed
the
majority
in
the
Senate
and
both
Republican
leadership
and
President
Obama
have
said
they
want
to
try
to
work
together
to
solve
problems.
Here
are
four
areas
where
we
could
get
to
work
for
the
American
people
in
a
bipartisan
way,
starting
today:
1.
Tax
Reform
-
Studies
show
that
70
percent
of
the
burden
of
our
uncompetitive
business
tax
code
falls
on
workers
in
the
form
of
lower
wages
and
fewer
benefits.
High
tax
rates
also
lock
up
dollars
overseas
that
could
be
invested
back
in
the
U.S.
The
President
has
said
that
he
is
open
to
reform.
Let's
get
it
done
and
help
increase
middle-class
wages
and
economic
growth.
2.
Expanding
Exports
-
Exports
support
over
25
percent
of
Ohio
manufacturing
jobs
and
we
want
more
of
them,
because
export
jobs
pay
more
and
have
higher
benefits.
The
President
has
asked
for
authority
to
expand
exports
even
further.
We
should
give
it
to
him.
3.
Reforming
Regulatory
Agencies
-
We
need
smarter
regulations
to
help
create
jobs.
For
example,
the
United
States
ranks
34th
in
the
world
for
the
time
it
takes
to
get
a
government
green-light
to
actually
build
something,
slowing
down
business
growth,
sending
investment
dollars
overseas,
and
costing
American
workers
jobs.
I've
introduced
sensible
bipartisan
legislation
to
fix
that.
4.
American
Energy
Independence
-
By
passing
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
and
my
bipartisan
energy
efficiency
legislation,
we
can
move
a
step
closer
to
American
energy
independence,
lower
the
cost
of
energy
for
all
Americans,
and
create
more
good
paying
jobs.
5.
A
Budget
-
Unbelievably,
the
current
Senate
leadership
has
passed
only
one
budget
in
the
last
five
years.
Congress
should
pass
a
budget
that
gets
to
balance
through
spending
restraint,
stopping
waste
and
growing
revenues
through
economic
growth.
American
families
have
to
live
within
a
budget.
American
businesses
have
to
have
a
budget
to
stay
in
business.
The
American
government
should
have
one,
too.
I
am
hopeful
that
we
can
work
across
the
aisle
to
get
these
and
many
other
priorities
done
for
the
American
people.
That's
one
reason
I
was
so
disappointed
in
the
President's
legally
questionable
unilateral
executive
action
on
immigration.
The
American
people
sent
a
message
in
the
last
election.
They
are
tired
of
partisan
politics,
and
they
want
us
to
work
together.
That
is
exactly
what
the
new
Republican
Congress should
do.
I
hope
the
President
is
ready
to
join
us
at
the
table
and
get
to
work.
