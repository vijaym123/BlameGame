Dear
Friends,
On Dec. 7, 1941, a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor killed 2,403
Americans and destroyed or damaged 19 U.S. Navy ships. Half those killed
were on the battleship USS Arizona.
The next day, Congress
declared a war that Americans knew we could and must win. The attack on
Pearl Harbor that brought the U.S. into the fight lasted just 75
minutes but launched almost four years of unrelenting
sacrifice.
Next year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the most costly
war in history, which killed 15 million in battle, including 416,000
Americans. Another 45 million civilians died as a consequence of World
War II.
Though the Pacific Fleet was severely damaged, the
admiral who conceived the attack knew his forces had fallen short by
failing to hit three aircraft carriers out to sea on Dec. 7. Japanese
Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto understood the strength of the American democracy
would respond.
He didnt imagine, however, that the U.S.
would sink four Japanese carriers just six months later in the decisive
Battle of Midway, a testament to American resolve. The heroism of the
American sailor, soldier, airman and marine is well
known.
Unlike some of our enemies in the course of history, Americans dont
relish war. We fight when we must.
As Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower said shortly after the close of World War II, I hate war as only
a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its
brutality, its stupidity.
I consider the authority to declare war
the most solemn responsibility of a member of Congress. History is
replete with examples
from Greece to World War I to Iraq and Afghanistan
in which promises of quick and easy victory go unfulfilled and
result in grave unintended consequences.
Our strength is our
democracy and commitment to the rule of law. Only when our direct
national interests are at stake should we put our brave men and women in
service in mortal danger. Thats why I have resisted efforts to expand
the U.S. role against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
On
this sobering anniversary, I pray for our forces in the field, as
well as their families. And I honor those who have sacrificed to
preserve, protect and defend these United States. I hope youll join
me.
Thank
you ,
