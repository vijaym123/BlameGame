Christmas and New Years are a time to join family and friends for
festive celebrations. While my offices in Mays Landing and Washington
will be closed on Christmas Day (December 25th) and New Year's Day
(January 1st), they will otherwise be open to assist South Jersey
residents & answer your questions. And forward and share this
e-newsletter
with your South Jersey neighbors and
coworkers.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Yet another unintended consequence of Obamacare has come to light,
threatening the "volunteer" status of our local fire departments and
emergency response centers. Upon hearing serious concerns from South
Jersey fire departments that they would be mandated to provide
healthcare coverage to their volunteer firefighters or possibly close
their doors, I urged the IRS
to take corrective action. I
also joined with my colleagues on legislation
to ensure our volunteer fire departments and
municipalities are no longer a target under Obamacare.
LATEST NEWS
On the heels of allowing personal electronic devices such as iPads and
Kindles to be used from gate to gate, the Federal Communications
Commission has voted to move forward with a plan that would allow air
passengers the option to use their cell phones in-flight. While the
U.S. Department of Transportation is reviewing the safety of such
action, I've joined on bipartisan legislation to ban cell phone use
in-flight
. I believe the personal
comfort and opinions of the flying public must also be considered.
SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC
My wife Tina and I, along with Luca and our newest addition - Lulu -
wish you and your family a very happy & safe holiday season.
