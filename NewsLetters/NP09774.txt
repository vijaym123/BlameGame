Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Demands Answers on Veterans Deaths at Phoenix VA
Recently, Congressman Cook voted in the House Veterans Affairs
Committee to issue a subpoena for information about the delays, deaths,
and secret patient lists at the Phoenix Veteran Affairs Medical Center.
The decision to subpoena the required documents came after multiple
requests for information by the House Veterans Affairs Committee went
unanswered by Secretary of the Veterans Administration, Eric Shinseki.
This subpoena covers all documents, including emails and
correspondence, sent after April 9, involving Secretary Shinseki, four
other top VA officials, and several VA employees in the Office of
Congressional Legislative Affairs pertaining to the maintenance and
destruction of an alternate wait list for the Phoenix Veteran Affairs
Medical Center. These documents must be turned over to the House
Veterans Affairs Committee. Failure to comply with the subpoena could
lead to federal prosecution.
Cook said, "I'm outraged by the reports of secret waitlists that may
have led to the deaths of at least 23 veterans. I'm committed to
getting to the bottom of this and holding people accountable for this
despicable act."
Lois Lerner held in Contempt of Congress
Last week, Congressman Cook voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of
Congress for refusing to cooperate with the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee's investigation into her role in the
targeting of conservative groups. This became necessary after Mrs.
Lerner, the Director of Exempt Organizations for the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS), failed to submit subpoenaed documents.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began their
investigation after the Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration released an audit report that revealed that the IRS had
illegally targeted conservative non-profits for investigation.
Cook said, "I've heard from many people across the Eighth District who
want to know why the IRS targeted conservative groups. Ms. Lerner's
testimony is necessary for getting to the bottom of this investigation.
As the director of the IRS office responsible for the targeting, Ms.
Lerner has unique, firsthand knowledge of how and why the IRS engaged
in the targeting. The IRS should enforce tax law, not target the
President's political enemies. This scandal raises serious concerns
about the Administration's respect for basic constitutional rights.
Anyone involved in illegal targeting needs to be held accountable both
administratively and legally. Ms. Lerner's obstruction of Congress'
efforts to uncover the truth and today's vote is about holding her
accountable."
Supporting American Research Creates Jobs
Congressman Cook voted Friday in favor of H.R. 4438, the American
Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014. This bill incentivizes U.S.
companies driving innovation in the fields of medicine,
pharmaceuticals, and energy by refining and extending the research and
development credit.
The American Research and Competitiveness Act amends the Internal
Revenue Code to change the calculation method and rate for qualifying
tax credits in research. This will reduce the tax burden on vital
research and development programs, allowing additional investment for
research. This will boost the economy and help create new good-paying
jobs.
Cook said, "America is the world's largest economy because we're the
world's leader in innovation and new technology. One of the best ways
to create new jobs is to stop taxing the types of research that produce
job growth. This bill does exactly that, which is why I'm happy to
support this important jobs legislation."
School Choice Through Charter Schools
Last week, Congressman Cook voted in favor of H.R. 10, the Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act. This bipartisan
legislation streamlines the process of charter school approval, making
it easier for charter developers to gain access to capital, while
providing support in the acquisition and maintenance of space.
The new charter school program will consist of three parts. First,
state entities will be awarded grants supporting the expansion and
replication of high quality charter schools and new innovative charter
school models. Second, facilities aid will be awarded to help charter
schools access private grants. Finally, this bill will allow the
Secretary of Education to operate a grant competition for charter
schools who did not receive state grants.
Cook said, "As a former educator myself, I understand that charter
schools can provide the choice that parents need for quality education.
This legislation will expand high quality charter schools and promote
innovative curriculums. I support this state-centered approach because
a one size fits all approach to education is never good for kids."

I-15 Bridge Cleanup Update

Bravery in Joshua Tree National Park
Jeremie Johnston and Danielle Sandoval, as well as 17 Park Rangers,
were awarded medals for bravery by the National Parks Service last
week. This was a result of their response to a plane crash in Joshua
Tree. Despite peril, Johnston and Sandoval sprung in to action, after
seeing smoke from over a hill. Upon reaching the crash site, they were
able to put out the fire and rescue the pilot who had ejected, but was
badly injured.
"They put their own lives in peril to help others," said National Park
Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis of the recipients. "Yet, each one
of them would humbly say they were simply doing their jobs. Their
passion to serve others is inspiring."

Recently,
Congressman
Cook

in
the

to
issue
a
subpoena
for
information
about
the delays,

multiple

by
Secretary
of
the

Eric

This
subpoena
covers
all

including
emails
and

sent
after
April
9,
involving
Secretary
Shinseki,
four
other
top

pertaining

Failure
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
could
lead
to
federal

Cook
said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m
outraged
by
the
reports
of
secret
waitlists
that
may
have
led
to
the
deaths
of
at
least
23
veterans.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
getting

of
this

holding
people
accountable
for
this
despicable
act.&#8221;
Lois
Lerner
held
in
Contempt
of
Congress
Last
week,
Congressman
Cook
voted
to
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
refusing
to
cooperate
with
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee&#8217;s
investigation
into
her
role
in
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups.
This
became
necessary
after
Mrs.
Lerner,
the
Director
of
Exempt
Organizations
for
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
failed
to
submit
subpoenaed
documents.
The
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
began
their
investigation
after
the
Treasury
Inspector
General
for
Tax
Administration
released
an
audit
report
that
revealed
that
the
IRS
had
illegally
targeted
conservative
non-profits
for
investigation.
Cook
said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
people
across
the
Eighth
District
who
want
to
know
why
the
IRS
targeted
conservative
groups.
Ms.
Lerner&#8217;s
testimony
is
necessary
for
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
investigation. As
the
director
of
the
IRS
office
responsible
for
the
targeting,
Ms.
Lerner
has
unique,
firsthand
knowledge
of
how
and
why
the
IRS
engaged
in
the
targeting.
The
IRS
should
enforce
tax
law,
not
target
the
President&#8217;s
political
enemies.
This
scandal
raises
serious
concerns
about
the
Administration&#8217;s
respect
for
basic
constitutional
rights.
Anyone
involved
in
illegal
targeting
needs
to
be
held
accountable
both
administratively
and
legally.
Ms.
Lerner&#8217;s
obstruction
of
Congress&#8217;
efforts
to
uncover
the
truth
and
today&#8217;s
vote
is
about
holding
her
accountable.&#8221;

because
we&#8217;re
the
world&#8217;s
leader
in

allow
the
Secretary
of
Education
to
operate
a
grant
competition
for
charter
schools
who
did
not
receive
state

Cook
said,
&#8220;As
a
former
educator
myself,
I
understand
that
charter
schools
can
provide
the
choice
that
parents
need
for
quality
education.
This
legislation
will
expand
high
quality

and
promote

I
support
this
