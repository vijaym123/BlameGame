Dear Friend,
Yesterday, President Obama ostensibly forced Secretary Shinseki to
resign over the scandals and systemic failures at the Veterans
Administration. I appreciate the President and Secretary Shinseki
heeding my call, and those of my colleagues, to resign.
But I say accountability ends at the President's feet. As the sign on
President Harry Truman's desk in the Oval Office stated, "The buck
stops here." The resignation of Secretary Shinseki sends the right
message that there has to be accountability, but more is needed. The
problems must be addressed and the President needs to step up and set a
better example of leadership. I have led several legislative efforts to
provide accountability and make much-needed reforms to the VA. To read
more about them, click HERE

Regarding General Shinseki, I would hope that he be denied any benefits
or pensions stemming from his tenure as Secretary, and only be afforded
those from his military service. The same goes for those employees
found to be complicit in these scandals. Further, after the VA
Inspector General and the House Veterans Affairs Committee reports are
complete, I believe we will likely need to initiate civil and criminal
proceedings against those in the VA who are deemed responsible for this
negligence and malfeasance. Click HERE

Gosar Amendments Pass House of Representatives:
This week, Congress continued its most important function which is to
establish a budget and properly appropriate taxpayer money. The
appropriations process is a primary component of Congress returning to
regular order. It is through this process that Congress must evaluate
each government program for its efficacy. It is our duty as
representatives to cut those programs which are wasteful and
inefficient, bolster those that are necessary and serve the public, and
given the $18 trillion federal debt, to cut spending overall. Since
Republicans took back the House in 2011, we have restored regular order
in our chamber, reduced spending, and evaluated programs properly.
Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Senate continues to balk and only
wishes to maintain the status quo and increase spending.
On Thursday, the House considered the Commerce, Justice, Science, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The bill
appropriates resources for law enforcement activities, trade and patent
offices, and scientific programs like NASA. I introduced and passed
three amendments to this bill to execute the mission of prioritization
of resources.
My first amendment cut $4.25 million from the Office of Justice
Programs Research, Evaluation, and Statistics budget, which was the
total increase that program was set to receive over last year's funding
levels. Those monies were re-directed to the Byrne-Justice Assistance
Grant (Byrne-JAG) program to bolster law enforcement nationwide. Law
enforcement officers in Arizona always tell me how important the JAG
program is, so I wanted to make sure a good program that protects
citizens receives the resources necessary to lower crime-as opposed to
a questionable program getting an unneeded increase. Click HERE
to see the text of the amendment, and click HERE
to read my remarks before the House.
My second amendment cut $6 million from the mismanaged Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE)-the agency that
perpetrated Operation Fast and Furious-and reprogrammed that money to
go to the Veterans Treatment Courts program. This program has proven
results in helping Veterans get back on track after minor legal
troubles. Click HERE
to see the text of the amendment, and click HERE
to read my remarks before the House.
My third amendment cut $8 million from Department of Justice
bureaucrats and transferred that money to bolster the Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program. Prescription drug abuse is increasing and leading
to higher rates of heroin use and other drugs. This is one area that
needs more attention for the sake of our families and communities.

Continued Opposition to Wasteful Earmarks and Pork Barrel Spending:
On Thursday, I joined Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) and 33 other bipartisan
members of the House and Senate in asking Congressional Leadership to
continue the moratorium on earmarks in spending bills. Washington has
racked up trillions of dollars in debt, much of which stems from
wasteful programs, special interests, and pork barrel projects. Ending
these practices and this wasteful spending are the primary reasons I
came to Washington. Thankfully, House Leadership has indicated that it
intends to keep the moratorium in place for the foreseeable future. I
urge my colleagues in the Senate to follow their lead. To view the text

Waste Fact of the Week:

Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
Watson Lake at Granite Dells, North of Prescott, is 100 years old this
year. Construction on the Granite Creek Dam began in 1914 and was
delivering water via 40 miles of earthen canals by 1916. The
construction of the dam and canals was carried out by the Arizona Land
and Irrigation Co., whose principal investor, Senator James Watson of
Indiana, is also the lakes namesake.
Although the lake is 100 years old, the Dells themselves are much, much
older. The Dells' granite has been dated at 1.4 billion years old. The
beautiful and unusual rock formations that characterize the Granite
Dells was formed by chemical weathering at different rates along the
joints of stone formations.

Dear
Friend,
Yesterday,
President
Obama
ostensibly
forced
Secretary
Shinseki
to
resign
over
the
scandals
and
systemic
failures
at
the
Veterans
Administration.
I
appreciate
the
President
and
Secretary
Shinseki
heeding
my
call,
and
those
of
my
colleagues,
to
resign.
But
I
say
accountability
ends
at
the
President&#8217;s
feet.
As
the
sign
on
President
Harry
Truman&#8217;s
desk
in
the
Oval
Office
stated,
"The
buck
stops
here."
The
resignation
of
Secretary
Shinseki
sends
the
right
message
that
there
has
to
be
accountability,
but
more
is
needed.
The
problems
must
be
addressed
and
the
President
needs
to
step
up
and
set
a
better
example
of
leadership.
I
have
led
several

provide
accountability
and

much-needed

to
the
VA.

Regarding
General
Shinseki,
I
would
hope
that
he
be
denied
any
benefits
or
pensions
stemming
from
his
tenure
as
Secretary,
and
only
be
afforded
those
from
his
military
service.
The
same
goes
for
those
employees
found
to
be
complicit
in
these
scandals.
Further,
after
the
VA
Inspector
General
and
the
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
reports
are
complete,
I
believe
we
will
likely
need
to
initiate
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
against
those
in
the
VA
who
are
deemed
responsible
for
this
negligence
and
malfeasance.

This

The

It
is
through
this

It

our

we
have
restored
regular

reduced

Unfortunately,
the

Ending

Thankfully,
