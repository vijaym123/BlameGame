A Special Holiday Message
Dear Friends,
On behalf of myself, my family, and my staff, Merry Christmas and best
wishes to your family in the coming New Year!
Please keep our service members and their families in your thoughts and
prayers as you gather with loved ones in the coming weeks. They're
serving our nation far away from their families and in harm's way. They
put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms and for this we're
especially grateful.
