Friends,
In last weeks e-newsletter, our governments budget process was
discussed in depth.
The President has submitted his budget request and
as pictured in the graph last week, we are in the beginning stages of
the budget process.
On Tuesday, my House Budget Committee
colleagues and I will unveil our budget proposal.
After we make our
budget plan public, the committee will review, amend, and vote on the
plan the following day.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
will then begin studying our budget request and release a nonpartisan
analysis of the plan for taxpayers, agencies, and businesses to review.
The CBO has been studying
the Presidents budget plan since he made it public last month and
released its analysis of his plan last week.
Their report revealed
the President's budget never, ever balances AND includes a $1.8
trillion tax increase.
Instead of cutting spending, the President's
plan increases itto the tune of $547 billion.
Instead of paying
down the deficit, his budget adds to itto the tune of $6
trillion.
Since our countrys deficit is $18
trillion, Americans expect the President to address our financial woes
by saving more and spending less.
While I cannot go into detail
yet, I am glad to let you know that the budget my colleagues and I will
unveil this week outlines a different financial future for the
countryone that puts us back on a path to
prosperity.
PAID for
Progress
Since the Great Recession began in 2007, real median
household income has dropped 8.7 percent. This decrease in pay has made it
difficult for American families to get back on their feet.
Meanwhile, during the same time
period, the average federal bureaucrat salary has ballooned 18 percent
(still waiting for exact numbers from HBC).
The federal
employees receiving pay raises are the people making decisions, as well as
implementing regulations impacting our impish economic recovery.
Since their salaries are not tied to economic success or supported by
consumer spending, bureaucrats do not have any skin in the game.
Simply, they do not feel the consequences of the federal governments
grip on the economy.
If federal government employees jobs and pay were directly tied
to the economy, like most Americans, they would likely approach
decision making
differently.
At the beginning of this month, I sent out a poll question to get your
feedback on a legislative idea that would hold bureaucrats
accountable for their decisions.
The poll asked, Do you think federal
government employees making more than $100,000 a year should have their
salaries reduced until the middle-class salary levels rise to
pre-recession levels?
Here are the
results:
Of the respondents, 72.42 percent think that federal
employees making six-figures should have their salaries reduced until
American middle-class incomes return to pre-recession levels.
After studying this issue in depth, I introduced legislation last week
that would link six-figure bureaucrat salaries to real median household
incomes.
The
Promoting Accountability In Decisions (PAID) for Progress Act (H.R. 1137),
reduces all federal government employee salaries, except active duty
military officials, over $100,000 by 8.7 percent, which is the current
decrease in real median household income.
As the economy recovers
and real median household salaries increase, so will federal
employees salaries.
This legislation also applies to all Cabinet
members, Members of Congress, the President, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
employees.
We must
continue to incentivize economic recovery.
I assure you that I
will continue turning over every rock and looking behind every tree for
ways to hold the federal government accountable and get our economy
thriving again.
Bullet
Ban Shelved
After 80,000 public comments and
push back from more than 280 Members of Congress, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has shelved its proposal to ban
ammunition for AR-15 guns.
Our offices received numerous calls,
emails, and letters about the proposed ammunition ban because this
specific bullet is cheap and popular with gun owners.
I signed on a
letter, along with 52 Senators and 237 Representatives urging the
agency to reconsider this ban.
Now that the Bureau has backed down,
Democratic members of Congress are urging the agency to revive the
ban.
I will pay close attention to the agencys actions and should
the ban surface again, work with my colleagues to halt
it.
