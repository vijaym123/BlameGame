Spending Less, Spending Wisely
This week the House began its important work funding the government for next year. The passage of the Veterans and Legislative Branch spending bills got this process off to a productive start. I was proud to support our Veterans by prioritizing treatment and upgrades to their care while making sure Congress stayed disciplined, with no raises for Representatives and keeping funding restrained.
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked to ensure these spending bills respect the conservative principles I am here to reflect.
When I raised cane over Nancy Pelosi's boondoggle on Capitol Hill, the Capitol Visitor Center, I was forced out of my chairmanship.
After Republicans took the House back in 2010, I was tasked with cutting the bloated budgets of President Obama's first two years. When I finished, we had reduced the spending by a $5 billion - a real cut.
I also took an early lead in banning earmarks. This "gateway spending" was an invitation to bigger government and bloated budgets, so I worked to stop them and keep lawmakers from indulging in this pork-barrel spending.
The work of funding the government is important an area where I have applied my conservative year after year, and 2014 will be no different.
Have a great weekend,
Jack
