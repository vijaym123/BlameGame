Farmers can get Typhoon Dolphin help from USDA - Farmers and ranchers, who suffered losses in Typhoon Dolphin, may be eligible for help from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Four programs authorized in the Agricultural Act of 2014 while I was a Member of the Agricultural Committee, may be of assistance. Hyperlinks, below, will take you to complete information about each:
*
Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance . Helps to offset production losses for producers who were signed up in advance for the program.
*
Tree Assistance Program . Available for growers of papaya, banana, and other tropical fruit to clean up orchards and replant.
*
Livestock Indemnity Program . Offsets up to 75 percent of the loss of cattle, pigs, goats, and poultry.
*
Farm Loan Program . Offers a range of low-interest loans to help agricultural producers. Producers with existing loans should also contact their Farm Services Agency loan officer if they expect they will have trouble making their regular loan payments because of the storm.
The Farm Services Agency has already made site visits to individual farms on Rota and will be on Saipan next week. For more information about how to obtain assistance from any of these programs, contact Mr. Thomas Camacho at the Farm Service Agency at 670-234-0896 or email him at Thomas.camacho@pb.usda.gov .

Rota's CUC crew was quick to repair the damage and restore power after Typhoon Dolphin struck last weekend. CUC was not alone: local government employees, volunteers from the Northern Marianas Chapter of the American Red Cross, and field officers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency all pulled together, working long hours to help Rota return to normal. I flew to Rota, which was hardest hit by the storm, to make sure that federal resources were reaching the people who needed assistance. There is still more to do throughout our islands, but thanks to everyone for helping with the recovery effort.

This year's Close Up students posed on the steps of the U.S. House of Representatives after touring the Capitol building on Wednesday. The cast iron dome of the Capitol, seen in the rear, is currently surrounded with scaffolding and under repair.
Close Up students see their congressional office - Twenty-two students from Northern Mariana Islands high schools got an inside look at their congressional office in Washington, DC this week as part of the Close Up Foundation's civic education program. The students met with the office staff, who described their jobs and how Congress works. After a lunch, the group went on a staff-led tour of the U.S. Capitol and watched the debate in the House of Representatives from the public gallery. This year's Close Up participants were: Rayanna Aldan, Steffie Alipio, Cindy Florene Alo, Quinn Ely Ebuen Amog, Shannon Delor Barcinas, Josepha Cabrera, Jessa Mae Camacho, Wilhelmina Cing, Merly-Ann Fernandez, Glengela Flor Guiang, Daniel Han, Hannah Hofschneider, You Na Lee, Jonathan Clyde Libut, David Phan, Sable Sablan, Odorico San Nicolas, Orlando I. Santos, Peter Anthony Santos, Roselyn Tanghal, Alexandria Vergara, and Nikki Yutuc. Grace Christian Academy, Kagman High School, Marianas High School, Mt. Carmel High School, Rota High School, Saipan Southern High School, and Tinian High School were all represented. Chaperones Armi Atalig, Josepha Kaipat, Vincente King, and Micah Page accompanied the group. In addition to Washington, the students also visited Philadelphia, Williamsburg, and New York City. Congress appropriates funds to the Interior Department each year to make the Northern Marianas Close Up program possible.

The Commonwealth Zoning Board received federal funds for the purchase of a much-needed new vehicle this month. Congress appropriates the monies to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to promote economic development in rural areas of our nation while conserving natural and historic resources. Zoning Administrator Therese Ogumoro, Board Chairman Diego Blanco, and Treasurer Alice Igitol were all on hand as Mr. Joe Diego of USDA made the presentation.

Our young people - and the future they represent - inspire me to work as hard as I can for our islands. That is why I visit a classroom whenever I am home. At the Joaquina Mareham Rabauliman Head Start Center in China Town last week I read Pigs Make Me Sneeze! together with the morning session students, which got us all talking about the importance of friendship in our lives. Thank you, JMR Head Start teachers, volunteers, staff, and students, for your warm welcome.
Head Start turns 50 - May 18 marked the 50th anniversary of the launch of Project Head Start, which today is helping 462 children from low-income families in the Northern Marianas get ready for school. We have ten Head Start centers here, where these young children learn about working in a classroom environment. Head Start also provides their families with health, nutrition, and other social services that can make a significant difference in school success. Federal funding of $1.86 million makes all this possible. As a member of the House Committee on Education, which has jurisdiction over Head Start, and working together with the CNMI Public School System, I want to help the program grow, so more of our children and their families can take part and get the boost that Head Start gives to students when they enter regular school.
House punts again, approves short-term patch for surface transportation programs - With surface transportation programs set to expire on May 31, the House passed a two-month extension this week for the Highway Trust Fund from which the Commonwealth receives $4 million annually. Without H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 , roadwork in many areas of the country would grind to a halt. The Northern Mariana Islands actually had a backlog of $22 million in federal highway money, as of the end of 2014, so work can continue here. But with highway dollars in short supply nationwide our continued funding could be at risk, if we do not spend the money we have. Good transportation systems are generally seen as essential to economic development in the long term, as well as a source of good-paying jobs and business opportunities here and now.
