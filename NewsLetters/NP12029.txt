News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
February 24, 2014
"A" Rating from NRA
As your Representative, I've taken an oath to uphold the Constitution.
That means the whole Constitution - including the Second Amendment,
which guarantees all citizens the right to bear arms.
Some politicians
in Washington like to pick and choose which parts they agree and
disagree with, ignoring their least favorite sections.
But that's not
what our Founders intended, and that's not how this country should
operate.
I'm always working to protect your Constitutional right to
bear arms.
That's why I am proud to have recently received an "A"
rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA)
for my votes to uphold our
Second Amendment rights.
It's an important issue for me because like
many of you, I'm a proud gun owner.
It's also a simple issue - it's
right there in the Constitution.
I'll continue to uphold the entire
Constitution and keep supporting your rights here in Washington.
Reforming Food Stamps
One of the reforms included in the Farm Bill was a pilot program to
help individuals on food stamps find employment.
It combines work
requirements and employment training to create opportunities that help
participants find work that allows them to move off food stamps.
I
think this is a great program because it changes the focus of food
stamps from sustenance to success.
Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
exploded during the recession, but as our economy has improved, the
food stamp rolls remain at record levels.
That's because too often,
government programs like this end up fostering dependence.
Even when
they don't create dependence, they're not actively working to improve
opportunities for American families.
This pilot program ensures we are
helping our neighbors in need-not just through nutrition assistance,
but also by giving them a helping hand up so they can become
self-sufficient again.
Last week, I sent a letter to the Texas Workforce Commission,
requesting that Texas apply to be one of the states that run this pilot
program.
Texas is already a national leader in creating jobs and
reducing unemployment, and taking part in this program will allow the
state to expand our efforts to get SNAP recipients back to work.
You
can read the full text of the letter
here, and see the other Members that joined me in
this effort.
We'd all be proud if our home state could lead the effort
to reform nutrition assistance in America.
Stop Government Abuse Week
This week, the House will vote on a series of bills that will help rein
in government abuse and stop President Obama from exceeding his
executive authority.
We're designating it Stop Government Abuse Week,
and our focus will be on good-government bills that hold Washington
accountable to the American people.
The bills we're voting on this
week cover a wide range of issues-from private property rights to
bringing transparency to regulations.
You can see the full list here
.
One of the bills I'm especially focused on is H.R. 3865
, which
stops the IRS from legalizing targeting of conservative groups.
The
fact is, organizations should be treated fairly regardless of their
political beliefs.
The "STOP Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS
Act" ensures that this Administration will not be allowed to
discriminate against groups based on their politics.
Action Item: A Committee Vote on My Windstorm Research Bill
This week, the House Committee on Science is planning to hold a vote on
my bill to reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program
(NWIRP). I first introduced NWIRP in 2004 to promote research that
helps save lives, reduce injuries, and lessen damage from windstorms.
This reauthorization would make the program more efficient, focusing
our resources on the research and pre-storm planning that allow us to
save lives, homes, and taxpayer dollars.
Not only does this benefit
communities that are hard-hit by tornados, hurricanes, and other
storms, but it also makes better use of taxpayer dollars. I'm looking
forward to getting this passed out of the Science Committee and
bringing it to the full House for a vote.

from
Representative
Randy
Neugebauer February

&#8220;A&#8221;
Rating
from
NRA
As
your
Representative,
I&#8217;ve
taken
an
oath
to
uphold
the
Constitution.
That
means
the
whole
Constitution
&#8211;
including
the
Second
Amendment,
which
guarantees
all
citizens
the
right
to
bear
arms.
Some
politicians
in
Washington
like
to
pick
and
choose
which
parts
they
agree
and
disagree
with,
ignoring
their
least
favorite
sections.
But
that&#8217;s
not
what
our
Founders
intended,
and
that&#8217;s
not
how
this
country
should
operate.
I&#8217;m
always
working
to
protect
your
Constitutional
right
to
bear
arms.
That&#8217;s
why
I
am
proud
to
have
recently
received
an
&#8220;A&#8221;
rating
from
the
National
Rifle
Association
(NRA)
for
my
votes
to
uphold
our
Second
Amendment
rights.
It&#8217;s
an
important
issue
for
me
because
like
many
of
you,
I&#8217;m
a
proud
gun
owner.
It&#8217;s
also
a
simple
issue
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
right
there
in
the
Constitution.
I&#8217;ll
continue
to
uphold
the
entire
Constitution
and
keep
supporting
your
rights
here
in
Washington.
Reforming
Food
Stamps
One
of
the
reforms
included
in
the
Farm
Bill
was
a
pilot
program
to
help
individuals
on
food
stamps
find
employment.
It
combines
work
requirements
and
employment
training
to
create
opportunities
that
help
participants
find
work
that
allows
them
to
move
off
food
stamps.
I
think
this
is
a
great
program
because
it
changes
the
focus
of
food
stamps
from
sustenance
to
success.
Participation
in
the Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(SNAP)
exploded
during
the
recession,
but
as
our
economy
has
improved,
the
food
stamp
rolls
remain
at
record
levels.
That&#8217;s
because
too
often,
government
programs
like
this
end
up
fostering
dependence.
Even
when
they
don&#8217;t
create
dependence,
they&#8217;re
not
actively
working
to
improve
opportunities
for
American
families.
This
pilot
program
ensures
we
are
helping
our
neighbors
in
need&#8212;not
just
through
nutrition
assistance,
but
also
by
giving
them
a
helping
hand
up
so
they
can
become
self-sufficient
again.
Last
week,
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Texas
Workforce
Commission,
requesting
that
Texas
apply
to
be
one
of
the
states
that
run
this
pilot
program.
Texas
is
already
a
national
leader
in
creating
jobs
and
reducing
unemployment,
and
taking
part
in
this
program
will
allow
the
state
to
expand
our
efforts
to
get
SNAP
recipients
back
to
work.
You
can
read
the
full
text
of
the
letter
here,
and
see
the
other
Members
that
joined
me
in
this
effort.
We&#8217;d
all
be
proud
if
our
home
state
could
lead
the
effort
to
reform
nutrition
assistance
in
America.
Stop
Government
Abuse
Week
This
week,
the
House
will
vote
on
a
series
of
bills
that
will
help
rein
in
government
abuse
and
stop
President
Obama
from
exceeding
his
executive
authority.
We&#8217;re
designating
it
Stop
Government
Abuse
Week,
and
our
focus
will
be
on
good-government
bills
that
hold
Washington
accountable
to
the
American
people.
The
bills
we&#8217;re
voting
on
this
week
cover
a
wide
range
of
issues&#8212;from
private
property
rights
to
bringing
transparency
to
regulations.
You
can
see
the
full
list
here .
One
of
the
bills
I&#8217;m
especially
focused
on
is
H.R.
3865 ,
which
stops
the
IRS
from
legalizing
targeting
of
conservative
groups.
The
fact
is,
organizations
should
be
treated
fairly
regardless
of
their
political
beliefs.
The
&#8220;STOP
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act&#8221;
ensures
that
this
Administration
will
not
be
allowed
to
discriminate
against
groups
based
on
their
politics.
Action
Item:
A
Committee
Vote
on
My
Windstorm
Research
Bill
This
week,
the
House
Committee
on
Science
is
planning
to
hold
a
vote
on
my
bill
to
reauthorize
the
National
Windstorm
Impact
Reduction
Program
(NWIRP).
I
first
introduced
NWIRP
in
2004
to
promote
research
that
helps
save
lives,
reduce
injuries,
and
lessen
damage
from
windstorms.
This
reauthorization
would
make
the
program
more
efficient,
focusing
our
resources
on
the
research
and
pre-storm
planning
that
allow
us
to
save
lives,
homes,
and
taxpayer
dollars.
Not
only
does
this
benefit
communities
that
are
hard-hit
by
tornados,
hurricanes,
and
other
storms,
but
it
also
makes
better
use
of
taxpayer
dollars.
I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
getting
this
passed
out
of
the
Science
Committee
and
bringing
it
to
the
full
House
for
a
vote.
