Pacifica Insurance Underwriters celebrates its 40th Anniversary this year. I marked the occasion with a statement to my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives . The late Jose C. "JoeTen" Tenorio was a founder of Pacifica, taking a chance on the business when most people in the Northern Mariana Islands were unfamiliar with the idea of insurance. But Pacifica has flourished; and, as I said in the House, "We all feel proud to witness a homegrown company with humble roots do well." Congratulations to everyone at Pacifica Insurance Underwriters.
Another $6.9m in water and sewer money for CUC; $1.7m for DEQ operations - The change we won in 2010 to increase drinking water and wastewater construction grants continues to pay off year after year. The Environmental Protection Agency announced $6.9 million in water and sewer grants to the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation this week. Before we got the funding formula changed the Commonwealth was only receiving about $1 million a year. Since the increase we have received $37 million; and Saipan has reached the goal of 24-hour water in many areas. The Commonwealth's Division of Environmental Quality - part of the newly formed Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality - was also awarded this week $1.7 million to carry out its operations, including beach monitoring, permitting, and other environmental protection programs. Thanks to all the staff and management at CUC and the new Bureau for improving our water system and protecting our environment.

Capt Adrian Evangelista of Tinian (center) and LCpl Jeremy Villagomez of Kagman (not pictured) are among the U.S. Marines delivering aid to the millions of people in the Philippines struck by Super Typhoon Yolanda. Thanks to both these sons of the Marianas for serving our nation and assisting our neighbors. To date, our federal government has provided $50 million in relief. For the latest information on the recovery efforts, go to sablan.house.gov/ typhoon-yolanda-relief .

5 U.S. Service Academy slots available - Apply for nomination today - Capt Adrian Evangelista (above) is one of a growing number of young men and women from the Northern Marianas who are graduates of a U.S. service academy. And, right now, nominations are open. The number of openings for the Northern Marianas doubled with a provision I added to Public Law 111-84. For 2014 we have two slots at the Naval Academy, Evangelista's alma mater, one at the Military Academy at West Point, and one at the Air Force Academy. There is also one slot open at the Merchant Marine Academy. Attending a service academy is a unique opportunity to obtain a first-rate college education entirely free. Graduates also earn the honor of receiving an officer's commission in the U.S. Armed Forces. As your Congressman, I may make nominations, but final selections among the nominees are made by academy admission officials. They look for strong grades in high school, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. More information and an application form are available at http://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/military-academy-nominations. Applications are due by December 13, 2013.
