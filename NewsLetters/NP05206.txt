Dear David,
Have you seen Congress lately? It&rsquo;s a mess. And it&rsquo;s only going to get worse if people like Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers continue to treat corporations better than people.
That&rsquo;s why I wanted to make sure you saw President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action. Just this week in Texas, voting rights were dismantled, essentially blocking minorities and many students and seniors from voting.
Whether you know it or not, in the past 6-years we have seen huge progress under President Obama. Unemployment is at the lowest level since before President Obama took office, before the Great Recession started. The deficit is rapidly dropping and is just 2.8% of GDP -- the lowest since 2007.
And thank God for President Obama&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people around the country gain access to health care.
Additionally, he has championed equal pay for women while Republicans try to take
away
long-term unemployment insurance and
kill
a minimum wage increase. There is still so much more we can do. And that can only be achieved with an active Congress, not an obstructive one. That is why it is so important to support Democratic candidates.
I&rsquo;m asking for your help. We have to act now. There&rsquo;s only a few days left. We&rsquo;re running out of time and money.
I know we can win, but we need your help! You can make a difference.
