This has been a great week, and I couldnt think of a better way to cap it off than to celebrate the 4 th
of July with folks around the district.
All week long Ive been meeting with veterans around the 12 th
District, for a couple of reasons: First, to thank them for everything theyve done for us.
Also, to help them break through the bureaucracy thats preventing them from getting the benefits theyve earned.
As you gather together with family and friends, I hope youll keep in mind what this day is all about.
Weve got so much to be thankful for here in the 12 th
District, and none of it would be possible without the bravery of the men and women who have served, and who still serve, this country.
If it hadnt been for their service, we wouldnt live in the land of the free, and the home of the brave.
So many men and women are fighting for us around the world today.
Theyve been away from their families for months at a time, and in some cases years at a time. We send a special thanks to them and their families for their continued sacrifice, and we continue to offer our prayers for their safe return home.
Unfortunately, some of our brave service members have paid the ultimate sacrifice so you and I can enjoy this day.
Today, we remember them in every flag we raise, and we continue to pray for their families who are left to shoulder that burden.
Again, I hope you enjoy this wonderful day, remember those who made it possible, and, of course, stay safe in whatever youre doing.
I hope to see many of you around the district.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
