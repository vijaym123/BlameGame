LOUISIANA ELECTION RESULTS: Mary Landrieu (D) 42.08% - Bill Cassidy (R) 40.96%
Friend -- There is still one more Senate seat that we can win this year.
Since neither Mary Landrieu nor her Tea Party opponent Bill Cassidy won 50% of the vote on Election Day, they&rsquo;re facing off in a runoff election on December 6.
The good news? Mary was the front-runner on November 4, and she can ABSOLUTELY win the runoff. But she won&rsquo;t win unless she has the resources she needs.
Mary&rsquo;s campaign must raise another $50,000 by midnight tomorrow to stay on track. Will you pitch in and help her in the next 30 hours?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Mary&rsquo;s extreme Tea Party challenger, GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, would be the next Ted Cruz if he is elected!
Why? Cassidy has said the U.S. Senate is &ldquo;run like a plantation&rdquo; and claimed being on Medicaid is &ldquo;actually worse&rdquo; than having no insurance. You CAN&rsquo;T let him get to the Senate.
But this race is going to be incredibly close, and Mary will need every single Democrat on board to push her over the finish line.
Will you pitch in to help Mary&rsquo;s campaign so she can surge to victory?
