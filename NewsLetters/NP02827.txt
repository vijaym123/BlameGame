Weekly Republican Address:
I
was honored to give the
Weekly Republican Address
this past week and discuss how we are working to lower costs for
middle-class families and empower folks with bottom up solutions that
prepare you for the future. I highlighted my bill,
H.R.
529 , which would expand and strengthen college savings plans to
help families everywhere send their children to the higher education
institution of their choice and urged the president to reconsider his
threats to veto common-sense jobs bills.

More of the Same from the Presidents
Budget:
We are six years into the Obama economy, and as
I begin to review the Presidents all too familiar budget that he
rolled out, all I notice is more of the same, except with a new slogan
called Middle Class Economics.
However, in spite of the
catchy title, according to reports,
fewer than one in
four
middle class taxpayers would benefit from his so-called
Middle Class Economics. Thats because the presidents top down,
government oriented budget would add trillions in new taxes, but it never
balances.
This is disappointing to say the least and
represents a huge missed opportunity to unite the country around a common
goal: to empower hardworking Americans and work with Congress to get real
results for the middle class.
Questioning
Secretary Jack Lew:
This week, I questioned
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew regarding President Obamas FY2016 budget
proposal and specifically the Presidents scheme to tax 529 college savings
plans. While Secretary Lewcontinued to defend taxing 529 college
savings plans as good policymoving forward, he acknowledged that they will
removeit from the Presidents current budget.
This sheds
light on just how out of touch the Presidents budget is with
hardworking Americans who are trying to get ahead. They deserve our respect
and support, not $2.1 trillion in new taxes.
While I was
disappointed with many of his remarks, Secretary Lew did leave the door
open that the Administration would consider working with Congress on
my bill to modernize 529s for families
trying to
save for higher education. I will continue to urge the President to
support H.R. 529 and future legislation to expand tax free college
savings plans.
ObamaCare Isnt
Working:
The House again took action this week to repeal the
Presidents disastrous health care law. The Affordable Care Act is driving up
health care costs and damaging small businesses. ObamaCare costs
small businesses $22.6 billion a year in lost wages through excess
regulation, and has caused individual premiums to
skyrocket.
This law is unworkable, impracticable, and not based on the values and
priorities of the American people. We must continue to work to replace
ObamaCare by advancing patient-centered legislation that improves
health care for all Americans.
National Rural
Health Association:
It was great to get to meet with
the National Rural Health Association this week. Rural healthcare
remains one of my top priorities in Congress and I will continue to
constantly work on the issue as a member of the Ways and Means Health
Subcommittee.
National School Board
Association:
This week I had the opportunity to
meet with school board members from Kansas to discuss reforms to our
nations education laws. As a mother of two kids who were educated in the
public school system, I am committed to reducing the federal footprint
in our childrens education system and returning local authority and
decision-making back to our public schools.
2015 Congressional Art
Competition:
Competition opened this week for the annual Congressional Art
Competition. Starting in 1982, the Congressional Art Competition is a fantastic
opportunity to recognize the talents of young Kansans. Since its
creation over 650,000 high school students have been involved nationwide
and I look forward to seeing the incredible entries this year. More
information about the competition and how to enter can be found on my
