7th DISTRICT
May 24, 2015
Dear
Friend,
On this Memorial Day, we Americans will
pause to remember those who have sacrificed their life in service to our
country.
In Central Florida, we
remember U.S. Marine Marine Sgt. Mark Johnson IV of Altamonte Springs,
who died May 12th in earthquake-ravaged Nepal. Mark perished not in
combat, but on a mission of aid and mercy. Greater love has no man
than to lay down his life for his fellow
man.
In the video below, the assembled House of
Representatives halted its business last Wednesday to rise in honor of Sergeant
Johnson and his fellow servicemen who lost their lives in the tragic
helicopter crash.
We pray for Mark, all the men and women who have paid
the ultimate price in service to our nation, their families and their
loved ones.
Most respectfully,
John L. Mica
Member of Congress
