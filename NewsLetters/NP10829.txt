Obamacare is not a Success Story
On Monday, President
Obama did his best to pull the wool over our eyes and claim Obamacare was a success - end of story. Using phony numbers of "enrollees" and a dubious "deadline" day, he claimed opponents of his healthcare takeover should give up.
But he is not living in reality. For Americans,
premiums are doubling ,
outrage over cancellations is boiling over,
and those the law was supposed to help are
being left out.
I have worked to repeal this destructive law and put in place reforms that increase patient choice, drive down premiums, and get the government out of your doctor's office.
Just this week,
the House voted
to restore Americans' full 40-hour workweek from the damage done by the healthcare law. This is another example of how we are working to roll back the most harmful aspects of this law.
I will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to repeal Obamacare root-and-branch -- for you, for your family, and for future generations.
Have a great weekend,
Jack
