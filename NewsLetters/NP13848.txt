Dear Friends:
This time of year, as you gather with your family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving, I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you.
I have so much to be thankful for
a wonderful family and great friends, but one of the greatest opportunities I have is to serve you in Congress.
Were at a crucial time in our nations history, and the fact that youve allowed me to be your voice in Washington is something Im grateful for every day.
This time of year, while we have plenty to be thankful for, I ask all of us to remember those whove fallen on hard times.
Whether theyre having trouble finding a job or have lost a loved one around the holidays, its important for us to keep them in our thoughts and prayers and do what we can to make this time of year special for them as well.
This Thanksgiving, Im volunteering at the Golden Harvest Food Bank in Augusta.
Golden Harvest provides an invaluable service to our community, especially during this time of year, and Im looking forward to spending time with them and helping out.
I also want to take this opportunity to say thank you to the men and women who serve our country and their families.
This time of year is especially tough for families that cant be together, but the service they're providing for our country will never be forgotten.
Weve got some of the bravest men and women serving our country from the 12th District, and while this time away from their loved ones is difficult, I know their families are very proud of what theyre doing for America.
I hope you and your families and friends enjoy this time together.
If youd like to keep this conversation going, send us a message on Twitter using
