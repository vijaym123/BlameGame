Friend,
Yesterday, I
introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate the month of May as National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month, along with my colleague and bladder cancer survivor, Mike Rogers (R-MI).
The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 72,000 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in 2013 alone.
This past year, 15,000 people died from the disease.
Despite bladder cancer being the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the country, the disease ranks a distant twenty-second on the list of cancers for which the federal government funds research.
Unfortunately, public awareness of the disease, in addition to federal research, is woefully inadequate.
That's why I am committed to work with my colleagues to raise awareness of this disease.
When diagnosed and treated early, bladder cancer has a relative five-year survival rate of 98 percent.
If the diagnosis and treatment of the disease are delayed, that survival rate can drop as low as 15 percent.
We must take an active role in the early detection and fight to end bladder cancer and I believe this resolution is a positive step in that direction.
