SIGN ON:
Voting Rights Amendment Act &gt;&gt;
A key section of the Voting Rights Act has been undone by the Supreme Court. We need the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore critical voting protections to ensure all can participate equally in our democracy. Add your name to support the Voting Rights Amendment Act:
Supporter: David Johnson
Petition Signature:

Sign your name &gt;&gt;
50 years ago, men and women from across the country came together in Selma, Alabama to press for civil rights. Their efforts helped lead to a major victory with President Johnson&rsquo;s signing of the Voting Rights Act.
But in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act. Since then, the voting rights of many have been rolled back.
It&rsquo;s critical we reinstate voting protections if we want to ensure the basic democratic right to vote.
Will you sign your name now in support of the Voting Rights Amendment Act? &gt;&gt;
Your voice is critical to protecting the right to vote.
Thank you,
