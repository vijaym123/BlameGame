Rep. Levin Works to Curb Predatory Lending
Practices Targeting Troops
We owe our service members a fair and
honest lending environment that is free from predators.
Rep. Levin
recently joined 65 colleagues in writing a
letter
to
Secretary of Defense Hagel in support of the Department of Defenses
proposed rules that would curb and prevent abusive practices currently
used by some lenders to target military personnel.
For example, one
lender charged a service member over $15,600 in interest for a
13-year-old car, when the title loan amount for the car was $1,615 -- an
annual interest rate of approximately 400 percent for the loan.
Rep. Levin fully supports the rules proposed by the Department of Defense
to close such unconscionable
practices.
Keystone Pipeline:
Good for Big Oil, Bad for Midwest
Drivers
On November 14, the House Republican
Leadership rushed to bring a bill to the Floor to approve the TransCanada
Keystone XL pipeline, which would be used to transport Canada tar
sands oil across 1700 miles of our country to Gulf Coast refineries,
where the oil would be refined into petroleum products, most of which
would be exported abroad.
The pipeline would not reduce the price
Americans pay for gasoline; in fact, TransCanada has indicated that
construction of the pipeline could actually result in higher gasoline
prices in Midwestern states.
The House voted 252 to 161 to approve
the measure.
Lawmakers Urge Restored Funding for the National
Institutes of Health
In a
letter
to Speaker Boehner and Minority
Leader Pelosi, Rep. Levin and more than 100 other House members urged
the House Leadership to prioritize the important role that the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) plays by working to fully restore
funding during the one-month Lame Duck session.
Over the past
decade, the federal governments investment in basic research at NIH has
failed to keep pace with inflation, causing NIHs purchasing power to
diminish by more than 20 percent.
At a time of unprecedented
scientific opportunity, it is critical that the United States make
forward-thinking investments that promote medical breakthroughs as well as our
international leadership in biomedical
research.
Rep. Levin
Cosponsors Bill to Reduce Unplanned Teen
Pregnancies
The U.S. has the highest teen
pregnancy rate when compared to other developed nations.
Of those
teens that get pregnant each year, almost a third said they did not
believe that they would get pregnant. Whats more, many states
including
Michigan
do not mandate sex education. Clearly, more must be done
to reduce unplanned pregnancies.
Rep. Levin recently joined 66 other Members and cosponsored
the Real Education for Healthy Youth Act [ H.R.
725 ].
This bill would authorize grants for states, local school
districts, hospitals, and non-profits to teach comprehensive,
evidence-based, age- and developmentally-appropriate sex education
programs.
