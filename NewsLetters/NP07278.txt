Medical research is more than a cure for a disease -- its hope. Hope that Alzheimers wont rob precious memories. Hope of a life without diabetes. Hope that you wont have to see your loved one suffer from Parkinsons disease. Hope to trade chemotherapy for keeping up with the kids and grandkids.
Its the hope of being there, and the promise for a better quality of life and a brighter future. Heres what Im working on to make that hope a reality:
Prioritizing medical research with proven success to cure illnesses like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's.
Patients come before politics
(Read:
H.R. 1740 ).
Choosing
medical innovation over medical regulation . The FDA process is too bureaucratic. Our medical system will be successful when its driven by innovation and discovery instead of red tape (Read: my
recent column
on the topic).
Finding new ways to treat existing diseases . Common sense drug repurposing can help find treatments to combat diseases like cancer, epilepsy, depression, and post-traumatic stress. (Read:
H.R. 4287 ).
