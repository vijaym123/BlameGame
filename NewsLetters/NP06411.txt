What I am Hoping to Hear from the President Tonight
Tonight President Obama will address the nation and lay out a comprehensive plan to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, a dangerous terrorist organization committing atrocities against thousands of people across Iraq and Syria, including American hostages. I'm confident the President will lay out a well-conceived proposal that will compel the support of our nation and of Congress. Yesterday in remarks on the Senate floor , I urged the President not just to inform Congress of what he plans to do, but to follow the Constitution and seek Congressional approval to defeat ISIL. In making the significant decision to authorize military action, Congress owes it to our troops who risk their lives to do our collective job and reach a consensus supporting the military mission that they are ordered to complete.
I await the President's address tonight on the real and serious threat posed by ISIL with a firm willingness to offer support to a well-crafted military mission. I believe the American public and this Congress will support such a mission. It is my deepest hope that we have the opportunity to debate and vote on it in the halls of Congress as our framers intended and as our troops deserve. You can watch my floor speech
