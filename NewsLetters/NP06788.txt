Dear
Friends,
This week, I toured our
states highways and
bridges to check up on the
status of some of
Delawares critical
transportation projects. As
Delawareans know all too
well, decades of wear and
tear have taken a toll on our
nations infrastructure
that was once the most
advanced in the world. Now we
find that our nations
bridges, tunnels, and
highways are crumbling and
Congress cant agree on
a long-term solution to
invest in repairing and
maintaining them, let alone
building the transformative
projects that will truly grow
our economy.
My first stop on the
tour was in Wilmington, where
the Christina River Bridge
Project will create another
access road into the
riverfront. This project has
the potential to bring more
visitors to our local
businesses in the area and
stimulate economic growth in
the city.
My second stop was on
Route 1 right by Milford High
School where theres a
project that would create an
overpass to eliminate
dangerous Route 1 crossovers
for pedestrians
enhancing public safety and
easing the flow of traffic in
the area.
Finally, I went to
Millville, where the Route 26
project would create
left-hand turn lanes, bike
and pedestrian lanes and
alleviate beach traffic for
Delawareans and First State
visitors.
Unfortunately, despite being
fully funded, this important
project was stalled
repeatedly due to the stop
and start of federal funding,
costing time and millions of
taxpayer dollars.
In Congress, we need to do
our job and shore up the
Highway Trust Fund for the
long-term to give our states
the funding certainty they
need to plan smart
infrastructure investments. I
stand ready to work with any
member who understands the
importance of passing a
long-term transportation
plan. Its what our
states, cities, and
businesses are asking for
and as I saw
this week in Delaware,
its what we need.
Sincerely,
Stay Connected with
