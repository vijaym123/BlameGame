Remember all that spending I told you about last week? Well -- it just got worse. Look for yourself:
$3,300,000 reserved by Boehner
$3,430,000 spent by Dold and other Republicans + $1,870,000 additional spending by a Dold billionaire backer.
$8,600,000 on ads against me
David, it&rsquo;s enough cash to make your head spin.
But here&rsquo;s the thing: even after millions and millions of dollars spent against me, our race is still in a dead heat.
How? Because of you, David. Your $5 and $10 gifts add up -- and they give us the resources to fight back against Republican attacks.
So naturally, David, I have to ask again. Will you pitch in before our 6:30 PM deadline? It&rsquo;s a big one, and we don&rsquo;t want to come up short. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thank you so much,
