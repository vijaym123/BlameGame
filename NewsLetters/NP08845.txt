Statement on the Colorado Springs VA
Clinic
6/10/14
It is very disappointing to learn that the
Colorado Springs VA Clinic must undergo further review by the
Inspector General. Three anonymous employees stepped forward stating they
were directed to manipulate appointment data in a way that would alter
perceived wait times. Weeks ago, I spoke with the leadership at this
clinic and was assured in no uncertain terms that this was not
happening.
If the
investigation arrives at the conclusion that wait list manipulation occurred in
Colorado Springs, two things must take place. First, the whistleblowers
must be protected from retribution for sharing the truth with the
Inspector General. Secondly, those responsible for any wrongdoing at the
Colorado Springs VA Clinic must be held
accountable."
"The practices of data manipulation
and obstruction of information must stop. The House Veterans Affairs
Committee has detailed the dozens of times that the VA has withheld
information from our Committee. These bureaucratic shell games have
prevented us from doing the necessary oversight work that the American
people expect. The hands-off leadership of the Obama Administration must
end. The President needs to approach this important issue with the same
tenacity as Congress. We will be holding Veterans Affairs Committee
hearings every week, until we root out the problems preventing our
veterans from receiving the care and respect that they have
earned.
