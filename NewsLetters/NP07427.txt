Dear Friend, National Republicans are pressing the attack in races around the country.
Their latest move is a $550,000 series of robocalls, but it&rsquo;s the same old play we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again.
I&rsquo;ve been the target of RNC attacks before. They sent on-the-ground staffers to Massachusetts last year in an attempt to beat me. But thanks to a strong grassroots network, we beat them back. This year, we need to do it again. I&rsquo;m counting on supporters like you to help our team reach our $35,000 fundraising goal for July -- can you get us $5 closer?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
The Republicans understand what&rsquo;s at stake this November --
control of the Senate, and a chance to ram their anti-middle class agenda through Congress.
They know they only need six seats to pull it off.
We&rsquo;re not going to let one of those seats come from Massachusetts. We&rsquo;re going to keep organizing and running hard until the last polls close on November 4. To do that, we have to hit our fundraising goals. Pitch in $5 to help us reach July&rsquo;s $35,000 goal.
Thank you for your continued support.
