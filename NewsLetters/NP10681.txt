Issues
Dear Friends,
Friday marked one year since I was given the honor of representing
Illinois' 2nd District in Congress.
And in the past year, we've made
much progress in addressing the complex challenges facing our district.
My casework teams in Chicago, Matteson and Kankakee have provided
thousands of hours of assistance to constituents. We've helped veterans
get the benefits they deserve, assisted homeowners with mortgage
modification efforts, and helped our seniors with their Medicare and
Social Security claims.
This is just a snapshot of some of the things we've accomplished
together in one short year.
There is still more important and exciting
work ahead, and I look forward to continuing to work for you and with
you.
Again, it's been an honor to serve the Second District, and I look
forward to continuing our work together. Thank you for staying engaged
and involved. If you have any questions, concerns, or recommendations
on how we can improve life in our district, please contact me at
www.robinkelly.house.gov
, or at 202-225-0773.
Sincerely,
Robin L. Kelly
Member of Congress

District Events
Getting the Second District back to work is my top priority and I'm
committed to helping spur job growth to accomplish this goal.
Last May, I led a "Make it in America" tour of the 2nd District. I met
with manufacturers and innovators to discuss what we can do to help
businesses grow and create jobs here at home. Helping manufacturers
produce more goods here in Illinois, and maintaining America's
innovation edge by training a highly skilled workforce are key to the
long-term economic growth of our district.
In October, I held the 2nd Congressional District Job Fair in South
Holland, where I connected over 1,400 residents looking for work with
employers looking to hire.
To help entrepreneurs, I hosted a Small
Business Workshop in Riverdale, where I helped over 100 local business
owners and leaders get information on accessing capital to grow their
businesses, effective marketing strategies, and programs at the Small
Business Administration that help businesses prosper.
Also, to help
local municipalities, churches, and non-profits, I hosted a Grants
Workshop on grant opportunities.
This past summer, I coordinated The National Summit on Violence in
Urban Communities, where Members of Congress from across the country
came together with local officials and community stakeholders to
address gun violence in cities like Chicago.
One of my principle
missions in Congress is to put an end to the stall tactics that have
held up national gun reform efforts.
I am committed to stopping the
gun violence that is destroying communities across Chicagoland.
Far too many homeowners in the 2nd District are struggling to maintain
their mortgages. To address this, I held the 2nd
Congressional
District Housing Expo in Matteson, where I assisted hundreds of
district residents who'd fallen behind on their mortgages, were in
danger of foreclosure, or who were looking to buy a home for the first
time. Home ownership and access to affordable housing are the
foundation for financial security for families and I am committed to
increasing housing options in the district.
On Saturday, I hosted the 2nd Congressional District Health & Wellness
Resource Fair at Corliss Early College STEM High School in Chicago.
The fair offered participants health-related resources and screenings,
access to social service program information, as well as fitness,
nutrition, and stress management sessions.
I'm committed to promoting
preventive health care and early detection, and to encouraging
residents of the 2nd District to live healthier and more active lives.

Introduced Legislation
Over the past year, I have introduced bills in Congress to help make
families safer, to give my constituents better access to job
opportunities, and to strengthen the local economy.
I first introduced two gun safety bills - H.R. 2464, The Improving Gun
Safety Standards Act and H.R. 2465 - The Recognizing Gun Violence as A
Public Health Emergency Act. H.R. 2464 amends the Consumer Product
Safety Act to allow for stricter safety standards on guns and
ammunition to help reduce gun-related deaths. H.R. 2465 requires the
U.S. Surgeon General to submit to Congress an annual report on the
effects of gun violence on the public's health in order to develop
informed strategies on how best to protect our communities from gun
violence.
I introduced H.R. 3328, the American Opportunity Act, which would help
reduce unemployment by extending the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for
businesses that hire long-term unemployed workers and other groups at
risk for high unemployment.
To assist servicemen and servicewomen who've returned home and are
looking for work, I introduced H.R. 3327: The Veterans Opportunity Act.
This bill puts veterans back to work by giving employers a tax
incentive to hire them.
This is a win-win that helps our veterans, our
businesses, and our economy.
I introduced H.R. 3956, the Community Investment & Empowerment Act.
This bill authorizes the Small Business Administration to make grants
available to economically underserved communities, and incentivizes
businesses, like grocery stores, retail chains, and restaurants, to
locate in areas that have struggled to recruit and retain businesses to
meet residents' needs.
I also introduced H.R. 3955, the Skilled Seniors Promotion Act, a bill
that helps break down barriers to employment for older unemployed
Americans by helping them acquire new skills to assist in their reentry
into the workforce.
To preserve our District's historical treasurers, I introduced H.R.
3929 the Pullman National Historical Park Act, which designates the
Pullman historic district as a National Park.
Designating Pullman as a
National Park will create a wonderful tourist attraction in the area
that will be a local job creator as well as a boon for the national
economy.

District Initiatives
Soon after taking office, I formed the 2nd Congressional District STEM
Council. The council consists of key innovators, educators, and
business leaders in our community who are committed to working with me
to find effective ways to promote science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM) to train the workforce of tomorrow.
As an extension of this goal, I formed the 2nd District STEM Academy
for local students. The academy offers STEM boot camps to help expose
kids to STEM careers and to encourage them to pursue STEM educations.
The key to America's global competitiveness is propelling our students
to the top of the pack in science and math achievement. Providing our
local students with access to creative STEM curriculum taught by
leaders in STEM fields is a big step in the right direction and is the
core mission of my STEM Academy.
As part of my efforts to increase educational opportunities for our
young people, I started a book donation program in my office. Through
the Library of Congress Surplus Books Program I've given over 1,000
books to schools in the 2nd District since the start of the school
year. It's imperative that our students have access to the resources
they need to succeed in school and I am committed to helping connect
them with those resources.
To help encourage economic development and improve our infrastructure,
I convened a meeting in Washington between Illinois officials and U.S.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and Federal Aviation
Administration representatives to discuss how we can make the South
Suburban Airport a reality by expediting final approval of this
important project (see picture below).
_____
Contests
To commemorate Black History Month, I hosted a video contest in which
students between in kindergarten through 8th grade were asked to submit
a 90-second video explaining why Black History Month is important to
them. All of the videos are available for viewing on my YouTube channel
at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEguFGPIS2idaaPWVXdYdbsfNxVfKT8KS
.
In keeping with my STEM push, I am participating in the Congressional
STEM App Challenge. High school students can submit apps until April
30th. For more information on how to apply, visit
http://robinkelly.house.gov/student-app-challenge
.
Each year, Congress hosts a Congressional Art Competition, inviting the
best high school artists to compete to have their work hung in the
United States Capitol Building. Submissions are due April 14th. For
rules and guidelines, visit
https://robinkelly.house.gov/services/art-competition

Dear
Friends,
Friday
marked
one
year
since
I
was
given
the
honor
of
representing
Illinois&#8217;
2nd
District
in
Congress.
And
in
the
past
year,
we&#8217;ve
made
much
progress
in
addressing
the
complex
challenges
facing
our
district.
My
casework
teams
in
Chicago,
Matteson
and
Kankakee
have
provided
thousands
of
hours
of
assistance
to
constituents.
We&#8217;ve
helped
veterans
get
the
benefits
they
deserve,
assisted
homeowners
with
mortgage
modification
efforts,
and
helped
our
seniors
with
their
Medicare
and
Social
Security
claims.
This
is
just
a
snapshot
of
some
of
the
things
we&#8217;ve
accomplished
together
in
one
short
year.
There
is
still
more
important
and
exciting
work
ahead,
and
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
for
you
and
with
you.
Again,
it&#8217;s
been
an
honor
to
serve
the
Second
District,
and
I
look
forward
to
continuing
our
work
together.
Thank
you
for
staying
engaged
and
involved.
If
you
have
any
questions,
concerns,
or
recommendations
on
how
we
can
improve
life
in
our
district,
please
contact

or

Sincerely,
Robin
L.
Kelly Member
of
Congress
District
Events
Getting
the
Second
District
back
to
work
is
my
top
priority
and
I&#8217;m
committed
to
helping
spur
job
growth
to
accomplish
this
goal.
Last
May,
I
led
a
&#8220;Make
it
in
America&#8221;
tour
of
the
2nd
District. I
met
with
manufacturers
and
innovators
to
discuss
what
we
can
do
to
help
businesses
grow
and
create
jobs
here
at
home.
Helping
manufacturers
produce
more
goods
here
in
Illinois,
and
maintaining
America&#8217;s
innovation
edge
by
training
a
highly
skilled
workforce
are
key
to the
long-term
economic
growth
of
our
district.
In
October,
I
held
the
2nd
Congressional
District
Job
Fair
in
South
Holland,
where
I
connected
over
1,400
residents
looking
for
work
with
employers
looking
to
hire.
To
help
entrepreneurs,
I
hosted
a
Small
Business
Workshop
in
Riverdale,
where
I
helped
over
100
local
business
owners
and
leaders
get
information
on
accessing
capital
to
grow
their
businesses,
effective
marketing
strategies,
and
programs
at
the
Small
Business
Administration
that
help
businesses
prosper.
Also,
to
help
local
municipalities,
churches,
and
non-profits,
I
hosted
a
Grants
Workshop
on
grant
opportunities.
This
past
summer,
I
coordinated
The
National
Summit
on
Violence
in
Urban
Communities,
where
Members
of
Congress
from
across
the
country
came
together
with
local
officials
and
community
stakeholders
to
address
gun
violence
in
cities
like
Chicago.
One
of
my
principle
missions
in
Congress
is
to
put
an
end
to
the
stall
tactics
that
have
held
up
national
gun
reform
efforts.
I
am
committed
to
stopping
the
gun
violence
that
is
destroying communities
across
Chicagoland.
Far
too
many
homeowners
in
the
2nd
District
are
struggling
to
maintain
their
mortgages.
To
address
this,
I
held
the
2nd
Congressional
District
Housing
Expo
in
Matteson,
where
I
assisted
hundreds
of
district
residents
who&#8217;d
fallen
behind
on
their
mortgages,
were
in
danger
of
foreclosure,
or
who
were
looking
to
buy
a
home
for
the
first
time.
Home
ownership
and
access
to
affordable
housing
are
the
foundation
for
financial
security
for
families
and
I
am
committed
to
increasing
housing
options
in
the
district.
On
Saturday,
I
hosted
the
2nd
Congressional
District
Health
&amp;
Wellness
Resource
Fair
at
Corliss
Early
College
STEM
High
School
in
Chicago.
The
fair
offered
participants
health-related
resources
and
screenings,
access
to
social
service
program
information,
as
well
as
fitness,
nutrition,
and
stress
management
sessions.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
promoting
preventive
health
care
and
early
detection,
and
to
encouraging
residents
of
the
2nd
District
to
live
healthier
and
more
active
lives.
Rep.

in
Chicago
Introduced
Legislation
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
introduced
bills
in
Congress
to
help
make
families
safer,
to
give
my
constituents
better
access
to
job
opportunities,
and
to
strengthen
the
local
economy.
I
first
introduced
two
gun
safety bills
-
H.R.
2464,
The
Improving
Gun
Safety
Standards
Act
and
H.R.
2465
&#8211;
The
Recognizing
Gun
Violence
as
A
Public
Health
Emergency
Act.
H.R.
2464
amends
the
Consumer
Product
Safety
Act
to
allow
for
stricter
safety
standards
on
guns
and
ammunition
to
help
reduce
gun-related
deaths.
H.R.
2465
requires
the
U.S.
Surgeon
General
to
submit
to
Congress
an
annual
report
on
the
effects
of
gun
violence
on
the
public&#8217;s
health
in
order
to
develop
informed
strategies
on
how
best
to
protect
our
communities
from
gun
violence.
I
introduced
H.R.
3328,
the
American
Opportunity
Act,
which
would
help
reduce
unemployment
by
extending
the
Work
Opportunity
Tax
Credit
for
businesses
that
hire
long-term
unemployed
workers
and
other
groups
at
risk
for
high
unemployment.
To
assist
servicemen
and
servicewomen
who&#8217;ve
returned
home
and
are
looking
for
work,
I
introduced
H.R.
3327:
The
Veterans
Opportunity
Act.
This
bill
puts
veterans
back
to
work
by
giving
employers
a
tax
incentive
to
hire
them.
This
is
a
win-win
that
helps
our
veterans,
our
businesses,
and
our
economy.
I
introduced
H.R.
3956,
the
Community
Investment
&amp;
Empowerment
Act.
This
bill
authorizes
the
Small
Business
Administration
to
make
grants
available
to
economically
underserved
communities,
and
incentivizes
businesses,
like
grocery
stores,
retail
chains,
and
restaurants,
to
locate
in
areas
that
have
struggled
to
recruit
and
retain
businesses
to
meet
residents&#8217;
needs.
I
also
introduced
H.R.
3955,
the
Skilled
Seniors
Promotion
Act,
a
bill
that
helps
break
down
barriers
to
employment
for
older
unemployed
Americans
by
helping
them
acquire
new
skills
to
assist
in
their
reentry
into
the
workforce.
To
preserve
our
District&#8217;s
historical
treasurers,
I
introduced
H.R.
3929
the
Pullman
National
Historical
Park
Act,
which
designates
the
Pullman
historic
district
as
a
National
Park.
Designating
Pullman
as
a
National
Park
will
create
a
wonderful
tourist
attraction
in
the
area
that
will
be
a
local
job
creator
as
well
as
a
boon
for
the
national
economy.
District
Initiatives
Soon
after
taking
office,
I
formed
the
2nd
Congressional
District
STEM
Council.
The
council
consists
of
key
innovators,
educators,
and
business
leaders
in
our
community
who
are
committed
to
working
with
me
to
find
effective
ways
to
promote
science,
technology,
engineering,
and
math
(STEM)
to
train
the
workforce
of
tomorrow.
As
an
extension
of
this
goal,
I
formed
the
2nd
District
STEM
Academy
for
local
students.
The
academy
offers
STEM
boot
camps
to
help
expose
kids
to
STEM
careers
and
to
encourage
them
to
pursue
STEM
educations.
The
key
to
America&#8217;s
global
competitiveness
is
propelling
our
students
to
the
top
of
the
pack
in
science
and
math
achievement.
Providing
our
local
students
with
access
to
creative
STEM
curriculum
taught
by
leaders
in
STEM
fields
is
a
big
step
in
the
right
direction
and
is
the
core
mission
of
my
STEM
Academy.
As
part
of
my
efforts
to
increase
educational
opportunities
for
our
young
people,
I
started
a
book
donation
program
in
my
office.
Through
the
Library
of
Congress
Surplus
Books
Program
I&#8217;ve
given
over
1,000
books
to
schools
in
the
2nd
District
since
the
start
of
the
school
year.
It&#8217;s
imperative
that
our
students
have
access
to
the
resources
they
need
to
succeed
in
school
and
I
am
committed
to
helping
connect
them
with
those
resources.
To
help
encourage
economic
development
and
improve
our
infrastructure, I
convened
a
meeting
in
Washington
between
Illinois
officials
and
U.S.
Transportation
Secretary
Anthony
Foxx
and
Federal
Aviation
Administration
representatives
to
discuss
how
we
can
make
the
South
Suburban
Airport
a
reality
by expediting
final
approval
of
this
important
project
(see
picture
below).
Contests
To
commemorate
Black
History
Month,
I
hosted
a
video
contest
in
which
students
between
in
kindergarten
through
8th
grade
were
asked
to
submit
a
90-second
video
explaining
why
Black
History
Month
is
important
to
them.
All
of
the
videos
are
available
for
viewing
on
my
YouTube
channel
at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEguFGPIS2idaaPWVXdYdbsfNxVfKT8KS .
In
keeping
with
my
STEM
push,
I
am
participating
in
the
Congressional
STEM
App
Challenge.
High
school
students
can
submit
apps
until
April
30th.
For
more
information
on
how
to
apply,

http://robinkelly.house.gov/student-app-challenge .
Each
year,
Congress
hosts
a
Congressional
Art
Competition,
inviting
the
best
high
school
artists
to
compete
to
have
their
work
hung
in
the
United
States
Capitol
Building.
Submissions
are
due
April
14th.
