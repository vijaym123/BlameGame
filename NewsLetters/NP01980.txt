Attention Students!
And parents, grandparents, &amp; teachers
I'm emailing today to highlight three exciting opportunities that are currently available for students throughout my Congressional district, and I want to ensure every student in the 2nd District is aware of them.
If you're currently a student in the Second Congressional District, I hope you'll explore the opportunities below. Even if you're not a student, please feel free to pass along this information to a student you may know (or their parents!).
In Your Service,
Brad Wenstrup
Internships
Immediate openings are available to intern with my office, both in Washington D.C. and Ohio.
Internship positions are offered for college and graduate students, and are designed to provide students with first-hand experience in a Congressional office.
Applications are open for spring and summer positions today. I encourage you to apply!

Service Academy Nominations
Members of Congress have the privilege of nominating exceptional young people for admission to the U.S. Service Academies, where motivated young men and women have the opportunity to serve their country while developing valuable leadership skills.
On
Saturday, April 25th , I will host my annual "Academy Day" for prospective Academy students and their parents. The day consists of an Academy Fair, as well as a formal program featuring representatives from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy.
