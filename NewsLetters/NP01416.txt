Greetings,
For most of us, the
4 million words
in the tax code are confusing and costly.
From individuals to small businesses, we have all experienced the IRS taking too much of our hard-earned money.
It has also, under President Obama, acted as a political enforcer, wielding tremendous power over organizations it deems as enemies.
Its intolerable actions have included
targeting conservative groups seeking tax exemptions
and
seizing small businesss bank accounts .
It has also recently been reported that
hundreds of former IRS employees with past behavior problems have been rehired by the agency .
This puts Americans at risk.
As some rush to get tax returns filed today, the House passed the following legislation that would stop the IRS from abusing its role.
Seven bills came to the House Floor today, with my support, aimed at holding the IRS accountable and stopping its ability to manipulate the tax code.
Three of these bills, the
Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act , the
Fair Treatment for All Gifts Act , and the
Ensuring Tax Exempt Organizations the Right to Appeal Act
will prevent IRS employees from targeting individuals and organizations based on their political affiliations.
The
Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2015
would restrict IRS employees and ensure all taxpayers receive quality service, guaranteed confidentiality, and have the right to appeal and have their challenge be heard.
The
Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act
and the
IRS Email Transparency Act
will protect the privacy of taxpayers.
And finally, the
IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Act
will speed the processing of 501(c)3 applications.
The IRS cannot be allowed to continue to manipulate its practices and bend the tax code as it sees fit.
The legislation passed by the House today will begin the process of reforming an increasingly confusing tax code and help stop taxpayers from falling victim to the IRS.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
