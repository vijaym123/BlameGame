President Obama has emailed you.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz has emailed you.
James Carville has emailed you.
And now I'm emailing you again.
We wouldn't be emailing you on Labor Day Weekend if this could wait. It can't.
David, if we're going to withstand the barrage of Obama-bashing attacks from Karl Rove and the Kochs, we need you to step up now. So far, more than 55,871 of our best supporters have responded this weekend to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action. But sadly, it doesn't look like you're on that list.
We&rsquo;re down to our last 24 hours before our fundraising deadline and still coming up 44,000 donations short. 24-HOUR DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
