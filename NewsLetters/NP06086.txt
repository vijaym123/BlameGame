Superfund Tour Measures Cleanup Progress
This past Monday
I conducted my annual tour of
Superfund
sites
in the 11 th
Congressional District. I visited six sites
in
Byram Township, Rockaway Township, Rockaway Borough, and Fairfield
to assess the progress being made in cleaning up these heavily
polluted sites.
Judith Enck, the Region 2 Administrator of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accompanied me for part of the tour.
Together we announced that EPA has finalized a cleanup plan for the
Radiation Technology site in Rockaway Township. I was surprised to hear
from Administrator Enck that I am perhaps the only Member of Congress
to
tour
Superfund
sites.
Wall Street Journal : The Recovery That Left
Out Almost Everybody
As I travel around the
11 th
Congressional District and speak to my constituents and visit
businesses about their concerns, the most frequently mentioned
problem is the economy. Americas economy is undergoing the slowest recovery
from a recession since World War II, and families are hurting. This
piece
by William A. Galston in the
Wall Street Journal
clearly explains out just how
dismal things are.
The House has passed more than 40
bills that would stimulate economic growth and opportunity. The Senate
hasnt even considered a single one of them. The Senate needs to get
to work to put America back on track!
Destroying
ISIS
This week has seen the critically important
first steps in the effort to destroy ISIS and its threat to America and
the civilized world.
We hope for the success of the mission
and the safety of our military personnel as this long fight continues
in the weeks and months ahead.
I am gratified at the
blows our military has already inflicted on ISIS and other terrorist
groups in the region. But, as Richard Cohen writes in this must read
column
in the
Washington
Post , the President still needs to develop a comprehensive,
long-range strategy for protecting our nation and our interests from
terrorism. We cant act just on promises.
Russian
Aggression: Is Latvia Next on the List?
This
insightful
article
from todays
Washington
Post
is a must read. It points to the spreading
threat unchecked Russian aggression poses to its neighbors across Eastern
Europe, from the Baltic to the Black
Sea.
Bloomberg: North Korea Inching Toward Mobile Long-Range
Missile
According to Tony Capaccio and David Lerman writing at
Bloomberg.com , North Koreas military is taking steps
to field a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile that could
threaten the U.S., the head of American forces in the Pacific said
today.
With so much attention focused on the Middle East, we
must not neglect the growing threats elsewhere in the
world.
The Independent VA Audit Needs to Start
Now
Last month the House passed, by a strong bipartisan majority, the
Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, &amp;
Transparency Act. This important bill also passed the Senate and was signed
into law by the President shortly thereafter.
One of the most
important provisions of that law called for an INDEPENDENT AUDIT of
the VA healthcare system. Given the nature and scope of the problems,
Congress expected that audit to be ordered immediately. Yet as of
today, nothing has been done.
House Speaker John Boehner
wrote
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald,
earlier this week to urge him to take action and get this audit
underway. Our veterans deserve a 21 st
century VA healthcare
system! Its time for the VA to get moving!
Salute:
Bridgette Hobart Conquers the English Channel, Earns Open Water Triple
Crown
Bridgette Hobart, a 51-year-old Lake Hopatcong
resident, last week completed a swim of the English Channel. According
to
nj.com , this feat puts her among a small
group to capture the "Triple Crown of Open Water
Swimming,"
a title given to those who cross the English Channel, circle
28.5 miles around Manhattan and make the 21-mile trip from Santa
Catalina Island to the California mainland.
I salute Bridgette
for this remarkable achievement of strength and
endurance!
