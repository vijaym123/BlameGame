Rep. Veasey Statement on Passing of Former Speaker, Jim Wright
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Congressman Marc Veasey released the following statement marking the passing of former Speaker of the House, Jim Wright:
With Speaker Jim Wrights passing, America has lost one of its most distinguished and dedicated public servants, I have lost a great friend and mentor, and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex has lost a tireless advocate whose impact in the region has been broad and deep.
From transportation and flood control to aviation and economic prosperity, Speaker Wright was a tremendous champion for North Texas.
From his service in World War II to his over three decade tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Speaker Wright earned the respect and trust of those on both sides of the aisle through his strong and dedicated leadership.
My own service today is inspired by Speaker Wrights fervent commitment to serving the people of Texas and beyond.
Speaker Wright was a man of deep courage, profound wisdom, and brilliant expression. I will miss deeply his presence, his example, and his advice. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.
