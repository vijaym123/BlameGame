please david Less than 1 vote per precinct.
David, when I won my first race, that&rsquo;s how close the margin was. This year, Brad Schneider&rsquo;s re-election could be even closer.
As you read this, Speaker Boehner, Karl Rove and the entire right-wing establishment is targeting his campaign.
We can break the tie for Brad and help him pull ahead, but he needs your support today, before right-wing attacks take hold with voters. So quick favor: Will you pitch in $5 or $10 to help Brad reach 250 grassroots donations by midnight? David Johnson
GOAL: 250 DONATIONS
DEADLINE: 11:59 PM, CDT If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Brad&rsquo;s up against a whole lot of folks with a whole bunch of money. We don&rsquo;t have to match them dollar-for-dollar, we just have to keep it close.
Please pitch in for Brad, while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference. Chip in:
