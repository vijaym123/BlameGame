Dear Friends,
For generations, members of the
National Guard have stepped forward to serve their neighbors, community,
and country. Since its creation by the Massachusetts General Court in
December 1636, these patriots have fought for our liberty and way of
life.
Throughout its history, the Guards citizen-soldiers have
protected our nation and defended our democratic values both at home and
abroad.
Over the years, the Guard has undergone significant
transformations, but its mission and ideals remain the same.
In
every corner of America, these citizen-soldiers are close by, ready to
serve.
As civilians, they work as teachers, students, doctors,
nurses, shift workers and small business owners helping to better our
nation every day. However, they also play an essential military
role.
They often serve as responders and as an important line of
defense after emergencies and disasters in local communities and around
the world.
An excellent example of the Florida National Guards
service is its dedication to helping our state after devastating
hurricanes. But the service of these great men and women goes beyond
responding to emergencies.
Over 100,000 Guardsmen and Guardswomen have
served tours of combat defending our freedom and ideals in places such
as Iraq and Afghanistan.
Even if they are not directly in the
line of fire, they do much of the ground work at local military bases
everyday which is essential in ensuring that military operations and
bases can continue their work.
For hundreds of
years, our nations citizen-soldiers have sacrificed, struggled and
triumphed.
They are our next door neighbors, our colleagues, and our
friends.
But their service goes beyond one weekend a month,
their work and sacrifice makes Guardsmen and Guardswomen essential in our
national defense every day.
On its anniversary this December
13th, I want to thank all members of the National Guard for, as their
motto states, being always ready and always there for
America.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
