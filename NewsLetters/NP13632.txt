CO biologist tells Tipton, Committee that BLM sage grouse approach is
simplistic, damaging: During a House Natural Resources Committee
hearing on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) decision-making process,
Congressman Scott Tipton (R-CO) shined light on numerous concerns with
the proposed ESA listing of the sage grouse. Tipton questioned Megan
Maxwell, a biologist from Broomfield, Colorado, on the Bureau of Land
Management's (BLM) National Technical Team Report (NTT) which makes
recommendations for stringent sage grouse habitat protections on
millions of square miles in parts of Colorado and ten other Western
states. Maxwell told Tipton and the Committee of numerous problems with
the NTT report, including the one-size-fits-all approach to preserve
the grouse, which fails to take into account diverse regional
ecological factors vital to successfully preserve the species, or take
into account the local efforts already underway. Read more

Speaking at a joint meeting of the Aspen and Snowmass Village Rotary

legislative pieces he is working on. The first of those was the
Planning for American Energy Act of 2013, which the House of
Representatives just passed. "Everyone in this room is involved in
business," Tipton said. "One of the key components of every business is
obviously our ability...to have affordable energy." The bill
specifically lists wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, oil, gas,
oil shale and minerals as resources to be developed without eliminating
any environmental requirements, Tipton said.

Things
to

both

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches

1500

in

because
they
will
leave

COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
