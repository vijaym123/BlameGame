Dear Friend,
Private property rights are vital to our American way of life.
It is the foundation for our homes, our livelihoods, and our opportunity to provide a better future for coming generations.
That is why alarms sounded when rights to Texas land were called into question by the federal government.
Last December, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced it was reviewing and updating its management plan for any land the federal government might own along the Red River
land that has been in families for decades.
To help settle the issue, I recently introduced legislation with Senator John Cornyn that would legally settle the question of ownership once and for all.
The Red River Private Property Protection Act (H.R. 4979) requires the BLM to provide quit claim deeds to any property owner who can demonstrate his or her ownership through a county deed and tax records.
It would also prevent the BLM from including any private property in its management plans now and in the future.
Landowners deserve the certainty that their land will be protected and their ownership secure.
Upon introduction, the bill was sent to the House Natural Resources Committee to await further review.
I am pleased that the Committee announced a hearing on the bill will be held next Tuesday, moving it one more step closer to hopefully getting to the House floor for a vote.
At the hearing, one of our local landowners will give his perspective on how the issue directly affects him and his land.
Listen below to learn more.
