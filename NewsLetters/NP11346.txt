Capitol Update
Congressman Cook: "It's Time to Audit the Federal Reserve"
This week I signed on as a cosponsor of H.R. 24, the Federal Reserve
Transparency Act. This bill requires a full audit of the Federal
Reserve and all Federal Reserve banks.
Despite the Federal Reserve's massive role in managing the economy,
current law restricts the Government Accountability Office (GAO) from
auditing the Federal Reserve's deliberations, decisions, or actions on
monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Transparency Act removes these
restrictions and allows the GAO to examine the Fed's books. This would
put the central banking system under the same transparency rules as
most other federal agencies.
After the most recent financial collapse, it's more important than ever
that we create full transparency in the Federal Reserve. The fact that
the chief regulator of our financial system isn't held to the same
reporting standards as the rest of the country is unacceptable. I'm
proud to be a cosponsor of this vital legislation to provide oversight
for our central banking system. It's time to audit the Federal Reserve.
Congressman Cook Votes to Rein in Executive Overreach
This week I voted to rein in the growing problem of executive overreach
and restore the constitutional separation of powers. H.R. 4198, the
"Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional
Enactments of the Law Act" better known as the ENFORCE the Law Act and
H.R. 3973, the "Faithful Execution of the Law Act," passed the House of
Representatives this week.
H.R.4198 would permit the House or Senate to authorize a lawsuit
against the Executive Branch for failure to carry out the law. This
bill requires expedited consideration of any such lawsuit by a
three-judge panel at the federal district court level and provides for
direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. This expedited review
is important in ensuring that any lawsuit brought against the Executive
Branch is heard in a timely manner. This prevents the President from
stalling and delaying the suit in courts.
H.R. 3973 amends federal law to require the Attorney General to report
to Congress any time a federal official refuses to enforce any
provisions of federal law. The report must explain the reason for the
non-enforcement. This will strengthen current law and promote
transparency and honesty in the federal government.
Many of my constituents are concerned about the overreaching of this
Administration and ask me what Congress is doing to stop it. Voting in
favor of these important bills is one way that I'm working to stop this
abuse of power and restore the equal balance between the branches of
government. A failure to enforce the constitutionally enacted laws
because of policy disagreements is not how our government works. The
Congress, not the President, has the duty to write the laws; it's the
President's job to carry out the law as written.
Congressman Cook Sponsors Bill to Ensure Effectiveness of Veterans
Programs
Rep. Dina Titus (D- NV) and I introduced the "Veterans Employment and
Training Service Longitudinal Study Act of 2014", a bill to ensure
veterans are receiving effective and successful employment training
services.
This bipartisan bill authorizes an independent organization to collect
and analyze data on the effectiveness of the Department of Labor's
Veterans Employment Training Service (VETS). The study will focus on
veterans who have received intensive services from two programs under
VETS, the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP) and the Local
Veterans Employment Representatives (LVER).
Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists provide services
to meet the employment needs of disabled veterans and other eligible
veterans. Their primary focus is on veterans who are economically or
educationally disadvantaged, including homeless veterans, and veterans
with barriers to employment. Local Veterans Employment Representatives
(LVER) conduct outreach to employers and focus on increasing and
promoting employment the hiring of veterans.
The study will track the employment status of veterans who have
received these services, determine if the program contributed to their
employment, monitor the employment retention rate, and determine if the
services provided helped them increase their average earnings. A report
on the findings will be presented to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs
in the House and Senate every year for the next five years. The study's
findings will allow Congress to make improvements to these programs and
more efficiently spend taxpayer dollars.
Congress has a duty to provide our veterans with the best employment
services possible. We can't just authorize these programs and hope they
work; we have to follow up and ensure that they are working as they
were intended to. The analysis of long-term outcomes is precisely the
type of oversight Congress needs to determine the effectiveness of
these programs and to ensure long-term success for our nation's heroes.
They deserve nothing less.

Veterans' Corner
Pension Scams Defraud Veterans
Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is warning veterans about fraudulent
offers of help in qualifying for benefits through the Veterans Pension
Program. This type of scam is often directed toward veterans and family
members who do not actually qualify for a VA pension. Veterans need to
be on guard against anyone who offers to move assets around to qualify
for a VA pension. If you are a veteran or a family member of a veteran
who has questions about pension eligibility or feel as though you may
have been targeted by this scam, please reach out to Congressman Cook's
Apple Valley District office at 760-247-1815.
Congratulations to Medal of Honor Recipients
Today, six Southern California Army veterans are among those set to
receive the Medal of Honor at the White House. The Medal of Honor is
the United States of America's highest military honor, awarded for
personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty. The medal is
awarded by the President of the United States in the name of Congress
to US military personnel only.
On behalf of the Eighth Congressional District of California,
Congressman Paul Cook extends his congratulations to all the recipients
and their families.

Capitol
Update
Congressman Cook:
&#8220;It&#8217;s
Time
to
Audit
the
Federal
Reserve&#8221;
This
week
I
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
of
H.R.
24,
the
Federal
Reserve
Transparency
Act.
This
bill
requires
a
full
audit
of
the
Federal
Reserve
and
all
Federal
Reserve
banks.
Despite
the
Federal
Reserve&#8217;s
massive
role
in
managing
the
economy,
current
law
restricts
the
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
from
auditing
the
Federal
Reserve&#8217;s
deliberations,
decisions,
or
actions
on
monetary
policy.
The
Federal
Reserve
Transparency
Act
removes
these
restrictions
and
allows
the
GAO
to
examine
the
Fed&#8217;s
books.
This
would
put
the
central
banking
system
under
the
same
transparency
rules
as
most
other
federal
agencies.
After
the
most
recent
financial
collapse,
it&#8217;s
more
important
than
ever
that
we
create
full
transparency
in
the
Federal
Reserve.
The
fact
that
the
chief
regulator
of
our
financial
system
isn&#8217;t
held
to
the
same
reporting
standards
as
the
rest
of
the
country
is
unacceptable.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
be
a
cosponsor
of
this
vital
legislation
to
provide
oversight
for
our
central
banking
system.
It&#8217;s
time
to
audit
the
Federal
Reserve.
Congressman Cook
Votes
to
Rein
in
Executive
Overreach This
week
I
voted
to
rein
in
the
growing
problem
of
executive
overreach
and
restore the
constitutional
separation
of
powers.
H.R.
4198,
the
&#8220;Executive
Needs
to
Faithfully
Observe
and
Respect
Congressional
Enactments
of
the
Law
Act&#8221;
better
known
as
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act
and
H.R.
3973,
the
&#8220;Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act,&#8221; passed
the
House
of
Representatives
this
week.
H.R.4198
would
permit
the
House
or
Senate
to
authorize
a
lawsuit
against
the
Executive
Branch
for
failure
to
carry
out
the
law.
This
bill
requires
expedited
consideration
of
any
such
lawsuit
by
a
three-judge
panel
at
the
federal
district
court
level
and
provides
for
direct
appeal
to
the
United
States
Supreme
Court.
This
expedited
review
is
important
in
ensuring
that
any
lawsuit
brought
against
the
Executive
Branch
is
heard
in
a
timely
manner.
This
prevents
the
President
from
stalling
and
delaying
the
suit
in
courts.
H.R.
3973
amends
federal
law
to
require
the
Attorney
General
to
report
to
Congress
any
time
a
federal
official
refuses
to
enforce
any
provisions
of
federal
law.
The
report
must
explain
the
reason
for
the
non-enforcement.
This
will
strengthen
current
law
and
promote
transparency
and
honesty
in
the
federal
government.
Many
of
my
constituents
are
concerned
about
the
overreaching
of
this
Administration
and
ask
me
what
Congress
is
doing
to
stop
it.
Voting
in
favor
of
these
important
bills
is
one
way
that
I&#8217;m
working
to
stop
this
abuse
of
power
and
restore
the
equal
balance
between
the
branches
of
government.
A
failure
to
enforce
the
constitutionally
enacted
laws
because
of
policy
disagreements
is
not
how
our
government
works.
The
Congress,
not
the
President,
has
the
duty
to
write
the
laws;
it&#8217;s
the
President&#8217;s
job
to
carry
out
the
law
as
written.
Congressman
Cook
Sponsors
Bill
to
Ensure
Effectiveness
of
Veterans
Programs
Rep.
Dina
Titus
(D-
NV)
and
I introduced
the
&#8220;Veterans
Employment
and
Training
Service
Longitudinal
Study
Act
of
2014&#8221;,
a
bill
to
ensure
veterans
are
receiving
effective
and
successful
employment
training
services.
This
bipartisan
bill
authorizes
an
independent
organization
to
collect
and
analyze
data
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
Department
of
Labor&#8217;s
Veterans
Employment
Training
Service
(VETS).
The
study
will
focus
on
veterans
who
have
received
intensive
services
from
two
programs
under
VETS,
the
Disabled
Veterans
Outreach
Program
(DVOP)
and
the
Local
Veterans
Employment
Representatives
(LVER).
Disabled
Veterans
Outreach
Program
(DVOP)
specialists
provide
services
to
meet
the
employment
needs
of
disabled
veterans
and
other
eligible
veterans.
Their
primary
focus
is
on
veterans
who
are
economically
or
educationally
disadvantaged,
including
homeless
veterans,
and
veterans
with
barriers
to
employment.
Local
Veterans
Employment
Representatives
(LVER)
conduct
outreach
to
employers
and
focus
on
increasing
and
promoting
employment
the
hiring
of
veterans.
The
study
will
track
the
employment
status
of
veterans
who
have
received
these
services,
determine
if
the
program
contributed
to
their
employment,
monitor
the
employment
retention
rate,
and
determine
if
the
services
provided
helped
them
increase
their
average
earnings.
A
report
on
the
findings
will
be
presented
to
the
Committee
on
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
in
the
House
and
Senate
every
year
for
the
next
five
years.
The
study&#8217;s
findings
will
allow
Congress
to
make
improvements
to
these
programs
and
more
efficiently
spend
taxpayer
dollars.
Congress
has
a
duty
to
provide
our
veterans
with
the
best
employment
services
possible.
We
can&#8217;t
just
authorize
these
programs
and
hope
they
work;
we
have
to
follow
up
and
ensure
that
they
are
working
as
they
were
intended
to.
The
analysis
of
long-term
outcomes
is
precisely
the
type
of
oversight
Congress
needs
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
these
programs
and
to
ensure
long-term
success
for
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes.
They
deserve
nothing
less.
