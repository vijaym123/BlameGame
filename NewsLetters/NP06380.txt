Failure tonight IS NOT an option.
David, we use that phrase a lot, but there&rsquo;s a darn good reason: the Koch Brothers are ready to crush us if we miss a goal even ONE TIME between now and Election Day. Failure tonight IS a possibility.
So we know Boehner and the Kochs are going to salivate when we put this into writing:
we are in serious danger of missing tonight&rsquo;s goal.
