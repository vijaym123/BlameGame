How May I Serve You?
Dear San Franciscan,
It is a privilege to represent you and the people of San Francisco in Congress. My office is proud to provide assistance if you need help with a federal agency or the federal grants process, seek to tour DC landmarks, or are interested in youth opportunities in my office.
Have you experienced an unusual delay in the processing of your Department of Veterans Affairs benefits? Do you need assistance with your visa or passport application? If you are experiencing issues with a federal government agency that are not primarily related to legislation,
my office may be able to help . If you would like to make an appointment with a caseworker, please contact my district office at (415) 556-4862.
Please feel free to
forward this information to your family and friends . For additional information on resources provided by my office or to sign up for email updates,
please visit my website .
best regards,
This mailing was prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense
