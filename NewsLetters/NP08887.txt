Dear Friend,
On Tuesday, the House Committee on Appropriations voted to approve the
FY 15 Defense Appropriations bill, clearing the way for the full House
of Representatives to vote on the defense measure next week. As Vice
Chairwoman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, I voted in favor
of this appropriations bill, which includes support for vital defense
and aerospace programs built in Tarrant County.
The vote this week was a strong showing of national support for the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the V-22 Osprey and other programs vital to
our national security, and our allies, that are produced in North
Texas. These defense programs employ thousands of North Texans, and
they are a critical part of the defense industry hub that thrives here.
The House committee voted to support funding for 38 F-35 Joint Strike
Fighters for FY 15, an increase of four jets above the Administration's
FY 15 request. Due to sequestration, the Administration reduced the
number of planes they proposed to purchase in FY15. However, I fought
hard to add in the four additional aircraft. In order to reduce costs,
it is a priority to get the Joint Strike Fighter line to full rate
production as soon as possible.
The bill also funds 19 Bell Helicopter V-22 Ospreys. Additionally, the
bill provides funding to modernize the C-130 fleet; a program that is
important to the modernization of the 136th Airlift Wing based at the
Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base.
The Defense funding bill also includes a pay raise of 1.8 percent for
military personnel and fully funds cancer research, medical facility
upgrades and traumatic brain injury researching as well as adds funding
for suicide prevention programs for defense health and military family
programs.
The defense bill makes modernizing our military a priority as well as
ensuring our men and women in uniform are receiving the best health
care possible while serving our country. I believe this bill meets
those needs and will ensure our service members receive the support and
resources they need whether it's on the battlefield or at home.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
On
Tuesday,
the
House
Committee
on
Appropriations
voted
to
approve
the
FY
15
Defense
Appropriations
bill,
clearing
the
way
for
the
full
House
of
Representatives
to
vote
on
the
defense
measure
next
week.
As
Vice
Chairwoman
of
the
Defense
Appropriations
subcommittee,
I
voted
in
favor
of
this
appropriations
bill,
which
includes
support
for
vital
defense
and
aerospace
programs
built
in
Tarrant
County.
The
vote
this
week
was
a
strong
showing
of
national
support
for
the
F-35
Joint
Strike
Fighter,
the
V-22
Osprey
and
other
programs
vital
to
our
national
security,
and
our
allies,
that
are
produced
in
North
Texas.
These
defense
programs
employ
thousands
of
North
Texans,
and
they
are
a
critical
part
of
the
defense
industry
hub
that
thrives
here.
The
House
committee
voted
to
support
funding
for
38
F-35
Joint
Strike
Fighters
for
FY
15,
an
increase
of
four
jets
above
the
Administration&#8217;s
FY
15
request.
Due
to
sequestration,
the
Administration
reduced
the
number
of
planes
they
proposed
to
purchase
in
FY15.
However,
I
fought
hard
to
add
in
the
four
additional
aircraft.
In
order
to
reduce
costs,
it
is
a
priority
to
get
the
Joint
Strike
Fighter
line
to
full
rate
production
as
soon
as
possible.
The
bill
also
funds
19
Bell
Helicopter
V-22
Ospreys.
Additionally,
the
bill
provides
funding
to
modernize
the
C-130
fleet;
a
program
that
is
important
to
the
modernization
of
the
136th
Airlift
Wing
based
at
the
Naval
Air
Station
Fort
Worth
Joint
Reserve
Base.
The
Defense
funding
bill
also
includes
a
pay
raise
of
1.8
percent
for
military
personnel
and
fully
funds
cancer
research,
medical
facility
upgrades
and
traumatic
brain
injury
researching
as
well
as
adds
funding
for
suicide
prevention
programs
for
defense
health
and
military
family
programs.
The
defense
bill
makes
modernizing
our
military
a
priority
as
well
as
ensuring
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
receiving
the
best
health
care
possible
while
serving
our
country.
I
believe
this
bill
meets
those
needs
and
will
ensure
our
service
members
receive
the
support
and
resources
they
need
whether
it&#8217;s
on
the
battlefield
or
at
home.
