Policy Update
*	Senators King and Blunt introduced The Common Sense Nutrition
Disclosure Act
that would free grocery stores and other food establishments
from the burdens of a poorly interpreted menu-labeling regulation.
*	The Senate Intelligence Committee accepted an amendment
authored by myself and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), The Targeted Strike
Oversight Reform Act
, which would require that an independent alternative
analysis commonly referred to as a "red-term analysis" be conducted if
the government is considering the legality or use of targeted lethal
force against a known U.S. person.
