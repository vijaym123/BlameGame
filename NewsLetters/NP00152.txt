Please take this one-question instant poll immediately:
Do you support automatic voter registration for all Americans?
Yes! Let every voice be heard!
No. Voters should face some obstacles.
David -- Republicans continue to make it harder and harder for Americans to vote -- particularly for minorities, the elderly, and students. But Democrats are fighting back . Hillary Clinton has DEMANDED change, and House Democrats just introduced a bill that would automatically register Americans to vote.
It&rsquo;d be a historic breakthrough for voting rights. But we need you to record your opinion: TAKE THE ONE QUESTION SURVEY: Do you think that America should adopt automatic voter registration?
Thanks,
