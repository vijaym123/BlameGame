Greetings,
Tonight, President Obama in his State of the Union remarks spoke of more government, more taxes and more programs.
But as someone whose mom grew up in small town Kansas - who got her first real job at an airplane factory we all know so well on South Oliver Street in Wichita -- I want you to know that I heard you loud and clear in November.
And the Republican Party heard you too.
I hope that the President will work with us on what it is you are demanding from Washington, D.C.
You demanded that we be frugal.
You demanded that government get out of the way so that you can live your life the way you want to and raise your family the way you want to raise them.
You demanded fewer big government programs that deny the least amongst us that first job to get them on their way.
Its about people not programs.
I hope youll listen to my message below about what we in Kansas know works and what doesnt, and how I intend to work to achieve it as your Representative.
Senator Ernst talked about it in
her response to the Presidents speech
as well.
The American people demanded change in November.
We are going to work tirelessly to achieve that change, you can count on it.
Thanks for watching.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
