A Grateful Nation Gives Thanks
Here we find ourselves once
again preparing to celebrate Thanksgiving and gathering together to give thanks with family and friends. While it is true that our nation faces many
challenges today, we have so very much to be thankful for as Americans.
While we spend
time with loved ones, there are many men and women spending this holiday away from home today. I am thankful for the members of our Armed Forces, past
and present, who have sacrificed greatly in order to ensure a more free America. They know all too well what it is like to miss family gatherings and
cherished traditions.
I encourage you to remember these brave folks as well.
I am
also especially thankful for my family as well as the opportunity to serve the Sixth Congressional District. It is truly an honor to work for
you.
As a grateful nation, let us give thanks for the many blessings we enjoy.
God bless you all, and from my family to yours &ndash; Happy Thanksgiving.
Secret Service Lapses &quot;Devastating&quot;
At a recent House Judiciary Committee oversight
hearing, Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy called the security lapses that allowed an armed man to jump the fence and enter the White House
&ldquo;devastating.&rdquo; That is a sentiment I agree with wholeheartedly.
The Secret Service has two primary missions &ndash; criminal investigations and protection of the President, Vice President, and other
dignitaries. This is an extremely difficult, high-profile mission, for which there is no margin for error. However, recent incidents give me great
concern that the policies, procedures, and training at the Secret Service are not entirely up to the task.
In light of these events, the Judiciary Committee &ndash; which has primary jurisdiction over the Secret Service
&ndash; held an oversight hearing to carefully examine a series of security lapses. Given the vital role the Secret Service plays in the security of
the President and the White House, it is critical that Congress continue to investigate the agency&rsquo;s response to recent incidents and work with
the Service to make sure it fulfills its critical mission.
