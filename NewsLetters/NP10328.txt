Dear Friend,
For 30 years, the Emergency Medical Services for
Children (EMSC) Program has been the only federal program focused solely
on improving emergency care for children and adolescents.
It is
dedicated to ensuring emergency medical services (EMS) are able to meet
the unique needs of kids and teenagers, such as smaller medical
equipment or more limited doses of medication.
Children are not
little adults, and this is no more evident than in medical care.
In
a similar medical emergency,
children respond
differently than adults, and therefore require
and deserve
specialized
care .
Since its inception, the EMSC
program has dramatically improved the quality of emergency medical care for
our children.
EMSC funds are provided to
all
50 states and territories , to help educate, train, and certify
medical professionals in trauma care for children.
Additionally, the
funds ensure that proper medical equipment is on hand in ambulances
and in emergency rooms, and ultimately make certain that the full
spectrum of emergency medical care is available to children no matter where
they live, attend school, or travel.
As a means of good governance, federal programs need to be renewed
every so often
typically every five years.
This allows
Congress to examine a program, adjust what needs fixing, or terminate what
is not working.
The EMSC program is no exception
it too needs
to be continued.
Given this programs success in improving the
child care, and saving the lives of some of our most vulnerable
citizens, I was proud to introduce legislation that would make certain that
EMSC will continue to play a vital role in ensuring our children receive
the best care in hospitals and emergency care centers.
My bipartisan bill, H.R.4290, the Wakefield Act, has also
been
introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator
Orrin Hatch,
in the U.S. Senate.
Our bills have been endorsed
by the Utah Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
Intermountain Healthcare, and Primary Childrens Hospital in Salt Lake
City.
This is a program that is worth continuing, and I am proud to put
forth legislation to do so.
I
am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like
yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing from you
on current topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please let me know areas you find especially interesting or where I can
provide you with additional information.
I value your ideas and
look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th
