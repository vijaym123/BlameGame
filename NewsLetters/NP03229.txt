Dear Friends,
Recently, a new Congress was
sworn into office with the promise and expectation of working together
to find solutions to some of our nations biggest issues.
With
the
Hire More Heroes Act of 2015 , the first piece of
legislation passed by the House of Representatives this year, my colleagues and
I approved a responsible jobs-creation bill and helped provide more
opportunities to those who have sacrificed so much for our
country.
Rather than helping our heroes, Obamacare penalizes those who
have served our nation.
As it currently stands, Obamacare
requires small businesses with at least 50 full time employees to provide
health insurance for those employees, even if some of those employees
are already insured under another healthcare plan. This includes
millions of veterans who are already covered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs or TRICARE.
As a sad consequence, many businesses
that would be willing to help our soldiers get back on their feet once
theyve returned home from their courageous service, may be discouraged
from hiring.
My husband, Dexter, served in Vietnam as a
U.S. Army Ranger, earning a Purple Heart. Currently Marine Reservists, my
step-son, Doug, and daughter-in-law, Lindsay, served our nation as
Marine officers in Iraq and Lindsay also served in Afghanistan.
Because of their service, I know all too well the sacrifices made by
those who have served in our military.
It is our duty to do
everything in our power to help veterans start a successful life and career
after they return home.
The
Hire More Heroes Act,
achieves exactly that goal.
This bill would provide small businesses
with an incentive to expand and hire those who have served our nation
by allowing them to bypass Obamacares regulations when hiring
veterans.
Finally, this bill marks the beginning of the Houses efforts
in 2015 to rid small businesses of the burdensome limitations placed
on them by Obamacare, and to once and for all speed up the economic
recovery of our nation that has languished under the Administrations
bureaucratic red tape and regulations.
Hiring veterans
should be of paramount importance for our nations businesses.
This commonsense piece of legislation not only provides small businesses
with much needed relief, it also empowers our veterans with
specialized skills by making it easier for them to navigate a very difficult
job market.
This bill truly shows our appreciation to those who
have served our nation honorably and worked to protect our
freedoms.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
