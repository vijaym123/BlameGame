Dear Friends,
Time is running out to vote for your &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; in this year&rsquo;s Congressional Art Competition.
Students from across the district submitted their artwork for a chance to win a $200 gift card for art supplies and an opportunity to have their painting displayed in our district office or in a city facility in their home city.
You can help me pick a &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; by voting online!
There are two ways to vote- you can visit my
website
or my
Facebook
page.
The &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; winner, along with other category winners, will be announced at a reception on Thursday, May 15, 2014 at the Pico Rivera Centre for the Arts from 5-7 PM. To RSVP, please call (562) 450-0968.
Hurry and cast your vote today! Voting for the &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; ends tomorrow!
Sincerely,
Linda T. S&aacute;nchez
Member of Congress
