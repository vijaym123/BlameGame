Congressman Lamborn Strengthens Charter
Schools
5/13/14
Recently, Congressman Doug Lamborn
voted for H.R. 10, the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter
Schools Act. The bill strengthens the charter school program across
the nation by enhancing opportunities for choice, innovation, and
excellence in education. The bill passed by a bipartisan majority of 360 to
45.
"As a long time
supporter of greater school choice and bringing the educational decisions
closer to the parents and teachers at the local level, I was pleased to
support H.R. 10. The bill will help bolster state efforts to develop
and expand charter schools. It is a good thing any time that Congress
can encourage that educational decisions be made at the state and
local level. I will continue to champion local education control at every
turn."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
