Boehner is PANICKING!
New Polls Show Republicans Could Lose On Their Home Turf!!!
David -- Boehner&rsquo;s eyes must have popped out of their sockets when he saw this: The latest polls show we can defeat some of the worst Tea Party Republicans in the country.
And we&rsquo;re not just talking about the traditional battlegrounds&hellip; we can defeat Republicans in deep-red Arkansas, West Virginia, and Nebraska!
But we&rsquo;re not the only ones who&rsquo;ve seen these shocking polls&hellip; New reports show Boehner&rsquo;s dumping millions of dollars to salvage these must-win races.
We can&rsquo;t let Boehner buy his way out of this now.
So here the deal: it&rsquo;s going to cost another $335,OOO to fight Boehner&rsquo;s attacks and get out enough votes to pull off a shocking upset.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO

Wonder why voters in these traditionally red states are abandoning the Republicans? It&rsquo;s simple.
Voters are FED UP with Republicans that put the Koch Brothers&rsquo; wish list before the needs of regular folks.
And thanks to your support, we&rsquo;ve been able to remind millions of voters exactly how the Republicans have sold out the middle class time and time again. But right now, we need you more than ever. We have just 24 hours before the final week ad buy deadline of this entire election.
