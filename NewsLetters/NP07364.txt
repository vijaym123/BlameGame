Veterans reforms await Obama signature
Veterans in the Northern Marianas may be better off as a result of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 , which Congress passed this week and which now awaits the Presidents signature. At my request, House and Senate conferee included a provision for veterans, such as those on Rota and Tinian, who have to travel by air to reach a Veterans Affairs medical facility, to obtain care from qualified non-VA providers instead. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will have 90 days after the Act is signed to implement this new program and to issue a special Veterans Choice Card for eligible veterans to use at non-VA providers. This provision is part of the larger response to the unacceptable difficulties and long waits for care that veterans have faced. The bill authorizes $10 billion in emergency funding for a new program to provide care and choice to veterans who have waited more than 30 days for an appointment or who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility. The bill also expands VA authority to provide care and services to military service members who are victims of sexual assault, and provides $5 billion in funding to hire more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel and to improve VAs infrastructure. And H.R.3230
increases accountability by authorizing the VA Secretary to terminate or demote senior executives for misconduct or poor job performance. We cannot forget those who have served their nation.

Congratulations to the first graduates of the American Hotel & Lodging Educational Institutes Skills, Tasks and Results Training (START) in the Northern Marianas. The students earned a widely recognized certificate by completing 180 hours of training in front desk, reservations, housekeeping, and other aspects of a lodging operation. They also spent time with persons in the hotel industry, as they went about their daily work. Making this connection between classroom learning and real world work experience is one of the strengths of START. Well done, Latte Training Academy, Island Training Solutions, PSS, and graduates!
NOAA wants public input to tackle illegal fishing
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is soliciting comments from stakeholders to help develop a plan to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Foreign vessels have been caught fishing illegally within the exclusive economic zone surrounding the Northern Mariana Islands, which undermines economic opportunities for legitimate fishermen in the Mariana Islands and can damage fish stocks. President Obama established a task force, co-chaired by the Departments of State and Commerce, to recommend a comprehensive framework for addressing IUU fishing. And NOAA will be holding a series of webinars, teleconferences, and public meetings throughout August to highlight the issue and encourage public input. Written comments are due September 2 and can be submitted electronically through the Federal e-rulemaking portal .

Sister Martha Ramarui retired this week as principal of Sister Remedios Early Childhood Development Center, where she guided the education of our youth for ten years. 2014 is Sister Marthas twentieth year as an educator in Micronesia and her sixtieth year as a Mercedarian Missionary of Berriz. To mark these milestones in her life and career I presented Sister Martha with a Congressional Commendation. Thank you, Sister, for all you have done and continue to do in service to our community.
Obamacare is still helping NMI seniors
Just like the rest of Americans, seniors in the Northern Marianas are getting help paying for prescription drugs as a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The Department of Health and Human Services has released new data , showing that 14 Medicare beneficiaries in the NMI, who fall in the so-called donut hole, have received an average of $660 so far this year to help pay for their medicines. The donut hole is the gap between regular Medicare Part D drug coverage and catastrophic coverage. Obamacare will close the gap completely by 2020; and in the meantime seniors in the donut hole are receiving extra assistance to pay for their medicines. Medicare beneficiaries in the Marianas have gotten a total of $53,214, according to HHS. This benefit will continue despite the recent decision by the Department that certain Obamacare requirements for insurance do not apply in the U.S. territories.

Senate Appropriators approve 1.5% set asides for water and sewer funds
The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 1.5 percent set-aside of water and sewer funds for the insular areas in its fiscal year 2015 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill
released on Friday. The House Appropriations Committee
approved my request for the same 1.5 percent set-aside in July. This is about five times more than the insular set-aside in current law; and we have been successful at getting the increase every year since fiscal 2010. The result
some $44 million for the Northern Marianas alone
has made it possible for the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation to get 24/7 water to Saipan consumers 95 percent of the time. A complete list of the CUC projects that this new money has funded was included in the Report to Constituents, which I mailed to all registered voters in the Northern Marianas in May. The Senate Appropriations bill today also recommended $150 million more for the water program and $500 million more for sewers than its House counterpart. And the Senate bill provided funding for BEACH grants, which House appropriators zeroed out. The NMI received a $293,000 grant in fiscal 2014, which EPA administers to help with beach monitoring. The Senate added about $1.3 million to the account for technical assistance to territories, as well. All of these differences will need to be resolved and finalized, when Congress returns to work in September and before the October 1 beginning of fiscal 2015.
