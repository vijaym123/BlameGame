CNN: President Barack Obama slammed Republican senators
David -- President Obama just ripped apart Senate Republicans who sent a letter to Iran undermining his negotiations.
Good for him.
The Republicans&rsquo; decision to align with Iranian hardliners over the President of the United States is unforgivable. We want to back up President Obama and make sure Republicans never live this disaster down.
That means we need $50,000 in our Republican Accountability Fund. This is your last chance before our deadline at MIDNIGHT.
President Obama NEEDS YOU in this moment -- will you stand with him?
