Dear Friends,
I hope you had a wonderful
Christmas and Happy New Year. In an effort to keep you more informed during
the 114 th
Congress, I will be sending out my e-newsletter
more frequently. I hope you find it helpful and informative. Thank you;
its a true honor to represent you in the U.S.
Congress.
Your
Congressman,
Chris
Stewart
For the first time in eight years the Republicans control both
the House and Senate. With this new American Congress, Republicans
will be in a better position to not only stop President Obamas
overreaching, big government agenda but have a real opportunity to work for the
American people by passing legislation to spur economic growth while
reducing the size and scope of the federal
government.
The House wasted no time getting to work. Here is what
we did in the first week:
1. Defunded the
Presidents Executive Amnesty
Watch me
debate the bill on the House Floor:
2. Approved the
building of the Keystone
Pipeline
3. Passed the Hire More Heroes
Act
Incentives our employers to hire more of our
veterans
4. Re-established the 40 hour work week as
fulltime

the video
below where
I discuss why this is so important
Now is the time for the Senate to act on this meaningful
legislation and send it to the President.
We are in a battle for the heart
and soul of this nation. Like you, I am tired of the gridlock in
Washington, which is why I have set forth an aggressive policy agenda for
the next few months. Stay tuned for more good things to come out of
the Peoples House.
