Congratulating Prime Minister
Netanyahu
3/18/15
Following yesterday's Israeli elections, Congressman
Doug Lamborn issued the following
statement:
"I would like to congratulate Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for winning the trust of the Israeli voters for a
third consecutive term. Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle
East. Only the people of Israel, and no outside factors, elect their
leadership. PM Netanyahu is a true and courageous leader, and has
always been an advocate for strong U.S.
Israel partnership and
friendship. Both America and Israel will face many challenges in coming years
and I would encourage the Prime Minister to remember the scripture of
Joshua 1:9 'Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be
discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you
go.'"
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
