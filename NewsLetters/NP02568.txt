Attacking Social Security, Obamacare, and abortion rights
Trying to
shut down

Honestly, the Republican-led House and Senate have been even more destructive than we thought they would be. And what&rsquo;s worse --
if the GOP takes over Congress
and
the White House, they&rsquo;ll be unstoppable.

need you to renew your membership.
