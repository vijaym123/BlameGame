Friend,
Fifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced the creation of Head Start, a comprehensive school development program aimed at serving disadvantaged preschool children in communities across the country.
This act affirmed the importance of quality childhood development education and ensured that children receive the care and education necessary to build a successful future, regardless of race or socioeconomic level.
Rep. Cartwright visits with students at Easton's Head Start Program.
Since its inception in 1965, Head Start has served over 30 million children and is now present in all fifty states offering a variety of educational options.
The importance of Head Start cannot be underestimated, as studies show that children not involved in an early childhood program are five times more likely to be arrested by age 27.
Children enrolled in Head Start experience significant, immediate improvements in reading levels and cognitive thinking skills, both of which are vital to success in elementary and secondary education.
I believe that one of the greatest investments this country can make is in our youth, and Head Start is of paramount importance in the development of our youth.
Throughout my time as your congressman, I have visited Head Start locations throughout northeastern Pennsylvania, observing first-hand the positive effects of the program.
I will remain dedicated to the continuation of Head Start, advocating for more funding and support for this vital and necessary program.
Sincerely,
