Dear
Friends,
I'm pleased to announce the first annual congressional
science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) academic competition. The
House Student App Challenge
in the 18th Congressional
District is designed to engage the creativity of students and encourage their
participation in STEM education fields. Established by the U.S. House
of Representatives in 2013, this competition is a nationwide event
that invites students from across the country to compete by creating and
exhibiting their software application, or "app," for mobile, tablet,
or computer devices on a platform of their choice.
The
competition begins on Saturday, February 1, 2014, and ends on Wednesday,
April 30, 2014. Students entering the competition must provide a
YouTube or VIMEO video demo explaining their app and what they learned
through the competition process by the April 30, 2014
deadline.
The submitted apps will be judged by an appointed panel of
individuals within the academic, software and entrepreneurial fields. The
winning student's app in each participating congressional district will
be featured on the website of the U.S. House of Representatives
(StudentAppChallenge.house.gov) and will be displayed in a U.S. Capitol
exhibit. Additional details on the
House Student App Challenge
will be announced in the coming weeks, with information provided on my
website at:
http://eshoo.house.gov/house-student-app-challenge .
As one of the national Co-Chairs of the
competition, I hope you will participate in this exciting event. Should
you have any questions regarding the competition and the rules, you can
call my district office at
408-245-2339/650-323-2984/831-335-2020.
I look forward to see many great entries!
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
