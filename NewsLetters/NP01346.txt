Tax Day Update 2015
Did you know Americans spend more than 7.6 billion hours filing their taxes each year? It makes sense because our tax code is 4 million words long. We need a fairer, simpler tax code that benefits all taxpayers. Unfortunately, instead of simplifying our tax code, this administration has only made it more complicated through policies like Obamacare which added 3,300 pages of regulations, rulings, notices, and procedures.
This tax season the House Republicans have passed bills to reign in the IRS by ensuring taxpayers know your right to privacy and right to a fair and just tax system through the
Taxpayers' Bill of Rights Act
and
preventing the IRS from targeting individuals
based on their religious or political affiliations.
Additionally, if you're having trouble with the IRS, my office can help. Give my Champaign office a call at 217-403-4690.
Preparing for Tornado Season
Reps. Davis and Shimkus tour Gifford, Ill.
Earlier this month, Congressman John Shimkus and I toured Gifford, Ill., one of the towns severely damaged by the Nov. 2013 tornadoes, and met with town leaders about the need to reform FEMA's disaster declaration process so small towns in large states like Illinois are not unfairly penalized.
I am pleased to report that as members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congresswoman Bustos and I were successful in
including language in the FEMA reauthorization bill , which passed unanimously out of committee, that will make this process more fair.
We are in the middle of storm season in Illinois and it's important to be prepared in the event of a disaster.
Our office has prepared this
disaster resource document
in case your town is impacted by a disaster.
As always, my staff and I are here to help so feel free to reach out to any of my offices if you need assistance.
Urging the VA to Close Choice Program Loophole
Despite passing legislation into law last Congress which enhances health care for veterans by allowing some to access private care, many veterans are still having to drive long distances or experiencing delayed care because of how the VA is interpreting the law. The VA has recently announced it will clarify that 40-miles from a medical facility refers to driving distance rather than as the crow flies, which is how the VA has been interpreting the law but other problems still remain.
My office continues to hear from veterans who have to drive further than 40 miles because the VA facility near them does not offer the care they need. Congressman Bost and I sent a
letter urging Secretary Robert McDonald to further clarify
that a medical facility refers to only one that provides the type of care the veteran is seeking. To me this is a commonsense change that the VA should be able to make without further clarification from Congress but I will continue to support any measure necessary to improve access to care for veterans.
In the meantime, if you're a veteran who is having problems with the VA, my office can help. Give our Champaign office a call at 217-403-4690.
