March 9, 2014
Dear Friend,
This Congress must no longer do nothing on the important issues that
face our nation, including immigration reform or initiatives on jobs
and the economy. On the topic of immigration reform, the system is
broken and needs to be fixed because it is the moral and fiscally
responsible thing to do. Industry after industry has agreed that
immigrants are a large part of the engine that keeps the economy going.
It is my hope that both sides of the aisle can come together and work
on this as a collective and responsible body. Last week, I spoke on the
floor of the House of Representatives about the need for comprehensive
immigration reform and the contributions immigrants have made to our
country. Keeping the momentum going on this vital issue is necessary to
engage people from all walks of life, all interests, and all political
backgrounds to call for immigration reform. I encourage you to check it
out below:
Budget Season Kicks Off with President's Budget Request Unveiling
This week, President Obama released his budget request for fiscal year
2015, kicking off the budget conversations for this upcoming fiscal
year where Congress sets into motion what gets funded by the
government.
The President's budget request prioritizes measures to
assist in job creation for hard-working folks, improve and expand
educational opportunities for students, and strengthen our economy.
San Antonians would benefit from the budget proposal:
*
$100 million for Promise Neighborhoods, including the East
Side of San Antonio, to help step up local efforts to beat back poverty
by improving housing, education opportunities and public safety.
*	$1.3 billion in grants to Texas schools with high percentages
of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children
meet state academic standards.
*	$302 billion infrastructure proposal that will be fully paid
for by existing funds and could modernize our San Antonio roads and
bridges.
The President's budget aims to cement the end of the damaging
across-the-board sequester cuts. As Congress begins the process of
combing through the President's request and setting actual funding
amounts, we must remain mindful that hardworking Americans are
protected.
This means ensuring we don't balance the budget on the
backs of our servicemembers and veterans or our most vulnerable folks,
like seniors and children.
Latino Enrollment Week
Last week marked Latino Enrollment Week, a nationwide push to ensure
that Latinos who are eligible to enroll in a healthcare plan under the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) have the information and resources they need
to choose a healthcare plan that is best for them and their families.
1 in 4 uninsured people in the United States who are eligible for
healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act are Latino.
That's
more than 10 million Latinos around our country who have the
opportunity to get quality, affordable healthcare coverage.
This is especially important in Texas.
Nearly 4 in 10 Texas Latinos do
not have health insurance.
Access to affordable, quality health
insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act is already giving
millions of Americans peace of mind.
If you have not done so already,
there is still time to enroll in a coverage plan.
I encourage you to
check out your options for affordable, quality healthcare insurance
before the March 31stenrollment deadline.
Here are some helpful resources:
*	Deadline to Enroll in Open Marketplace: March 31st
*	For more information on the Affordable Care Act, to enroll in a
plan, or find local assistance:
*	Online at: Healthcare.gov
or

Recognizing Outstanding Texas Teachers
I had the privilege of welcoming Northside ISD science teacher, Kent
Page, and Grapevine-Colleyville ISD math teacher, Wendy Hendry, to the
Capitol this week.
They are the Texas recipients of the Presidential
Award in Excellence in Math and Science Teaching.
The award is considered the highest recognition in the country that a
K-12 mathematics or science teacher can receive for teaching.
As Congress begins to move through the process of setting the budget
for next year, I remain committed to ensuring it provides necessary
funding for initiatives that are important to San Antonio, helps grow
the middle class, and keeps our economy on the path for prosperity.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Avoid
tables

more
than

Dear
Friend,
This
Congress
must
no
longer
do
nothing
on
the
important
issues
that
face
our
nation,
including
immigration
reform
or
initiatives
on
jobs
and
the
economy.
On
the
topic
of
immigration
reform,
the
system
is
broken
and
needs
to
be
fixed
because
it
is
the
moral
and
fiscally
responsible
thing
to
do.
Industry
after
industry
has
agreed
that
immigrants
are
a
large
part
of
the
engine
that
keeps
the
economy
going.
It
is
my
hope
that
both
sides
of
the
aisle
can
come
together
and
work
on
this
as
a
collective
and
responsible
body.
Last
week,
I
spoke
on
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Representatives
about
the
need
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
the
contributions
immigrants
have
made
to
our
country.
Keeping
the
momentum
going
on
this
vital
issue
is
necessary
to
engage
people
from
all
walks
of
life,
all
interests,
and
all
political
backgrounds
to
call
for
immigration
reform.
I
encourage
you
to
check
it
out
below:
Budget
Season
Kicks
Off
with
President&#8217;s
Budget
Request
Unveiling
This
week,
President
Obama
released
his
budget
request
for
fiscal
year
2015,
kicking
off
the
budget
conversations
for
this
upcoming
fiscal
year
where
Congress
sets
into
motion
what
gets
funded
by
the
government.
The
President&#8217;s
budget
request
prioritizes
measures
to
assist
in
job
creation
for
hard-working
folks,
improve
and
expand
educational
opportunities
for
students,
and
strengthen
our
economy.
San
Antonians
would
benefit
from
the
budget
proposal:
$100
million
for
Promise
Neighborhoods,
including
the
East
Side
of
San
Antonio,
to
help
step
up
local
efforts
to
beat
back
poverty
by
improving
housing,
education
opportunities
and
public
safety. $1.3
billion
in
grants
to
Texas
schools
with
high
percentages
of
children
from
low-income
families
to
help
ensure
that
all
children
meet
state
academic
standards. $302
billion
infrastructure
proposal
that
will
be
fully
paid
for
by
existing
funds
and
could
modernize
our
San
Antonio
roads
and
bridges.
The
President&#8217;s
budget
aims
to
cement
the
end
of
the
damaging
across-the-board
sequester
cuts.
As
Congress
begins
the
process
of
combing
through
the
President&#8217;s
request
and
setting
actual
funding
amounts,
we
must
remain
mindful
that
hardworking
Americans
are
protected.
This
means
ensuring
we
don&#8217;t
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
our
servicemembers
and
veterans
or
our
most
vulnerable
folks,
like
seniors
and
children.
Latino
Enrollment
Week
Last
week
marked
Latino
Enrollment
Week ,
a
nationwide
push
to
ensure
that
Latinos
who
are
eligible
to
enroll
in
a
healthcare
plan
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
have
the
information
and
resources
they
need
to
choose
a
healthcare
plan
that
is
best
for
them
and
their
families.
1
in
4
uninsured
people
in
the
United
States
who
are
eligible
for
healthcare
coverage
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
are
Latino.
That&#8217;s
more
than
10
million
Latinos
around
our
country
who
have
the
opportunity
to
get
quality,
affordable
healthcare
coverage.
This
is
especially
important
in
Texas.
Nearly
4
in
10
Texas
Latinos
do
not
have
health
insurance.
Access
to
affordable,
quality
health
insurance
coverage
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
giving
millions
of
Americans
peace
of
mind .
If
you
have
not
done
so
already,
there
is
still
time
to
enroll
in
a
coverage
plan.
I
encourage
you
to
check
out
your
options
for
affordable,
quality
healthcare
insurance
before
the
March
31 st enrollment
deadline.
Here
are
some
helpful
resources:

Recognizing
Outstanding

I
had
the
privilege
of
welcoming
Northside

science
teacher,
Kent
Page,
and
Grapevine-Colleyville
ISD
math
teacher,
Wendy
Hendry,
to
the

this
week.
They
are
the
Texas
recipients
of
the
Presidential

in

The
award
is
considered
the
highest
recognition
in
the
country
that
a
K-12
mathematics
or
science
teacher
can
receive
for
teaching.
As
Congress
begins
to
move
through
the
process
of
setting
the
budget
for
next
year,
I
remain
committed
to
ensuring
it
provides necessary
funding
for
initiatives
that
are
important
to
San
Antonio,
helps
grow
the
middle
class,
and
keeps
our
economy
on
the
path
for
prosperity.

Member
