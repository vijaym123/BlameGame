Carper's Connection

Dear Friend,
Delaware is a buzz as 90,000 people from all over the country
and the
world
make their way to Dover this week for the Firefly Music
Festival. Last Monday, I sat down with event organizers and got a
behind-the-scenes lo
ok at the manpower
much of it local
that it takes to put on an
event like this one. From my early days as a concert promoter at Ohio
state, I've always been a music lover, so it was exciting to see the
festival coming together, and to learn about the impact events like
this have on our local economy. According to a University of Delaware
Study, Firefly added $68 million to the local economy last year alone.
Right on the heels of Firefly is the Big Barrel Country Music Festival,
followed by many great music events happening up and down the state.
Delaware is known for its first-class beaches and tax-free shopping,
but it is also developing a niche as a great destination to see live
music. From the Freeman Stage in the south to the Queen Theatre up
north, Delaware has amazing venues
some of them more than a hundred
years old and full of history
to see a live show. Recently, I
convened a group of representatives from all of the live music venues
in Delaware in Dover to discuss ways they can work together and bring
great acts to Delaware. This group is in its infancy, but I hope to
build this coalition of stakeholders so we can better enhance
Delawares reputation as an arts and entertainment destination now and
in the future. All ideas are welcomed, and feel free to contact me
