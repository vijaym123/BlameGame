David -- we won&rsquo;t sugarcoat this. We&rsquo;re in serious trouble. And we need your help.
Voters are getting inundated with Obama-bashing Republican attacks
And now, the Koch Brothers have dropped ANOTHER $1.8 million in to our key races
We are almost out of time to close this fundraising gap
David, there&rsquo;s no time left. If we don&rsquo;t fight back now, we&rsquo;ll have zero shot on Election Day. To fight back, we are unlocking the triple-match for ONE DAY only. President Obama&rsquo;s final two years in office are at stake, so please take advantage of this today!
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
It&rsquo;s going to take a herculean effort to close this gap. But if everyone who receives this email chips in one more time today, we can get back on track and hand Boehner a painful loss this November. Please -- chip in whatever you can today.
1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: We&rsquo;ll triple-match your support if you donate today: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
