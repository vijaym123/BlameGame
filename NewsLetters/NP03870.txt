Friends,
As we reach the end of this year and begin to plan for what's to come,
I would like to extend an invitation to you and your family to visit
Washington, DC, and to join me for an open house at the start of the
new Congress.
We will be hosting the open house on Tuesday, January 6, 2015 from
11AM-12:30PM in my Washington Office, located at 167 Russell Senate
Office Building, Washington, DC 20510.
I am excited to open my office for you and your family to join me and
my staff for some Southern hospitality and great conversations in our
nation's capital.
We will be welcoming South Carolinians for some real
sweet tea, coffee, hot cocoa, and light refreshments.
If you are able to join us or would just like more information, please
give us a call toll-free at (855) 425-6324.
I hope to see you there!
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
