Thanksgiving Day Statement
2013
Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05) issued the
following statement to commemorate Thanksgiving 2013:
"My family and I
are thankful for all of our many blessings. Foremost among those
blessings are life and liberty. We are blessed to live in a land of great
wealth and even greater opportunity. I am greatful for our form of
government that llows its citizens to select their leaders and choose their
destiny.
We are one nation under God and we thank Him for
our freedom and prosperity. We also thank our men and women of the armed
forces for the sacrafices they make daily to protect our freedom. May
God bless them and their families in this time of
war.
This
Thanksgiving many Americans are struggling fincancially. They want to
know why the government continues to grow, while the private sector
shrinks. We are on an unsustainable course, which I am committed to
reversing. While we are thankful for the blessing of living in this great
nation, we are mindful that we must reduce government spending in
order to restore our financial health.
I believe better
times are ahead for our great nation. I am greatful to all the people of
Colorado's Fifth Congressional District for the honor of representing
you in Congress. May each of you have a wonderful Thanksgiving!"
-- Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
