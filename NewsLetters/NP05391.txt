David -- the Koch Brothers plan on spending $300 million during this election.
This is just the third election since
Citizens United
opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate cash in our elections. And guess what? The Koch Brothers are taking full advantage of it: Spending in this midterm election is set to be the highest in U.S. history.
Right now, Democrats in Congress are working to end the insidious influence of secret money in politics. But they need our help. We need 25O,OOO people to add their name and demand an end to
Citizens United . This is the right thing to do. Will you add your name? http://action.dccc.org/big-money-out-of-politics
