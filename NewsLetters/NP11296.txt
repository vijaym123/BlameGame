Common Sense Budget Cuts
Tomorrow I will be testifying before the House Budget Committee
on how we can rein in spending and make the government more
accountable to taxpayers. You can watch live
at 1:00 pm CDT.
With $17 trillion in debt, it's never been more important to control
spending and balance our budget.
I've made a commitment to you that
I'll do everything in my power to make sure the government isn't
wasting your hard-earned tax dollars.
Here are some common sense
reforms I'm proposing to bring us closer to a balanced budget:
*	The Government Printing Office received nearly $80 million in
FY2014 to print rules, regulations, and reports that could all have
simply been published online.
If we reduce their budget by 50%, we can
encourage online publication and save $40 million this year.
*	The Senate offers lifestyle coaching to their staff to teach
employees how to reduce stress. Cutting this program would save nearly
$2 million.
*	Amtrak operates at a loss every single year, at taxpayer
expense.
Defunding its operating account would save $340 million.
But
if we defund both their operating and capital expenses, we could save
$1.4 billion, and encourage Amtrak to operate only in those areas of
the country where it is profitable.
*	States are using increased funding for the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, to game the system and trigger
more federal payments for nutrition assistance, despite reforms
included in the Farm Bill to prevent just that.
If we return LIHEAP to
FY2013 funding levels, we will save money and prevent abuse of this
system.
*	Finally, with more than 400,000 veterans waiting for their
cases to be processed, it's inexcusable that VA employees continue to
receive performance-based bonuses.
Until the VA backlog of cases is
reduced by 50%, we should eliminate all employee bonuses.
National Ag Day
Tomorrow, March 25th, is National Agriculture Day
.
It's a day set aside to honor the importance of American farming
and ranching, and help us reconnect to the producers that grow our food
and fiber.
Most of us are lucky enough to be able to purchase a wide
variety of fresh food at our local grocery store, and the dependable
quantity, safety, and affordability of our food allows us to take it
for granted.
A few bad seasons can put a farmer out of business, and
once we lose that production, we usually can't get it back.
America
needs to maintain the capability to feed our own country so we aren't
hit by huge swings in food prices the way we are by energy prices.
That's why it's important that we provide a safety net for producers in
the form of a Farm Bill.
Most producers rely on crop insurance to help protect against losses.
Generally, plans kick in after a farmer pays a 30% deductible.
I
authored the CROP Act
-a market-based plan to let
farmers insure themselves against smaller losses, so they only have to
take a 14% hit before their coverage kicks in.
The CROP Act had wide
bipartisan support, and was included in the final Farm Bill
as an efficient way to help our producers
manage risk.
I'm proud to support our farmers and ranchers, and
tomorrow, on National Ag Day, I hope you'll join me in thanking our
producers for all they do for our country.
Supreme Court to Hear Religious Freedom Case Tomorrow
Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear a landmark case
involving
Obamacare's violation of religious freedom.
Hobby Lobby and Conestoga
Wood are taking a stand before the highest court in the land against
the mandate that requires all companies to provide coverage for
sterilization, contraception, and abortifacient services.
They're
fighting for businesses across the nation that have to choose between
crippling fines (up to $36,500 per employee each year) or dropping all
health coverage for their employees.
They want to provide good
coverage - just not the type of coverage that goes against their
beliefs.
No one should ever have to violate his or her conscience to comply with
the law.
That's why I signed an amicus brief
to the Court in support of
Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood's case.
I've also cosponsored two bills
in Congress to clarify abortion coverage under Obamacare
and to allow providers to deny
coverage
that goes against their
beliefs.
I hope the Court takes a similar stand tomorrow.

Common
Sense
Budget
Cuts
Tomorrow
I
will
be
testifying
before
the
House
Budget
Committee
on
how
we
can
rein
in
spending
and
make
the
government
more
accountable
to
taxpayers.
You
can
watch
live
at
1:00
pm
CDT.
With
$17
trillion
in
debt,
it&#8217;s
never
been
more
important
to
control
spending
and
balance
our
budget.
I&#8217;ve
made
a
commitment
to
you
that
I&#8217;ll
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
sure
the
government
isn&#8217;t
wasting
your
hard-earned
tax
dollars.
Here
are
some
common
sense
reforms
I&#8217;m
proposing
to
bring
us
closer
to
a
balanced
budget: The
Government
Printing
Office
received
nearly
$80
million
in
FY2014
to
print
rules,
regulations,
and
reports
that
could
all
have
simply
been
published
online.
If
we
reduce
their
budget
by
50% ,
we
can
encourage
online
publication
and
save
$40
million
this
year.
The
Senate
offers
lifestyle
coaching
to
their
staff
to
teach
employees
how
to
reduce
stress.
Cutting
this
program
would
save
nearly
$2
million. Amtrak
operates
at
a
loss
every
single
year,
at
taxpayer
expense.
Defunding
its
operating
account
would
save
$340
million.
But
if
we
defund
both
their
operating
and
capital
expenses,
we
could
save
$1.4
billion,
and
encourage
Amtrak
to
operate
only
in
those
areas
of
the
country
where
it
is
profitable.
States
are
using
increased
funding
for
the
Low
Income
Home
Energy
Assistance
Program,
or
LIHEAP ,
to
game
the
system
and
trigger
more
federal
payments
for
nutrition
assistance,
despite
reforms
included
in
the
Farm
Bill
to
prevent
just
that.
If
we
return
LIHEAP
to
FY2013
funding
levels,
we
will
save
money
and
prevent
abuse
of
this
system. Finally,
with
more
than
400,000
veterans
waiting
for
their
cases
to
be
processed,
it&#8217;s
inexcusable
that
VA
employees
continue
to
receive
performance-based
bonuses.
Until
the
VA
backlog
of
cases
is
reduced
by
50%,
we
should
eliminate
all
employee
bonuses.
National
Ag
Day
Tomorrow,
March
25 th ,
is
National
Agriculture
Day .
It&#8217;s
a
day
set
aside
to
honor
the
importance
of
American
farming
and
ranching,
and
help
us
reconnect
to
the
producers
that
grow
our
food
and
fiber.
Most
of
us
are
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
purchase
a
wide
variety
of
fresh
food
at
our
local
grocery
store,
and
the
dependable
quantity,
safety,
and
affordability
of
our
food
allows
us
to
take
it
for
granted.
A
few
bad
seasons
can
put
a
farmer
out
of
business,
and
once
we
lose
that
production,
we
usually
can&#8217;t
get
it
back.
America
needs
to
maintain
the
capability
to
feed
our
own
country
so
we
aren&#8217;t
hit
by
huge
swings
in
food
prices
the
way
we
are
by
energy
prices.
That&#8217;s
why
it&#8217;s
important
that
we
provide
a
safety
net
for
producers
in
the
form
of
a
Farm
Bill.
Most
producers
rely
on
crop
insurance
to
help
protect
against
losses.
Generally,
plans
kick
in
after
a
farmer
pays
a
30%
deductible.
I
authored
the
CROP
Act &#8212;a
market-based
plan
to
let
farmers
insure
themselves
against
smaller
losses,
so
they
only
have
to
take
a
14%
hit
before
their
coverage
kicks
in.
The
CROP
Act
had
wide
bipartisan
support,
and
was
included
in
the
final
Farm
Bill
as
an
efficient
way
to
help
our
producers
manage
risk.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
support
our
farmers
and
ranchers,
and
tomorrow,
on
National
Ag
Day,
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
join
me
in
thanking
our
producers
for
all
they
do
for
our
country.
