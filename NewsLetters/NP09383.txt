Dear David,
On this Memorial Day
and during Military Appreciation Month, we thank our courageous
servicemembers for their selfless dedication in serving our
country.
I'm always grateful for the opportunity to visit with so many of
Missouri's servicemembers and veterans, and I enjoyed meeting several
WWII and Korean War veterans visiting their memorials in Washington,
D.C. through Missouri's Honor Flight program.
Please click
here to see photos from the Central Missouri Honor Flight.
Thank you to those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice to protect and preserve our freedoms. Let
us remember our fallen military heroes on this Memorial Day, and
every day.
I hope you will visit my
website , and continue to share your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
