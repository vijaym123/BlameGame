Dear Friend, The pundit class likes to think of Massachusetts as true blue. The party enrollment numbers, however, paint a different picture.
Here are Massachusetts&rsquo; party ID counts as of August 20, 2014:
Democratic: 1,509,269
Republican: 466,487
Unenrolled: 2,262,571 There are more independent, unenrolled voters in Massachusetts than Republicans and Democrats combined.
Independents count for more than 53% of Bay State voters, which only reinforces the fact that we have to be prepared for anything in this election. With so much at stake and the GOP just six seats away from a Senate majority, we need to build our grassroots network. Contribute $5, $10, or even $25 if you can before our FEC deadline on September 30.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Massachusetts independents truly vote for the person, not the party. Those independents are the reason why our House delegation is all Democrats, yet four of our last five governors were Republicans.
They&rsquo;re part of the reason why Democrats lost our Senate supermajority months before the Tea Party wave that took over the House. We need to reach independent voters while turning out our own supporters on Election Day. You can help by getting us $5 closer to our $145,000 goal for September.
Thank you.
