Dear
David,
With the
confirmation of a diagnosed Ebola case in Dallas, TX and that patients
subsequent death,
many of my constituents have expressed concerns
about the situation and possible threats the US may face. It is
important to understand how Ebola is spread,
precautions
you can take , and the ongoing efforts that the United States is
taking to stem the spread of this disease.
ABOUT
EBOLA:
Unlike many viral diseases, such as the
common cold, Ebola is not easily transmissible. Ebola is spread from
person to person only by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous
membranes such eyes, nose, or mouth) with the blood or bodily fluids of a
patient
experiencing
symptoms . The early symptoms include high fever (higher than
101.5F), severe headache, muscle pain, and weakness. Patients with
advanced infections may also experience diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
and unexplained bleeding or bruising. Symptoms may appear anywhere
from 2 to 21 days after exposure to Ebola, but the average is 8 to 10
days according to the
CDC .
Healthcare providers in the Rochester area have been
monitoring the situation
and have prepared a
brief
Q&amp;A .
ASSURANCES :
The current outbreak of Ebola is unprecedented
and illustrates how a lack of treatment options can lead to a
public health crisis. Preventing these disasters requires a strong
healthcare infrastructure, which includes robust support for basic research
funding to understand emerging diseases and development of new
treatments. Recent budget cuts, including sequestration and the government
shutdown, have deprived the NIH and CDC of the funds they need to combat
deadly diseases such as Ebola. Continued support for health research
and education is imperative to prevent future outbreaks, whether caused
by a new strain of a known virus, a currently unknown disease, or the
emergence of an antibiotic resistant
superbug.
To learn more about what the United States government is doing to
help stem the tide of this disease at home and abroad, read my
blog

Sincerely,
Louise M. Slaughter
