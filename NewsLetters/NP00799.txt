Dear
F riends,
This Memorial Day weekend, I&#8217;m renewing my vow to fight to ensure veterans and military families have the resources needed to thrive by reaffirming a basic pledge that just as our soldiers leave no one behind on the battlefield, we must
never leave our veterans behind at home.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m working with my colleagues to honor the indomitable courage and selfless sacrifice of veterans transitioning into civilian careers.
Nothing I did this week was as important as my vote supporting the Help Hire Our Heroes Act sponsored by Congresswoman Brownley, which would provide training resources for veterans who are seeking good-paying jobs.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, let me say on behalf of a grateful nation we salute our veterans&#8217; strength and service.

HISTORY PROJECT:
This Memorial Day start a new tradition -- connect with a veteran in our community and share their history with the
Library of Congress&#8217; Veterans History Project . These histories will be preserved at the Library of Congress so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war.
The Veterans History Project currently
has over 96,000 collections from veterans, but they need your help to continue to grow and document our veterans' experiences. Visit
www.loc.gov/vets
to browse the archives or learn more about how to get involved.
