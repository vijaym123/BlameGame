Dear David,
Today marks the four-year
anniversary of President Obama signing his health care takeover into
law.
Four years later, this flawed law has led to
canceled coverage
for millions of Americans,
higher premium s
for 11 million workers,
drastic
Medicare Advantage cuts
for up to 15
million seniors, and devastating
job losses
nationwide.
Despite the fact that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (Nev.) believes all ObamaCare horror stories are " untrue ," I hear from more Missourians every day about the
broken promises and
real-life consequences
of this
disastrous law for seniors, families, employers, and
workers.
I want to know how ObamaCare impacts you.
Click here to share your story.
I'll keep fighting to
stop the ObamaCare train wreck and replace it with common-sense health
care reforms that put patients and doctors in control of their health
care
not Washington.
I also welcome you to
share your thoughts and concerns on ObamaCare and other important issues
by visiting my
website
and
Facebook page , or sending me a
tweet

Sincere
regards,
