Dear Friends,
Like most Americans, I refuse to seriously believe that the IRS accidentally "lost" two years worth of e-mails from Lois Lerner and others related to the horrendous IRS targeting scandal.
Earlier today, my colleagues and I on the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing
with new IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to demand answers about this missing critical evidence. You can watch the video of my interaction with Mr. Koskinen
here .
At the time this scandal broke last year, even President Obama called the IRS's harassment of Americans for their political beliefs "outrageous." He said it was "inexcusable" and that "Americans are right to be angry about it." The White House promised full cooperation in getting to the bottom if it. But, of course, that was then. Now, the truth is being swept under the rug, if not outright deliberately destroyed. THIS MUST NOT STAND.
My colleagues and I will not stop our investigation until the full truth is exposed and every single person responsible for the IRS's outrageous actions is held fully accountable.
Again, if you believe you were ever unfairly intimidated or discriminated against by the IRS for your political affiliation, then I still urge you to share your important story with our Committee
here .
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Discusses
President Obama's
War on Coal, IRS Scandal on Fox Business
WATCH HERE
On Tuesday,
Rep. Kelly appeared on
Varney & Co.
on Fox Business Network to discuss his recently-introduced
Coal Country Protection Act , as well as the latest developments regarding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal.
Rep. Kelly on
President Obama's visit to Pittsburgh :
"While he's there, I'd like him to apologize to all our coal people. He's taking about the economy-there's nobody who's been worse for the economy and certainly nobody who's been worse for coal than this president and this administration."
"I would just wish that for the next two years he just keeps his hands off things. There's been too much breaking down for six years. Just keep your hands off stuff-let us recover."
On President Obama's war on coal:
" I was in the Long Run Mine yesterday , Stewart, talking to some of our miners and talking about our Coal Country Protection Act. I just think it's time for America to start pushing back on these things. These are not Republican issues, these are American issues. When we start killing coal, we start taking away from our economic recovery, when we start causing people to lose their jobs, electric rates to soar, the reliable delivery of electric to be interrupted, there's something wrong."
On the
Coal Country Protection Act :
"This is a bipartisan issue, and it's going to be bicameral also. What we're saying is, 'Hey, listen, just don't touch anything for a while. Run the traps on [the new EPA rules] first: Major job loss? You can't institute these rules. It's going to hold back our GDP and our recovery? You've got to hold back on these rules. If it's going to change our rates and let them skyrocket, and if it's going to affect the lower-income people, don't touch it. And if it comes down to the delivery of electric on a reliable basis, just stay away from it. We've got tests running on it, we're just saying to the EPA, 'Listen, just hold off til we run the traps. Let's make sure we don't have these famous unintended consequences that make it so tough for every American guy and gal."
On the IRS's
lost Lois Lerner e-mails :
"The public needs to be outraged, and I mean outraged. ... We can investigate, we can expose, [but] we don't have prosecutorial powers."
"The people still control this government. It's the only place on earth, Stewart, where the people actually have a voice and can weigh in on it. It is time for the American public to wake up and say, 'Enough is enough. We want answers from you people. We want them now.' And let's just push for all these answers and not let them squirm off the hook again."
"This has been a horrible six years for all of us. ... I've got friends on both sides of the aisle that are saying, 'Has the presidency ever been held in such low esteem than it is right now?' This man has taken it to a new low. It's time for the American people though-it's our government, it's our responsibility, it's our time, and it's not an option. We need to fight to get this back on track."
NOTE:
H.R. 4808 -
the Coal Country Protection Act
-- is a bipartisan bill, introduced by Rep. Kelly, to stop any new regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on America's power plants until the following four outcomes are guaranteed: 1.) No job losses; 2.) No loss in GDP/economic growth; 3.) No higher electric rates; 4). No interruption in energy delivery. The Senate companion to this bill is
being sponsored by
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
Rep. Kelly Appointed to
House
Education & Workforce Committee
Speaker Boehner appoints Rep. Kelly to fill seat vacated by Rep. Gowdy, current chair of Benghazi committee
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Thursday regarding his appointment by House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to the House Education and the Workforce Committee. Rep. Kelly will fill the seat of Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who is currently serving as chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, until the end of the 113th Congress. Rep. Kelly previously served on the Education and the Workforce Committee for the 112th Congress during his first term in the House.
"I am enormously honored to return to the Education and the Workforce Committee and sincerely appreciate the confidence and consideration by Speaker Boehner. In addition to my current work on the Ways and Means Committee, I look forward to working with Chairman Kline in the months ahead to ensure our nation's schools and workforce are as strong as can be."
Statement by Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN):
"I am delighted Representative Kelly will be rejoining the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mike is a powerful advocate for students and working families, and I have no doubt his contribution to the committee's work strengthening our nation's classrooms and workplaces will be invaluable."
House Passes Defense Appropriations Bill with Kelly Provision to Ban Funding
for Arms Trade Treaty
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement today after the House of Representatives passed
the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2015
by a bipartisan vote of 340-73. The bill included language requested by Rep. Kelly to prohibit any funding by the Department of Defense for the implementation of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The provision requires a one-year ban on funding for the ATT unless the treaty receives the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.
"Today the House took action to preserve our Second Amendment rights and secure our national sovereignty. For as long as this administration recklessly intends to implement the ATT, the American people's representatives have an obligation to prevent any taxpayer dollars from doing so. With today's legislation, we met that obligation and once again affirmed our bipartisan opposition to this very dangerous treaty."
NOTE:
Rep. Kelly is a national leader of the movement to stop the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). On March 15, 2013, he
introduced
H. Con. Res. 23, a
bipartisan concurrent resolution
expressing opposition to the treaty on behalf of members of Congress. The resolution currently has 149 co-sponsors in the House and 36 supporters in the Senate.
On May 30, 2013,
Rep. Kelly submitted
a
bipartisan letter
with 130 co-signers from Congress to both President Obama and Secretary Kerry urging them to reject the treaty. He sent
a similar bipartisan letter
to the president following Secretary Kerry's signing of the treaty on October 15, 2013, which was signed by 181 members of Congress, including multiple committee chairmen. A
follow-up letter
was sent to the White House
on April, 20, 2014.
On June 14, 2013, Rep. Kelly
introduced
an
amendment
to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014 to prohibit federal funding for the implementation of the ATT for one year by the Department of Defense. The amendment was
adopted unanimously
by a voice vote and included in the final passage of the NDAA by the House of Representatives. The House-Senate compromise NDAA, which included an updated version of the Kelly amendment, was passed by the House on December 12, 2013; passed by the Senate on December, 19, 2013; and
signed by President Obama
on December 26, 2013.
On July 24, 2013,
the House Appropriations Committee approved
the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2014 which imposes a one-year ban on the use of federal funds for the implementation of the ATT by the State Department. The ban is based on language from
a bipartisan letter
which
Rep. Kelly authored and submitted
to the State and Foreign Operations subcommittee on April 18, 2013. A version of this ban was integrated into H.R. 3547, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which temporarily funded the government between October 1, 2013 and January 15, 2014.
On April 1, 2014, Rep. Kelly
authored and submitted four separate letters
to the bipartisan leaders of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Defense ,
the Subcommittee on Homeland Security ,
the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs , and
the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
requesting updated and strengthened language prohibiting federal funding of the ATT in each of the subcommittees' respective appropriation bills for fiscal year 2015, including an explicit ban on the use of funds to engage in domestic prosecutions on the basis of the ATT. Each letter was co-signed by more than 80 members of Congress.
On May 22, 2014,
the House passed
H.R. 4335,
the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015 , which included Rep. Kelly's amendment to continue
the Defense Department's ban on funding
for the ATT.
On May 30, 2014,
the House passed the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2015 , which included language requested by Kelly to ban ATT funding by the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and other related agencies.
