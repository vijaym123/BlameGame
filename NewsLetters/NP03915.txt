ABLE Act Supports
Michiganders with Disabilities
Dear Friend:
More than 2 million Michigan adults have some form of a disability and that number is expected to increase over the next decade, reports the Michigan Department of Community Health.
We want to help give those families the opportunity to save for their future and long-term expenses, which is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of
H.R. 647, the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2014 . This bipartisan, commonsense legislation seeks to create tax-free savings accounts (ABLE accounts) for individuals with disabilities to cover qualified expenses such as education, housing, transportation, training, assistive technology, and personal support.
The ABLE Act empowers millions of Americans with disabilities, enabling them to save for their own future needs without jeopardizing the benefits and services they vitally depend upon. Through access to tax-free savings accounts, we can help our most vulnerable maintain their health, independence, and quality of life.
Under the ABLE Act, states would have the option to establish an ABLE program, under which eligible individuals with disabilities may establish an ABLE account. To be eligible, individuals must: 1) be severely disabled before turning age 26, based on a marked and severe functional limitation; or 2) receive benefits under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Disability Insurance (DI) programs.
ABLE accounts would be modeled after existing 529 investment plans
named after section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code
that are already used by families to save for college expenses. Notably, ABLE account balances and withdrawals would not jeopardize an individuals eligibility for Medicaid and other benefit programs.
Other key features of the program include: contributions into an ABLE account could be made by any person; contributions are not tax deductible; income earned by the accounts is not taxed; and account withdrawals, including portions attributed to investment earnings generated by the account, for qualified expenses are not taxable.
The ABLE Act recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of
404 to 17 . I am hopeful that the U.S. Senate will quickly act to ensure this important legislation gets signed into law.
Thank you for your interest in this important issue. As always, my door is always open and I look forward to hearing from you on the issues impacting our state and nation.
God bless,
Fred Upton
