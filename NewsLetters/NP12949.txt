Dear Friend,
We were busy in
Congress last week, but one thing in particular caught my eye and I wanted
to draw your attention to it as well.
Army Chief of Staff Gen.
Ray Odierno
made some comments
recently
about the readiness capacity of our National Guard and reserve forces.
Not only do I have the privilege of representing so many of
these citizen soldiers in Georgia 9, but most of you know I'm an Air
Force reservist myself.
I had
some thoughts on
this
and I bet
you do, too .
I'm
looking forward to a busy few days back in Georgia and I hope to
spend time with as many folks as possible.
In fact, I'm
having lunch at the Chick-Fil-A in Cornelia on Friday and I hope you'll
stop by if you're in the area .
I'll have someone from my
Gainesville office with me to talk about any issues you or a loved one
might be having with federal agencies. The cost of lunch will be on
your own, but you can find out more and let us know if we can look for
you by

Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
