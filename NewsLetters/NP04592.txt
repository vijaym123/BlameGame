HARPER, NUNNELEE &amp; PALAZZO CONGRATULATE SEN. ROGER WICKER ON ELECTION TO CHAIRMAN OF NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON
Rep. Harper, Rep. Nunnelee, and Rep. Palazzo released the following statement today after U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), was elected by his fellow Republican members of the U.S. Senate to serve as Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC):
Our sincere congratulations to Senator Roger Wicker on his election today to head the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). This is not only an honor for the state of Mississippi, but important to our country as a whole. It comes as no surprise to the Mississippi delegation that Senator Wicker was chosen to lead the NRSC during this important time. Other members of the United States Senate have come to realize what we in Mississippi already know: Sen. Wicker is a strong leader and public servant who has fought for years, in both the House and Senate to successfully champion conservative values. Our Mississippi delegation may be small, but we are a strong and the NRSC is fortunate to have Sen. Wicker leading the charge to keep the Republican majority in the Senate during the next election cycle.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is the only national organization solely devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. Senate. The NRSC provides invaluable support and assistance to current and prospective Republican U.S. Senate candidates in the areas of budget planning, election law compliance, fundraising, communications tools and messaging, research and strategy.
