David,
In 2014, outside groups hammered Illinois T.V. with negative ads around the clock. But you know what? We still won!
Here&rsquo;s a big reason why: over 10,000 people had Cheri&rsquo;s back last election. With your help, we had the resources to get our message out to voters. We can&rsquo;t thank you enough!
Now it&rsquo;s a new year, and if Cheri&rsquo;s going to keep fighting to grow Illinois&rsquo; middle class and protect Medicare and Social Security, we need you again. David, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to become a Founding Member of Cheri&rsquo;s campaign.
Tomorrow marks your LAST CHANCE to get in on the ground floor.
