Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
As the son of a Vietnam-era veteran and the grandson of a veteran of
World War II's Pacific theater, I was raised to respect our veterans
and their service to our nation.
This Veterans Day, I hope you will join Carol and me as we reflect on
the incredible and enduring sacrifices our veterans have made on behalf
of our nation. Without question, we must do everything we can to get
our veterans the benefits they earned, and I am honored to be fighting
on behalf of our service members.
And while we celebrate Veterans Day tomorrow, I know that as
Kentuckians, we don't need a special day to thank a veteran for their
sacrifice and service, or to keep those still serving in our Armed
Forces and their families in their prayers.
These are things we already do daily, defining us as a community. And
that is why I am so honored and humbled to serve all the people of the
Sixth Congressional District.
To all those who have and continue to serve our great nation, thank you.
Listening to You
Last week, I visited with folks all across central and eastern
Kentucky.
As part of my ongoing Accessibility Initiative, I spent the
week holding public town hall meetings, touring local businesses,
speaking with students, and most importantly, listening to Kentuckians
tell me what was on their mind.
I continue to hear that folks are as frustrated as I am with Washington
bickering and that it is time to take the steps forward that will get
our country back on the right track.
That is why I continue to advocate for all sides to come to the table
and find common ground so we can work out bipartisan solutions that
will encourage long-term economic growth and job creation.
Tweets from Around the District
Fighting to Protect Kentuckians
Constituents around the district also continue to share their concerns
about the Obama Administration's implementation of the so-called
Affordable Care Act.
They tell me stories of dropped coverage, increased premiums, and
concerns about the security of the website. One Winchester resident who
is suffering from stage 4 cancer came to my town hall this week to
share that he will lose his insurance on January 15. "Where do people
like us go?" he asked.
Please know that I hear you and will continue fighting to fix both this
deeply flawed law and the Obama Administration's failure to implement
it effectively.

Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and also feel free to forward my weekly
newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.

Report
Dear
Friend,
As
the
son
of
a
Vietnam-era
veteran
and
the
grandson
of
a
veteran
of
World
War
II&#8217;s
Pacific
theater,
I
was
raised
to
respect
our
veterans
and
their
service
to
our
nation.
This
Veterans
Day, I
hope
you
will
join
Carol
and
me
as
we reflect
on
the
incredible
and
enduring
sacrifices
our
veterans
have
made
on
behalf
of
our
nation. Without
question,
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
get
our
veterans
the
benefits
they
earned,
and
I
am
honored
to
be
fighting
on
behalf
of
our
service
members.
And
while
we
celebrate
Veterans
Day
tomorrow,
I
know
that
as
Kentuckians,
we
don't
need
a
special
day
to
thank
a
veteran
for
their
sacrifice
and
service,
or to
keep
those
still
serving
in
our
Armed
Forces and
their
families
in
their
prayers.
These
are
things
we
already
do
daily,
defining
us
as
a
community.
And
that
is
why
I
am
so
honored
and
humbled
to
serve
all
the
people
of
the
Sixth
Congressional
District.
To
all
those
who
have
and
continue
to
serve
our
great
nation,
thank
you.
