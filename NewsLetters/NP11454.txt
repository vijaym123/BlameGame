Its been a busy week here in Washington
and for me in particular, since Im Chairman of the Homeland Security
Appropriations Subcommittee and we have had a lot of important
hearings this week.
We had the new Secretary of
Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, come to Congress and
testify on DHS FY 2015 budget request . He did a good job and Im
very hopeful that he will take a more positive approach than his
predecessor.
We also had the acting Director of ICE, Daniel
Ragsdale, come to testify regarding ICEs FY15
budget.
Im on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and this week we
questioned Secretary Hagel and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs about
the budget this year for our military. Im very concerned about the
cuts being made and opposed to more reductions of the army. We have
reduced it far enough and its time to hold the line.
I
asked a question about awarding purple hearts to our warriors at Fort
Hood.
I got an indirect answer that a report will be out by
May.
On Tuesday, the House passed
H.R. 3979 , the
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and
Emergency Responders Act of 2014
that I cosponsored. (See
Roll Call #116 ) This bill will relieve volunteer fire
departments of ObamaCares burdening regulations by exempting them from having
to require health insurance to their volunteers. This will ensure the
funds appropriated to these departments can be used to continue
protecting our communities. I also so helped secure a $473,375 grant for
the Leander Fire Department to hire a Volunteer Liaison who will recruit
new, diverse volunteers and also work to retain current and future
members.
Also on Tuesday, House Republicans
passed two additional bills that I believe will protect Americans
from ObamaCare.
H.R. 1814 ,
The Equitable Access
to Care and Health (EACH) Act , which I cosponsored, expands
religious exemptions in ObamaCare. This legislation protects individuals
faith and allows them to avoid purchasing health insurance for
religious purposes. The EACH Act passed by voice vote. The House also passed
H.R. 3474 ,
the Hire More Heroes Act
which gives small businesses an incentive to hire veterans by exempting
veterans from the full-time employee count, mandated by Obamacare, if
they are covered by a federal veterans health program. The Hire More
Heroes Act passed by voice vote as well.
On
Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 4138 ,
the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional
Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act
(See
Roll
Call #124 ). This legislation allows the House or the Senate to
authorize a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for failure to faithfully
execute the laws.
Thursday, the House
passed
H.R. 3973 ,
the Faithful Execution of the
Law Act by a vote of 244-171
(See
Roll
Call #129 ). This bill requires all federal officials who stop
enforcing a law to report to Congress the reason for non-enforcement. We
cannot allow our federal departments to be used to fulfill this
administrations liberal agenda, and this bill is an attempt to curtail
that.
Finally, on Friday, the House passed
H.R. 4015 , the
SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider
Payment Modernization Act of 2014 , by a vote of 238-181. (See
Roll Call #135 ).
H.R. 4015 repeals the current
sustainable growth rate formula and replaces it with a permanent
solution to address physician payments in the Medicare program. The
replacement bill is offset by a five year delay of the individual mandate tax
penalty.
I am now headed back to Texas to
work in the district for the next week. Our next session begins March
26.
