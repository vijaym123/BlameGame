Outrageous Fraud in Afghanistan: STOPPED
Dear Friend,
I am especially proud to tell you that the House last week passed
(325-98) the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which included my
amendment to stop outrageous fraud and abuse of U.S.-funded
reconstruction projects in Afghanistan.
The amendment prohibits funds in excess of $500,000 from being spent
for any Afghanistan reconstruction project unless the Department of
Defense verifies to Congress that the effort will be properly monitored
and supervised.
Since 2002, our government has spent more than $100 billion on
reconstruction projects in Afghanistan and Iraq - some $60 billion of
which the Special Inspector General cannot account for. Much of
Afghanistan operates on a cash economy. Fraud and abuse are rampant,
and stories of truckloads of cash disappearing into the hands of
corrupt officials, warlords and criminals are commonplace.
Moreover, the area of Afghanistan in which U.S. personnel can travel
and operate safely has dwindled from 68 percent in 2009 to just 21
percent today. With up to $79 billion already authorized for new
construction projects, many of which would be located in regions where
monitoring is impossible, billions of dollars should be saved as a
result of this single amendment.
That's exactly why the measure received such enthusiastic, bipartisan
support from the bipartisan Taxpayers Protection Alliance and 22 other
organizations under the Project on Government Oversight.
I hope you will take a minute to watch this clip of my speech on the
House floor below.
Sincerely,
Click on the image above to watch me speak out against the fraud and
corruption rampant in Afghanistan, and how my amendment to the Defense
bill would put a stop to it. The blue portions of the map show the
limited area where U.S. personnel can travel and operate safely in
Afghanistan.

We Must Fix the VA Immediately - Secretary Shinseki Should Resign
On Friday, I called upon Veterans Administration Secretary Erik
Shinseki to resign. And I urged Speaker Boehner to establish a Select
Committee of the House to get to the bottom of allegations into
mismanagement, fraud and abuse at the VA.
These issues did not begin with the Secretary, but he's had six years
to fix the problems that plague this agency, and it's highly unlikely
that any more time will make a difference. The VA requires a new
leadership team with a fresh perspective and a total commitment to our
veterans and their families.
It is also important to understand that these problems stem not only
from terrible management, but also from lack of funding and resources
to deal with the dramatic increase in disability claims stemming from
13 long years of war - and the increased need to treat terrible
injuries with which veterans from Vietnam to Iraq to Afghanistan
continue to struggle.
It is disingenuous in the extreme that many of the same Republicans who
voted down our amendment to double the number of VA personnel necessary
to alleviate the backlog in disability claims are now shouting the
loudest about the failure to address that same backlog.
Nonetheless, it is time to put politics aside and fix the VA once and
for all. No more excuses. Our heroes put themselves in harm's way to
protect and serve us - and we have a sacred duty to protect and serve
them when they return.

Shutting Down Carp - Opening Up Shipping
The amendments to the Water Resources Reform & Development Act (WRRDA)
I first introduced last year on the House Transportation Committee to
(1) stop invasive (Asian) carp from invading northern Minnesota waters,
(2) provide the Army Corps of Engineers with new weapons to battle
invasive animal as well as plant species and (3) open up Great Lakes
shipping by stopping raids on the federal Harbor Trust Fund are all
headed to the President's desk for signature.
The impact on Minnesota's Eighth District - and on our entire state -
can't be overstated.
By closing the St. Anthony Lock and Dam in Minneapolis, we will stop
invasive carp from moving into the upper Mississippi watershed - into
the Crow Wing, Pine, and Rum Rivers - into Gull, Pine, White Fish, and
Mille Lacs Lakes, as well as into other important lakes including
Leech, Cass, and Winnie - threatening our multi-billion dollar sport
fishing and tourism industry.
By adding animals like the zebra mussel to the federal definition of
"invasive species" (which heretofore included only plant life) we
provide the Army Corps of Engineers with money and authority for more
research and abatement.
And by stopping raids on the Harbor Trust Fund for purposes other than
critical maintenance of our harbors and waterways - we take a giant
step toward eliminating a 10-year dredging backlog due to lack of
funds, and start returning Duluth Harbor and Great Lakes ships to 100%
operating capacity, creating more jobs by moving more iron ore, coal,
grain, and manufactured goods up the Great Lakes to national and
international destinations.
We got this done for Minnesota and the nation, and I'm proud of it.

Optimistic About A Rail Solution for Ranier
Meeting with Canadian National Railway executives and U.S. Customs and
Border Protection officials in my office to discuss solutions to the
rail issues plaguing the town of Ranier.
After inviting U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials and
Canadian National Railway (CN) executives to my office last week, I'm
confident we can arrive at a solution to alleviate the hours-long
delays the residents of Ranier face due to the dramatic increase in the
number and length of trains crossing the border from Canada into the
United States. On my visits to Ranier, I've experienced firsthand these
disruptions by trains stopped at Customs: a whole town is divided in
two - preventing kids from getting to school, residents from running
errands, and interrupting basic, crucial life-saving emergency services
from reaching those in need. Moreover, the lift bridge, which is left
in the down position for much of the day to allow trains to travel
between Fort Frances and Ranier, is an obstacle to recreational and
boat traffic on Rainy River - including to and from Voyageurs National
Park. Both CN and CBP representatives agreed to study possible
solutions to this issue - including moving the customs inspection
facility further inland. A similar situation in Brownsville, Texas, on
the U.S border with Mexico, was resolved in this way, so we know there
is precedent. We'll have an update in the coming weeks - in the
meantime, here is an article in the International Falls Journal
with more detail.

A Fund for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking
The U.S. House of Representatives has sent a clear message to the
victims of child sex trafficking: we intend to treat you as the victims
you are. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, of which I am an
original cosponsor, and which the House passed unanimously last week,
would establish a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund to provide support
services such as counseling, housing, medical help, and other safe
harbor protections, to victims of the sex trafficking trade. This fund
would come at no cost to the taxpayers, as it is paid for on the backs
of the criminals: the rapists - the johns - the kidnappers, and the
child abusers.
Local community organizations like Men Against Trafficking in Duluth
are setting a national example with their work offering prevention and
protections for young victims, and I'm so proud to have worked in
Congress to assist worthy groups such as this in the fight against the
terrible scourge of sex trafficking in our own backyards.
Before the unanimous vote, I spoke from the House Floor in support of
the bill's passage. Watch the clip below:

Our Week in Pictures
I was happy to address the crowd at the unveiling of Cambridge's new
Senior Enrichment Center, housed in the same building as City Hall.
Besides a wide variety of activities such as card clubs, knitting
groups, book talks, and bird walks, the center will also feature
healthy eating seminars and blood pressure checks. A great investment
for any community.

Isanti County Commission on Aging.
It was my 30th wedding anniversary last weekend, and what better way to
celebrate than to grab a guitar and sing "You Are My Sunshine" to my
sunshine, Mary, at Woody's Pub in Ranier. The entire pub joined in for
the chorus. Only in Minnesota, right?

Coming Up in Washington
.
Heads up to our Monday Report readers: I want you to be the
first to know that this week I will announce two new pieces of
legislation: (1) to reroute the North Country National Scenic Trail to
join existing hiking trails across the Range and the Arrowhead, making
the new route more environmentally sustainable - not to mention more
scenic; (2) to amend the Affordable Care Act to ensure that certain
employers and unions - those that run their own insurance plans - have
more time to accommodate the "reinsurance tax" the law requires. I'll
be making more formal announcements later this week, so stay tuned.
.
The U.S. House of Representatives will consider several
bills related to the ongoing allegations of mismanagement at the
Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as several measures that would
provide additional counseling and treatment for veterans who have
experienced sexual trauma. I have called for the resignation of the VA
secretary, Erik Shinseki, over these allegations; read my statement
here
.
.
Later this week, we'll consider funding for NASA, the
National Science Foundation (NSF), law enforcement, national security,
public safety programs, and more, as we debate the Commerce, Justice,
Science (C-S-J), and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This bill
looks to boost our defenses against crime, terrorism, and
cyber-attacks, improve weather forecasts and warnings, and foster U.S.
global competitiveness by making vital investments in science, space,
exports, and manufacturing - crucial for jobs across the nation and
right here in Minnesota's 8th.
.
Finally, the U.S. House is expected to consider the
Intelligence Authorization Act, which authorizes funding for the
various federal government agencies and departments that conduct
intelligence, including the CIA, Department of Defense, FBI, and the
National Security Agency (NSA).

Finally...
Memorial Day Celebrations in Little Falls and Nisswa
Standing with members of the Brainerd Civil Air Patrol during Camp
Ripley's Memorial Day Ceremony in Little Falls.
I was so honored to speak at both the Camp Ripley Memorial Day Ceremony
in Little Falls, and the Nisswa Memorial Day Ceremony, over the
weekend. More than 1,000 attendees turned out to the Minnesota State
Veterans Cemetery in Little Falls to pay tribute to those brave men and
women of our military who have so honorably served our country. We must
always remember that our fortune is due to their sacrifice - and
continue to renew our sacred obligation to protect and serve those who
have protected us. Above are two of my favorite photos from the event -

Outrageous
Fraud
in
Afghanistan:
STOPPED
Dear
Friend,
I
am
especially
proud
to
tell
you
that
the
House
last
week
passed
(325-98)
the
2015
National Defense
Authorization
Act,
which
included
my
amendment
to
stop
outrageous
fraud
and
abuse
of
U.S.&#8211;funded
reconstruction
projects
in
Afghanistan .
The
amendment
prohibits
funds
in
excess
of
$500,000
from
being
spent
for
any
Afghanistan
reconstruction
project
unless
the
Department
of
Defense
verifies
to
Congress
that
the
effort
will
be
properly
monitored
and
supervised .
Since
2002,
our
government
has
spent
more
than
$100
billion
on
reconstruction
projects
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
&#8211;
some
$60
billion
of
which
the
Special
Inspector
General
cannot
account
for.
Much
of
Afghanistan
operates
on
a
cash
economy.
Fraud
and
abuse
are
rampant,
and
stories
of
truckloads
of
cash
disappearing
into
the
hands
of
corrupt
officials,
warlords
and
criminals
are
commonplace.
Moreover,
the
area
of
Afghanistan
in
which
U.S.
personnel
can
travel
and
operate
safely
has
dwindled
from
68
percent
in
2009
to
just
21
percent
today.
With up
to $79
billion
already
authorized
for
new
construction
projects,
many
of
which
would
be
located
in
regions
where
monitoring
is
impossible,
billions
of
dollars
should
be
saved
as
a
result
of
this
single
amendment.
That&#8217;s
exactly
why
the
measure
received
such
enthusiastic,
bipartisan support
from
the
bipartisan
Taxpayers
Protection
Alliance
and
22
other
organizations
under
the
Project
on
Government
Oversight.
I
hope
you
will
take
a
minute
to
watch
this
clip
of
my
speech
on
the
House
floor
below.
Sincerely,
Click
on
the

to
watch
me
speak
out
against
the
fraud
and
corruption
rampant
in
Afghanistan,
and
how
my
amendment
to
the
Defense
bill
would
put
a
stop
to
it.

We
Must
Fix
the
VA
Immediately
-
Secretary
Shinseki
Should
Resign
On
Friday,
I
called
upon Veterans
Administration
Secretary
Erik
Shinseki
to
resign.
And
I
urged
Speaker
Boehner
to
establish
a
Select
Committee
of
the
House
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
allegations
into
mismanagement,
fraud
and
abuse
at
the
VA.
These
issues
did
not
begin
with
the
Secretary,
but
he&#8217;s
had
six
years
to
fix
the
problems
that
plague
this
agency ,
and
it&#8217;s
highly
unlikely
that
any
more
time
will
make
a
difference.
The
VA
requires
a
new
leadership
team
with
a
fresh
perspective
and
a
total
commitment
to
our
veterans
and
their
families.
It
is
also
important
to
understand
that
these
problems
stem
not
only
from
terrible
management,
but
also
from
lack
of
funding
and
resources
to
deal
with
the
dramatic
increase
in
disability
claims
stemming
from
13
long
years
of
war
&#8211;
and
the
increased
need
to
treat
terrible
injuries
with
which
veterans
from
Vietnam
to
Iraq
to
Afghanistan
continue
to
struggle.
It
is
disingenuous
in
the
extreme
that
many
of
the
same
Republicans
who
voted
down
our
amendment
to
double
the
number
of
VA
personnel
necessary
to
alleviate
the
backlog
in
disability
claims
are
now
shouting
the
loudest
about
the
failure
to
address
that
same
backlog.
Nonetheless,
it
is
time
to
put
politics
aside
and
fix
the
VA
once
and
for
all .
No
more
excuses.
Our
heroes
put
themselves
in
harm's
way
to
protect
and
serve
us
-
and
we
have
a
sacred
duty
to
protect
and
serve
them
when
they
return.

-
Opening

The

to
the
Water
Resources
Reform

Development
Act
(WRRDA)
I
first
introduced
last
year
on
the
House
Transportation
Committee
to
(1)
stop
invasive
(Asian)
carp
from
invading
northern
Minnesota
waters ,
(2)
provide
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
with
new
weapons
to
battle
invasive
animal
as
well
as
plant
species
and
(3)
open
up
Great

shipping
by
stopping
raids
on
the
federal
Harbor
Trust
Fund
are
all
headed
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk
for
signature.
The
impact
on
Minnesota&#8217;s
Eighth
District
&#8211;
and
on
our
entire
state
&#8211;
can&#8217;t
be
overstated.
By
closing
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
and
Dam
in
Minneapolis ,
we
will
stop
invasive
carp
from
moving
into
the
upper
Mississippi
watershed
&#8211;
into
the
Crow
Wing,
Pine,
and
Rum
Rivers
&#8211;
into
Gull,
Pine,
White
Fish,
and Mille
Lacs
Lakes,
as
well
as
into
other
important
lakes
including
Leech,
Cass,
and
Winnie
&#8211;
threatening
our
multi-billion
dollar
sport
fishing
and
tourism
industry.
By
adding
animals
like
the
zebra
mussel
to
the
federal
definition
of
"invasive
species"
(which
heretofore
included
only
plant
life)
we
provide
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
with
money
and
authority
for
more
research
and
abatement.
And
by
stopping
raids
on
the
Harbor
Trust
Fund
for
purposes
other
than
critical
maintenance
of
our
harbors
and
waterways
&#8211;
we
take
a
giant
step
toward
eliminating
a
10-year
dredging
backlog
due
to
lack
of
funds,
and
start
returning
Duluth
Harbor
and
Great
Lakes
ships
to
100%
operating
capacity ,
creating
more
jobs
by
moving
more
iron
ore,
coal,
grain,
and
manufactured
goods
up
the
Great
Lakes
to
national
and
international
destinations.
We
got
this
done
for
Minnesota
and
the
nation,
and
I&#8217;m
proud
of
it.
Optimistic
About
A
Rail
Solution
for
Ranier
Meeting
with
Canadian
National
Railway
executives
and
U.S.
Customs
and
Border
Protection
officials
in
my
office
to
discuss
solutions
to
the
rail
issues
plaguing
the
town
of
Ranier.
After
inviting
U.S.
Customs
and
Border
Protection
(CBP)
officials
and
Canadian
National Railway
(CN)
executives
to
my
office
last
week,
I'm
confident we
can
arrive
at
a
solution
to
alleviate
the hours-long
delays
the
residents
of
Ranier
face
due
to the
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
and
length
of
trains
crossing
the
border
from
Canada
into
the
United
States . On
my
visits
to
Ranier,
I've
experienced
firsthand
these
disruptions
by
trains
stopped
at
Customs:
a
whole
town
is
divided
in two
-
preventing
kids
from
getting
to
school,
residents
from
running
errands,
and
i nterrupting
basic,
crucial
life-saving
emergency
services
from
reaching
those
in
need.
Moreover,
the
lift
bridge,
which
is
left
in
the
down
position
for
much
of
the
day
to
allow
trains
to
travel
between
Fort
Frances
and
Ranier,
is
an
obstacle
to
recreational
and
boat
traffic
on
Rainy
River
-
including
to
and
from
Voyageurs
National
Park .
Both
CN
and
CBP
representatives
agreed
to
study
possible
solutions
to
this
issue
-
including
moving
the
customs
inspection
facility
further
inland . A
similar
situation
in
Brownsville,
Texas,
on
the
U.S
border
with
Mexico,
was
resolved
in
this
way,
so
we
know
there
is
precedent.
We'll
have
an
update
in
the
coming
weeks
-
in
the
meantime,
here
is
an
article
in
the
International
Falls
Journal
with
more
detail.
A
Fund
for
Victims

Child
Sex
Trafficking
The
U.S.
House

Representatives
has
sent
a
clear
message
to
the
victims
of
child
sex
trafficking :
we
intend

Victims
of Trafficking
Act,
of

would
establish
a
Domestic
Trafficking
Victims'

to
provide
support
services
such
as
counseling,
housing,
medical
help,
and
other
safe
harbor
protections,
to
victims
of
the
sex
trafficking
trade.
This
fund
would
come
at
no
cost
to
the
taxpayers,
as
it
is
paid
for
on
the
backs
of
the
criminals :
the
rapists
-
the
johns
-
the
kidnappers,
and
the
child
abusers.
Local
community
organizations
like
Men
Against
Trafficking
in
Duluth
are
setting
a
national
example
with
their
work
offering
prevention
and
protections
for
young
victims,
and
I'm
so
proud
to
have
worked
in
Congress
to
assist
worthy
groups
such
as
this
in
the
fight
against
the
terrible
scourge
of
sex
trafficking
in

(2)
to
amend
the
Affordable
Care
Act
to
ensure
that
certain
employers
and
unions
-
those
that
run
their
own
insurance
plans
-
have
more
time
to
accommodate
the
"reinsurance
tax" the
law
requires.
I'll
be
making
more
formal
announcements
later
this
week,
so
stay
tuned.
&#8226;
The
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
will
consider
several
bills
related
to
the
ongoing
allegations
of
mismanagement
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs ,
as
well
as
several
measures
that
would
provide
additional
counseling
and
treatment
for
veterans
who
have
experienced
sexual
trauma.
I
have
called
for
the
resignation
of
the
VA
secretary,
Erik
Shinseki,
over
these
allegations;
read
my
statement
here .
&#8226;
Later
this
week,
we'll
consider
funding
for
NASA,
the
National
Science
Foundation
(NSF) ,
law
enforcement,
national
security,
public
safety
programs ,
and
more,
as
we
debate
the Commerce,
Justice,
Science
(C-S-J),
and
Related
Agencies
Appropriations
Act.
This
bill
looks
to
boost
our
defenses
against
crime,
terrorism,
and
cyber-attacks,
improve
weather
forecasts
and
warnings,
and
foster
U.S.
global
competitiveness
by
making
vital
investments
in
science,
space,
exports,
and
manufacturing
-
crucial
for
jobs
across
the
nation
and
right
here
in
Minnesota's
8th.
&#8226;
Finally,
the
U.S.
House
is
expected
to
consider
the
Intelligence
Authorization
Act,
which
authorizes
funding
for
the
various
federal
government
agencies
and
departments
that
conduct
intelligence,
including
the
CIA,
Department
of
Defense,
FBI ,
and
the
National
Security
Agency
(NSA) .
Finally...
Memorial
Day
Celebrations
in
Little
Falls
and
Nisswa
Standing
with
members
of
the
Brainerd
Civil
Air
Patrol
during
Camp
Ripley's
Memorial
Day
Ceremony
in
Little
Falls.
I
was
so honored
to
speak
at
both the
Camp
Ripley
Memorial
Day
Ceremony
in
Little
Falls ,
and
the
Nisswa
Memorial
Day
Ceremony,
over
the
weekend. More
than
1,000
attendees
turned
out
to
the
Minnesota
State
Veterans
Cemetery
in
Little
Falls
to
pay
tribute
to
those
brave
men
and
women
of
our
military
who
have
so honorably served
our
country.
We
must
always
remember
that
our
fortune
is
due
to
their
sacrifice
-
and
continue
to
renew
our
sacred
obligation
to
protect
and
serve
those
who
have
protected
us . Above
are
two
of
my
favorite
photos
from
the
event
