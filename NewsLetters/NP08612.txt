Dear Friend, Outside groups have spent $100 million on this year&rsquo;s elections, with more spending yet to come.
There&rsquo;s a simple, two-word explanation for that unprecedented number:
Citizens United. Citizens United
is one of the most egregious Supreme Court decisions in our nation&rsquo;s history, and it must be overturned. Add your name to our petition and help us end the damage this case has caused.
Come to think of it, there&rsquo;s also a two-word explanation for where most of that money comes from:
Koch brothers. The Koch brothers&rsquo; group Americans for Prosperity has committed to spending $125 million on this year&rsquo;s elections.
Without
Citizens United , it&rsquo;s harder for billionaires like the Koch brothers to purchase influence over our democracy. Without
Citizens United , it&rsquo;s harder for billionaires like the Koch brothers to launch anonymous attacks against people like me. The Koch brothers have benefitted from
Citizens United , while our democracy has suffered. Help us put an end to the damage wrought by
Citizens United
-- sign our petition calling for campaign finance reform.
$100 million in outside spending already, and groups backed by billionaires like the Koch brothers show no signs of slowing down. We need to stand up to this tide of outside money now, before it&rsquo;s too late.
Thank you.
