Greetings,
As we start a new year, Ill be working with my House colleagues to put people back to work, spur economic growth, and give everyone a fair shot.
We need to put a stop to Washingtons record of stagnant job growth, skyrocketing health-care costs, and more broken promises.
Obamacare must be stopped:
Through my website, Kansans Concerned with Obamacare, Ive been hearing from more and more of you about your hardships stemming from the Affordable Care Act.
( Please share your story here! )
Many of you have lost your health insurance.
One 35-year old mother lost her familys coverage and is waiting in limbo to see what happens.
Another family is seeing health providers close their doors.
We need to put a stop to this disastrous law.
Immigration law needs to be fixed:
If we cant control our borders, any proposed reform is meaningless.
We need to dedicate more resources to securing the border and ensuring that Americans are safe.
Washingtons wasteful spending binge must end:
Decembers jobs report shows a tragic number of Americans dropping out of the workforce.
Our sluggish economy means taxpayers cant support more out-of-control spending.
Its time for Washington to deal with the grim reality the rest of Americans have been facing.
I regularly hold Calls with Mike where you can speak to me and hear the concerns of other Kansans.
Its a much easier way for people with busy schedules and family lives to express their views and ask questions.
If you want to register to receive these calls, please
sign up here . (Please note that due to federal rules, this is limited exclusively to Kansans in the 4th District.)
I always want to hear your thoughts, so please contact my office should you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
