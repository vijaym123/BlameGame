Dear Neighbor,
The idea of having a flag honoring our nations Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA) was developed in 1971 by a woman named Mary Hoff from Orange Park, Florida. Her husband, Michael Hoff, went missing during the Vietnam War. The sad truth is that Mrs. Hoff is one of many Americans whose loved one became listed as missing in action. There are over 83,000 U.S. soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who are listed as POW/MIA from WWII, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the 1991 Gulf War.
The POW/MIA flag pictures a guard in a watch tower surveillancing the silhouette of a man apprehended by barbed wire. The phrase YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN is written below. Today we must say an additional prayer for those service members who are POW/MIA, for we will
never forget
their heroism. It is our duty to remember our POW and MIA service members, for they have selflessly served for the freedom of our nation.
I begin each day thanking God for his blessings and for the privileges afforded by our enlisted troops, veterans, armed forces, and military heroes.
Join me today to remember and pay tribute to the brave patriots who suffered as prisoners of war or went missing in action.
God Bless.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
