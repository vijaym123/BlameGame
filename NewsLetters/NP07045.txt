In June, as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) began its takeover of major cities in Iraq, I
asked
if you believed the United States should get involved. In response, 2,096 out of 3,469 or
60.4%
of you said no.
On August 7 th , the President
authorized
targeted airstrikes against ISIL if they move toward or threaten our personnel in the U.S. consulate in Erbil or the American embassy in Baghdad.
The President also called for humanitarian aid for the Iraqi civilians stranded on Mount Sinjar, and authorized military assistance to the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces as they battle these terrorists.
To date, the U.S. military has conducted
airdrops
of food and water, delivering more than 85,000 meals and more than 20,000 gallons of drinking water, and is continuing
airstrikes
against ISIL to protect our American diplomats and military personnel in Erbil.
