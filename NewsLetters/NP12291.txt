Transparency &amp;
Accountability
Last week saw several key pieces of legislation
finding approval in both the House Ways &amp; Means Committee and the
House Budget Committee. Over in Ways &amp; Means, the committee
approved H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act
of 2014 introduced by the chairman of that committee Rep. Dave Camp
(MI-04). This bill would put on hold an attempt by the IRS to unfairly
target organizations seeking 501(c)(4) classification under the tax
code. The type of scrutiny being proposed is eerily similar to the abuse
perpetrated by the IRS against conservative organizations that was
uncovered last
summer.
The regulators are claiming that the current 501(c)(4)
rules are simply too confusing for them, despite no trouble since
their implementation in 1959.
The Stop the Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act is absolutely critical in allowing for proper
congressional oversight of the federal
bureaucracy.
In the House Budget
Committee, the committee members approved two pieces of legislation aimed at
reforming the congressional budget process
H.R. 1872, the Budget
and Accounting Transparency Act, and H.R. 1869, the Biennial Budgeting
and Enhanced Oversight Act. In order to save taxpayer dollars, Congress
must reform the process by which we draft a budget and define its
priorities. It is clear that the current budget process is a real
impediment to fiscal responsibility, and it feeds the culture of spending in
Washington. As vice chairman of the House Budget Committee, I am
grateful to be working with my colleagues on a proactive approach to
instilling more transparency and accountability that will help force
Congress to budget more efficiently and effectively, rein in wasteful
government spending and help us tackle the real fiscal challenges that stand
in the way of greater economic growth, job creation, and a more
successful and secure future for our kids and
grandkids.
