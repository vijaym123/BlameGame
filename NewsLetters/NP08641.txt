Dear David,
It was great to talk with so many Oregonians around the First District
over the last two weeks. I held town hall meetings in Portland,
Beaverton, Hillsboro, Gearhart, Vernonia, McMinnville, Newberg, and
Scappoose and addressed a wide range of topics. Here's a rundown of
some of the most prevalent issues discussed.
Veterans
At nearly every town hall meeting I heard from veterans about concerns
with the VA. These personal accounts coincided with reports that some
VA employees in Arizona covered up long wait times at their facilities
and an internal VA audit that revealed serious system-wide problems. We
must do all we can to provide care to our nation's heroes, and any
employees who are found to have contributed to a cover-up should face
repercussions. Meanwhile, my focus continues to be on ensuring that our
veterans have access to quality, timely care
. Hearing directly from veterans is
important. I will be holding roundtable meetings
with
veterans in the coming weeks to learn how we can help improve access to
care and I want to hear from you. Read more here
.
Infrastructure
Another issue we discussed at multiple town hall meetings was
infrastructure. From our ports to our roadways, this framework is
critical for our economy and must be maintained. In coastal
communities, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA),
which recently passed the House
, will help smaller ports in need of
maintenance funding. I also discussed the pending insolvency of the
Highway Trust Fund, which could put some of the state's transportation
projects and construction jobs in jeopardy. I am especially concerned
about this issue and I'm
exploring many options to ensure that we have the funds to pay for
these projects.
Gun Violence Prevention
Many constituents voiced their concern about gun violence in schools
and on campuses. I share their concern. There was the recent tragedy at
Seattle Pacific University, where a 19-year-old Beaverton resident
was
killed. And then the shooting at Reynolds High School in Troutdale
where lives were lost. We must set aside our differences and work
together to determine the best way to prevent this senseless violence.
I'm glad there was bipartisan support in the House recently to increase
funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. We
must continue to work on policies that will prevent these tragedies in
the future.
Immigration Reform
During the town hall meetings, we also discussed immigration reform, an
issue that impacts many industries across our district. I often hear
about the need for immigration reform from the technology industry in
Washington County and the agricultural industry in Yamhill County, and
I am advocating for the House to take up this issue soon. Comprehensive
immigration reform should: secure the border; create an orderly; legal
immigration system; and provide a pathway to citizenship.

Dear
David,
It
was
great
to
talk
with
so
many
Oregonians
around
the
First
District
over
the
last
two
weeks.
I
held
town
hall
meetings
in
Portland,
Beaverton,
Hillsboro,
Gearhart,
Vernonia,
McMinnville,
Newberg,
and
Scappoose
and
addressed
a
wide
range
of
topics. Here's
a
rundown
of
some
of
the
most
prevalent
issues
discussed.
Veterans At nearly
every
town
hall
meeting
I
heard
from
veterans about concerns
with
the
VA.
These
personal
accounts
coincided
with
reports
that
some
VA
employees
in
Arizona
covered
up
long
wait
times
at
their
facilities
and
an
internal
VA
audit
that
revealed
serious
system-wide
problems.
We
must
do
all
we
can
to
provide
care
to
our
nation's
heroes,
and
any
employees
who
are
found
to
have
contributed
to
a
cover-up
should
face
repercussions.
Meanwhile,
my
focus
continues
to
be
on
ensuring that
our
veterans
have
access
to
quality,
timely
care .
Hearing
directly
from
veterans
is
important.
I
will
be
holding
roundtable
meetings
with

to

access
to
care
and

Infrastructure Another
issue
we
discussed
at
multiple
town
hall
meetings was
infrastructure.
From
our
ports
to
our
roadways,
this
framework is
critical
for
our
economy
and
must
be
maintained.
In
coastal

I
also
discussed
the
pending
insolvency
of
the
Highway
Trust
Fund,
which
could put
some

the
state's
transportation
projects
and
construction

in

I
am
especially
concerned
about
this
issue
and
I'm

many
options
to

that
we

And
then
the

lost.
We
must
set aside

senseless
violence.

Immigration
Reform
During
the
town
hall

we
also

immigration
reform,
an
issue
that
impacts
many
industries
across
our
district.
I
often

the

County
and
the
agricultural
industry
in
Yamhill
County,

Comprehensive
immigration

should:
