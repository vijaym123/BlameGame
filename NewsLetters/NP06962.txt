Dear Friends,
Each year,
I have the honor of nominating a limited number of people to four of
the five military academies

interested in learning more about the military academies or university
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs, please save the date
of
Saturday, September 20 for
Academy Day 2014.
At
Academy Day, military academy representatives and university ROTC
representatives from Ole Miss and Mississippi State will be on site to share
information about their programs and to answer any questions you may
have.

to seek a nomination to the Coast Guard Academy, as the U.S.C.G.A.
accepts candidates based on their own testing
criteria.
