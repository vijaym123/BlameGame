Dear M. Mignaud,
Today, my first bill as a Member of Congress was unanimously passed in the
House Committee on Natural Resources with bipartisan support.
The John Muir National Historic Site Expansion Act (H.R.1289) would add 44
acres of land to the Martinez historic site that celebrates the life and legacy
of Contra Costa?s own John Muir. The additional 44 acres will improve access to
the park and trails for the public. The bill can now can be brought to the
floor of the House of Representatives for a vote, and Senator Barbara Boxer has
introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate, so the bill is on its way
to becoming law.

As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
assistance.
Sincerely,
Mark DeSaulnier
Member of Congress
