Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is a column I read recently by
Veronique de Rugy titled, "Yes, We Do Have a Debt Problem.
"
The recovery from recent storms that hit Indiana and the Midwest so
hard last month continues.
As part of the recovery, Governor Pence
submitted a request for federal disaster aid for Howard County this
week
.
As coverage of the
storms began, I received many calls regarding my position on federal
disaster assistance.
In general, I support assistance when it is
needed, but it must be budgeted for and paid for.
I was reminded of this column by de Rugy because there is still an
important debate to be had regarding our spending priorities.
In
short, we must live within our means. The budget process is by
definition spending prioritization. Congress writes a budget by funding
higher priorities, including disaster relief, at the expense of lower
priorities.
If circumstances change and additional disaster funding
becomes necessary, we must reevaluate our priorities in order to
provide that funding.
If not, our children and grandchildren will be
forced to pick up the bill, and that is neither responsible nor moral.
That's the basic theme of de Rugy's column - we are ignoring the bigger
picture when we look at our federal spending through a short-term
prism.
Just as a family would have a serious discussion about
priorities during a trying difficult time, our country must also have
this discussion as we consider what is most important to us.

Congress on Your Corner - Monticello and Frankfort
Last Tuesday, I hosted Congress on Your Corner events in Monticello and
Frankfort.
It was great to see so many of you who took the time out of
your schedule to discuss issues that are important to you.
Both events
were very well-attended.
Thank you to the Monticello-Union Public
Library and the Frankfort City Council for hosting these events.
Rep. Rokita Answers Questions at Congress on Your Corner in Monticello
At the events I fielded a wide range of questions.
In Monticello, we
spent a considerable amount of the time discussing the reauthorization
of the Farm Bill and food stamp reform.
In Frankfort, we spent more
time discussing immigration reform.
Rep. Rokita Meets with Hoosiers in Frankfort
At both events, however, the number one issue people wanted to discuss,
which I feel is the most important issue that faces our nation, is our
$17 trillion debt and $100 trillion in unfunded promises that are on
the way in the decades to come.
People all over Indiana joining in the fight to stop the runaway
spending in Washington.
The fight is not an easy one, but I find your
commitment to this cause inspiring. Even with a difficult economy,
where it is just easier to expect our federal government takes care of
us, Hoosiers still care more about their children and grandchildren and
less about themselves and what goodies politicians can give them.
We
must continue this fight so that the children of tomorrow do not
inherit the debt that we've racked up.
Also, as I do at most town hall and Congress on Your Corner events, I
promised to answer several more detailed questions from the events on
my Facebook page.
I will be posting some of the questions from the
events over the coming weekend.
If you were either unable to attend or there was not enough time to
answer your question, please send me an e-mail or call my office
and I will get back to you in short order.

US 31 Bypass - Open for Business
Rep. Rokita with Gov. Pence, State Senator Buck, and State Rep.
VanNatter
Also last Tuesday, along with Governor Pence and other elected
officials, I attended the ribbon cutting for the new U.S. 31 Bypass in
Kokomo.
I can attest personally to the importance of this project.
Now, and
over eight years as Indiana Secretary of State, I logged thousands of
miles on U.S. 31.
While I like to stop in Kokomo any chance I can,
there are times when Hoosiers simply are heading to South Bend or
elsewhere.
When the final Hamilton County section opens to traffic in 2015, a
total of 32 stoplights will have been removed from U.S. 31 between
Indianapolis and South Bend, saving drivers a half hour of travel time.
For frequent travelers of the route, imagine how many days of their
lives they will get back in a year!
On Thursday, I made remarks on the House floor to commemorate this
event and hail the great work happening in the "Crossroads of America."
You can watch my remarks here
.
At a time short-term thinking dominates policymaking in Washington, it
is great to see Indiana making sound investments not just for today,
but particularly for future generations.
I commend and congratulate all of the individuals, elected officials,
and business and community groups involved in bringing the Kokomo
corridor of U.S.31 from the drawing board to reality.

Fighting Red Tape - Hearing on Unfair, Selective Enforcement of Federal
Rules
On Wednesday, I took part in a hearing held by the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
to provide oversight to the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP)'s recent expansion of
regulatory and enforcement activities.
In enforcing the
nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements applicable to
federal contractors and subcontractors, the OFCCP continues to
establish new and more stringent standards for the hiring and
employment of veterans and persons with disabilities.
I have serious concerns that the OFCCP creates these new rules with
unclear language which is leading to selective and, by definition,
unfair enforcement of these rules as well as a focus on citing
contractors for violations rather than to advance the goals of equal
employment opportunity.
I was able to highlight these unfair
inconsistencies with the OFCCP's public stance and their actual
activities.
During her testimony, OFCCP Director Shiu contradicted herself by
claiming that the OFCCP is forbidden to enforce "quotas," yet they are
able to enter into and enforce "conciliation agreements" with
contractors that have the force and effect of law.
The contradiction underscores the selective enforcement this agency
engages in, which is unfair to all involved.
Once again, we are
reminded of the dangers of unelected bureaucrats that think they know
better than us and do not always act in our best interest.
You can
watch my exchange with witnesses here

ObamaCare Insurance Cancellations Continue to Hit Mailboxes - Just the
Tip of the Iceberg
It has been widely reported that millions of Americans are being sent
cancellation notices of their insurance policies
due to forced changes under ObamaCare.
These
cancellations come despite the promise made by the President, time and
again, that, "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your
plan."
Cancellations are just the tip of the iceberg on this insidious
law.
Hoosiers are seeing rate increases, hours and jobs being cut, and
health benefits are changing so rapidly that many are unsure of exactly
what coverage they will have in the new year.
I recently received a story from Danny in Frankfort who saw his
deductible increase from $500 to $5000 per year.
Like many Hoosiers,
he is frustrated by the changes forced on him by ObamaCare.
If you or someone you know has had a similar experiences due to
ObamaCare, please send me your story, your cancellation notice, or rate
increase documents at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.

Todd Rokita

titled,
" Yes,

The

continues.
As

In

If

Just
as
a

would

about
priorities
during
a
trying
difficult

our
country
must
also
have
this
discussion

we
consider
what
is

Congress
on
Your
Corner
-
Monticello
and
Frankfort
Last Tuesday, I
hosted
Congress
on
Your
Corner
events
in
Monticello
and
Frankfort.
It
was
great
to
see
so
many
of
you
who
took
the
time
out
of
your
schedule
to
discuss
issues
that
are
important
to
you.
Both
events
were
very
well-attended.
Thank
you
to
the
Monticello-Union
Public
Library
and
the
Frankfort
City
Council
for
hosting
these
events.
Rep.
Rokita
Answers
Questions
at
Congress
on
Your
Corner
in
Monticello
At
the
events
I
fielded
a
wide
range
of
questions.
In
Monticello,
we
spent
a
considerable
amount
of
the
time
discussing
the
reauthorization
of
the
Farm
Bill
and
food
stamp
reform.
In
Frankfort,
we
spent
more
time
discussing
immigration
reform.
Rep.
Rokita
Meets
with
Hoosiers
in
Frankfort
At
both
events,
however,
the
number one
issue
people
wanted
to
discuss,
which
I
feel
is
the
most
important
issue
that
faces
our
nation,
is
our
$17
trillion
debt
and
$100
trillion
in
unfunded
promises
that
are
on
the
way
in
the
decades
to
come.
People
all
over
Indiana
joining
in
the
fight
to
stop
the
runaway
spending
in
Washington.
The
fight
is
not
an
easy
one,
but
I
find
your
commitment
to
this
cause
inspiring.
Even
with
a
difficult
economy,
where
it
is
just
easier
to
expect
our
federal
government
takes
care
of
us,
Hoosiers
still
care
more
about
their
children
and
grandchildren
and
less
about
themselves
and
what
goodies
politicians
can
give
them.
We
must
continue
this
fight
so
that
the
children
of
tomorrow
do
not
inherit
the
debt
that
we've
racked
up.
Also,
as
I
do
at
most
town
hall
and
Congress
on
Your
Corner
events,
I
promised
to
answer
several
more
detailed
questions
from
the
events
on
my
Facebook
page.
I
will
be
posting
some
of
the
questions
from
the
events
over
the
coming
weekend.
If
you
were
either
unable
to
attend
or
there
was
not
enough
time
to
answer
your
question,
please
send
me
an
e-mail
or

I
will

short
order.

Also

I

for
the

I
can

to
the

Now,
and
over
eight
years
as
Indiana
Secretary
of
State,
I
logged
thousands
of
miles
on
U.S.
31.
While
I
like
to
stop
in
Kokomo
any
chance
I
can,
there
are
times
when
Hoosiers
simply
are
heading
to
South

or
elsewhere.
When
the

County
section
opens

in

a

On

Fighting
Red
Tape
-
Hearing
on
Unfair,
Selective
Enforcement
of
Federal
Rules
On
Wednesday,
I
took
part
in
a
hearing
held
by
the
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce
Subcommittee
on
Workforce
Protections
to
provide
oversight
to
the
Office
of
Federal
Contract
Compliance
Programs
(OFCCP)'s
recent
expansion
of
regulatory
and
enforcement
activities.
In
enforcing
the
nondiscrimination
and
affirmative
action
requirements
applicable
to
federal
contractors
and
subcontractors,
the
OFCCP
continues
to
establish
new
and
more
stringent
standards
for
the
hiring
and
employment
of
veterans
and
persons
with
disabilities.
I
have
serious
concerns
that
the
OFCCP
creates
these
new
rules
with
unclear
language
which
is
leading
to
selective
and,
by
definition,
unfair
enforcement
of
these
rules
as
well
as
a
focus
on
citing
contractors
for
violations
rather
than
to
advance
the
goals
of
equal
employment
opportunity.
I
was
able
to
highlight
these
unfair
inconsistencies
with
the
OFCCP's
public
stance
and
their
actual
activities.
During
her
testimony,
OFCCP
Director
Shiu
contradicted
herself
by
claiming
that
the
OFCCP
is
forbidden
to
enforce
&#8220;quotas,&#8221;
yet
they
are
able
to
enter
into
and
enforce
&#8220;conciliation
agreements&#8221;
with
contractors
that
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
The
contradiction
underscores
the
selective
enforcement this
agency
engages
in,
which
is
unfair
to
all
involved.
Once
again,
we
are
reminded
of
the
dangers
of
unelected
bureaucrats
that
think they
know
better
than
us
and
do
not
always
act
in
our
best
interest.

ObamaCare
Insurance
Cancellations
Continue
to
Hit
Mailboxes
-
Just
the
Tip
of
the
Iceberg
It has
been
widely
reported
that
millions
of
Americans
are
being
sent
cancellation
notices
of
their insurance
policies
due
to forced
changes
under
ObamaCare.
These
cancellations
come
despite
the
promise
made
by
the
President,
time
and
again,
that,
"if
you
like
your
health
insurance
plan,
you
can
keep
your
plan."
Cancellations
are
just
the
tip
of
the iceberg
on this
insidious
law.
Hoosiers
are
seeing
rate
increases,
hours
and
jobs
being
cut,
and
health
benefits
are
changing
so
rapidly
that
many
are
unsure
of
exactly
what
coverage
they
will
have
in
the
new
year.
I
recently
received
a
story
from
Danny
in
Frankfort
who
saw
his
deductible
increase
from
$500
to
$5000
per
year.
Like
many
Hoosiers,
he
is
frustrated
by the
changes
forced
on
him
by
ObamaCare.
If
you
or
someone
you
know
has
had
a
similar
experiences
due
to
ObamaCare, please
send
me
your story,
your cancellation
notice,
or
rate
increase
documents at
InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov .
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
Congress
and
for
supporting
my
efforts
in
Washington.
Take
care.
