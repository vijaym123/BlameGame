Dear Friend,
This evening, the House of Representatives passed the FY 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This spending bill contains a number of important measures that fulfill the peoples priorities, including protecting jobs, stopping wasteful spending, reining in government overreach, and funding our national security.
This bill also sets up a showdown with President Obama in just a few weeks on immigration and his illegal amnesty action. In January, with the help of a Republican-led Senate, Congress will have the ability to move legislation through the legislative process and work to place a check on the President's power. While this bill is not perfect, it does move us in the right direction on conservative principles.
