Dear Friends:
If you live in the area of the Charlie Norwood VA in Augusta, theres a good chance youve seen the coverage of problems that led to the death of at least three veterans.
These deaths were reportedly caused by a delay in getting some veterans the care they need. We have a responsibility to provide quality health care to veterans after they serve our country, and clearly, that didnt happen.
Before Thanksgiving,
I called on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs to conduct a full investigation
into what went wrong at the Augusta VA.
This isnt an issue we can let slide.
We have to work to find answers about who dropped the ball and hold them responsible.
Ive received a personal commitment from the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House to bring their leadership to Augusta to find out what went wrong.
Well stay on top of this issue until we can get some answers for the families whove lost loved ones.
Again this year,
were collecting Christmas cards for the service men and women
whove been injured and cant spend the holidays at home with their families.
If you or your family are interested in contributing a card, please make sure to have it to our Augusta District Office by December 13 th .
Also, my Augusta District Office is an official Toys for Tots drop off location.
I want to make sure we can spread some Christmas cheer to the children whose families have fallen on hard times.
This is a great time of year.
Ill be participating in lots of Christmas parades throughout the district, so perhaps our paths will cross and we can visit some. In any case, I hope you and yours have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
And, as always, if theres anything I can do to help you or someone you know, please dont hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
