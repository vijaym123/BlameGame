1.3 Million to Lose Jobless Benefits Next Month Unless Congress
Acts
A
new
report
by
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee underscores that 1.3
million Americans will lose jobless benefits the week of December 28
unless Congress takes action to extend the program.
In terms of
the Michigan impact, 43,800 people in Michigan stand to lose their
benefits next month, and an additional 86,500 Michiganians would lose their
benefits by June.
Without prompt action by Congress, well over a million Americans
will have their entire unemployment compensation immediately
eliminated in the midst of the holiday season and close to another two million
will lose that federal unemployment insurance over the first half of
next year, said Rep.
Levin.
If you or someone you know
will be affected by the expiration of the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation program (EUC), please
share your story .
Honoring Our Nations
Veterans
When the first
Armistice Day was declared in 1919, President Wilson described it as a day
to be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in
the countrys service and with gratitude for the victory.
Today
we call it Veterans Day, but it is still a time when Americans come
together to thank and honor the men and women who have sacrificed so much
for our nation.
Rep. Levin spent Monday at the VFW Bruce Post in St. Clair Shores at
a truly moving ceremony with over 200 veterans and their
families.
Thereafter, he went to the Resurrection Cemetery in Clinton
Township for Veterans Day services.
One of the best ways to honor veterans is to remember
their stories.
For many years, Rep. Levins office has been
involved in an effort at the Library of Congress to collect and preserve
wartime stories.
The Veterans History Project is the largest oral
history project in U.S. history.

House Approves Bill to Reduce Preterm
Delivery
Approximately 500,000 babies are born prematurely each year in the United
States.
Premature babies
those born before 37 completed weeks
of pregnancy
often have more health problems and require longer
hospitalization.
On November 12, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved
the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act.
PREEMIE stands for Prematurity
Research Expansion for Mothers Who Deliver Infants Early.
The bill
renews and supports research and programs at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention that seek to better understand and prevent
preterm births.
Rep. Levin is a cosponsor of the House version of
the PREEMIE Act.
The Secret
Deaths of Bees
As
was recently highlighted in the
Time Magazine
cover story
[ A World Without Bees , August 19], our nations honeybee population
is dramatically declining.
One third of U.S. honeybee colonies
died or disappeared during the past winter, a rate of decline far higher
than the normal loss rate of around 15 percent.
If this
continues, the implications are far reaching since honeybees pollinate about
one-third of the human diet.
Most disturbing of all is the fact
that scientists do not yet have a firm handle on why the bees are in
trouble.
The suspected causes of bee colony collapse are diverse,
including overuse of pesticides, bacterial disease, and fungal
infections.
Rep. Levin
recently joined 25 other concerned members of Congress in writing a
letter
to Agriculture Secretary Vilsac to urge him to request
significant additional resources to address these bee health decline
challenges.
As the lawmakers state in their letter, more needs
to be done before it is too late.
