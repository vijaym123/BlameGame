It requires federal land managers to support and facilitate use and access for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land.

*
It adjusts funding limitations to make more funds available to states, for a longer period of time, for the creation and maintenance of shooting ranges.
*
The bill protects law-abiding individuals' constitutional right to bear arms on lands owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress has passed legislation allowing citizens to exercise this right on National Park and National Wild Service lands, but did not address lands owned by the Army Corps.

Rep. Miller Votes to Protect Recreational Hunting and Fishing
Feb 5, 2014
WASHINGTON &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after House passage of the Sportsmen&#8217;s Heritage and Recreational
Enhancement Act:
&#8220;This important legislation is necessary to protect and expand American sportsmen&#8217;s right to hunt and fish on public lands without bureaucratic restrictions and roadblocks.
&#8220;The traditions of hunting and fishing are not only part of our rich history, but are also important to our economic growth and livelihood through the increased recreational opportunities they
create.
By requiring that federal lands remain accessible to sportsmen and women and preventing federal agencies like the EPA from dictating what type of ammunition and tackle we use, this legislation demonstrates our bipartisan commitment to American sportsmen
and their contributions.&#8221;
