Friends,
Earlier this
week, the first known Ebola patient in the United States died in a Texas
hospital. He was allowed to travel to the United States from Liberia
after telling officials he hadn't been in direct contact with anyone
infected with Ebola, which unfortunately was not true. He did not develop
symptoms until he arrived in the United States, making detection
nearly impossible.
Though an Ebola outbreak in the
United States is highly unlikely, I agree with my constituents that the
U.S. must do more to ensure this virus doesnt spread at all. Relying
solely on the CDCs current process of asking a few questions before
travelers board a plane and hoping those travelers are telling the truth
just isnt enough.
This week, I signed a bipartisan
letter to President Obama asking him to take immediate action to protect
American citizens from further exposure to the Ebola virus through
travel restrictions and more active screening practices at the border,
while still allowing rescue and aid workers to travel to and from the
affected countries.
Twenty-seven African nations have already
implemented travel restrictions to protect their citizens. With the
holiday travel season fast approaching, its time to put processes in
place here in America to isolate the epidemic so that it can be fully
defeated.
Those are my thoughts on the situation as it
stands now, but I want to hear from you. Please let me know what you
think by answering the question below. POLL: Do you support travel restrictions to and from the United
States to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus in our
country? Yes, travel restrictions to and
from West African countries impacted by the Ebola epidemic should be
implemented immediately. No, we should not impose travel restrictions, but we should
increase fever and health screenings for the virus at major U.S.
airports. No, we do not need
travel restrictions or additional screenings. I have another answer. I'm undecided. If you selected "I have another
answer," please share it here. If you are having
