STAR METRICS
( https://www.starmetrics.nih.gov/ ) is a multi-agency
venture led by the National Institutes of Health, National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy. The objective of STAR METRICS Level I was to examine the impact of
science spending using data from research institutions' existing
database records. Access to the STAR METRICS Level I data is limited;
however, investigators are encouraged to propose research studies
based on similar institutional data. STAR METRICS Level II, or
Federal RePORTer (Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool), provides a
searchable database of scientific awards from Federal agencies.
Investigators may familiarize themselves with the details of the STAR METRICS
data collection effort by reviewing information available online
at
https://www.starmetrics.nih.gov/ .
