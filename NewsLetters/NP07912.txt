Hobby Lobby
is a direct assault on women&rsquo;s healthcare rights, but Republican Bob Dold -- beholden to right-wing special interests -- refuses to stand up for women and take a position on the ruling. Sign our petition to send a message to Dold that corporations have no place in women's healthcare choices.
"A spokeswoman for Republican Bob Dold of Kenilworth, Schneider's opponent in a widely watched campaign for re-election in the 10th District, didn't return a request for comment" --
Daily Herald
David --
Bob Dold&rsquo;s silence is deafening.
Ten days after the ruling, Dold is refusing to speak on the
Hobby Lobby
decision for the fear of backlash from his right-wing backers. David, Bob Dold can&rsquo;t have it both ways -- and we won&rsquo;t let him.
His record speaks for itself: Dold voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and now he won't stand up for working women in Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district. Will you sign our petition to condemn the
Hobby Lobby
decision and send a message to Dold that companies have no right to interfere with women's healthcare decisions?
Women deserve someone who will stand up for their rights, not cave to right-wing pressures. Please sign our petition:
