Dear Friend,
The recent allegations, as reported by the Washington Examiner
, of
employees at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLAHS)
willfully manipulating and destroying as many as 40,000 backlogged
veteran medical exam requests are appalling if true. This news
underscores the problems veterans face when scheduling medical
appointments to receive care and is an issue I continue to fight to
reform.
Before these allegations, local veterans have voiced numerous
complaints to me over the past few years on the amount of time it takes
the VA to schedule medical appointments. When I would contact GLAHS on
the behalf of our veterans, I would never get the full story. After
growing frustrated with GLAHS, I requested that the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) conduct an audit
of the department to
investigate why veterans were not being scheduled for medical
appointments in a timely manner.
As a result, the GAO found that the
VA's positive wait time reports are not what veterans actually
experience due to unreliable data input by VA employees. Additionally,
the VA failed to require strict adherence to scheduling policy and
lacked oversight on the scheduling process, which contributed to
substandard care. Subsequently, Chairman Jeff Miller of the House
Committee on Veterans' Affairs and I sent a letter
to the Secretary of Veterans'
Affairs, Eric Shinseki, calling on him to implement the GAO's
recommendations following the release of the audit. On March 14, 2013,
I testified at a Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing
on the issues raised by the GAO audit and complaints
from local veterans.
Unfortunately, the VA provided disappointing responses to both our
letter and to questioning at the hearing. As a result, I took action
and introduced H.R. 2661, the Veterans Access to Timely Medical
Appointments Act
, to reform the scheduling process within the VA. This legislation
addresses the GAO-identified factors contributing to the unreliability
of appointment wait times. The bill mandates the VA improve its medical
appointment scheduling policy and deliver a report to Congress within
60 days on how it plans to implement this policy; specifically, on how
it will schedule primary care appointments within seven days and
specialty care appointments within 14 days. I chose these timeframes
because they are the goals used internally by VA supervisors and I felt
it necessary to hold them accountable to their own goals. I will
continue to work with my House colleagues to pass this legislation out
of the House and signed into law by the President.
In light of the most recent allegations of the VA attempting to make
its backlog numbers look better than they actually are, Representative
Dan Benishek and I sent a letter
to Secretary
Shinseki requesting that the VA's Office of Medical Inspector
immediately investigate GLAHS and report to Congress with its findings.
President Lincoln once said, "To care for him who shall have borne the
battle and for his widow, and his orphan."
Our veterans deserve the
best care, especially from the Department that was created to serve
them.
I will continue to work with the House Committee on Veterans'
Affairs to uncover all the facts and reform the VA's scheduling process
to ensure timely access to medical appointments.
Sincerely,
Congressman Kevin McCarthy

Dear
Friend,
The
recent
allegations,
as
reported
by
the
Washington
Examiner ,
of
employees
at
the
VA
Greater
Los
Angeles
Healthcare
System
(GLAHS)
willfully
manipulating
and
destroying
as
many
as
40,000
backlogged
veteran
medical
exam
requests
are
appalling
if
true.
This
news
underscores
the
problems
veterans
face
when
scheduling
medical
appointments
to
receive
care
and
is
an
issue
I
continue
to
fight
to
reform.
Before
these
allegations,
local
veterans
have
voiced
numerous
complaints
to
me
over
the
past
few
years
on
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
the
VA
to
schedule
medical
appointments.
When
I
would
contact
GLAHS
on
the
behalf
of
our
veterans,
I
would
never
get
the
full
story.
After
growing
frustrated
with
GLAHS,
I
requested
that
the
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
conduct
an
audit
of
the
department
to
investigate
why
veterans
were
not
being
scheduled
for
medical
appointments
in
a
timely
manner.
As
a
result,
the
GAO
found
that
the
VA&#8217;s
positive
wait
time
reports
are
not
what
veterans
actually
experience
due
to
unreliable
data
input
by
VA
employees.
Additionally,
the
VA
failed
to
require
strict
adherence
to
scheduling
policy
and
lacked
oversight
on
the
scheduling
process,
which
contributed
to
substandard
care.
Subsequently,
Chairman
Jeff
Miller
of
the
House
Committee
on
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
and
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Secretary
of
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs,
Eric
Shinseki,
calling
on
him
to
implement
the
GAO&#8217;s
recommendations
following
the
release
of
the
audit.
On
March
14,
2013,
I
testified
at
a
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs
hearing
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
GAO
audit
and
complaints
from
local
veterans.
Unfortunately,
the
VA
provided
disappointing
responses
to
both
our
letter
and
to
questioning
at
the
hearing.
As
a
result,
I
took
action
and
introduced
H.R.
2661,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Timely
Medical
Appointments
Act ,
to
reform
the
scheduling
process
within
the
VA.
This
legislation
addresses
the
GAO-identified
factors
contributing
to
the
unreliability
of
appointment
wait
times.
The
bill
mandates
the
VA
improve
its
medical
appointment
scheduling
policy
and
deliver
a
report
to
Congress
within
60
days
on
how
it
plans
to
implement
this
policy;
specifically,
on
how
it
will
schedule
primary
care
appointments
within
seven
days
and
specialty
care
appointments
within
14
days.
I
chose
these
timeframes
because
they
are
the
goals
used
internally
by
VA
supervisors
and
I
felt
it
necessary
to
hold
them
accountable
to
their
own
goals.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
House
colleagues
to
pass
this
legislation
out
of
the
House
and
signed
into
law
by
the
President.
In
light
of
the
most
recent
allegations
of
the
VA
attempting
to
make
its
backlog
numbers
look
better
than
they
actually
are,
Representative
Dan
Benishek
and
I
sent
a
letter
to
Secretary
Shinseki
requesting
that
the
VA&#8217;s
Office
of
Medical
Inspector
immediately
investigate
GLAHS
and
report
to
Congress
with
its
findings.
President
Lincoln
once
said,
&#8220;To
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow,
and
his
orphan.&#8221;
Our
veterans
deserve
the
best
care,
especially
from
the
Department
that
was
created
to
serve
them.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
the
House
Committee
on
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
to
uncover
all
the
facts
and
reform
the
VA&#8217;s
scheduling
process
to
ensure
timely
access
to
medical
appointments.

Congressman
