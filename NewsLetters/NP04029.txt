Dear Fellow Nevadan,
The events in
Ferguson, Missouri and Staten Island, New York are very troubling. I believe
there is one fact we can all agree on: neither of these men deserved to
die. I hope that as Americans mourn the tragic loss of these lives,
protests will remain peaceful and that local authorities throughout the
country will continue to respect the right of protestors to
peacefully demonstrate.
I support President Obamas recent call to
commit funds for body cameras on local law enforcement so that we can
ensure accountability. The Presidents plan will promote effective
crime reduction while rebuilding trust in our communities. It is my hope
that through the Presidents Executive Action to review and assess
local law enforcement requests for military style equipment, we can create
an open dialogue between community leaders and law enforcement and
ensure that our first responders have the equipment they need to do
their job. We should also look at our options for advancing legislation to
help this effort in the Senate.
The bottom line is that
every community in America deserves equal protection and fair treatment
under the law. I fully support efforts by the Department of Justice to
investigate these tragedies. Even if Mike Brown and Eric Garner
allegedly committed minor crimes they should not have had to pay with their
lives.
