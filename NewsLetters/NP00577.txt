Week in Review
This past Monday was Memorial
Day, a very special day allowing
time to pause and reflect upon the
loss of those who offered their
lives for our freedom. Our nation's
military men and women set aside
their individual needs so that
their fellow Americans could live
in peace, safety, and security. I
am appreciative to have been able
to attend several ceremonies in
Southern Nevada to pay my respect
to the heroes who gave their lives.
There is no better way to spend
Memorial Day than honoring our
nation's heroes with my fellow
Nevadans.
Last week, I had the opportunity
to testify at a Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Subcommittee
hearing regarding two important
land bills for the State of Nevada,
the
Good
Samaritan Search and Recovery Act
of 2015 (S. 160)
and the
Douglas
County Conservation Act of 2015 (S.
472) . Both pieces of
legislation are extremely important
to the well-being of Nevada, and
this hearing marked an important
step in the legislative process.

I was also pleased to see a
couple pieces of legislation I led
pass through the House of
Representatives and Senate.
First, the House of
Representatives passed the
Justice
for Victims of Trafficking Act
(S.178) . Included in the
legislation was my amendment that
ensures Transportation Security
Administration, U.S. Customs and
Border Protection, and other
Department of Homeland Security
personnel are trained and equipped
to better identify victims and
perpetrators of human trafficking.
The amendment also allows funds to
be used to strengthen Internet
Crimes Against Children Task Forces
across the country, which
investigate heinous crimes, such as
the production of child pornography
and human trafficking.
The
ROV
in-Depth Examination (RIDE) Act
(S.1040) , bipartisan
legislation introduced by me and
U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV),
was approved by the Senate
Commerce, Science, &amp;
Transportation Committee. This
legislation puts the brakes on the
Consumer Product Safety
Commission's flawed proposed
mandatory standards for lateral
stability and vehicle handling that
could have unintended safety
consequences and limit off-road
vehicles' ability to access
difficult terrain. Off-road
vehicles play a major role in
enabling many Nevadans to enjoy the
outdoors and the Silver State's way
of life. It is critical to the
safety of Nevadans that these
standards actually reduce the risk
of injury, not increase it. I'm
proud to see this bipartisan
legislation, which ensures the
regulation is implemented
correctly, moved through committee
on such a positive note.
I look forward to returning to
Washington, DC, this weekend to
continue my work for the people of
the state of Nevada.
