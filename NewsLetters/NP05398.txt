David, I&rsquo;m emailing you to ask for $5.
Here&rsquo;s why:
The election is exactly 17 days away.
A new poll showed our race within a SINGLE-DIGIT.
Karl Rove just launched a deceptive ad campaign against me.
I refuse to fall behind. Not when we&rsquo;re this close to the finish.
David, if you&rsquo;re with me, I hope you&rsquo;ll chip in $5 (or more if you can!) today. Every bit helps.
