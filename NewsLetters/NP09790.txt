Wing
5/14/14
In observance of Armed Forces Week and National Small Business Week,
Congressman Doug Lamborn toured RMB Products on Wednesday morning,
May 14th, at 9:00am. RMB Products is a small business of approximately
75 employees based in Fountain, Colorado. Founded in 1963, RMB Products
utilizes their 82,500 square foot facility to engineer and
manufacture polymer products for a variety of defense and aerospace needs,
including the F-18 fighter plane.

Also
in observance of Armed Forces Week, and National Small Business Week,
Congressman Lamborn visited the 302nd Airlift Wing at Peterson AFB to
say thank you. As we enter wildfire season, the 302nd will be flying
C-130s equipped with the
Modular Airborne Firefighting System (MAFFS) II
system .
Recently, Congressman Lamborn
inserted language into the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act ensuring
that the Air Force C-130 MAFFS aerial firefighting aircraft based at
Peterson Air Force Base are not removed without certification from the
Secretary of the Air Force that there will be no danger posed to the
ongoing, nationwide firefighting mission. Congressman Lamborn is
extremely familiar with the necessity of the MAFFS mission, having been
closely involved in getting the aircraft deployed as rapidly as possible
during the Waldo Canyon and Black Forest Wildfires of 2012 and
2013.
