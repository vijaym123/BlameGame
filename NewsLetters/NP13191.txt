Happy New
Year!
Thank you for the privilege of serving the 11th District in
2013. It was an eventful year, and there is no doubt 2014 will present
many opportunities and challenges of its own. After taking on 1,265
cases last year ranging from veterans affairs to IRS issues to
disability claims, my staff and I look forward to maintaining our emphasis on
constituent service this year.
Safeguarding Personal Information on
Healthcare.gov
Considering the known risks and lack of security testing for
Healthcare.gov, the American people have the right to know if their
personal information required by the website has been
compromised.
On Friday, the House passed the
Health Exchange Security
and Transparency Act . This legislation ensures that Americans
receive notification from the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) within two days after discovery of a security breach in the
Affordable Care Acts exchanges.
The
Health Exchange
Security and Transparency Act
passed the House in a vote
of 291-122.
Supporting
First Responders
Earlier this week, I spoke on the House floor in support of the
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act .
This legislation, of which I am a co-sponsor, protects fire
departments from the harmful impacts of Obamacare's employer mandate by ensuring
that emergency services volunteers are not counted as full-time
employees.
Obamacares adverse impacts on local fire
departments exemplify the unintended consequences of a law that is
significantly burdening the American people. To stand with the first
responders who stand for us every day, we must address this crucial issue that
could have major financial implications for our fire
departments.
Update:
At the urging of
Congress, the IRS announced on Friday that fire departments would not be
forced to count volunteers as full-time employees.

Navigating Senate Roadblocks
As of January 1st, there were 160 bills passed by the
U.S. House of Representatives still languishing in the U.S. Senate.
Despite the roadblocks, the House will continue to pass legislation in 2014
that stops waste, reigns in federal spending, fosters innovation, and
creates an environment conducive to job growth. It is my hope that
the Senate will begin working with the House to enact commonsense
solutions to our nations greatest challenges.
