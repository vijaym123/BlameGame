Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
My son Jim joined me in Washington, D.C. this week for his birthday. He
went many places with me including an Energy and Mineral Resources
Subcommittee Hearing.
40-Hour Work Week
This week I supported and the House passed H.R. 2575, the "Save
American Workers Act," that reinstates the definition of "full-time
employment" to a 40-hour work week. Currently under the employer
mandate of Obamacare, a 30-hour work week qualifies as "full-time
employment."
As a result of the employer mandate's "30-hour rule," employees are
seeing their wages and hours cut, and rather than being encouraged to
grow and innovate, businesses are turning to more part-time employees.
The Congressional Budget Office scored H.R. 2575 and found that this
legislation would lead to an increase of cash wages by $75 billion and
a decrease of taxes by $63 billion. The bill passed the House of
Representatives with a bipartisan vote of 248-179.
During debate on the House floor, I explained that in addition to the
monetary impacts this rule change has on businesses, we need to look at
the moral impact of scaling back the definition of a full-time
employee. Reducing hours in a work week effectively lowers a standard,
rather than raises the bar.

Budget Accountability
The House set up added accountability measures within the budget
process this week by approving H.R. 1874, the "Pro-Growth Budgeting
Act."
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has the responsibility of scoring
legislation, but its analysis is only on a bill's fiscal impact. Many
factors such as the cost to businesses and the amount of jobs created
and lost are not examined. H.R. 1874 requires CBO to provide a
"supplemental macroeconomic impact analysis" when reviewing major
legislation such as tax reform, farm bills, and highway
reauthorizations. This analysis will show the legislation's impact on
items such as workforce and revenue, and provide what is known as a
"dynamic score."
Business owners are already faced with a great amount of uncertainty
with the ever-increasing government regulations. This bill will provide
more clarity and accountability of policy costs and how they will
impact a business' ability to grow themselves and compete at a higher
level.
Principal Chief Bill John Baker and Marshall Shannon Buhl of the
Cherokee Nation stopped by our office in Washington, D.C.
We had many great groups visit our Washington, D.C. office this week,
including Roy Lee Lindsey, Cathy Vaughan and Darren Appleton with the
Oklahoma Pork Producers.
National Defense
We owe a great debt to all our men and women in the armed forces, past
and present.
Our nation has a rich history of brave military service
that we celebrate.
Unfortunately today our country finds itself in a different atmosphere
under an Administration that only pays lip service to our troops and
veterans. A Commander-in-chief that is deeply concerned about the
security of a nation holds different priorities than the ones we've
seen from this President. With weak foreign policy and support of
defense cuts, our country is being led down the wrong path.
The threat from Al Qaida is real and we must remain vigilant against
the enemies who want to do us harm here at home and abroad. The current
rise of terrorist groups in Iraq shows the painful truth that the
foreign policy of this Administration has eroded our influence in that
region of the world.
It is more important than ever to get this right.
Recently the President presented his annual budget request, which
critically impacts our military. The President's budget takes us down
to pre-World War II troop levels, eliminates the A-10 aircraft and
reduces military benefits. Oklahoma's Second District is home to
countless veterans and active duty troops, and the McAlester Army
Ammunition Plant. We are clearly committed to our nation's defense and
do not want to see these cuts implemented.
There are ways we can reform the Defense budget and go after wasteful
spending whether it be government contracting inefficiencies, or
various forms of fraud and abuse in the military industrial complex.
But it should not be on the backs of our men and women in uniform.
Votes
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the following legislation this
week:
H.R. 1874: Pro-Growth Budgeting Act
H.R. 2575: Save American Workers Act
H.R. 4152, concurring in Senate Amendment: To provide for the costs of
loan guarantees for Ukraine
S 2183: United States International Programming to Ukraine and
Neighboring Regions
Next Week
Next week will be an active week in committees, and on the House floor
we will work on a budget--one that is fiscally responsible and balances
in 10 years.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
My
son
Jim
joined
me
in
Washington,
D.C.
this
week
for
his
birthday.
He
went many
places
with
me
including
an Energy
and
Mineral
Resources
Subcommittee
Hearing.
40-Hour

Week This
week
I
supported
and
the
House

H.R.
2575,
the
&#8220;Save
American
Workers
Act,&#8221;
that
reinstates
the
definition
of
&#8220;full-time
employment&#8221;
to
a
40-hour
work
week.
Currently
under
the
employer
mandate
of
Obamacare,
a
30-hour
work
week
qualifies
as
&#8220;full-time
employment.&#8221;
As
a
result
of
the
employer
mandate&#8217;s
&#8220;30-hour
rule,&#8221;
employees
are
seeing
their
wages
and
hours
cut,
and
rather
than
being
encouraged
to
grow
and
innovate,
businesses
are
turning
to
more
part-time
employees.
The
Congressional
Budget
Office
scored
H.R.

and
found
that
this

an
increase
of
cash

in

rule
change
has
on
businesses, we
need
to
look
at the
moral
impact
of
scaling
back
the
definition
of
a

Reducing
hours
in
a
work

effectively
lowers
a
standard,
rather
than
raises
the
bar.

Budget
Accountability
The
House
set
up
added
accountability
measures within
the
budget process
this
week
by
approving
H.R.
1874,
the
&#8220;Pro-Growth
Budgeting
Act."
The
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
has
the
responsibility
of
scoring
legislation,
but
its
analysis
is
only
on
a
bill&#8217;s
fiscal
impact.
Many
factors
such
as
the
cost
to
businesses
and
the
amount
of
jobs
created
and
lost
are
not
examined.
H.R.
1874
requires
CBO
to
provide
a
&#8220;supplemental
macroeconomic
impact
analysis&#8221;
when
reviewing
major
legislation
such
as
tax
reform,
farm
bills,
and
highway
reauthorizations.
This
analysis
will
show
the
legislation&#8217;s
impact
on
items
such
as
workforce
and
revenue,
and
provide
what
is
known
as
a
&#8220;dynamic
score.&#8221;
Business
owners
are
already
faced
with
a
great
amount
of
uncertainty
with
the
ever-increasing
government
regulations.
This
bill
will
provide
more
clarity
and
accountability
of
policy
costs
and
how
they
will
impact
a
business&#8217;
ability
to
grow
themselves
and
compete
at
a
higher
level.

We

to
all

of

Unfortunately
today
our
country
finds
itself
in
a

under
an

that
only
pays

A
Commander-in-chief
that
is
deeply
concerned
about
the
security
of
a
nation
holds
different
priorities
than
the
ones
we&#8217;ve
seen
from
this
President.
With
weak
foreign
policy
and
support
of
defense
cuts,
our
country
is
being
led
down
the
wrong
path.
The
threat
from
Al

is
real
and
we
must
remain
vigilant
against
the
enemies
who
want
to
do
us
harm
here
at
home
and
abroad.
The
current
rise
of
terrorist
groups
in
Iraq
shows
the
painful
truth
that
the
foreign
policy
of
this
Administration
has
eroded
our
influence
in
that
region
of
the
world.
It
is
more
important
than
ever
to
get

Recently
the

The

us

eliminates
the

implemented.
There
are
ways
we
can
reform
the
Defense
budget
and
go
after
wasteful
spending
whether
it
be
government
contracting
inefficiencies,
or
various
forms
of
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
military
industrial
complex.
But
it
should
not
be
on
the

of
our

in
