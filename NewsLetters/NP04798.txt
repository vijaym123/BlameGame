President Obama emailed you this morning. And I&rsquo;m emailing you this afternoon. You know it&rsquo;s critical if the President and Vice President are both emailing you.
Friend -- President Obama emailed you this morning.
And I&rsquo;m emailing you this afternoon.
You know it&rsquo;s critical if the President and Vice President are both emailing you.
Please take a break from your Monday and read this start to finish:
With ten races STILL within three points, the DSCC is making a bold move to expand their Emergency Get Out the Vote efforts.
This is a last-minute play to turn out as many voters as possible -- it&rsquo;s exactly the kind of push that could win Democrats the Senate.
There&#39;s just one problem: They have to fund this final push by midnight tonight.
Friend, I know I&rsquo;ve asked a lot. But this Emergency Get Out the Vote Push could make THE difference in these final hours. Will you please give whatever you can to support it before midnight tonight?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Friend, I&rsquo;ll just be frank: This last-minute Emergency Get Out the Vote Push could tip the balance in these too close to call states.
But the DSCC will have to scale back if you can&rsquo;t help them close their $200,000 Get Out The Vote funding gap.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking just one more time -- will you step up?
Thanks,
Joe Biden
