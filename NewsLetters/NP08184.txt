Setting precedent and reaching goals were the twin themes of my remarks, following this week's State of the Commonwealth Address by Governor Eloy Inos to a joint session of the Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature. I have a unique responsibility as our first representative in Congress to set high standards for how the office conducts business and what can be accomplished. Five goals we reached include the conveyance of submerged lands, making the immigration transition as least difficult as possible, raising the minimum wage without causing job loss, getting federal food assistance on par with other Americans, and, most importantly, increasing funding for education. I also looked ahead to new goals, particularly the emerging need to manage the military build-up in a way that protects our islands, but also fulfills our role in our nation's defense.
Defining what a Delegate can be - The people of the Northern Mariana Islands never had a representative in the United States Congress before I began service in 2009. So, defining what a Member of Congress should be expected to do was of great concern to me. I knew that whatever I did could shape our understanding of what our representative should do for years to come. Speaking to the Northern Marianas Legislature this week in conjunction with Governor Inos' State of the Commonwealth Address, I explained the standards for accessibility, accountability, and accomplishment I have tried to set over the last five years in Congress. Of course, I hope that our future representatives in Congress will do even more to be open and helpful to constituents, find even more ways to keep constituents informed, and surpass what I have been able to accomplish to improve life in our islands. But I think I have set a solid foundation for those who come after to build upon. You can read the complete text of my remarks here .

The seventeen Northern Marianas members of the Guam Army National Guard were honored with a Freedom Salute Ceremony this week. The 1st Battalion, 294th Regiment of the Guard, led by Major General Benny Paulino, recently returned from a 12-month deployment to Afghanistan. We are very proud of our soldiers and are grateful to them and their families for their service and sacrifices.
