Wisdom of the District: NSA Surveillance
Striking the right balance between personal privacy and national security has always been a challenge in our country. Recently Congress passed, and President Obama signed, the USA FREEDOM Act, a bill that strengthens congressional oversight of the National Security Agency (NSA) and limits its ability to review Americans phone records through bulk data collection.
Do you agree with Congress actions to limit the NSA's bulk collection programs?
(_)
I disagree. Restricting bulk data collection substantially weakens a vital tool in our counter-terrorism efforts at a time when the terrorist threat has never been higher.
(_)
I somewhat disagree. The NSA plays an important role in protecting our nation. Congress must find the appropriate balance between ensuring they have the tools needed to be successful and protecting our personal liberties.
(_)
I somewhat agree. Government surveillance is important but should be limited to known or suspected terrorists.
(_)
I agree. My personal freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and bulk data collection is a violation of my most fundamental right to privacy.
(_)
I dont know.

I have another answer.
