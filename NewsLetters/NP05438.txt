As a friend of mine once said, it is no surprise that trust of government is at an all time low when the size of government is at an all time high.
Big government relies on the arrogance of powerful bureaucrats. Limited government is founded on the personal responsibility of its citizens, the cooperation and initiative of local government and community leaders, and direct accountability: the idea that those who are most directly impacted by the decisions being made should be the ones calling the shots. Abraham Lincoln called it government of the people, by the people, for the people and it relies on a simple idea that I believe we would do well to return to today: less power to bureaucrats in Washington, more power to the people.
Yours in service,
Randy
