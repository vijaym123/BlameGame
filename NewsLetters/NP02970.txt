Today, we
received the fantastic news that the U.S. Army will award the victims of the
2009 Fort Hood Shooting the Purple Heart!
This has been a
long, hard fight. The victims of this attack have struggled, suffered
and been abandoned by the Obama Administration. No more. Today is a day
of victory and I am honored to have fought on their behalf. The
Administration did not want to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.
I have received confirmation from the Pentagon that the victims will
receive the Purple Heart and the Defense Medal for the Defense of
Freedom. I want to thank my Texas colleagues for their help and support;
including Rep. Williams, Rep. Thornberry, Senators Cornyn and Cruz. I
commend the Secretary of the Army for stepping up to provide the
victims their due benefits and to finally give closure to the
families.
This week the House passed
H.R.
596 , a bill to repeal Obamacare
and direct relevant
committees to report to the House alternative healthcare solutions based upon
a number of guiding principles, including: lowering healthcare costs;
promoting job creation and economic growth; preserving a patient's
ability to keep their healthcare plan; providing people with pre-existing
conditions access to affordable healthcare coverage; reforming the
medical liability system; and increasing the number of insured
Americans. This bill passed bya vote of 239-186. (See
Roll
Call #58 ).
Three weeks ago, the House of
Representatives passed my
Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) Appropriations bill
which included language that would
prohibit the President from using DHS funds to implement his amnesty
executive action. This week the Senate has been considering my
legislation and I urge everyone to call on their Senators to encourage them to
pass this conservative legislation . Its the Senates
turn to throw a punch!
Its been a busy week,
and Im happy to be in Fort Hood today celebrating this victory with
our soldiers. I will be back in D.C. on Tuesday, February
10 th . Make sure to like my Facebook page to stay up to speed with the
legislation we will be voting on next
week.
