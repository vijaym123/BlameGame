More EPA
Regulation, Higher Costs for the Middle Class
I always hear stories about how government
bureaucrats are becoming increasingly aggressive.
Our out-of-control
government is putting the squeeze on Missouris middle class, and the
biggest bully of the bunch is the EPA.
You and I know there are already too many regulations on the
books, but the EPA has more coming everyday with no end in
sight.
First the EPA tried to regulate farm
dust and then every ditch and pond in our fields. Then they went
after wood burning stoves used for inexpensive home heating.
Now,
the President and the EPA are trying to force some of the most crushing
regulations on coal power plants in history.
What will this mean
for Missourians?
Higher electric bills.
The President already failed to get these regulations
though Congress.
Now, he is trying to go around Congress to
enforce his agenda.
Our region benefits greatly from coal-generated
electricity, which is the cheapest form of American energy.
Under the Presidents plan, electricity bills for small businesses and
families will go up.
Our leaders
need to be working to reduce costs for small businesses, farmers, and
families, not make paying the bills more expensive.
Our
government needs to be more accountable to the people, and that is why my
legislation will give Congress a say in all the EPAs actions.
Its
time to reign in this out-of-control government, and we must start
with closing the floodgates on the EPA.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
