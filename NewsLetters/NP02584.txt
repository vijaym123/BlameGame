Voting Against Continued
Funding For Illegal Executive
Amnesty
2/27/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn voted against a three week funding extension
for the Department of Homeland Security.
"I cannot support funding, even for a short period of
time, the Presidents unlawful executive action that violates the
Constitution. The President and liberal Democrats need to stop playing
politics with our national security by catering to illegal immigrants
instead of fighting for American citizens. Members of Congress were elected
to represent the will of their constituents and should not rely on the
judicial branch to protect them from difficult votes. The House has
passed legislation to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security
while prohibiting the Presidents unconstitutional executive amnesty.
The House should insist on our position and conference with the Senate.
I will never support amnesty for illegal immigrants. I will continue
to push my colleagues to stand up against these lawless actions of the
President and to stand with the conservative principles that support
and defend the rule of law."
