Dear Fellow Coloradan,
When we bank on students, we are making a long-term investment in Colorado and the nation&rsquo;s economy. That&rsquo;s why I led the fight two months ago to pass my deficit-neutral plan to help many of the 760,000 Coloradans who carry student loan debt and millions more nationwide refinance their student loans. The Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act would put more money in Coloradans&rsquo; pockets by allowing them to refinance their student loan debt at today&rsquo;s low interest rates, potentially saving college graduates thousands of dollars.
But a minority in the U.S. Senate refused to even debate this common-sense plan. Instead of tackling one of our nation&rsquo;s most pressing issues, a group of senators ignored the best interests of Coloradans by putting their partisan agenda first. But I haven&rsquo;t given up. Instead, the stories of the Coloradans I meet with every day only strengthens my commitment to make higher education more accessible and affordable.
Hardworking Coloradans need Congress to help them address the mounting burden of student debt instead of turning a blind eye to the problem like many in Washington are content to do.
When I asked you to share what you&rsquo;d do if you could refinance your student debt, I was overwhelmed by your responses. Here&rsquo;s what some of you told me on Twitter:
Nearly 1 in 6 Coloradans carries student loans with interest rates as high as 14 percent, and they each have their own stories about what they would do with money saved from refinancing their loans. Some dream of starting a small business and creating jobs in their community. Others want to save for a house and prepare to start a family &mdash; or support the ones they already have.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve fought to allow Coloradans to refinance their student loans and invest in not only themselves, but also our economy &mdash; and I&rsquo;m proud to have you by my side supporting this common-sense idea.
Congress must act to restore opportunity to Coloradans with student debt. Join my call to pass the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.
I&rsquo;ll never give up on fighting for the hundreds of thousands of Coloradans with student loan debt. The mountain may be high, but we&rsquo;ll summit it together.
Warm regards,
Offices
