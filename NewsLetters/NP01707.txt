Kansas Common Sense
March 30, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Senate Passes Moran VA Amendment on 40-Mile Eligibility
In a rare 100-to-0 vote on the Senate Floor, on Thursday the entire
U.S. Senate passed my amendment (#356) to the Budget Resolution (S.
Con. Res. 11) to make clear the Senate's overwhelming support to
require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement the
Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (the Choice Act)
as Congress intended. By passing Amendment #356, the entire United
States Senate has joined me in calling on the VA to provide veterans
access to non-VA health care when the nearest VA medical facility
within 40 miles drive time from a veteran's home is incapable of
offering the care sought by the veteran.
By currently refusing to consider whether the VA facility within 40
miles of where a veteran lives actually offers the care a veteran
needs, the VA is forcing thousands of veterans to choose between
traveling hours to a VA medical facility, paying out of pocket, or
going without care altogether. This is of particular concern to rural
veterans in Kansas may not live near a VA medical facility that is
capable of offering the care they need. For example, if you are a rural
veteran and there is a VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC)
within
40 miles of your home, the VA states you are not eligible and
don't qualify for the Choice Act even though that CBOC doesn't provide
the service that you need.
This is a significant problem and instance where the VA continues to
lack common sense by not putting veterans first. When the Senate and
House came together to pass the bipartisan Choice Act last August, we
told veterans they would now have a choice when it came to their health
care. Now we need to make certain those who are entitled to benefits
are receiving them. This is not a Republican issue, this is not a
Democrat issue. This is an American issue that mostly calls for common
sense.
The amendment passed by the Senate mirrors bipartisan legislation I've
introduced, theVeterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015 (S. 207),
which is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 19 Senators. The bill has
been endorsed by numerous veterans' organizations including the
American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of
America and the National Guard Association of the United States as well
as the National Rural Health Association.
I am hopeful that the strong support conveyed by the Senate's passage
of Amendment #356 this week will encourage a passage of S. 207 out of
the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and a vote on the Senate Floor in
the very near future. I spoke on the Senate floor prior to the vote on
Amendment #356, describing the ongoing problem veterans' face accessing
the care they were promised through the Choice Act. Click here
to watch my speech.
Senate Passes Balanced Budget
Early Friday morning, following 15 hours of amendment votes, the Senate
passed S. Con. Res. 11, the budget blueprint for Fiscal Year 2016. In
all, the Senate voted on 49 amendments offered by both Republicans and
Democrats to the budget resolution, related to wide-ranging issues such
as defense spending, Iran sanctions, estate taxes and Obamacare. The
budget passage sets the stage for conference negotiations with the
House of Representatives, which passed its own budget resolution on
Thursday. Congress has not successfully adopted a budget conference
report since 2009, an important duty of governing which the new
Republican Senate majority is eager to restore.
Having offered several amendments to the budget resolution, I am
pleased that two of them were ultimately passed. By a roll call vote of
100-0, the Senate passed my amendment #356 calling on the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide veterans access to
non-VA health care when the nearest VA medical facility within 40 miles
drive time from a veteran's home is incapable of offering the treatment
needed. Later in the evening, my amendment #1099 to support biomedical
research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was passed by
voice vote.
The Senate budget resolution balances the Federal budget within 10
years and creates a surplus by FY 2025, no easy task given the $7.6
trillion currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
to be added to our national deficit during that timeframe. While
President Obama's FY 2016 budget request raises taxes by $1.8 trillion
to finance new spending, the Senate budget protects Americans from new
taxes and institutes several budget process reforms to reduce wasteful
spending and increase transparency. By CBO estimates, the balanced
budget and reduced regulatory burdens of the Senate budget will
stimulate economic growth and result in as many as one million new jobs
over the next decade. It is my hope that the House and Senate can
resolve budget differences in a timely fashion, and produce a fiscally
responsible budget to finally get our country's finances back under
control.
Supporting Life-Saving Medical Research
During the debate this week of the Senate Budget Resolution for Fiscal
Year 2016 (S. Con. Res. 11), I offered an amendment to support
biomedical research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - the
focal point of our nation's medical research. The Senate passed this
amendment, which stresses the benefits of investment in biomedical
research, in an effort to keep up with the rate of biomedical
inflation. It prioritizes medical research funding without adding a
penny to the nation's annual deficit.
Medical research supported by NIH has changed the lives of millions of
Americans and has the potential to impact millions more - offering them
hope for the future. Now is not the time to waiver on America's
commitment to advancing disease cures and treatments. Without
consistent, strong support of NIH, our nation is at risk of
jeopardizing patient treatment advancements, losing our position as a
global medical research leader, and squandering the opportunity to
drive economic growth and reduce health care costs. As a member of the
Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, I remain committed to
working in a bipartisan manner to support the critical federal
investment in NIH.
By harnessing decades of research, the life expectancy of the average
American increased by eight years between 1970 and 2013. Deaths from
heart disease have fallen by more than 60 percent since 1970. Cancer
mortality rates have steadily declined since 1990 and today more than
12 million Americans are cancer survivors. Despite significant advances
in research, much work still remains. Nearly every family has been
touched by disease. Around 600,000 Americans will die of cancer this
year, and half of all men and a third of all women will be diagnosed
with cancer in their lifetimes. An American is diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease every minute. Without NIH support, critical
research to cure diseases and save lives will stall. Click here
to read more about the
importance of biomedical research.
Budget Amendment to Protect Second Amendment Rights
I sponsored an amendment (#385) this week to the Senate Budget
Resolution for Fiscal Year 2016 (S. Con. Res. 11) to help protect and
preserve the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The
amendment would prevent taxpayer funding toward the implementation of
the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty (U.N. ATT) - or any other international
organization established to implement the U.N. ATT - before Senate
ratification and the implementation of legislation from both the House
and Senate.
The U.N. ATT is now in force since more than 50 countries have ratified
the treaty. A secretariat of the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade
Treaty oversees the practical and logistical arrangements related to
the work of the Conference. In discussions of providing funding to the
Secretariat, many nations supported the idea that all signatory
countries contribute, of which the United States is one. This would
require the United States to contribute 22 percent of the funding - in
line with their contribution level to the U.N. as a whole.
Despite the Obama Administration formally signing the ATT in September
2013, the Senate opposition to this Treaty in the 114th Congress
remains strong and continues to grow. I will continue to fight to
uphold the fundamental individual rights of Americans by reiterating
our rejection of the ATT.
Permanent Medicare Payment Reform
On Thursday, the House of Representatives approved legislation to
repeal the broken Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula by a
bipartisan vote of 392-37. This measure has been sent to the Senate for
consideration. Medicare reimbursement to physicians is currently
calculated through the SGR. This formula, which I did not support when
it was created, was introduced as a way to contain the growth in health
spending, but more than a decade of short-term "SGR patches" have
frustrated health care providers, threatened access for Medicare
beneficiaries, and created budgetary dilemmas for Congress. During this
time, Congress has spent nearly $150 billion on these temporary
patches. I spoke on the Senate floor Thursday morning about the urgent
need to permanently repeal and replace the SGR formula. Click here
to view my remarks.
To preserve medical access for Kansans, physicians and other health
care providers must receive appropriate reimbursement for the care they
provide. The reality is patient care suffers when providers are forced
to endure an exasperating wait-and-see game every few months to find
out what amount they will be reimbursed for the care they provide.
Rather than continually punting responsibility for this issue to a
later date, Congress can - and must - do better. We can end this
piecemeal approach to legislating and come together to permanently
repeal the SGR in a fiscally responsible manner. I urge the Senate to
take up this SGR repeal legislation without delay.
Questioning Bill Gates on Polio Eradication Efforts
On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign
Operations and Related Programs held a hearing to discuss health and
development issues in Africa. Those testifying included Bill Gates,
former NATO Commander Admiral James Stavridis, and Oscar-winning
director Ben Affleck. I had the opportunity to ask Mr. Gates about
polio eradication efforts and get the panel's insight on how the
American response to the Ebola crisis will help prevent the next
pandemic. I was pleased to hear progress that is being made against
infectious diseases and economic growth. The health, security and
economic challenges facing so many African nations may impact our
country in the coming years, and the assistance of generous individuals
and the U.S. government can ensure a safe, prosperous future.
USDA: Farm Bill Crop Insurance Provision Ready for Wheat & Commodity
Program Sign-up Deadline Extended
This week, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced that USDA
will extend the deadline for farmers to sign up for the new Farm Bill
commodity programs - Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss
Coverage (PLC) - until Tuesday, April 7. The Agriculture Department
will also extend the deadline for producers to reallocate base acres
and update yields to the same date. Producers who have not signed up
yet should visit their county FSA offices for more information.
USDA also confirmed the Actual Production History (APH) Yield
Exclusion, a new crop insurance provision created in the 2014 Farm
Bill, will be available for producers who plant winter wheat this
coming fall. The provision was implemented by USDA in time for crops
planted this spring, but not for wheat planted in the fall of 2014. It
is intended to assist producers in drought stricken areas who have seen
diminishing insurable yields on crop insurance policies. The provision
allows farmers to exclude yields from their individual APH when the
average yield in a county or surrounding county is 50 percent below the
county's 10-year average. At a recent Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee hearing, I pressed Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to
make certain the provision was ready in time so that Kansas wheat
producers may see its potential benefits on their next crop.
I will continue to work with Secretary Vilsack on Farm Bill
implementation as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee. It's important that producers have the risk management
tools available to effectively operate their farm and ranch, including
the Farm Bill commodity and crop insurance provisions. Click here
to learn more.
National Cattlemen's Beef Association Legislative Conference
This week, I had the opportunity to speak to cattle producers from
across Kansas and the nation at the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association Legislative Conference. When you come from a state that has
twice as many cows as people, you feel pretty comfortable among that
crowd. We discussed a number of important issues impacting cattle
producers, including regulatory overreach by the federal government and
the misguided Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report that was
recently released. As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee, I will continue to work to keep the government out of the
way so this important Kansas industry can thrive. I enjoyed the
conversations I had at the conference and look forward to continuing to
advocate on behalf of Kansas beef in the Senate.
Salina Farm Show
I hosted a booth at the 50th Annual Mid America Farm Exposition in
Salina this week. The three-day event featured more than 325 exhibitors
who highlighted the latest in farming technology and practices. The
Expo has grown to become one of the largest spring farm shows in the
Midwest, attracting more than 10,000 people each year. Topics of
conversation at my booth ranged from the Farm Bill and crop insurance,
to the FAA to rural Kansas. Thanks again to everyone who shared their
thoughts and concerns with my staff this week.
Visiting Ceva Animal Health
Before returning to Washington, D.C., on Monday, I visited Ceva Animal
Health in Lenexa. Ceva is one of the world's top 10 animal health
companies with 3,750 employees globally. They have expanded several
times in Lenexa to increase vaccine production capacity, and are
currently completing construction of a new building and starting
construction on another. Thanks to CEO Daryl Pint for the tour and
informative visit, and thanks also to Lenexa Mayor Mike Boehm and
Lenexa Chamber of Commerce President Blake Schreck for joining me.
Now Accepting 2015 Service Academy Applications
Even as students are beginning their summer breaks, I want to remind
them of the opportunity to apply to a United States Service Academy.
Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.;
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; the U.S. Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings
Point, N.Y., is one of my favorite duties as a U.S. Senator.
To find out the requirements and apply, please download an application
from my website or contact my Olathe office. All application materials
are due to my Olathe office by September 4, 2015. After applications
have been reviewed, applicants will be notified of interviews with my
Service Academy Selection Board, which will take place on Saturday,
September 26, 2015, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene.
Kansas College Basketball on National Stage
I was proud to see two of our Kansas teams in the NCAA March Madness
Men's Basketball Tournament this year. Both the University of Kansas
and Wichita State University had fantastic seasons and their spots in
the tournament were well deserved.
KU won their 11th straight
conference championship in the Big 12, while Wichita State's regular
season record was strong enough to win an at-large bid coming out of
the Missouri Valley conference. Their winning seasons resulted both
teams having to play each other in the second round of the tournament,
with Wichita State knocking KU out and moving on to play Notre Dame in
the Sweet Sixteen. I was hoping to see Wichita State defeat Notre Dame,
taking to the Senate floor in my black and gold tie Thursday to support
the team, but unfortunately they lost later that night. Congratulations
to both University of Kansas and Wichita State University on their
success this year in men's basketball and I hope this success is
continued in future years.

Senate
Passes
Moran
VA
Amendment
on
40-Mile
Eligibility
In
a
rare
100-to-0
vote
on
the
Senate
Floor,
on
Thursday
the
entire
U.S.
Senate
passed
my
amendment
(#356)
to
the
Budget
Resolution
(S.
Con.
Res.
11)
to
make
clear
the
Senate's
overwhelming
support
to
require
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
to
implement
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(the
Choice
Act)
as
Congress
intended.
By
passing
Amendment
#356,
the
entire
United
States
Senate
has
joined
me
in
calling
on
the
VA
to
provide
veterans
access
to
non-VA
health
care
when
the
nearest
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
drive
time
from
a
veteran's
home
is
incapable
of
offering
the
care
sought
by
the
veteran.
By
currently
refusing
to
consider
whether
the
VA
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
a
veteran
lives
actually
offers
the
care
a
veteran
needs,
the
VA
is
forcing
thousands
of
veterans
to
choose
between
traveling
hours
to
a
VA
medical
facility,
paying
out
of
pocket,
or
going
without
care
altogether.
This
is
of
particular
concern
to
rural
veterans
in
Kansas
may
not
live
near
a
VA
medical
facility
that
is
capable
of
offering
the
care
they
need.
For
example,
if
you
are
a
rural
veteran
and
there is
a
VA
Community-Based
Outpatient
Clinic
(CBOC)
within
40
miles
of
your
home,
the
VA states
you
are
not
eligible
and
don't
qualify
for
the
Choice
Act
even
though
that
CBOC
doesn't
provide
the
service
that you
need.
This
is
a
significant
problem
and
instance
where
the
VA
continues
to
lack
common
sense
by
not
putting
veterans
first.
When
the
Senate
and
House
came
together
to
pass
the
bipartisan
Choice
Act
last
August,
we
told
veterans
they
would
now
have
a
choice
when
it
came
to
their
health
care.
Now
we
need
to make
certain
those
who
are entitled
to
benefits
are receiving
them. This
is
not
a
Republican
issue, this
is
not
a
Democrat
issue. This
is
an
American
issue
that mostly
calls
for
common
sense.
The
amendment
passed
by
the
Senate
mirrors
bipartisan
legislation
I've
introduced,
the Veterans
Access
to
Community
Care
Act
of
2015
(S.
207),
which
is
cosponsored
by
a
bipartisan
group
of
19
Senators.
The
bill
has
been
endorsed
by
numerous
veterans'
organizations
including
the
American
Legion,
Veterans
of
Foreign
Wars,
AMVETS,
Vietnam
Veterans
of
America
and
the
National
Guard
Association
of
the
United
States
as
well
as
the
National
Rural
Health
Association.
I
am
hopeful
that
the
strong
support
conveyed
by
the
Senate's
passage
of
Amendment
#356
this
week
will
encourage
a
passage
of
S.
207
out
of
the
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
and
a
vote
on
the
Senate
Floor
in
the
very
near
future.
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
prior
to
the
vote
on
Amendment
#356,
describing
the
ongoing
problem
veterans'
face
accessing
the
care
they
were
promised
through
the
Choice
Act.

Senate
Passes
Balanced
Budget
Early
Friday
morning,
following
15
hours
of
amendment
votes,
the
Senate
passed
S.
Con.
Res.
11,
the
budget
blueprint
for
Fiscal
Year
2016.
In
all,
the
Senate
voted
on
49
amendments
offered
by
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
to
the
budget
resolution,
related
to
wide-ranging
issues
such
as
defense
spending,
Iran
sanctions,
estate
taxes
and
Obamacare.
The
budget
passage
sets
the
stage
for
conference
negotiations
with
the
House
of
Representatives,
which
passed
its
own
budget
resolution
on
Thursday.
Congress
has
not
successfully
adopted
a
budget
conference
report
since
2009,
an
important
duty
of
governing
which
the
new
Republican
Senate
majority
is
eager
to
restore.
Having
offered
several
amendments
to
the
budget
resolution,
I
am
pleased
that
two
of
them
were
ultimately
passed.
By
a
roll
call
vote
of
100-0,
the
Senate
passed
my
amendment
#356
calling
on
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
to
provide
veterans
access
to
non-VA
health
care
when
the
nearest
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
drive
time
from
a
veteran's
home
is
incapable
of
offering
the
treatment
needed.
Later
in
the
evening,
my
amendment
#1099
to
support
biomedical
research
and
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
was
passed
by
voice
vote.
The
Senate
budget
resolution
balances
the
Federal
budget
within
10
years
and
creates
a
surplus
by
FY
2025,
no
easy
task
given
the
$7.6
trillion
currently
projected
by
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
to
be
added
to
our
national
deficit
during
that
timeframe.
While
President
Obama's
FY
2016
budget
request
raises
taxes
by
$1.8
trillion
to
finance
new
spending,
the
Senate
budget
protects
Americans
from
new
taxes
and
institutes
several
budget
process
reforms
to
reduce
wasteful
spending
and
increase
transparency.
By
CBO
estimates,
the
balanced
budget
and
reduced
regulatory
burdens
of
the
Senate
budget
will
stimulate
economic
growth
and
result
in
as
many
as
one
million
new
jobs
over
the
next
decade.
It
is
my
hope
that
the
House
and
Senate
can
resolve
budget
differences
in
a
timely
fashion,
and
produce
a
fiscally
responsible
budget
to
finally
get
our
country's
finances
back
under
control.
Supporting
Life-Saving
Medical
Research
During
the
debate
this
week
of
the
Senate
Budget
Resolution
for
Fiscal
Year
2016
(S.
Con.
Res.
11),
I
offered
an
amendment
to
support
biomedical
research
and
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
&ndash;
the
focal
point
of
our
nation's
medical
research.
The
Senate
passed
this
amendment,
which
stresses
the
benefits
of
investment
in
biomedical
research,
in
an
effort
to
keep
up
with
the
rate
of
biomedical
inflation.
It
prioritizes
medical
research
funding
without
adding
a
penny
to
the
nation's
annual
deficit.
Medical
research
supported
by
NIH
has
changed
the
lives
of
millions
of
Americans
and
has
the
potential
to
impact
millions
more
&ndash;
offering
them
hope
for
the
future.
Now
is
not
the
time
to
waiver
on
America's
commitment
to
advancing
disease
cures
and
treatments.
Without
consistent,
strong
support
of
NIH,
our
nation
is
at
risk
of
jeopardizing
patient
treatment
advancements,
losing
our
position
as
a
global
medical
research
leader,
and
squandering
the
opportunity
to
drive
economic
growth
and
reduce
health
care
costs.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
I
remain
committed
to
working
in
a
bipartisan
manner
to
support
the
critical
federal
investment
in
NIH.
By
harnessing
decades
of
research,
the
life
expectancy
of
the
average
American
increased
by
eight
years
between
1970
and
2013.
Deaths
from
heart
disease
have
fallen
by
more
than
60
percent
since
1970.
Cancer
mortality
rates
have
steadily
declined
since
1990
and
today
more
than
12
million
Americans
are
cancer
survivors.
Despite
significant
advances
in
research,
much
work
still
remains.
Nearly
every
family
has
been
touched
by
disease.
Around
600,000
Americans
will
die
of
cancer
this
year,
and
half
of
all
men
and
a
third
of
all
women
will
be
diagnosed
with
cancer
in
their
lifetimes.
An
American
is
diagnosed
with
Alzheimer's
disease
every
minute.
Without
NIH
support,
critical
research
to
cure
diseases
and
save
lives
will
stall.

Budget
Amendment
to
Protect
Second
Amendment
Rights
I
sponsored
an
amendment
(#385)
this
week
to
the
Senate
Budget
Resolution
for
Fiscal
Year
2016
(S.
Con.
Res.
11)
to
help
protect
and
preserve
the
Second
Amendment
rights
of
law-abiding
citizens.
The
amendment
would
prevent
taxpayer
funding
toward
the
implementation
of
the
U.N.
Arms
Trade
Treaty
(U.N.
ATT)
&ndash;
or
any
other
international
organization
established
to
implement
the
U.N.
ATT
&ndash;
before
Senate
ratification
and
the
implementation
of
legislation
from
both
the
House
and
Senate.
The
U.N.
ATT
is
now
in
force
since
more
than
50
countries
have
ratified
the
treaty.
A
secretariat
of
the
U.N.
Conference
on
the
Arms
Trade
Treaty
oversees
the
practical
and
logistical
arrangements
related
to
the
work
of
the
Conference.
In
discussions
of
providing
funding
to
the
Secretariat,
many
nations
supported
the
idea
that
all
signatory
countries
contribute,
of
which
the
United
States
is
one.
This
would
require
the
United
States
to
contribute
22
percent
of
the
funding
&ndash;
in
line
with
their
contribution
level
to
the
U.N.
as
a
whole.
Despite
the
Obama
Administration
formally
signing
the
ATT
in
September
2013,
the
Senate
opposition
to
this
Treaty
in
the
114 th
Congress
remains
strong
and
continues
to
grow.
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
uphold
the
fundamental
individual
rights
of
Americans
by
reiterating
our
rejection
of
the
ATT.
Permanent
Medicare
Payment
Reform
On
Thursday,
the
House
of
Representatives
approved
legislation
to
repeal
the
broken
Medicare
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
(SGR)
formula
by
a
bipartisan
vote
of
392-37.
This
measure
has
been
sent
to
the
Senate
for
consideration.
Medicare
reimbursement
to
physicians
is
currently
calculated
through
the
SGR.
This
formula,
which
I
did
not
support
when
it
was
created,
was
introduced
as
a
way
to
contain
the
growth
in
health
spending,
but
more
than
a
decade
of
short-term
"SGR
patches"
have
frustrated
health
care
providers,
threatened
access
for
Medicare
beneficiaries,
and
created
budgetary
dilemmas
for
Congress.
During
this
time,
Congress
has
spent
nearly
$150
billion
on
these
temporary
patches.
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
Thursday
morning
about
the
urgent
need
to
permanently
repeal
and
replace
the
SGR
formula.
Click
here to
view
my
remarks.
To
preserve
medical
access
for
Kansans,
physicians
and
other
health
care
providers
must
receive
appropriate
reimbursement
for
the
care
they
provide.
The
reality
is
patient
care
suffers
when
providers
are
forced
to
endure
an
exasperating
wait-and-see
game
every
few
months
to
find
out
what
amount
they
will
be
reimbursed
for
the
care
they
provide.
Rather
than
continually
punting
responsibility
for
this
issue
to
a
later
date,
Congress
can
&ndash;
and
must
&ndash;
do
better.
We
can
end
this
piecemeal
approach
to
legislating
and
come
together
to
permanently
repeal
the
SGR
in
a
fiscally
responsible
manner. I
urge
the
Senate
to
take
up
this
SGR
repeal
legislation
without
delay.
Questioning
Bill
Gates
on
Polio
Eradication
Efforts
On
Thursday,
the
Senate
Appropriations
Subcommittee
on
State,
Foreign
Operations
and
Related
Programs
held
a
hearing
to
discuss
health
and
development
issues
in
Africa.
Those
testifying
included
Bill
Gates,
former
NATO
Commander
Admiral
James
Stavridis,
and
Oscar-winning
director
Ben
Affleck.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
Mr.
Gates
about
polio
eradication
efforts
and
get
the
panel's
insight
on
how
the
American
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
will
help
prevent
the
next
pandemic.
I
was
pleased
to
hear
progress
that
is
being
made
against
infectious
diseases
and
economic
growth.
The
health,
security
and
economic
challenges
facing
so
many
African
nations
may
impact
our
country
in
the
coming
years,
and
the
assistance
of
generous
individuals
and
the
U.S.
government
can
ensure
a
safe,
prosperous
future.
USDA:
Farm
Bill
Crop
Insurance
Provision
Ready
for
Wheat
&amp;
Commodity
Program
Sign-up
Deadline
Extended
This
week,
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
announced
that
USDA
will
extend
the
deadline
for
farmers
to
sign
up
for
the
new
Farm
Bill
commodity
programs
&ndash;
Agricultural
Risk
Coverage
(ARC)
and
Price
Loss
Coverage
(PLC)
&ndash;
until
Tuesday,
April
7.
The
Agriculture
Department
will
also
extend
the
deadline
for
producers
to
reallocate
base
acres
and
update
yields
to
the
same
date.
Producers
who
have
not
signed
up
yet
should
visit
their
county
FSA
offices
for
more
information.
USDA
also
confirmed
the
Actual
Production
History
(APH)
Yield
Exclusion,
a
new
crop
insurance
provision
created
in
the
2014
Farm
Bill,
will
be
available
for
producers
who
plant
winter
wheat
this
coming
fall.
The
provision
was
implemented
by
USDA
in
time
for
crops
planted
this
spring,
but
not
for
wheat
planted
in
the
fall
of
2014.
It
is
intended
to
assist
producers
in
drought
stricken
areas
who
have
seen
diminishing
insurable
yields
on
crop
insurance
policies.
The
provision
allows
farmers
to
exclude
yields
from
their
individual
APH
when
the
average
yield
in
a
county
or
surrounding
county
is
50
percent
below
the
county's
10-year
average.
At
a
recent
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
hearing,
I
pressed
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
to
make
certain
the
provision
was
ready
in
time
so
that
Kansas
wheat
producers
may
see
its
potential
benefits
on
their
next
crop.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
Secretary
Vilsack
on
Farm
Bill
implementation
as
chairman
of
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee.
It's
important
that
producers
have
the
risk
management
tools
available
to
effectively
operate
their
farm
and
ranch,
including
the
Farm
Bill
commodity
and
crop
insurance
provisions.

National
Cattlemen's
Beef
Association
Legislative
Conference
This
week,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
cattle
producers
from
across
Kansas
and
the
nation
at
the
National
Cattlemen's
Beef
Association
Legislative
Conference.
When
you
come
from
a
state
that
has
twice
as
many
cows
as
people,
you
feel
pretty
comfortable
among
that
crowd.
We
discussed
a
number
of
important
issues
impacting
cattle
producers,
including
regulatory
overreach
by
the
federal
government
and
the
misguided
Dietary
Guidelines
Advisory
Committee
report
that
was
recently
released.
As
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
will
continue
to
work
to
keep
the
government
out
of
the
way
so
this
important
Kansas
industry
can
thrive.
I
enjoyed
the
conversations
I
had
at
the
conference
and
look
forward
to
continuing
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
Kansas
beef
in
the
Senate.
Salina
Farm
Show
I
hosted
a
booth
at
the
50th
Annual
Mid
America
Farm
Exposition
in
Salina
this
week.
The
three-day
event
featured
more
than
325
exhibitors
who
highlighted
the
latest
in
farming
technology
and
practices.
The
Expo
has
grown
to
become
one
of
the
largest
spring
farm
shows
in
the
Midwest,
attracting
more
than
10,000
people
each
year.
Topics
of
conversation
at
my
booth
ranged
from
the
Farm
Bill
and
crop
insurance,
to
the
FAA
to
rural
Kansas.
Thanks
again
to
everyone
who
shared
their
thoughts
and
concerns
with
my
staff

Visiting
Ceva
Animal
Health
Before
returning
to
Washington,
D.C.,
on
Monday,
I
visited
Ceva
Animal
Health
in
Lenexa.
Ceva
is
one
of
the
world's
top
10
animal
health
companies
with
3,750
employees
globally.
They
have
expanded
several
times
in
Lenexa
to
increase
vaccine
production
capacity,
and
are
currently
completing
construction
of
a
new
building
and
starting
construction
on
another.
Thanks
to
CEO
Daryl
Pint
for
the
tour
and
informative
visit,
and
thanks
also
to
Lenexa
Mayor
Mike
Boehm
and
Lenexa
Chamber
of
Commerce
President
Blake
Schreck
for
joining
me.
Now
Accepting
2015

Even
as

are
beginning
their
summer
breaks,
I
want
to
remind
them
of
the
opportunity
to

to
a
United
States
Service
Academy.

Kansas
College
Basketball
on
National
Stage
I
was
proud
to
see
two
of
our
Kansas
teams
in
the
NCAA
March
Madness
Men's
Basketball
Tournament
this
year.
Both
the
University
of
Kansas
and
Wichita
State
University
had
fantastic
seasons
and
their
spots
in
the
tournament
were
well
deserved.
KU
won
their
11 th
straight
conference
championship
in
the
Big
12,
while
Wichita
State's
regular
season
record
was
strong
enough
to
win
an
at-large
bid
coming
out
of
the
Missouri
Valley
conference. Their
winning
seasons
resulted
both
teams
having
to
play
each
other
in
the
second
round
of
the
tournament,
with
Wichita
State
knocking
KU
out
and
moving
on
to
play
Notre
Dame
in
the
Sweet
Sixteen.
I
was
hoping
to
see
Wichita
State
defeat
Notre
Dame,
taking
to
the
Senate
floor
in
my
black
and
gold
tie
Thursday
to
support
the
team,
but
unfortunately
they
lost
later
that
night.
Congratulations
to
both
University
of
Kansas
and
Wichita
State
University
on
their
success
this
year
in
men's
basketball
and
I
hope
this
success
is
continued
in
future
years.
