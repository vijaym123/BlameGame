The
Senates Inaction Prevents Strong
Economic Recovery
Dear Friend,
As I spoke with constituents throughout
the district this month, the most common
theme, as I have heard so many times
before, is the need for Congress to pass
jobs bills that will promote economic
growth in our communities. Many hardworking
individuals are still looking for work, and
I share the frustrations of the industrious
Virginians with whom I spoke.
The House has been dedicated during this
session of Congress to enacting pro-growth
policies that will encourage job creation
and provide more opportunities for
hardworking families. Weve passed
dozens of jobs bills that would increase
our energy independence, cut unnecessary
red tape, improve educational
opportunities, and reduce federal spending.
Unfortunately, the Senate continues to
block
over
43 of these jobs bills
that would
provide common sense solutions.
Thats 43 opportunities to create
jobs. Thats 43 opportunities to get
Americans back to work.
I introduced one such bill,
the
Small Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act , which passed the
House with bipartisan support because of
its common sense approach to reining in the
red tape that hurts small business
investment in our communities. The bill
would promote greater access to capital for
small businesses, like Virginia Candle or
Commonwealth Laminating and Coating,
encouraging the creation of new jobs and
economic stimulation across the country. It
passed the House
nearly
nine months ago
but remains stuck in
the Senate with so many other bills.
The Senate isnt just letting the
dust pile up on jobs bills, it is refusing
to act on hundreds of other bills. At the
same time, the House has been working to
help the American people. The House has
passed
511
bills , while the Senate has passed less
than half that number, only 232. Included
in these numbers are appropriations bills
to fund key agencies of the federal
government, one of the most basic
constitutional duties of the Congress.
While the House has passed 7 appropriations
bills and 215 amendments in an open,
deliberative process, the Senate has
refused to consider a single appropriations
bill this year.
The Senates failure to pass the
43 jobs bills only fuels the
Washington-created uncertainty that is
stalling economic opportunities. We, in the
House, have been working to build a
stronger economy and create a better
future, and the Senate has prevented these
bills from helping the American people. Its
inaction is unacceptable. When Congress
returns in a week, I hope that our
colleagues in the Senate will take up the
Small Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act and the numerous other
jobs bills that will advance pro-growth
solutions and provide a stronger economic
recovery for hardworking Americans.
