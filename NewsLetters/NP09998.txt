Heller Urges Senate Committee to
Include Designation for I-11 from Las Vegas
to Northern Border
(Washington, D.C.)
Last
week, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) sent
a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member
of the Environment and Public Works
Committee asking them to include a
designation for the I-11 interstate from
Las Vegas to Nevadas northern
border. Heller specifically asked
that this designation be included in the
reauthorization of the Moving Ahead for
Progress in the 21
st
Century Act (MAP-21) so that
progress on this important project can move
forward in a timely manner.
A designation extending I-11 to
Nevadas northern border has the
potential to open even more markets for
tourism and trade, which will create jobs
and improve our economy throughout the
entire western United States, Heller
writes in the letter.
With legislative discussions
ongoing regarding the reauthorization of a
longer MAP-21 bill, continuing the
designation throughout the entire state
clearly reflects Nevadas growing
needs within the region that cannot afford
to wait years until the next
reauthorization bill is considered,
he continued.

May 1, 2014
Chairman Barbara Boxer
Senate Committee on Environment and Public
Works
Dirksen Senate Office Building Room 410
Washington, D.C. 20510-6175
Ranking Member David Vitter
Senate Committee on Environment and Public
Works
Dirksen Senate Office Building Room 456
Washington, D.C. 20510-6176
Dear Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member
Vitter:
I write to you today regarding the
importance of Interstate 11 (I-11) to the
citizens of Nevada and respectfully ask
that you include in the Moving Ahead for
Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)
reauthorization a designation for the
interstate from Las Vegas to the northern
border of Nevada. I appreciate the
opportunity to contact you regarding this
issue and look forward to working with you
to move legislation forward.
As you may know, Nevada welcomed close
to 40 million visitors last year which
supported 375,000 jobs, making up 46
percent of our workforce. A
designation extending I-11 to
Nevadas northern border has the
potential to open even more markets for
tourism and trade, which will create jobs
and improve our economy throughout the
entire western United States. That is
why a project like this will have the
regional and the national significance to
improve our economy that the Environment
and Public Works Committee has looked to
move forward under your
leadership.
Furthermore, the designation would
continue work done in the 2012 MAP-21 bill,
which included language that designated
I-11 between Las Vegas and Phoenix as part
of the Interstate Highway
System. This was an important
designation for Las Vegas as it advanced
the connection of the only two cities in
the nation with populations over 1 million
that are not already linked by an
interstate. With legislative
discussions ongoing regarding the
reauthorization of a longer MAP-21 bill,
continuing the designation throughout the
entire state clearly reflects
Nevadas growing needs within the
region that cannot afford to wait years
until the next reauthorization bill is
considered.
Thank you again for the opportunity to
share my support for extending I-11 to the
northern border of Nevada. The federal
government has a strong role to play in
these types of transportation projects
across the country, and I look forward to
working with you on a new Map-21
bill.
Sincerely,
Dean Heller
U.S. Senator
