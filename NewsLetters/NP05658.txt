Friend,
Well, there you have it.
The differences between my opponent and I could not be more clear.
I&#39;m focused on standing up to Wall Street and fighting for the middle class - Doug Ose struggled to name even three votes he&#39;s taken against Wall Street interests. I&#39;m for comprehensive immigration reform - Doug Ose is against it. And what&#39;s most shocking - he actually stands by his ill-advised vote to take us into the Iraq war, and is an advocate for putting more boots on the ground in the Middle East.
We CANNOT let someone who is this misguided and indecisive represent our district. But if we aren&#39;t able to respond to the MASSIVE amounts of outside spending we&#39;re facing, Doug Ose WILL be representing us as a Member of Congress.

PS - The contrasts between Doug Ose and I are quite stark. If we don&#39;t bulk up our reserves, Doug Ose will be our voice in Congress.
