Protecting
Americans Privacy on
Healthcare.gov
Dear Friend,
Hearing from those living and working in
Virginias Fifth District continues
to be my greatest resource as I serve them.
Their input has brought to light problems
created by some of the big government
programs coming out of Washington.
Recently, a constituent contacted our
office to express concern over the fact
that he was unable to delete his profile
from Healthcare.gov. Even though he
ultimately decided not to sign up for
healthcare coverage, he still could not
remove his profile from the site. When he
called the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), he was told there was
personal information that simply could not
be removed.
He then asked our office to contact HHS
and reiterate his request, but we were also
told applicants could delete applications
but could not remove all of their
information from the system. We found that
other people experienced the same problem,
so we continued to press HHS for answers
but received no justification for this
policy. It became clear that legislative
action would be necessary to ensure that
Americans can protect their personal
information. Repealing the President's
healthcare law and replacing it with
healthcare reform based upon
market-oriented principles remains one of
my top priorities, but with such sensitive
information at risk, this problem must be
resolved as soon as possible.
I recently introduced the Healthcare
Consumer Privacy Act, H.R. 5610, along with
my democratic colleague, Congressman John
Barrow of Georgia, which will enable
individuals to remove their profiles from
the federal healthcare website,
HealthCare.gov.
This issue is particularly critical
given all the reports over the past year
regarding the
security
vulnerabilities
of HealthCare.gov. In
July, HealthCare.gov was hacked, and
the
malicious software embedded in the site
was not even discovered for weeks. Two
weeks ago, the Government Accountability
Office (GAO)
released
a study
pointing out that several
privacy and security risks from the
sites launch, almost a full year
ago, had not yet been fixed. The GAO
reported that there are still serious risks
of unauthorized access, disclosure, and
modification to all information collected
and maintained by this website.
This administration has been so focused
on getting Healthcare.gov to function at a
basic level that it did not take sufficient
action to ensure that users personal
information will be protected. Given the
outrageous amount of money the
administration has spent building the
website -
more
than $2 billion according to the most
recent report
- it is astonishing that
these digital vulnerabilities persist,
jeopardizing the personal information of
millions of Americans.
These grave security concerns make it
even more imperative that individuals have
the ability to remove their personal
information permanently from
Healthcare.gov, which this bill enables.
The bipartisan Healthcare Consumer Privacy
Act is a direct response to these concerns
about privacy and the protection of
personal information for those using
Healthcare.gov, and it is a compliment to
the robust oversight we in the House are
conducting to press the administration to
protect this data.
While I still believe we need repeal the
President's healthcare law and replace it
with real healthcare reform based upon
market-oriented principles, the Healthcare
Consumer Privacy Act is a critical step
forward. It is my hope this bill moves
swiftly through the legislative process. I
look forward to working with Representative
Barrow and my colleagues to ensure that
individual privacy is protected.
