WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week started off with much
excitement as I hosted the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (PA-9) in the Third District to tour the
regions infrastructure, including Interstate 49 (I-49) and the
McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS).
I appreciate the
Chairman taking the time to come to the Third District!
It was a
rare opportunity to highlight the critical need to complete the
upgrades to I-49, MKARNS, and other ongoing projects and showcase what we
already know: investing in their continued development will create
thousands of jobs and will be a boon to our economy.

more about his visit in
this Times Record

On
Tuesday, I attended an event for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation in
Rogers, where I saw my great friend and the events special guest, Coach
Tommy Tice! You can read more about Coach Tice and his story from the
Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette .
On Wednesday, I headed down to
Farmington, where I hosted Coffee with the Congressman. Thank you to all
of you who took time out of their mornings to share coffee and your
questions with me.
After coffee, I went over to Bob Folsom
Elementary to visit with the schools students. I also made sure to stop by
the Farmington School Administration Building and talk football with
Athletic Director Brad Blew. Go Cardinals!
From there, I sat down
with Mayor Rossetti and other West Fork community leaders for an
update on the city.
I spent Thursday in Gentry, where I started off the day
with another Coffee with the Congressman. I truly enjoy these
opportunities to visit with you and hear whats on your minds. My thanks to all
those in attendance. Following coffee, I headed to Gentry High to tour
the school.
I was extremely impressed by both the students and
the facilities. Go Pioneers! And thanks for having
me.
While in Gentry, I stopped by
Mid-America Cabinet Company to see the companys facilities and hear about
the impact of overregulation on small businesses in the Third
District.
I also swung by McKee Foods to get a complete tour of their
Gentry facility, meet with several of McKees employees, and discuss new
employee training and increasing technical education to prepare
Gentrys top notch high school students for good jobs after graduation in
the company.
On
Friday, I attended a roundtable discussion at Crafton Tull to talk about
everything from tax and regulatory reform to national security. Thank
you for the opportunity!
Tomorrow, I am looking forward to cheering on the Razorbacks as they take on
the Crimson Tide. Woo Pig Sooie!
