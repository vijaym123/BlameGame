MISS. DELEGATION ENDORSES FEDERAL
DISASTER DECLARATION
Lawmakers Send Letter to President Seeking Approval of State Request for Dec. 23 Storm Recovery
WASHINGTON, DC
A united Mississippi congressional delegation has endorsed Mississippi Governor Phil Bryants recent request for a federal disaster declaration for areas of the state that sustained extensive tornado and severe storm damage on Dec. 23, including Marion and Jones counties.
U.S. Senators Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., with U.S. Representatives Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., Gregg Harper, R-Miss., Alan Nunnelee, R-Miss., and Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., signed a letter to President Obama asking for full consideration of the states request for a major federal disaster declaration, including hazard mitigation assistance statewide.
We understand that the State of Mississippi and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) jointly continue to assess the damage across the state.
Should the state request federal disaster declarations for other counties, we are hopeful you will also give these requests your full consideration, the federal lawmakers wrote.
We stand ready to face this new challenge by supporting the local communities, the State, and your administration as we work together to rebuild and renew areas destroyed by this major storm, they added in the letter received by the White House on Monday.
