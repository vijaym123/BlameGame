Dear Friend,
Since coming to Washington, I have
fought for policies that will help
hardworking Ohio families keep more of
their paychecks and make it easier for the
next generation of Americans to succeed. We
all know that a higher education opens the
door to well-paying jobs and expanded
opportunity, however, the rising cost of
college is making it difficult for families
and students to afford that education.
Earlier this week, the Associated Press
reported that 11 of the 13 traditional,
four-year public universities in Ohio will
increase tuition this fall. According to
the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), the
total cost of paying for college is higher
in Ohio compared with public institutions
in other states. In fact, five Ohio schools
were among the top 25 schools with the
highest overall cost in the country.
With tuition prices climbing in Ohio and
throughout America, it is becoming more and
more difficult for families to plan for
sending their children to college. This is
in part due to our broken tax code and its
15 complicated, overlapping education
provisions that take the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) 90 pages to explain. Though I
remain a strong proponent for comprehensive
tax reform, its critical that we
simplify the education tax benefits so that
families can actually use them.
This week, we in the House of
Representatives will consider the Student
and Family Tax Simplification Act. This
legislation consolidates four current tax
benefits for higher education (the American
Opportunity Tax Credit, the Hope
Scholarship Credit, the Lifetime Learning
Credit, and the college tuition deduction)
into a new, simplified and more beneficial
American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC).
Specifically, this bill provides a 100
percent tax credit for the first $2,000 of
certain higher education expenses and a 25
percent tax credit for the next $2,000 of
such expenses. It makes the first $1,500 of
the credit refundable, meaning students get
the benefit even if they have no income tax
liability. Lastly, this legislation would
provide greater tax benefits for those
students most in need by improving the tax
treatment of Pell Grants and the
coordination between Pell Grants and the
AOTC.
We need to do our part to make higher
education more affordable. This includes
passing legislation that will get our
economy back on track so that students and
families are earning enough to afford a
quality education. That is why I have
consistently advocated for solutions that
will ease the squeeze on the middle class
by supporting policies that will increase
take home pay. I look forward to voting in
favor of the Student and Family Tax
Simplification Act, and I hope to see this
bipartisan legislation receive strong
support from my friends on both sides of
the aisle.
