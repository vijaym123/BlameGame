Growing American Jobs
The most pressing issue for our country today is how to grow our
economy, create jobs, and get Americans back to work. My SKILLS Act
is a great step towards doing this, streamlining a maze of
duplicative federal job training programs in order to make them more
efficient, more responsive to hiring needs, and able to help more
Americans get the training that will land them in good-paying jobs.
Watch me address the need for economic growth and the SKILLS Act in
this week's Republican Weekly Address.

Building on the South Carolina Apprenticeship Model
Apprenticeships are a proven way to get people into skilled jobs, and
South Carolina's model of offering tax credits for new apprenticeships
is leading the way in encouraging companies to hire and train talent
within our own state.
This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill called the Leveraging and
Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs (LEAP) Act in order to
provide a paid-for way to expand the successful South Carolina model to
the national level.

and the rest of my

Visitors from Home
When I need to be in Washington for legislative duties, it is always a
pleasure to see people from home.
Southern hospitality reaches all the
way up to Washington, D.C., and we enjoy visiting with the school
groups, families, and individuals who join us for Palmetto Wednesdays
or come by the office to say
hello.
If you will be in Washington, be sure to let us know at (202)
224-6121 and feel free to come on by!
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate, and
I value hearing your opinions, questions, and concerns.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
