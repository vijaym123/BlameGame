CHICAGO SUN-TIMES Chris Christie hosting VIP fundraiser for Bobby Schilling
In 72 hours, Chris Christie is headlining a $1O,OOO per-plate fundraiser right here in Illinois.
Every dollar he raises will go
straight
towards brutal attacks against Cheri.
With 21 days to go -- and voters ALREADY casting their ballots -- we&rsquo;ve never needed you more.

David, if you agree, PLEASE, send a donation to Cheri before Christie&rsquo;s fundraiser.
