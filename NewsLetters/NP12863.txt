Dear
Friend,
Last night, KPHO-TV Channel 5, our local CBS
affiliate, aired a story featuring a veteran my office helped as
part of its "Keeping the Promise" series. District office caseworkers
became involved with this veteran, who saw tours of duty in
Afghanistan, after he waited more than a year for his VA benefits.
This story has a happy ending.
My team
was able to help cut through the red tape to get the claim
processed.
I hope this look into the
constituent services my office can provide gives you a sense of how we assist
our service men and women navigate the benefit and medical claims
process.
Unfortunately, it is all
too common to hear of delayed cases, backlogs and long waiting times at
the Veterans Administration.
It is
unacceptable that men and women who have made the sacrifices our veterans
have should experience further pain, frustration and uncertainty upon
their return from the the battlefield.
We know there are other veterans here in our district who are
experiencing the same issues, who may need help but who don't know my office
can help.
Please help spread the
word.
Sincerely,
Do You Have a VA Story? We want to hear from you! Do you have or know of an experience with
