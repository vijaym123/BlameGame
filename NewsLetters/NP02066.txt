Veterans Job Training Workshop
As part of my veterans training initiative started last year, my office
held a veterans training workshop in Greenville yesterday. The workshop
was hosted in partnership with Greenville Technical College and SC
Accelerate and focused on education and career opportunities.
I will also partner with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to hold a
Veterans Jobs Fair in Greenville on Monday, March 25th.
Visit to Kershaw and Lee County Correctional Institute
Over the weekend, I visited the Kershaw and Lee County Correctional
Facilities with Proverbs 22:6, a group dedicated to providing support
and educational resources for children whose parents are incarcerated.
As someone who grew up without a dad, my visit with the children and
their fathers was incredibly moving, especially the moment when the
dads read letters they wrote to their children, asking for forgiveness.
I served the families their meals and spoke with them about the
importance of reconciliation and strengthening father-child bonds.
This experience was truly an example of hope and forgiveness.
5th Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act
Yesterday, March 19th, marked the 5th Anniversary of the Affordable
Care Act. I questioned witnesses in Senate Finance Committee on the
structural issues with the Affordable Care Act, as well as what steps
we can take moving forward to provide a better approach to replace the
ACA. You can watch here:

March Madness
I would like to congratulate Wofford and Coastal Carolina for earning
their spots in the NCAA Tournament. Both teams are awesome!
And go Gamecocks! I am extremely proud and confident they will win the
Women's NCAA Tournament.
Sincerely,
Tim
