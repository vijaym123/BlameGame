David --
All the evidence out there shows the Affordable Care Act is working. And this fact isn&rsquo;t debatable: if Republicans repealed the ACA, millions of people would lose health care coverage.
But ignoring all the evidence, the GOP has voted literally dozens of times to repeal the law. It&rsquo;s time for Republican lawmakers to quit playing games and stop attacking Obamacare.

Demand Republicans leave the Affordable Care Act intact &gt;&gt;
Brad&rsquo;s running for Congress to strengthen the middle class and expand economic opportunity for every American -- not give up on the progress we&rsquo;ve made together. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so upsetting Republicans want to fund their budget by repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Let&rsquo;s keep the pressure on these Republicans to drop the attacks on Obamacare for good:
