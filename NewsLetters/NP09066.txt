Congressman

Dear Friends,
Private re-homing is typically used to describe pet owners looking for
a new home for their animals. But there is an online underworld
where re-homing is
just as often used to shift guardianship of children, without
regulation or oversight. Having grown up in a family with many foster
siblings, this hits close to home, and I find this practice deeply
unsettling.
Thankfully, I am not alone. There are many others who are fighting this
same fight, and together, we will find a solution.
In Rhode Island, I convened a roundtable discussion
to address re-homing and what can be done to stop it. The
conversation was very productive, and the wheels are already in motion
to try and stop re-homing from happening to others. In Washington, I
commissioned a GAO study to investigate re-homing and recommend actions
to Congress. I am co-leading a bill to expand the training of the
Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force to include offers to
re-home children
, and I am an original
cosponsor of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities
for Youth in Foster Care Act
, which would help
prevent youth in foster care from becoming victims of re-homing. In
October, I also introduced the Protecting Children Act
to provide for pre- and post-adoptive counseling assistance to ease
the transition for children and families.
This is a good start, and I pledge to continue fighting on behalf of
our children. All children deserve a safe, loving home, and it is our
responsibility to ensure that is possible.
