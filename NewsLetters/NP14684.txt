Dear Friend,
This afternoon, I joined Mayor A C Wharton in welcoming U.S. Secretary
of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to Memphis. While she was
here, we met with local partners, like Seedco Mid-South, who are helping
enroll uninsured Memphians in high-quality, affordable coverage and
participated in an Affordable Care Act outreach and education session at
the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library with area residents who are
interested in enrolling in the Tennessee Marketplace.

The fight to reform our nation's health care system is in many ways
similar to my 18 year struggle to create the Tennessee Education Lottery
Scholarship program. Many of the people who fought most vehemently
against me then are now some of the first in line for the benefits the
program provides their children. At the time when the lottery launched,
there were even some computer issues that caused problems. But today,
there aren't many left who would say the lottery is anything but a
success. Just as the opponents of the lottery were wrong during the long
fight to help improve our education system, the opponents trying to
delay and prevent improvements to our health care system today are
wrong. And just as the lottery's opponents failed, the opponents of
health care reform will fail as well. Keep reading to learn what else
happened this week.
Helping Memphis Get Covered
I'm glad that Secretary Sebelius was able to visit our city today and
help Memphians get covered. Whether or not you were able to make it to
the library today, I think we can all agree that everyone should have
quality health coverage. Luckily, many who have been unable to afford
quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's
Health Insurance Marketplace
thanks to the President's landmark
Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. If you do not have health
insurance coverage, you may be eligible to save money on your health
care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year that you will enroll in, you won't need to
enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't sure
whether or not you will need to use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the
Marketplace Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid
program) is a coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of
Americans who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage today that will take
effect January 1, 2014. Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open
for six months, but you can go online to www.healthcare.gov
today to check out your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the government shutdown didn't change that. According to
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000 individuals in
the district now have health insurance that covers preventive services
without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums have been returned
to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare paid a total of
$5.9 million less for their prescription medications as we continue to
close the 'donut hole.' Health insurance companies can no longer
discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions and young
adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
In recent weeks, there have been reports of citizens having difficulty
successfully using the Marketplace website. Many of these reported
problems have already been resolved and there are people working around
the clock to fix the problems that remain on the website. But the
Marketplace website is only one tool that you can use to sign up for
coverage. If you are having trouble accessing the website, please do not
hesitate to call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
Seedco Mid-South for in-person help. Seedco is located at 22 North Front
Street (Suite 900), and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341.
You should also feel free to call my office at 901-544-4131 if you have
any additional questions.
Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Harassment
Just like the United States government, consumers should pay the debts
they owe, but they still deserve protection from harassment and the
abusive and predatory tactics used by some debt collectors. On
Wednesday, I introduced the Fair Debt Collection Improvement Act to
ensure that some of the worst tactics of debt collectors are no longer
used.
My legislation would explicitly bar debt collectors from bringing legal
action against consumers on a debt for which the statute of limitations
has expired. While this predatory practice is not currently illegal,
most courts hold that creditors may not sue to collect such debts. And
because many creditors sell time-barred debts to secondary debt
collection agencies with unsavory collection practices, my bill would
also prevent those agencies from hiding or obscuring the legal rights of
consumers when seeking to collect the debt.
The Fair Debt Collection Improvement Act would require collectors who
have purchased time-barred debt on the secondary market to inform
consumers that: the debt collector (not the original creditor) now holds
the debt, the debt collector cannot sue for the debt, and that-if
applicable under state law-any payment made towards the debt by the
consumer could restart the statute of limitations on the entire debt. I
believe that people should pay the debts that they owe, but debt
collectors shouldn't be able to bully and harass consumers.
Working to Prevent Hunger and Poverty
This morning, millions of Americans woke up to some tough news: the SNAP
benefits they rely on the keep food on their tables are going to be
smaller from now on. And House Republicans recently passed legislation
that would cut even more from this critical part of our social safety
net. Last night, I went on Al Jazeera's Consider This TV show
to discuss the cuts and what they mean for
children, families, and seniors in Memphis.
Instead of cutting benefits to families and taking food out of the
mouths of hungry children, I believe we should work to keep Americans
out of poverty. That is why I have co-sponsored Rep. John Conyers'
Extend Not Cut SNAP Benefits Act, to prevent even more citizens from
going hungry.
Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline
Unless dealt with early and effectively, young perpetrators of minor,
non-violent offenses can unnecessarily fall into a pattern of violent
conduct later in life. But instead of focusing on conflict resolution
methods that could cut short this cycle, schools in Memphis and across
the country often involve the police in non-violent incidents on school
property, which helps feed the "school-to-prison" pipeline that is both
expensive and harmful to our community's youth.
This week, I introduced the Restorative Justice in Schools Act, which
would help reduce youth incarceration by helping to provide educators
valuable training in innovative "restorative justice" methods.
Restorative justice can serve as a cost-effective and useful alternative
to the more punitive conflict resolution methods used by many schools to
resolve minor student conflicts. These victim-centered methods hold
offenders accountable to their victims and their communities, help
offenders understand the impact of their actions, and give the wronged
party an opportunity to have a voice in resolving the conflict-which can
assist in the healing process and prevent victims from becoming
aggressors.
By training educators in alternative conflict resolution methods that
yield better results for everyone, we can keep our young people out of
jail, provide better outcomes and improved healing for victims, and save
the country money.
Improving Downtown Memphis
The Commercial Appeal reported today
that work to make Downtown Memphis more
walkable will soon begin as the first part of the Main Street to Main
Street project, a project which I helped secure a $15 million federal
TIGER grant for last year. While the TIGER grant includes the bicycle
path over the Harahan Bridge, at least half of the funding will go to
long-needed but little-noted improvements to local infrastructure.
In addition to other improvements, the City will be putting people to
work repairing and improving Downtown sidewalks and the Main Street
Mall. Once these streets and sidewalks are improved, more people will
come Downtown-as will more jobs. I'm glad that this program is getting
off the ground and bringing jobs to our city, and I look forward to the
new upgrades to Downtown Memphis.
Grants to Memphis
On Tuesday, I announced that the Department of Health and Human Services
awarded nearly $100,000 to the Shelby Country Health Care Corporation.
The funds will be used by The MED to help keep Memphis healthy.
Medicare Open Enrollment
Medicare Part D enrollment for 2014 is now open and will run until
December 7th. The Aging Commission of the Mid-South will be sponsoring
several enrollment workshops in the 9th District to assist seniors in
enrolling in next year's plans. All that you have to bring is your
Medicare card and prescriptions. Be sure not to miss out on this great
opportunity to lower your monthly pharmacy costs. For dates, times, and
locations of the workshops please click here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th district. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

The

But
today,
there

Just
as

improve
our

the

are
wrong.
And
just
as
the

the

will
fail as

Keep

to
learn
what
else
happened
this
week.
Helping
Memphis
Get
Covered
I&#8217;m
glad
that
Secretary
Sebelius
was
able
to
visit
our
city
today
and
help
Memphians
get
covered. Whether
or
not
you
were
able
to
make
it
to
the
library
today,
I
think
we
can
all
agree
that
everyone
should
have
quality
health
coverage.
Luckily,
many
who have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace
thanks
to
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act,
also
known
as
Obamacare.
If
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year
that
you
will
enroll
in,
you
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at 1-800-318-2596 or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
today
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014.
Enrollment
in
the
marketplace
will
remain
open
for
six
months,
but
you
can
go
online
to
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
check
out
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
In
recent
weeks,
there
have
been
reports
of
citizens
having
difficulty
successfully
using
the
Marketplace
website.
Many
of
these
reported
problems
have
already
been
resolved
and
there
are
people
working
around
the
clock
to
fix
the
problems
that
remain
on
the
website.
But
the
Marketplace
website
is
only
one
tool
that
you
can
use
to
sign
up
for
coverage.
If
you
are
having
trouble
accessing
the
website,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
Seedco
Mid-South
for
in-person
help.
Seedco
is
located
at
22
North
Front

(Suite

and
they

Protecting
Consumers
from
Unreasonable
Harassment
Just
like
the
United
States
government,
consumers
should
pay
the
debts
they
owe,
but
they
still
deserve
protection
from
harassment
and
the
abusive
and
predatory
tactics
used
by
some
debt
collectors.
On
Wednesday,
I
introduced
the
Fair
Debt
Collection
Improvement
Act
to
ensure
that
some
of
the
worst
tactics
of
debt
collectors
are
no
longer
used.
My
legislation
would
explicitly
bar
debt
collectors
from
bringing
legal
action
against
consumers
on
a
debt
for
which
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired.
While
this
predatory
practice
is
not
currently
illegal,
most
courts
hold
that
creditors
may
not
sue
to
collect
such
debts.
And
because
many
creditors
sell
time-barred
debts
to
secondary
debt
collection
agencies
with
unsavory
collection
practices,
my
bill
would
also
prevent
those
agencies
from
hiding
or
obscuring
the
legal
rights
of
consumers
when
seeking
to
collect
the
debt.
The
Fair
Debt
Collection
Improvement
Act
would
require
collectors
who
have
purchased
time-barred
debt
on
the
secondary
market
to
inform
consumers
that:
the
debt
collector
(not
the
original
creditor)
now
holds
the
debt,
the
debt
collector
cannot
sue
for
the
debt,
and
that&#8212;if
applicable
under
state
law&#8212;any
payment
made
towards
the
debt
by
the
consumer
could
restart
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
entire
debt.
I
believe
that
people
should
pay
the
debts
that
they
owe,
but
debt
collectors
shouldn&#8217;t
be
able
to
bully
and
harass
consumers.
Working
to
Prevent
Hunger
and
Poverty
This
morning,
millions
of
Americans
woke
up
to
some
tough
news:
the
SNAP
benefits
they
rely
on
the
keep
food
on
their
tables
are
going
to
be
smaller
from
now
on.
And
House
Republicans
recently
passed
legislation
that
would
cut
even
more
from
this
critical
part
of
our
social
safety
net.
Last
night,
I
went
on
Al
Jazeera&#8217;s
Consider
This
TV
show
to
discuss
the
cuts
and
what
they
mean
for
children,
families,
and
seniors
in
Memphis.
Instead
of
cutting
benefits
to
families
and
taking
food
out
of
the
mouths
of
hungry
children,
I
believe
we
should
work
to
keep
Americans
out
of
poverty.
That
is
why
I
have
co-sponsored
Rep.
John
Conyers&#8217;
Extend
Not
Cut
SNAP
Benefits
Act ,
to
prevent
even
more
citizens
from
going
hungry.
Ending
the
School-to-Prison
Pipeline
Unless
dealt
with
early
and
effectively,
young
perpetrators
of
minor,
non-violent
offenses
can
unnecessarily
fall
into
a
pattern
of
violent
conduct
later
in
life.
But
instead
of
focusing
on
conflict
resolution
methods
that
could
cut
short
this
cycle,
schools
in
Memphis
and
across
the
country
often
involve
the
police
in
non-violent
incidents
on
school
property,
which
helps
feed
the
&#8220;school-to-prison&#8221;
pipeline
that
is
both
expensive
and
harmful
to
our
community&#8217;s
youth.
This
week,
I
introduced
the
Restorative
Justice
in
Schools
Act ,
which
would
help
reduce
youth
incarceration
by
helping
to
provide
educators
valuable
training
in
innovative
&#8220;restorative
justice&#8221;
methods.
Restorative
justice
can
serve
as
a cost-effective
and
useful
alternative
to
the
more
punitive
conflict
resolution
methods
used
by
many
schools
to
resolve
minor
student
conflicts.
These
victim-centered
methods
hold
offenders
accountable
to
their
victims
and
their
communities,
help
offenders
understand
the
impact
of
their
actions,
and
give
the
wronged
party
an
opportunity
to
have
a
voice
in
resolving
the
conflict&#8212;which
can
assist
in
the
healing
process
and
prevent
victims
from
becoming
aggressors.
By
training
educators
in
alternative
conflict
resolution
methods
that
yield
better
results
for
everyone,
we
can
keep
our
young
people
out
of
jail,
provide
better
outcomes
and
improved
healing
for
victims,
and
save
the
country
money.
Improving
Downtown
Memphis
The
Commercial
Appeal
reported
today
that
work
to
make
Downtown
Memphis
more
walkable
will
soon
begin
as
the
first
part
of
the
Main
Street
to
Main
Street project,
a
project
which
I
helped
secure
a
$15
million federal
TIGER
grant
for
last
year.
While
the
TIGER
grant
includes
the
bicycle
path
over
the
Harahan
Bridge,
at
least
half
of
the
funding
will
go
to
long-needed
but
little-noted
improvements
to
local
infrastructure.
In
addition
to
other
improvements,
the
City
will
be
putting
people
to
work
repairing
and
improving
Downtown
sidewalks
and
the
Main
Street
Mall.
Once
these
streets
and
sidewalks
are
improved,
more
people
will
come
Downtown&#8212;as
will
more
jobs. I&#8217;m
glad
that
this
program
is
getting
off
the
ground
and
bringing
jobs
to
our
city,
and
I
look
forward
to
the
new
upgrades
to
Downtown
Memphis.
Grants
to
Memphis
On
Tuesday,
I
announced
that
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
awarded
nearly
$100,000
to
the
Shelby
Country
Health
Care
Corporation.
The
funds
will
be
used
by
The
MED
to
help
keep
Memphis
healthy.
Medicare
Open
Enrollment
Medicare
Part
D
enrollment
for
2014
is
now
open
and
will
run
until
December
7th.
The
Aging
Commission
of
the
Mid-South
will
be
sponsoring
several
enrollment
workshops
in
the
9th
District
to
assist
seniors
in
enrolling
in
next
year&#8217;s
plans.
All
that
you
have
to
bring
is
your
Medicare
card
and
prescriptions.
Be
sure
not
to
