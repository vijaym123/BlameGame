Up and Down the Coast
Monday, March 30, 2015
Dear Friend,
A couple weeks ago, I had a busy week traveling up and down the Central Coast. Logging the miles and meeting with constituents throughout my congressional district is one of the best parts of my job.
I presented a Congressional Medal to Megan Pollan , a local student who has done great work in our community,
I took a tour of Astro Aerospace
in Goleta to see the cutting edge technologies they are developing as a small business contributing to our local economy, and
I visited with the Merchant Mariners , who served our country during World War II. I also spent some time with
students at the Grizzly School at Camp San Luis Obisp o and with
sixth graders at Washington Elementary in Santa Barbara
to speak with them about my work in Congress and the impact it has on their daily lives.
And on Thursday,
I had the honor and privilege of dedicating the post office at 801 W. Ocean Avenue in Lompoc as the Federal Correctional Officer Scott J. Williams Memorial Post Office Building .
I introduced a bill last Congress naming the post office after Federal Correctional Officer Williams that made it through both the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama last December.
Senior Officer Specialist Williams was killed in the line of duty at the U.S. Penitentiary in Lompoc on April 3, 1997. He served with honor and distinction as a U.S. Marine during the Persian Gulf War, where he saved the lives of his countrymen and received multiple awards, including &ldquo;Marine of the Year.&rdquo;
It was an honor and privilege to celebrate his life and honor his service with his wife Kristy and their two daughters, Kaitlin and Kallee. Naming the Lompoc Post Office after him is a fitting tribute as we continue to keep his memory alive and honor this selfless local hero.
