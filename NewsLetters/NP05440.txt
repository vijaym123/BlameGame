Fewer Than Half of Americans
Get Vaccinated Against the Flu
According to health officials at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than half of Americans are
being vaccinated against the flu.
Yet influenza remains a leading
cause of death in the United States year after year.
Depending
on the severity of the virus and other factors, thousands to tens of
thousands of Americans die each year from the flu.
The CDC
recommends an annual flu vaccination for all individuals older than six
months of age.
You
can greatly reduce your risk of catching the flu by getting a flu
shot.
To learn more about the vaccine and other actions you can take
to protect yourself against the flu please visit the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website .

Urge Pro Sports Leagues to Adopt Stronger Policies Against Abuse and
Assault
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a time when Americans join
together in rededicating ourselves to eradicating from our society the
scourge of domestic violence.
The domestic violence cases within the National Football
League recently led to a bipartisan effort to urge the major U.S. sports
leagues to review and strengthen their policies regarding domestic
violence, sexual assault, and child abuse.
Fifty-seven House
members, including Rep. Levin, joined together to
send
letters
to the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NBA, National Hockey
League, and Major League
Soccer.
Forecast for Midwest: Heavy
Downpours on the Rise
The torrential rains that hit the Metro Detroit area on August 11
dumped 5-6 inches of rain on our region, resulting in over $1 billion
in damage.
In recent years, these heavy downpours are on the
increase in the United States, especially in the Midwest and
Northeast.
Between 1958 and 2012,
large precipitation events in the Midwest have risen 37 percent,
according to a
study
from the latest U.S. National
Climate Assessment report.
One reason for the increased heavy
rainfall is climate change, as warmer air can contain more water vapor
than cooler air.
Iran Must Fully Disclose Its Nuclear
Activities
The U.S.
and other nations have been negotiating with Iran about its nuclear
program.
With talks set to resume, over 350 members of the House of
Representatives, including Rep. Levin, recently wrote a letter to
Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to ensure that Iran is fully
transparent about its nuclear activities, particularly those related to
the development of nuclear weapons.
The
letter
expresses serious concern about Irans refusal to fully cooperate
with the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
