Friends,
Last week was a stressful one for many of us as we stared down the
daunting tax code to file our taxes by Wednesday's deadline . To say our
tax code is a mess is an understatement.
At 4 million words
which is 3,998,800 more than the King James Bible - and nearly 74,000
pages long, it stands as one of the biggest boondoggles holding our
economy back.
The tax code is tedious, wasteful, inefficient and
well...
taxing , causing too many folks to spend more and more
time and resources just to comply with the law.
In fact, as Americans
wrestled through the complex code, our economy lost a whopping $234
billion and 6.1 billion hours of productivity.
Theres no doubt
that this years tax code was especially difficult with the addition of
Obamacare and its 3,000 pages of complexities and
regulations.
On top of the
burdensome tax code, the federal government continues to take bigger
chunks of our paychecks to pay for Washingtons spending addiction. In
North Carolina, we finally earned enough money to pay our combined total
tax bill for the year on April 16. That means all of those hours of
hard work you punched prior went straight to our growing tax burden.
If this seems unfair,
would you believe it if I told you President Obama wants to make that day
later by taxing us
even more ?
According to the Tax Policy
Center, under the presidents proposed plan to increase taxes by $2.1
trillion, the average American family would see an increase in their tax
bills. I fail to see how this approach will increase wages, promote job
creation or provide the economic security families deserve.
We
have a tremendous opportunity to advance bipartisan tax reform that
would empower individuals and families to keep more money in their
pockets and more hours on their schedules.
I support completely
overhauling our current tax system to make it simpler, fairer and
flatter and reducing taxes to force the government to live within its
means, just like working families do here at home.
This tax season, were also
reminded of President Obamas plan to hand over our tax dollars to illegal
immigrants. Under the presidents amnesty executive order, illegal
immigrants could be eligible to get Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for
years they worked illegally in the United States. Taking billions of
dollars from law-abiding taxpayers to write checks to unlawful immigrants
is an absolute disservice to working families and hardworking
immigrants who lawfully entered our country.
The bottom line is, the
presidents policies neither help grow our economy nor serve the best interests
of North Carolinians.
While Washington continues to turn a blind eye to families who are
playing by the rules, yet struggling under the Obama economy, Im
fighting for you and your family.
Just this week, I
supported
legislation to stop IRS abuse and hold agency employees
accountable for misconduct.
From targeting taxpayers for
their political beliefs to rehiring hundreds of untrustworthy
ex-employees, its clear the IRS doesnt have the best interest of hardworking
taxpayers in mind.
I
believe in you, our neighbors, our friends and our community, not our
federal government, and I will continue to work with Democrats and
Republicans to tip the balance of power back to "we the people" and away from
Washingtons
bureaucrats.
Until next week,
Richard Hudson
Member of
Congress (NC-08)
Remember
Spc. Brent
Grommet and his military dog Matty? When I learned of their
separation, I was heartbroken.
I was honored to help reunite Brent and Matty
last year and excited to meet them for the first time last
week.

At its core, the death tax is a tax on the American
dream.
Last week,
I voted to axe the death tax .
North Carolinian's do not owe their success to the federal government, and
the benefits of their hard work shouldn't be confiscated from their
children and grandchildren when they
die.

leaders at the UNC Charlotte EPIC Advisory Board meeting about ways to
continue to grow energy production in North Carolina to create jobs
and lower energy costs.
