Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Nine months ago the Democratic Republic of the Congo halted all
international adoptions. Many American families who had completed all
the necessary paperwork and had their adoptions confirmed by the
Congolese courts were unable to finalize their adoptions.
One of these families was Michael and Erin Peat of Dubuque. Even though
they have been granted U.S. visas for their children, the Congolese
government has not allowed them to bring their children home.
I'm writing Secretary of State John Kerry to ask that the State
Department place pressure on the Congolese government to resolve this
impasse so that the Peats --and hundreds of other families throughout
the United States -- can be united with their children.
I'd like you to join me in signing this letter to Secretary Kerry so
that he understands how important it is that this issue is quickly
resolved.
Feel free to click here and add your name to my letter to Secretary
Kerry.
On Thursday, June 12, I'll be sending this letter to Secretary Kerry,
showing him that Iowans across our state support the Peats and other
parents that have been unfairly separated from their children.
All the best,
Bruce
