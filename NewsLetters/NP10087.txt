Congresswoman Brooks meeting with Hoosier members of the American
Legion.
Dear Friends,
As I work to be your voice in Congress, I continue to look for ways to
save taxpayer dollars and increase government efficiency. We must build
a leaner and smarter federal government that eliminates wasteful
spending while still supporting vital priorities.
One priority I know all of us share is meeting the needs of Indiana's
490,000 military veterans. They've made tremendous sacrifices for us,
and we owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.
Unfortunately, too many of them are jobless, homeless or lost in the
bureaucratic and slow claims process administered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Sadly, these sobering facts apply to veterans
returning from recent wars and those who served decades ago. Something
must be done.
That's why just a few days ago I voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2015
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill,
legislation which provides new levels of targeted support for programs
that can truly make a difference in the lives of our veterans.
This legislation fulfills our moral and legal obligations to our
veterans, making sure they receive top notch medical care, helpful job
training programs and other benefits they have earned. It increases
discretionary funding for veterans programs by $1.5 billion above last
year, providing $158.2 billion in total for our nation's veterans.
A majority of this funding goes toward essential medical services that
include mental health care, suicide prevention, traumatic brain injury
treatment and rural health initiatives. Did you know that one VA study
found 22 veterans commit suicide every day? Our veterans struggling
with mental health challenges must know they have a strong and
effective support network on which to lean.
It's also time for the VA to finally modernize its services and
operations. That's why this past week's legislation also includes funds
for the digital scanning of health records and a centralized mail
system. This will increase the timely and accurate exchange of medical
data between the VA and the private sector. Right now, claims for
medical assistance and reimbursements often take years, sometimes
decades, to be resolved. That's simply not good enough. We must do
better.
All of this funding will only go so far if the VA is not held
accountable for providing excellent service to our veterans. As your
Member of Congress, I promise I will continue to support efforts to
hold the VA accountable to the most rigorous standards. The legislation
I voted for just a few days ago actually withholds funds from the VA if
it can't demonstrate measurable progress toward key performance goals
and prohibits performance bonuses for senior executives.
Since my swearing in, I've met so many wonderful, talented and hard
working veterans while traveling the 5th District. The struggles they've
faced and the challenges they've overcome have inspired me to become a
passionate advocate for our veterans. Last May, I was honored to lead
passage of the bipartisan "Helping Heroes Fly Act" on the House Floor.
This legislation requires the Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) to ensure expedited screening for our nation's wounded warriors.
Those who've put everything on the line to protect our freedom should
be treated with the highest level of respect and dignity as they travel
through our airports.
I also held a Veterans Listening Session last November at the Anderson
Flagship Center. This event brought the many government and non-profit
organizations that serve veterans together to discuss the challenges
our veterans face and the opportunities we have to solve those
challenges. In addition, last May I joined several of my colleagues in
sending a letter to President Obama calling on him to take direct
action to end the VA backlog. This is an issue our nation's highest
executive must lead on.
It's an honor to represent so many of our military veterans in Congress
and I will do everything I can to make sure we keep the promises we've
made to them. These brave men and women are heroes and it's time to
make sure every single one of them is treated like one.
Sincerely,
Susan W. Brooks

Congresswoman Brooks
meeting
with
Hoosier members
of
the
American
Legion.
Dear
Friends,
As
I
work
to
be
your
voice
in
Congress,
I
continue
to
look
for
ways
to
save
taxpayer
dollars
and
increase
government
efficiency.
We
must
build
a
leaner
and
smarter
federal
government
that
eliminates
wasteful
spending
while
still
supporting
vital
priorities.
One
priority
I
know
all
of
us
share
is
meeting
the
needs
of
Indiana&#8217;s
490,000
military
veterans.
They&#8217;ve
made
tremendous
sacrifices
for
us,
and
we
owe
them
a
debt
of
gratitude
we
can
never
fully
repay.
Unfortunately,
too
many
of
them
are
jobless,
homeless
or
lost
in
the
bureaucratic
and
slow
claims
process
administered
by
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
Sadly,
these
sobering
facts
apply
to
veterans
returning
from
recent
wars
and
those
who
served
decades
ago.
Something
must
be
done.
That&#8217;s
why just
a
few
days
ago I
voted
in
favor
of
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Bill,
legislation
which
provides
new
levels
of
targeted
support
for
programs
that
can
truly
make
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
our
veterans.
This
legislation
fulfills
our
moral
and
legal
obligations
to
our
veterans,
making
sure
they
receive
top
notch
medical
care,
helpful
job
training
programs
and
other
benefits
they
have
earned.
It
increases
discretionary
funding
for
veterans
programs
by
$1.5
billion
above
last
year,
providing
$158.2
billion
in
total
for
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
A
majority
of
this
funding
goes
toward
essential
medical
services
that
include
mental
health
care,
suicide
prevention,
traumatic
brain
injury
treatment
and
rural
health
initiatives.
Did
you
know
that
one
VA
study
found
22
veterans
commit
suicide
every
day?
Our
veterans
struggling
with
mental
health
challenges
must
know
they
have
a
strong
and
effective
support
network
on
which
to
lean.
It&#8217;s
also
time
for
the
VA
to
finally
modernize
its
services
and
operations.
That&#8217;s
why
this
past
week&#8217;s
legislation
also
includes
funds
for
the
digital
scanning
of
health
records
and
a
centralized
mail
system.
This
will
increase
the
timely
and
accurate
exchange
of
medical
data
between
the
VA
and
the
private
sector.
Right
now,
claims
for
medical
assistance
and
reimbursements
often
take
years,
sometimes
decades,
to
be
resolved.
That&#8217;s
simply
not
good
enough.
We
must
do
better.
All
of
this
funding
will
only
go
so
far
if
the VA
is
not
held
accountable
for
providing
excellent
service
to
our
veterans.
As
your
Member
of
Congress,
I
promise
I
will
continue
to
support
efforts
to
hold
the
VA
accountable
to
the
most
rigorous
standards.
The
legislation
I
voted
for just
a
few
days
ago actually
withholds
funds
from
the
VA
if
it
can&#8217;t
demonstrate
measurable
progress
toward
key
performance
goals
and
prohibits
performance
bonuses
for
senior
executives.
Since
my
swearing
in,
I&#8217;ve
met
so
many
wonderful,
talented
and
hard
working
veterans
while
traveling
the
5th
District.
The
struggles
they&#8217;ve
faced
and
the
challenges
they&#8217;ve
overcome
have
inspired
me
to
become
a
passionate
advocate
for
our
veterans.
Last
May,
I
was
honored
to
lead
passage
of
the
bipartisan
&#8220;Helping
Heroes
Fly
Act&#8221;
on
the
House
Floor.
This
legislation
requires
the
Transportation
Security
Administration
(TSA)
to
ensure
expedited
screening
for
our
nation&#8217;s
wounded
warriors.
Those
who&#8217;ve
put
everything
on
the
line
to
protect
our
freedom
should
be
treated
with
the
highest
level
of
respect
and
dignity
as
they
travel
through
our
airports.
I
also
held
a
Veterans
Listening
Session
last
November
at
the
Anderson
Flagship
Center.
This
event
brought
the
many
government
and
non-profit
organizations
that
serve
veterans
together
to
discuss
the
challenges
our
veterans
face
and
the
opportunities
we
have
to
solve
those
challenges.
In
addition,
last
May
I
joined
several
of
my
colleagues
in
sending
a
letter
to
President
Obama
calling
on
him
to
take
direct
action
to
end
the
VA
backlog.
This
is
an
issue
our
nation&#8217;s
highest
executive
must
lead
on.
It&#8217;s
an
honor
to
represent
so
many
of
our
military
veterans
in
Congress
and
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
make
sure
we
keep
the
promises
we&#8217;ve
made
to
them.
These
brave
men
and
women
are
heroes
and
it&#8217;s
time
to
make
sure
every
single
one
of
them
is
treated
like
one.
