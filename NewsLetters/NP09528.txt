Dear Friend,
As many of you know, I recently wrote you about the reported incident at a Phoenix Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital where a secret waiting list was kept. In the following weeks, several other VA staff at other hospitals have stepped up and stated that they too have secret waiting lists. As a result, veterans are not receiving timely medical care and some may have passed away while on these waiting lists.
In light of these recently reported instance of secret waiting lists by certain Veterans Health Administration hospitals and clinics, I want to take the opportunity to ask you, my constituent, about your interaction with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
As your Representative, I want to hear directly from you about your interactions at VA Hospitals in Iowa. Please take the time and click the link below to give me your feedback:
