Supporting the 2016 National Defense
Authorization Act
5/15/15
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn voted in favor of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA). Additionally, the Congressman added or supported seven more
amendments to the bill.
"Supporting our men and women in uniform is vitally important to the
safety and security of the United States. It was profoundly
disappointing to see so many Democrats turn away from our brave warriors and
vote against this bill.
This is a good and
important bill. Ive been working on it for months now, and have added
provisions at subcommittee, full committee, and on the floor. We
address critical issues in military space, missile defense and almost every
area of national security policy. I addressed a range of issues
impacting Colorado Springs and our military bases here. I also added a
provision to establish a partnership with Israel to develop tunnel
detection technology, because we are facing tunnel threats on our southern
border as well as the threat of terrorists using tunnels around the
world. The bottom line is that this is a good bill and we must continue to
make sure that our national security is our top
priority.
