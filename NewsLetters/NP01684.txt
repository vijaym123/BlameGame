FIRST BIG POLL OF 2015: Ohio (Dems + 9)
David -- We couldn&rsquo;t wait to share the news: Our candidate Ted Strickland is leading the Republican incumbent by an incredible NINE POINTS in Ohio!
Yes, it&rsquo;s still early in the campaign cycle.
But here&rsquo;s why this matters:
It shows that Democrats have the momentum. Nine points is a SHOCKING lead -- it means Republicans are very vulnerable.
Ohio is THE ultimate swing state for the presidential and Senate elections.
If we take Ohio, we could take EVERYTHING.
We&#39;re thrilled about this poll -- but now we have to seize the opportunity it gives us. Can you help?
