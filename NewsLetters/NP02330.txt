Friends,
I have troubling news.
To push its
gun control agenda, this Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is considering a ban on the M855
AR-15 round, common ammunition frequently used by law-abiding
sportsmen.
Im proud to join my
conservative colleagues to send a letter to the director of ATF
demanding answers for this blatant attempt to bypass Congress and the
American people.
I will continue to fight against this misguided
ammunition ban and any overreaching proposals that would prevent us from
responsibly exercising our Second Amendment
rights!
Sincerely,
Richard
Hudson
