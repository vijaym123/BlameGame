Visiting Constituents in Tyler
County
Continuing my travels across the First Congressional District, I had
a chance to stop by Tyler County and meet with local business leaders
and veterans. These meetings provide a great opportunity for me to
hear peoples concerns and to work to find solutions to their
problems.
With business leaders we were able to
discuss their priorities, and the issues facing industries in Tyler
County. In Congress, I have worked on numerous pieces of legislation to
promote U.S. manufacturing and innovation. I have also partnered with my
colleagues across the aisle to help provide incentives for
manufacturers to hire employees, especially in economically disadvantaged
areas.
Meeting with veterans is always a privilege. Our veterans
are a real treasure and I appreciate their personal and unique
perspective on the issues.
West
Virginia University Leading in Energy
Research
Earlier this week,
the Department of Energy
announced
that West Virginia University has been selected to be a national
field laboratory to promote the development of unconventional oil and
natural gas resources.
West Virginia is a leader in the
development of Americas energy future and will be for decades to come. We
are also a center for groundbreaking research on natural gas and coal
being done at West Virginia University and the
National Energy Technology Laboratory . By committing nearly $7.5
million over the next five years, the Department of Energy clearly
recognizes that West Virginia is a leader in this field. This investment will
allow us to produce energy more efficiently and safely in the years to
come and is an exciting development for WVU and our
state.
Moundsville Man Returns
Home
Mr. John Berisford, formerly of Moundsville , returned to the United States from China earlier this
week .
Mr. Berisford fell ill and had been stuck in a Chinese hospital
for the past 8 months.
Between community donations and an
anonymous donation, Mr. Berisfords family was able to pay his hospital bill
and bring him home.
A few months ago I learned of Mr.
Berisfords predicament after some conversations with constituents.
Upon launching an inquiry into the matter, my office was informed that
the State Department was already on the case
they did truly terrific
work on behalf of Mr. Berisford and his family.
I am thankful
for their dedication and the kindness of the anonymous donor who made
it possible for Mr. Berisford to come
home.
