Worth Working to Save
Dear Friends,
Unless Congress acts to reform Social Security it will be going broke within the next 15 years.
Reform will be even more urgent if the program is raided again as it has been in the past.
We owe it to todays workers who contribute to Social Security to close the funding gap to guarantee continuing benefits.
This week, to help ensure continuation of the program, I introduced
H.R. 1366:
Alexs Law .
This bill, named for an eight year old daughter of one of my staffers, would gradually raise the retirement age for todays eight year olds from 67 to 70.
This three year difference would make up for almost
one-fourth of the social security funding gap
and would have
no effect on anyone currently in or closely approaching retirement .
Three years is a modest increase of the retirement age and accurately reflects the longer average life expectancy we enjoy thanks to advancement in medicine and technology.
If this can help make the difference between having Social Security or not, I think most agree those three years are worth working to save the program.

Alexs Law , please

Please let me know your thoughts on this bill and
share your concerns .
