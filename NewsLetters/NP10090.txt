Constituent Meetings from the 5th and DC:
Visit to Skills of Central PA: In February, I had the opportunity to
visit Skills of Central PA, which provides a wide variety of services
focused on supporting individuals with disabilities so they can live
self-determined lives. I met with
Regional Vice President
Joe
Weilacher at Skills of Central PA's primary facility in State College,
along with so many talented individuals and staff.
Visit to the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences:
I
recently visited the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences
in Bethesda, which prepares our uniformed services health professionals
and officers to directly support the Military Health System. During the
visit, I was able to meet with SGT Mike Lee, of Waterford, Erie County,
who is just back from Afghanistan.
Thank you for your service, SGT
Lee!
A Day with Corl Street Elementary: In March, I was able to join the
students of Corl Street Elementary in State College, during their
celebration of Read Across America, a nationwide reading program
initiated by the National Education Association to promote early
learning "with read-aloud, read-along, and reading marathon activities."

Leadership Recognition:
National Award for Work in Agriculture: In February, I was recognized
by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) with the Golden Plow
Award
, which is the highest honor the AFBF presents to Members of
Congress. I was nominated for the award by the Pennsylvania Farm
Bureau, for my work to "advance the Farm Bill, commitment to reducing
regulatory red tape and burdens on farmers, and leadership in
addressing Environmental Protection Agency-related challenges that
threaten the very foundation of agriculture."

President Julie Anna Potts and PA Farm Bureau President Carl Shaffer.
National Award for Advocacy in Career & Technical Education: In April,
I was honored to receive the National Association of State Directors of
Career Technical Education (CTE) Consortium's Star of Education Award
. The award is given to Members
of Congress who have demonstrated leadership, vision, and dedication to
CTE, and have made extraordinary contributions to the practice and
expansion of CTE programs. My colleague and fellow Co-Chair of the
bipartisan Congressional CTE Caucus
, Jim Langevin (D-RI), was
the other recipient of the award.
I look forward to continuing our
shared advocacy on behalf of aspiring learners of all ages.
News Headlines:
The Hill Newspaper: Thompson Military Mental Health Bill Picks Up
Steam:
"A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a bill calling
for mental health screening for recruits before they can join the
military. "While the military performs comprehensive physical and
medical evaluations, no similar examination for mental health exists,"
said Rep. Glenn Thompson. "The Medical Evaluation Parity for Service
Members Act will institute a preliminary mental health assessment at
the time recruits are first joining the military," he said. Nearly one
in five Army soldiers enters the service with a psychiatric disorder,
and nearly half of all soldiers who tried suicide first attempted it
before enlisting, according to recent Army reports. "This small but
consequential improvement to recruitment evaluations will help address
a recognized knowledge gap within the military and ensure our soldiers
are both physically and mentally fit to serve," Thompson said. Thompson
introduced the legislation on March 27, but it picked up more support
after Army Spc. Ivan Lopez, 34, went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood
last Tuesday, killing three soldiers and wounding 16. Since then,
Senators Portman and Rockefeller have introduced a companion bill in
the Senate." (The Hill
, April 17, 2014)
Warren Times Observer: Thompson Law Boosts U.S. Forest Products: "The
farm bill, now law, contains provisions that originated in the Forest
Products Fairness Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Thompson, representing
a long-fought-for victory for Thompson..."If you go to a hardware
store, let's say you go to the counter for flooring and you buy a box
of bamboo flooring, which is not grown in this country. You will see
that it will have a sticker on it saying that it is USDA
'bio-preferred'. Sitting next to it could be a box of hardwood cherry,
from Warren County, and it's not eligible. I mean, it's the craziest
thing.that will change. So that marketing will help expand new market
opportunities for timber and forest products by allowing them now to
qualify for the USDA's 'bio-preferred' program. So that creates more
demand for our forest products and timber." (Warren Observer
, February 5, 2014)

Legislative Activity:
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act Signed into Law: In December
of last year, the House passed bipartisan legislation to shift $126
million - money previously used to finance national political
conventions - to the National Institutes of Health, where it will now
support research into childhood cancer and other pediatric diseases,
including down syndrome, cancer, autism, and the countless other
diseases that affect our children that don't yet have a cure. In March
of 2014, the Senate passed the legislation - again with bipartisan
support. That bill, now law, was the Gabriella Miller Kids First
Research Act
. I am proud
to be an original cosponsor of this bill and for the leadership
displayed in the House to advance this important piece of legislation.
Thompson Cosponsored Bill to Extend Emergency Relief from Propane
Crisis Becomes Law: On March 25, President Obama signed into law H.R.
4076, the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation
(HHEATT) Act
, a bill I cosponsored to extend
emergency relief to families and businesses during the propane and home
heating fuels crisis facing so many of our communities.
House Passes "Hire More Heroes Act": On March 12, I voted to support
H.R. 3474, the Hire More Heroes Act, bipartisan legislation that will
incentivize small businesses to hire veterans by adjusting requirements
under the Affordable Care Act's Employer Mandate.
