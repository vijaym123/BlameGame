David --
The Supreme Court might as well put a &lsquo;For Sale&rsquo; sign on our elections.
In their latest decision, the Court lifted the cap on direct contributions to elections, paving the way for mega-donors and shadowy special interests to funnel MILLIONS more into our elections.
We can&rsquo;t take this lying down. The uber-wealthy already play too large a role in our elections, and now, it&rsquo;s even easier for them to drown out the voice of everyday Americans. I won&rsquo;t stand for a political process that&rsquo;s up for grabs to the highest bidder.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m urging Congress to pass meaningful campaign finance reform to prevent big money donors from buying our elections David, will you join me in demanding Congress take immediate steps to reverse the Supreme Court&rsquo;s disastrous decision?
Outside groups spent over $9 million in our race in the last election, and you can bet after seeing this latest decision they&rsquo;re gearing up to spend even more.
We can&rsquo;t stand by while the Supreme Court systematically dismantles our campaign finance system.
