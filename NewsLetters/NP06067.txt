David, we have some good news&hellip;FINALLY!
President Obama just announced we&rsquo;re in range of an I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E milestone: 2 MILLION grassroots donations for a Democratic House in 2014.
That&rsquo;s grassroots power John Boehner could never even dream of!
David, we&rsquo;ll make this simple:
We are determined to hit this milestone for President Obama before our end of month deadline. There&rsquo;s just 96 hours remaining. We need you to step up if we're going to get there:
