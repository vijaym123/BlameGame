Dear Friends,
Earlier this week, 60 Minutes aired its investigation on the Social
Security Administrations Death Master File
. The investigation traced the costly and, in worst cases,
life-altering ripple effects of incorrect or outdated data thats used
to determine eligibility for federal benefits and by the private sector
for credit reporting.
Oftentimes, errors in death data lead to something called improper
payments. Those are payments made by federal agencies in error or due
to fraud, putting an added strain on our already stretched-thin federal
budget. Last fiscal year alone, improper payments cost American
taxpayers $125 billion. For the past decade, Ive worked to root out
these instances of waste, fraud and abuse, and enact common-sense
reforms to prevent them.
This week, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs, where I serve as the top Democrat, held a hearing
that further examined improper payments
because of inaccurate Death Master File information, and the actions we
must take to fix these problems. I will soon be introducing legislation
based on what I learned from the hearing and building on years of past
work to curb improper payments.
In 2010, I was proud to introduce the Improper Payments Elimination and
Recovery Act
with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), which
became law. In 2013, I teamed up with Sen. Coburn again to enact the
Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act
, which
provides agencies with new tools needed to improve anti-waste efforts
and curb millions of dollars in improper payments. This Congress, I
introduced The Improper Payments Coordination Act of 2015
to continue the forward progress.
Im a big proponent of looking at everything we do and searching for
ways to make it better. Thats why I will continue pushing for common
sense reforms to make sure federal agencies practice better stewardship
of hard-earned taxpayer dollars.
As always, I encourage you to send me your views on this issue, or any
other, through email or by contacting me on Twitter @SenatorCarper
and on Facebook at facebook.com/tomcarper

Dear
Friends,
Earlier
this
week,
60
Minutes
aired
its
investigation
on
the
Social
Security
Administration&#146;s
Death
Master
File .
The
investigation
traced
the
costly
and,
in
worst
cases,
life-altering
ripple
effects
of
incorrect
or
outdated
data
that&#146;s
used
to
determine
eligibility
for
federal
benefits
and
by
the
private
sector
for
credit
reporting.
Oftentimes,
errors
in
death
data
lead
to
something
called
&#147;improper
payments.&#148;
Those
are
payments
made
by
federal
agencies
in
error
or
due
to
fraud,
putting
an
added
strain
on
our
already
stretched-thin
federal
budget .
L ast
fiscal
year
alone,
improper
payments
cost American
taxpayers
$125
billion.
For
the
past
decade,
I&#146;ve
worked
to
root
out
these
instances
of
waste,
fraud
and
abuse,
and
enact
common-sense
reforms
to
prevent
them.
This
week,
the
Senate
Committee
on
Homeland
Security
and
Governmental
Affairs,
where
I
serve
as
the
top
Democrat,
held
a
hearing
that
further
examined
improper
payments
because
of
inaccurate
Death
Master
File
information,
and
the
actions
we
must
take
to
fix
these
problems. I
will
soon
be
introducing
legislation
based
on
what
I
learned
from
the
hearing
and
building
on
years
of
past
work
to
curb
improper
payments.
In
2010,
I
was
proud
to
introduce
the
Improper
Payments
Elimination
and
Recovery
Act
with
Sen.
Tom
Coburn
(R-Okla.),
which became
law.
In
2013,
I
teamed
up
with
Sen.
Coburn
again

the
Improper

Act ,
which
provides

with
new

to
improve
anti-waste
efforts
and
curb
millions
of
dollars
in
improper
payments.
This
Congress,
I
introduced
The
Improper
Payments
Coordination
Act
of
2015
to
continue
the
forward
progress.
I&#146;m
a
big
proponent
of
looking

everything
we
do
and

to
make
it

That&#146;s

I
will

of
hard-earned
