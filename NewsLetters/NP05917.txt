Team Bera,
I dont know about you, but Im tired of seeing these emails from other campaigns:Were giving up. Were going home. Throwing in the towel. Turning off the lights.
Other races may be quittingbut were fighting back.Were going to win thisbecause of people like you. Yes, the outside groups may be pouring money into our race, but were giving this all weve got.
Join me in fighting back today: pitch in $5 to help us exceed our goal by midnight on Tuesday. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/teamberacrucialdeadline
We shouldnt be throwing in the towel. We should be using every resource we have to run a smarter, more aggressive campaign. Were fighting for a brighter future for our familiesand I can tell you that my team isnt quitting on that.
Were locked in one of the toughest races in the country, but were optimistic and were working harder than our opponent. We have $11,595 left to raise to hit our goalon Tuesday.Can you help us with $5 right now?secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/teamberacrucialdeadline
I wont be sending you any emails about going home, because I have faith that our grassroots support can overcome these special interest groups who are dumping in millions. Instead, lets stand together and tell them: Bring it on. Were ready.
Heres to the fight ahead,

Team Bera,
I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m tired of seeing these emails from other campaigns:
We&rsquo;re giving up.
We&rsquo;re going home.
Throwing in the towel.
Turning off the lights.
Other races may be quitting&mdash;but we&rsquo;re fighting back.
We&rsquo;re going to win this&mdash;because of people like you.
Yes, the outside groups may be pouring money into our race, but we&rsquo;re giving this all we&rsquo;ve got.
Join me in fighting back today: pitch in $5 to help us exceed our goal by midnight on Tuesday.
We shouldn&rsquo;t be throwing in the towel.
