Protecting our Great Lakes
Dear Friend,
This week dealt with two important pieces of legislation related to the Great Lakes. As someone who represents a large chunk of Michigan coastline, I have long been a champion of all issues related to our Great Lakes and protecting those who live near them.
The
Drinking Water Protection Act
passed in the House and is on its way to the Senate. This bipartisan legislation, which passed through my committee earlier this month, will give the EPA the tools it needs to prevent future occurrences like the one that happened last summer when the drinking water of nearly 500,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio, was threatened by harmful algal toxins.
The second bill was introduced by Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township, and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing, to control the spread of Asian Carp. We must take aggressive action to protect our Great Lakes from invasive species like Asian Carp. Its important not just for the health and beauty of our Great Lakes ecosystem, but also for protecting thousands of jobs in the recreational fishing and boating industries.
The
Defending Our Great Lakes Act
is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that would give federal agencies authority to take immediate actions to stop the spread of invasive species like Asian Carp. The legislation will also require agencies to work with regional stakeholders to institute measures to stop the spread of Asian Carp between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.
I was proud to sign on as an original co-sponsor to this vital legislation and look forward to working with my Michigan colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress to get the job done for you.
Growing up on the shores of Lakes Michigan has instilled a deep appreciation for Michigans wildlife and natural resources. I will continue working to preserve the beauty and sustainability of our lakes for future generations.
God bless,
Fred
