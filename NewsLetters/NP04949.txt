Handling the Ebola
Crisis
Ebola continues to be a threat to
the health and safety of American families and workers.
The
Presidents response has been to appoint Ron Klain, a political operative,
as his Ebola response coordinator.
By appointing Mr. Klain
as his Ebola czar, it is clear that the President sees this as a
political problem and not a health crisis.
As a doctor who has
worked in pubilc health programs in the U.S. and hospitals in Africa, we
need someone with extensive health care experience in dealing with this
public health crisis.
Reforming
Flood Insurance
The
Grimm-Cassidy Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act continues to
be implemented.
FEMA
recently
announced
that more Louisiana parishes will receive flood map updates in
the coming months.
Flood insurance rates must be fair and
reflect Louisiana families actual flood risk.
Incorporating
local recommendations when issuing rate maps will help accomplish this.
FEMA has made progress in implementing Grimm-Cassidy, but there
is still more to be
done.
Taking a Stand
Election Day is
next Tuesday.
No matter what your political leanings, we can take
pride in our country and its democratic process.
I hope you
go to the polls to cast your vote.
