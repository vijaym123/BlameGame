We don&rsquo;t mean to nag, but this is urgent: President Obama is under attack and we are in
desperate
need of your grassroots support.
As of yesterday&rsquo;s House GOP hearing, Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit against President Obama is going full speed ahead. It&rsquo;s critical that we respond now with an outpouring of grassroots power. Otherwise, we might as well throw in the towel for the remainder of his presidency.
Look, we are only 4431 away from hitting 200,000 donations since Boehner announced his lawsuit. If we don&rsquo;t have a massive flood of support today to get us there:
BOEHNER WINS.
We have to hit this goal to show Boehner what a horrible mistake he made when he decided to waste YOUR tax payer money on suing the President. Will you chip in $5 or more right now to get us over the top? Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
