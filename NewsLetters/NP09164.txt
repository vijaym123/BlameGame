Dear Friend,
I wanted to give you a quick update on our monthly fundraising goal. Right now, with less than 24 hours until the deadline, we&rsquo;re still about $2,800 shy of hitting our $20,000 goal -- can you contribute $5, $10, or more to help us get closer?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Ed knows how to get the most out of every resource our campaign has, but we need to hit these goals every month to stay on track for victory. Even grassroots campaigns like ours need money to get our message out. We count on supporters like you to help us spread Ed&rsquo;s message. Help us get to $20,000 this month by making a $5 contribution right now.
Thanks for always being there for Ed.
Colleen
