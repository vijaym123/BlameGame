ISSUES
LEGISLATION
March 16, 2014
Dear
David,
It has been a busy couple of weeks with a lot going on in
Washington!
Last week, we passed a number of bills aimed at providing
relief for the many Americans struggling because of slow job growth,
increased health care costs, and unnecessary red
tape.
Below is an update on my work in our nations capital. To
learn more about what I have been working on, please visit my
website .
Sincerely,
Fighting for Fiscal Responsibility
On
Wednesday, I had the opportunity to speak on the House floor on the
financial risk to federal and state budgets posed by Californias
high-speed rail plan. Even with the $3 billion in federal stimulus funding
added to the $9.9 billion available from a state bond issue, funding
still falls far short of the amount estimated to complete the project.
At a time when every aspect of federal spending is being scrutinized,
we must ensure that billions of dollars are not wasted on a project
that will never be completed. You can watch my floor speech
here .
Rep. Doug LaMalfa speaking on the House
floor.
Protecting Americans from Obamacare
I supported a number of
bills that would provide relief from the punitive mandates under
Obamacare for volunteers, veterans, and those with certain sincerely held
religious beliefs.
The Hire More Heroes Act ( H.R. 3474 ) incentivizes small businesses to hire
veterans by ensuring that veterans who already receive health insurance
through the Department of Veterans Affairs or reservists covered under
TRICARE are exempted from being counted towards the number of employees
required by the employer mandate under ObamaCare.
The
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters &amp; Emergency Responders Act ( H.R. 3979 ) amends the definition of full-time
employee to ensure that qualified volunteers, including voluntary
firefighters and emergency responders are not counted for determining the number
of full-time employees or full-time equivalents at a given employer
for the purposes of the employer mandate in
ObamaCare.
The Equitable Access to Care and Health (EACH) Act ( H.R. 1814 ) expands the religious conscience exemption in ObamaCare.
It will allow people avoid buying health insurance if they have a
religious reason for doing so in order to protect all
faiths.
All three of these commonsense bills passed out of the House
with bipartisan support. It is time for the Senate and the President to
work with us to provide real solutions and fairness for all Americans
under the law.

Reining in Executive Overreach
As made
clear in the Oath of Office that each constitutional officer of the
Federal government must take, the separation of powers is established
within a system of three branches of government: the executive, the
legislative, and the judicial, to provide checks and balances that keep
power from becoming too concentrated. This administration's attempts to
expand executive power and whittle away at our rights must be
addressed to protect and defend due process and rule of law under the
Constitution. I recently supported
H.R. 4138 , the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactment of
the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act of 2014, which allows the House or
Senate to adopt a resolution authorizing a civil action if the President or
any federal officer implements a policy to refrain from enforcing the
law. H.R. 4318 passed with bipartisan support by a vote of
233-181.

Agricultural
Delegation.
I also voted in favor of The Faithful
Execution of the Law Act, which will bring more transparency to government by
requiring the administration provide full disclosure to the American
people for any policies they choose not to enforce. In doing so, we can
make the issue of constitutional authority and rule of law a debate
with full transparency to the public.
H.R. 3973
passed on the Floor with bipartisan support.
I encourage the
Senate to act on these two responsible pieces of legislation so we can rein
in the massive government overreach that only makes life more
difficult for hardworking
Americans.
Congressional Art Competition
Each spring, the
Congressional Institute sponsors a nationwide high school visual art competition
that honors the talents and abilities of the nations young people.
Since the competition began in 1982, more than 650,000 high school
students have participated. This year, I want to encourage all North State
high school students to exercise their creativity and participate with
a chance of having their artwork hang in the exhibition at the U.S.
Capitol in Washington, D.C.
All artwork must be submitted by
Friday April 25th to any of our district
offices.

2013 contest winner, Logan Theobald.
If you know a high school
student interested in entering the 2014 Congressional Art Competition,
they can find information about the requirements and the submission
process by contacting my Oroville office at (530)
