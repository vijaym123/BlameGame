Dear Friend,
It was
a great privilege for me on Saturday to join former U.S. Senator Bob
Dole at the World War II Memorial to welcome veterans from Central
Florida and across America to our Nation's Capital. Thank you to those who
sponsor and volunteer to bring our Veterans to see their war
memorials on Honor Air Flights. More than 50 veterans participated in this
weekends fly in. How grateful we are for their service and sacrifice for
our country. It was wonderful weather for a wonderful group of
American heroes.
Most respectfully,
John L. Mica
Member of
Congress
