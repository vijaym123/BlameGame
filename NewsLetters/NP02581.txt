UPDATE: TAXPAYER FUNDS USED TO PAY FOR ABORTION UNDER OBAMACARE
As you know, in December 2014, I joined with other Members of Congress in sending a
letter
to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging the modification of a proposed rule that allowed health insurance issuers to avoid the law by not collecting the abortion surcharge as an actual separate payment under Obamacare.
This month we received a
response
from HHS
that continued to defend its action, stating that the proposed rule offers a number of ways the law may be satisfied.
However, the proposed rule still allows issuers the opportunity to only notify enrollees of a monthly separate charge for such services without actually billing and collecting a separate payment.
I am disappointed HHS does not go further to ensure American taxpayer dollars are not being used to fund subsidies that cover elective abortion.
LATTA RECEIVES FAMILY VALUES AWARD
In February, Congressman Latta was honored with the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council (FRC), an organization dedicated to protecting human life, preserving the institution of the family, and upholding our constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms.
The True Blue Award is presented to Members of Congress who demonstrate extraordinary integrity, leadership, commitment and character in their defense of life, families, and faith.
Congressman Latta was recognized by the FRC as a tireless advocate of pro-life and pro-family issues and commended for his persistent work and support on behalf of his constituents and others across the country who respect and value the exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms.
LEGISLATION PROTECTING MARRIAGE
In honor of National Marriage Week (February 7-14), Id like to share with you legislation I have cosponsored in the 114 th
Congress that would defend traditional marriage:
H.J.RES. 32, the Marriage Protection Amendment
This bill would amend the U.S. Constitution to affirm marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
H.J.RES. 32 was introduced by Representative Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) on February 21, 2015 and was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.
H.R. 824, the State Marriage Defense Act of 2015
This bill affirms states authority to define marriage on the basis of the state of domicile standards by requiring the federal government to defer to laws of a couples state of legal residence in determining their marital status.
H.R. 824 was introduced by Representative Randy Weber (R-TX) on February 10, 2015 and was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.
I am proud to cosponsor legislation that protects traditional marriage and defends states rights to strengthen their own marriage definition.
I will keep you updated on the status of these very important bills as they move through the legislative process.
