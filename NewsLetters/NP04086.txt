Dear David,
This week, negotiators are in
Washington, D.C. to continue talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) trade deal between the United States and 11 other countries in the
Asia-Pacific region. During my time in Congress, I have opposed trade
agreements that are bad for U.S. manufacturers and American workers,
including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Unfortunately, the TPP is more of the same.
As it currently stands,
the TPP deal would roll back Wall Street reforms, raise the cost of
medicine, ban Buy American policies needed to create renewable energy
jobs, and expose the U.S. to unsafe food and products. Whats more, the
TPP would give away our competitive advantage to countries like Vietnam
and Malaysia that do not have adequate protections for workers or the
environment.
With so much at stake, Congress should play a
key role in negotiating and approving trade agreements. Instead, some
are pushing for whats known as fast track, a procedural rule that
means a bad agreement like the TPP would get one up or down vote with
no opportunity to amend the proposal, not allowing elected
representatives a chance to improve the deal. I have long opposed fast track and
will continue to so do to prevent trade deals from getting rubber stamp
approval when they threaten our jobs and economy.
I remain
committed to ensuring that U.S. trade policy looks out for American
businesses and American workers who are the driving force behind our
economy.
Best,
Louise
