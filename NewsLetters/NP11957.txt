You Just Can't Make This Stuff Up: Birds Fried in the Sky
Thursday, February 27, 2014
Opening in California earlier this month was the giant Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, which the
Wall Street Journal
reports includes three towers as tall as 40-story buildings.
Nearly 350,000 mirrors, each the size of a garage door, reflect sunlight onto boilers atop the towers, creating steam that drives power generators.
The
Wall Street Journal
called the system The $2.2 Billion Bird-Scorching Project, noting that it appears to be scorching birds that fly through the intense heat surrounding the towers, which can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
A peregrine falcon, a grebe, two hawks, four nighthawks and a variety of warblers and sparrows were among the dead birds.
The
Huffington Post
has reported that birds have been insta-cooked by the systems intense heat rays quite literally getting burned by the system.
The
International Business Times
recently ran a piece entitled, Worlds Largest Solar Plant, Partly Owned By Google, Opens In Nevada, Roasts Birds and Angers Environmental Group.
And a
Fox News
story on this new solar super site is entitled, Worlds Largest Solar Plant Scorching Birds in Nevada Desert.
The
International Business Times
notes, Western Watersheds Project filed a lawsuit against the BLM [Bureau of Land Management] in January 2011, alleging it had failed to protect more than 1,000 desert tortoises, along with birds and sheep.
A California district court tossed out the case in November 2012, and two weeks ago, Western Watersheds restated its pleas to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
A birder myself, I too think this ought to be reviewed.
As U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Director for Migratory Birds Eric Davis said, When you have new technologies, you don't know what the impacts are going to be.
But I couldnt help but think of a few headlines of my own:
Birds Fried in the Sky, Hot Suspect: Green Energy
Environmentalists Oppose Solar Super Site
Green Energy Facility Ruffling Feathers
Environmentalists Watching Ivanpah Like Hawks
Solar Super Sites Swan Song?
Do you have ideas?
Feel free to send them my way.
Because, folks, you just cant make this stuff up.
