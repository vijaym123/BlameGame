Dear Friend: I hope you had a safe
holiday season and look forward to a healthy
and prosperous new year. With Congress
returning to Washington this week for the
start of the second session of the
113thCongress,weve already
hit the ground running on some important
issues.I'd like to take this
opportunity to update you on some recent
developments from the nations capital.
Marking the 50th Anniversary of War on
Poverty
As the Republican Study Committees
Anti-Poverty Initiative chairman, I hosted a
press conference on Wednesday with other RSC
members marking the 50th anniversary of
Americas War on Poverty. Despite
more than $15 trillion being spent to fight
poverty, 46.5 million Americans continue to
live below the poverty line.
As we mark the 50
th anniversary of
Americas War on Poverty, its
clear we are instead locked in battle of
attrition thats left more people in
poverty than ever before. The Big
Government ideas of the past arent
working. History has taught us that
bigger budgets arent going to solve
Americas poverty challenges.
Thats why House Republicans are
committed to improving educational
opportunities, strengthening two-parent
families, and ensuring the long-lasting job
growth necessary to provide vulnerable
individuals with a renewed opportunity for
earned success.
Fighting for Our Veterans
I am proud to have recently joined House
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman
Jeff Miller (R-FL) in introducing legislation
to eliminate cuts in the cost-of-living
adjustments for military retirees (H.R.
3790).
I voted against sequestration in 2011
because I knew it was wrong for North and
Northwest Floridas military. I
also voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act last
month because it lessened the crushing impact
of these untargeted, across-the-board cuts on
Americas military readiness.
That being said, I knew I could not support
keeping in place COLA cuts for our military
retirees. Thats why I am proud
to have joined Chairman Miller in working to
ensure the federal government keeps its
promises to the veterans who sacrificed so
much for our freedoms.
Recognizing the National Champion Florida
State Seminoles
On Tuesday, I addressed the House honoring
the Florida State Seminoles for winning this
years BCS National Championship.
As the Representative of Florida's Second
Congressional District, I could not be more
proud. With the Bowl Championship
Series coming to a close, the Florida State
faithful can forever take pride in knowing
that the last BCS title will forever reside
in Tallahassee, Florida.

attention and support. Your feedback
and participation is critical to my ability

Florida's Second Congressional District.
I am looking forward to 2014, as we
work together to seize the opportunities and
conquer the challenges ahead! To learn
