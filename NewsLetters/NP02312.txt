Rogers Pushes for Improved Veterans Care
WASHINGTON, D.C.
- U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) defended military veterans this week on Capitol Hill during
budget hearings with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert A. McDonald
and
Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Ashton Carter , as well as through his support for two veterans-related bills. On Monday, the House passed under suspension the
Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act
(H.R. 294)
and a bill to
rescind bonuses from underperforming VA employees
(H.R. 280) .
Rogers commended Secretary McDonald for the actions he has taken to curtail mismanagement and negligence in the VA, but pushed for continued efforts to digitize medical records and to ensure that eligible veterans can join the newly established Veterans Choice Program with ease.
"Many veterans who should qualify for the Choice Program have been denied access by the VA. These veterans either live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or must drive distances in excess of 40 miles to reach one," said Chairman Rogers. "This Department must take steps to ensure that the '40 mile rule' and qualifying exceptions are applied evenly and in a timely manner."
Rogers also applauded the work of Veterans Treatment Courts and improved action to prevent prescription drug abuse among veterans.
During a budget hearing with the DoD on Wednesday,
Rogers also questioned Secretary Ashton B. Carter
about plans for authorized use of military force relating to ISIS and integrating health records with the VA.
The House also passed
H.R. 294 , which expands veterans' healthcare choices by allowing eligible veterans to receive long-term, VA-paid nursing home health services for three years, beginning October 1, 2015. Medical foster home care is a long-term care alternative for veterans who prefer a smaller, more home-like and familial care setting than a traditional nursing home. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would result in cost savings of $248 million over the next five years.
H.R. 280
also passed the House on Monday. This legislation aims to curtail mismanagement and negligence at VA facilities by authorizing the Secretary of the VA to recoup more than $380,000 in cash bonuses paid to top executives at 38 hospitals who are under investigation for falsifying wait times for medical care. Currently, the VA has no authority to recoup bonuses for its employees, even if they were awarded under false pretenses.
