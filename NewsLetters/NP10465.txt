Capitol Update
A Message from Congressman Cook on the Keystone Pipeline:
Once again, President Obama has put politics ahead of policy. Last
week, he delayed the decision on the Keystone Pipeline yet again, under
the guise of extending an already dramatically prolonged public comment
period. The public has been weighing in on this issue for years and
even Senate Democrats have called on the president to make a choice.
Let's take a moment to review some of the facts associated with
building Keystone. The benefits of building this pipeline far exceed
the risks. Over seventy percent of Americans support constructing the
Keystone Pipeline, which will create tens of thousands of good paying
jobs in states that desperately need them. Pipelines are easily the
safest and most affordable way to transport crude oil. Other options,
such as rail and freight are not nearly as cost effective, and are much
more harmful to the environment. Both require large amounts of energy
to transport the crude from point A to point B.
Additionally, there are far more instances of environmental disasters
caused by non-pipeline transportation than by pipeline transportation.
Study after study, especially the most recent environmental impact
study performed by the State Department, has shown that building the
Keystone Pipeline will have no effect on climate change and will be an
environmentally safe project.
Building the Keystone Pipeline is not just good environmental and
fiscal policy, but it is also good national security policy. The more
energy we purchase from close allies like Canada, the less dependent we
are on sources of foreign oil from unfriendly places such as the Middle
East, Venezuela, and Russia. This means we can remove a large amount of
risk from our energy portfolio by importing from a close friend rather
than from our adversaries.
Continuing the endless delays for this vital energy project will lead
to continued unemployment, a weaker national energy policy, continued
reliance on oil from unstable regions, and a loss of faith from trade
partners worldwide. This issue is too important to play politics with,
and I encourage the president to do what's best for America and approve
the Keystone Pipeline.
District Update
Hesperia and Big Bear Lake Meet and Greets a Huge Success
With the long recess in Washington, Congressman Cook was happy to get
back to the district and meet with constituents in Hesperia and Big
Bear last week. Meet and greets are a vital tool in the public
engagement toolbox, as they enable meaningful discourse between
residents of the district and their Representative in Washington.
Congressman Cook was encouraged by the level of interest shown by
attendees, who were curious about both national and local issues. These
events are of vital importance to Congressman Cook, who prides himself
on being open to the public and a true advocate for the people of the
Eighth district.
Congressman Cook's Statement on Gunnery Sergeant Richard Jibson Being
Awarded the Navy Cross for Exemplary Service
The men and women of our US military continually humble me. Their
bravery and courage never cease to amaze me. Thank you, Gunnery Sgt.
Richard A. Jibson and Navy Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Andrew Owensby
of Marine Corps Base 29 Palms. Your service to our country is greatly
appreciated.

Capitol
Update
A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
on
the
Keystone
Pipeline:
Once
again,
President
Obama
has
put
politics
ahead
of
policy.
Last
week,
he
delayed
the
decision
on
the
Keystone
Pipeline
yet
again,
under
the
guise
of
extending
an
already
dramatically
prolonged
public
comment
period.
The
public
has
been
weighing
in
on
this
issue
for
years
and
even
Senate
Democrats
have
called
on
the
president
to
make
a
choice.
Let&#8217;s
take
a
moment
to
review
some
of
the
facts
associated
with
building
Keystone.
The
benefits
of
building
this
pipeline
far
exceed
the
risks.
Over
seventy
percent
of
Americans
support
constructing
the
Keystone
Pipeline,
which
will
create
tens
of
thousands
of
good
paying
jobs
in
states
that
desperately
need
them.
Pipelines
are
easily
the
safest
and
most
affordable
way
to
transport
crude
oil.
Other
options,
such
as
rail
and
freight
are
not
nearly
as
cost
effective,
and
are
much
more
harmful
to
the
environment.
Both
require
large
amounts
of
energy
to
transport
the
crude
from
point
A
to
point
B.
Additionally,
there
are
far
more
instances
of
environmental
disasters
caused
by
non-pipeline
transportation
than
by
pipeline
transportation.
Study
after
study,
especially
the
most
recent
environmental
impact
study
performed
by
the
State
Department,
has
shown
that
building
the
Keystone
Pipeline
will
have
no
effect
on
climate
change
and
will
be
an
environmentally
safe
project.
Building
the
Keystone
Pipeline
is
not
just
good
environmental
and
fiscal
policy,
but
it
is
also
good
national
security
policy.
The
more
energy
we
purchase
from
close
allies
like
Canada,
the
less
dependent
we
are
on
sources
of
foreign
oil
from
unfriendly
places
such
as
the
Middle
East,
Venezuela,
and
Russia.
This
means
we
can
remove
a
large
amount
of
risk
from
our
energy
portfolio
by
importing
from
a
close
friend
rather
than
from
our
adversaries.
Continuing
the
endless
delays
for
this
vital
energy
project
will
lead
to
continued
unemployment,
a
weaker
national
energy
policy,
continued
reliance
on
oil
from
unstable
regions,
and
a
loss
of
faith
from
trade
partners
worldwide.
This
issue
is
too
important
to
play
politics
with,
and
I
encourage
the
president
to
do
what&#8217;s
best
for
America
and
approve
the
Keystone
Pipeline.

was
happy
to
get
back
to
the
