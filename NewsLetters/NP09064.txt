Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag was sentenced to 100 lashes and death while she was 8 months pregnant.
Why? Simply because she refuses to recant her Christian beliefs.
Meriam has been convicted of apostasy and adultery.
As the daughter of a Muslim man, the Sudanese government does not recognize her marriage to a Christian man.
She gave birth to her baby girl, Maya, in prison and in shackles.
Maya and Martin, Meriams 20-month old son, are being held in prison with her.
After conflicting reports that Meriam may be released, the Sudanese government has stated that her fate lies with the outcome of her appeal.
In response, I am joining with a bipartisan group of Members of Congress in a resolution,
H.Res. 601 , calling for the immediate release of Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag and her children. Meriam should have the freedom to follow her faith, and to live according to the dictates of her own conscience.
We, as Americans, are incredibly blessed to have the level of religious liberties that we have in our nation. Let us never forget to be grateful for those freedoms, and to fight to protect and preserve them, even as we stand beside those around the world who do not have the precious freedom to choose their own faith and their own beliefs.
Yours in service,
Randy
