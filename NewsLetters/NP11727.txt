News from Representative John Delaney
March 4, 2014
Dear Friend,
Today, the White House released its budget proposal for Fiscal Year
2015, highlighting the administration's goals for the coming year. I
was excited to see deficit reduction, investment in education, and
infrastructure improvements listed among the President's top
priorities. While the budget doesn't have everything I would like to
see, the proposal takes an important step by providing a blueprint for
bipartisan action on some of the most important issues facing our
nation.
To find out what is in this year's budget, you can read the proposed
FY2015 budget
or see
the President's remarks
on today's proposal.
As a Freshman Class President, I've acted as a voice for fiscal
responsibility, economic competitiveness, and expanded opportunity for
the middle class, and I was happy to see these priorities addressed in
the White House's budget. The proposed budget not only takes action to
reduce the deficit by over $1 trillion in the next decade, but also
strengthens critical investments, like early education, and calls for
an increased minimum wage to help ensure that all Americans have an
opportunity for success in today's economy.
Of special importance is the proposed budget's endorsement of a
National Infrastructure Bank that would "leverage private and public
capital to support infrastructure projects of national and regional
significance." During my first term in Congress, I've introduced
legislation to do just that. With 29 Democratic and 26 Republican
cosponsors, the Partnership to Build America Act
uses
repatriated corporate earnings to help finance the rebuilding of our
country's transportation, energy, communications, water, and education
infrastructure. With a companion bill in the Senate and strong support
in the House, the White House budget takes a critical next step towards
bringing our nation's infrastructure back online.
As Congress begins consideration of the White House's budget, I will
continue my work to bring both parties together and take action on our
country's top priorities. To let me know what your priorities are or to
send your feedback, please feel free to contact my office
. With infrastructure investments, deficit
reduction and other important issues on the table, I'll be sure to keep
you up to date with my work.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
March
4,
2014
Dear
Friend,
Today,
the
White
House
released
its
budget
proposal
for
Fiscal
Year
2015,
highlighting
the
administration&#8217;s
goals
for
the
coming
year.
I
was
excited
to
see
deficit
reduction,
investment
in
education,
and
infrastructure
improvements
listed
among
the
President&#8217;s
top
priorities. While
the
budget
doesn&#8217;t
have
everything
I
would
like
to
see,
the
proposal
takes
an
important
step
by
providing
a
blueprint
for
bipartisan
action
on
some
of
the
most
important
issues
facing
our
nation.
To
find
out
what
is
in
this
year&#8217;s
budget,
you
can
read
the
proposed
FY2015
budget
or
see
the
President&#8217;s
remarks
on
today&#8217;s
proposal.
As
a
Freshman
Class
President,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
voice
for
fiscal
responsibility,
economic
competitiveness,
and
expanded
opportunity
for
the
middle
class,
and
I
was
happy
to
see
these
priorities
addressed
in
the
White
House&#8217;s
budget.
The
proposed
budget
not
only
takes
action
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
over
$1
trillion
in
the
next
decade,
but
also
strengthens
critical
investments,
like
early
education,
and
calls
for
an
increased
minimum
wage
to
help
ensure
that
all
Americans
have
an
opportunity
for
success
in
today&#8217;s
economy.
Of
special
importance
is
the
proposed
budget&#8217;s
endorsement
of
a
National
Infrastructure
Bank
that
would
&#8220;leverage
private
and
public
capital
to
support
infrastructure
projects
of
national
and
regional
significance.&#8221;
During
my
first
term
in
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
introduced
legislation
to
do
just
that.
With
29
Democratic
and
26
Republican
cosponsors,
the
Partnership
to
Build
America
Act
uses
repatriated
corporate
earnings
to
help
finance
the
rebuilding
of
our
country's
transportation,
energy,
communications,
water,
and
education
infrastructure.
With
a
companion
bill
in
the
Senate
and
strong
support
in
the
House,
the
White
House
budget
takes
a
critical
next
step
towards
bringing
our
nation&#8217;s
infrastructure
back
online.
As
Congress
begins
consideration
of
the
White
House&#8217;s
budget,
I
will
continue
my
work
to
bring
both
parties
together
and
take
action
on
our
country&#8217;s
top
priorities.
To
let
me
know
what
your
priorities
are
or
to
send
your
feedback,
please
feel
free
to
contact
my
office .
With
infrastructure
investments,
deficit
reduction
and
other
important
issues
on
the
table,
I&#8217;ll
be
sure
to
keep
you
up
to
date
with
my
work.

John
