Rubio To Obama: Take Decisive Action
Against Human Rights Violators In
Venezuela
In light of the upcoming anniversary of
the violent repression of peaceful
demonstrators in Venezuela, Marco called on
President Obama to fully implement the
provisions in the
Venezuela Defense
of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of
2014
that were signed into law on December
18 and mandate asset freezes and visa
restrictions on individuals involved in
human rights violations under the Maduro
regime.
In
a letter to the
President
, Marco highlighted the deteriorating
economic and security conditions in
Venezuela, and expressed concerns regarding
the lack of progress in imposing financial
sanctions mandated by the law, particularly
asset freezes.
As you know, February 12 marks
the anniversary of massive public
demonstrations in Venezuela, in reaction
to President Maduros incompetent
rule and violent repression of tens of
thousands of peaceful demonstrators. As a
result of President Maduros
ongoing crackdown, more than 40 people
have died, there have been at least 50
documented cases of torture by government
forces on peaceful demonstrators, and
more than 1700 individuals await trials
by a Venezuelan judiciary fully
controlled by President Maduro
including opposition leader Leopoldo
Lopez, who has been held in the Ramo
Verde military prison for a year,
wrote Rubio . On January 27,
Maduros regime approved an order
by Defense Minister Vladimiro Padrino
authorizing the Venezuelan armed forces
to use lethal force
including
firearms and chemical weapons
to
control public demonstrations. The need
for decisive action by the United States
could not be clearer.
While I support the decision by
the Department of State to deny U.S.
visas to an additional but undetermined
number of human rights violators in
Venezuela, I am deeply concerned about
the lack of progress in imposing the more
powerful financial sanctions mandated by
this law,
Rubio added . Given the
rapid decline of economic and security
conditions in Venezuela, I urge you to
fully implement the provisions in the
Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and
Civil Society Act of 2014.
ICYMI: Rubio: Cuba Taking Advantage Of
U.S.
On Tuesday, Marco presided over the
Senate Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere
Subcommittee
hearing on the new
Cuba policy
, and warned that Cuba is taking
advantage of the U.S. in
an op-ed for
CNN.com
.
Since President Barack Obama
announced his normalization deal with the
Cuban regime in December, life appears to
be imitating art. Last week, Cuban
President Raul Castro declared that his
regime would not even entertain the Obama
administrations requests to
normalize ties until the United States
abandons our naval base at Guantanamo
Bay, ends the trade embargo, ceases
pro-democracy radio and television
broadcasts into Cuba and compensates the
regime for human and economic
damages the U.S. has, according to
him, inflicted on the Cuban people. Last
month, the regimes lead negotiator
summed up its position even more
succinctly after the first round of
U.S.-Cuba normalization talks in Havana,
saying, Change in Cuba is not
negotiable.
In other words, emboldened by
the first wave of concessions Obama gave
the Castro regime in the form of access
to more U.S. dollars, it wants even more
in exchange for nothing.
When dealing with tyrants, you
cant wear them down with kindness.
When that approach is attempted and
one-sided concessions are made, tyrants
dont interpret them as good faith
gestures. They interpret them as
weakness. This is a lesson the Obama
administration has failed to learn from
its dealings with Iran, North Korea and
Russia, and even terrorists such as the
Taliban.

Rubio Comments On Meeting With King Of
Jordan, Execution Of Jordanian Pilot
In
a video
statement
, Marco expressed his condolences to
King Abdullah II of Jordan regarding the
execution of a Jordanian pilot by the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL).
Marco issued the following
statement:
The horrific murder of a Royal
Jordanian Air Force pilot by the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is
just the latest sign of the brutality of
this group. Lieutenant Moaz al-Kassasbeh
was honorably serving his country when
his plane went down in ISIL-controlled
territory. He was helping to lay the
groundwork for the eventual liberation of
Syrians and Iraqis from ISILs rule
and he was admirably defending the
security of the Kingdom of Jordan and his
fellow Jordanians.The United States
has a close partnership with Jordan and
terrible acts like these will only bring
us closer together in our effort to
destroy ISIL and work toward a Middle
East that offers hope and progress to the
people of the region rather than the
hatred and vitriol of these
barbarians.
The United States also shares a
close and enduring relationship with
Japan. That is why I was so saddened by
the deaths of Kenji Goto and Haruna
Yukawa in recent weeks.As Americans
have witnessed through our own citizens
who have lost their lives, ISILs
cruelty knows no bounds. As Floridians,
we experienced the loss of one of our
own, Steven Sotloff, early in this
conflict last year. We share the pain of
families in mourning in Jordan and Japan,
across continents and cultures. In their
deaths, we gain greater resolve to defeat
our common foe once and for all and
repudiate the hateful ideology that ISIL
is attempting to spread.
My thoughts and prayers are
with our friends in Jordan and Japan
during this time as they mourn the deaths
of their countrymen.
Constituent Casework Corner
Virginia, a widow of a veteran, applied
for Aid and Attendance benefits in
September of 2014. Her family contacted
Senator Rubios office to request
expedited processing of her claim due to
significant financial hardship. A member of
the staff contacted the VAs Pension
Management Center with the request.
Expedited processing was granted, and
Virginia was subsequently awarded
approximately $22,000.00 in benefit
