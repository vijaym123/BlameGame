Simplify The Tax
Code
This past week
was the federal tax filing deadline, also known as Tax Day.
And I dont know about you, but Im sick and tired of all the
hassle.
According to the IRS, the tax
code forces Americans to spend over $168 billion and 6 billion hours
each year complying with its provisions.
But the real impact of
taxes on Missouri families and small businesses is not contained to a
day or a season.
Small businesses make tax-related decisions
throughout the year that affect nearly everything they do, from budgets to
hiring.
Tax rates are steep,
but theres also a major cost in time.
Most small businesses
spend at least 40 hours around this time of year preparing their taxes,
and
40 percent of them spend 80 hours
two full
work weeks
on compliance.
The large and complicated federal tax
code is increasingly difficult for small companies to navigate.
For small businesses, a week or two is time they cannot afford to
lose.
According to recent reports examined by the Small Business
Committee, the complexity of the process causes 86 percent of small
businesses to pay tax preparers.
To
alleviate this burden that affects not only most Americans, but more
importantly, Missourians, I support the Fair Tax.
Thats why I am a co-sponsor of the
Fair Tax
Act , which would eliminate our burdensome tax code by repealing
the individual income tax, the corporate income tax, capital gains
taxes, all payroll taxes, the self-employment tax, and the estate and gift
taxes, in lieu of a 23 percent tax on the final sale of all goods and
services.
By implementing this system, we can promote freedom
and economic opportunity, while collecting revenue through simpler,
fairer means.
The time to reform
our nation's tax code has come.
Our current system is fraught
with confusion and in need of major changes to promote economic growth.
I believe we can do better than simply lower taxes.
I know
that we can make a bigger impact on our economic future by ridding
ourselves of a tax structure that is holding us back.
Sincerely,
Sam
