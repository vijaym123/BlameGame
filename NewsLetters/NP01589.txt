Fifth
District Virginians Deserve Better From
the IRS
Dear
Friend,
Fifth District Virginians have been
preparing for the April 15th tax filing
deadline for the past several weeks, which
is a burdensome annual reminder of just how
complex and outdated our current tax code
is. Families and small businesses spend
billions
of hours each year
dealing with this
most excessive example of bureaucratic red
tape only to hand over their hard-earned
dollars to a federal government that
continues to make the process more
difficult and unfair than it needs to
be.
Americans make a good faith effort to
comply with our complicated tax code, but
recent reports indicate that they have not
received the assistance they may need when
filing taxes. These reports exposed that
the
IRS is only answering four in 10 customer
service calls , leaving many pressing
tax questions unanswered. This unsettling
news comes at a time when thousands have
questions about the mandates and reporting
requirements imposed by the
Presidents healthcare law -
questions made even more complex because
more than 800,000 Americans who signed up
for the federal healthcare exchange
received
the wrong forms . Tax season is
stressful enough; the last thing
hardworking Americans need is inept service
from the agencies responsible for these
important matters.
Many Fifth District Virginians also
remain troubled by the reports of IRS
officials targeting groups based on
political affiliation, which is totally
unacceptable given the agencys
authority. I was very disappointed to learn
that the Justice Department
will
not seek the criminal contempt charges
authorized by the House of Representatives
against former Director of Exempt
Organizations of the IRS Lois Lerner for
her refusal to answer questions during a
congressional hearing about the
allegations. The American people deserve
answers as to why certain groups were
targeted for their political beliefs, and
they have understandably lost trust in the
IRSs ability to fairly administer
our laws.
I share the American peoples
frustration that the IRS,
whose
purported mission is to , provide
Americas taxpayers top quality
service by helping them understand and meet
their tax responsibilities and enforce the
law with integrity and fairness to
all, is not living up to that
standard. The American people deserve
better. My colleagues and I in the House of
Representatives remain committed to reining
in an out-of-control federal government
that makes life more difficult for
hardworking Americans.
This week, we will consider a number of
bills to get the federal government out of
the way and promote tax freedom and
financial independence. We are continuing
our work to overhaul our broken tax code
and implement a simpler, fairer, and
flatter tax code that will ensure that
individuals and businesses have the
certainty they need and that all Americans
are keeping more of their hard-earned tax
dollars. We will also consider bills to
hold the IRS accountable and ensure
fairness for all hardworking taxpayers,
doing all we can to reform the IRS and make
future April 15ths are simpler and
easier for all Americans.
