Dear Friend,
The
Affordable Care Act
marked an important step toward making quality and affordable health care accessible to every American. One of the greatest benefits of the ACA is the new insurance marketplace, which provides an affordable place for individuals, families and small businesses to shop for private health insurance.
The Marketplace provides a new way to find health coverage that fits your budget and meets your needs.
When you use the Health Insurance Marketplace, you are able to fill out one application to see all your insurance options and then enroll in health coverage. You may also be eligible for financial assistance to pay your premium.
Open Enrollment ends on March 31, 2014.
If you need health insurance coverage in 2014, you must sign up by the
March 31 st
deadline .
You can apply for coverage three ways: online, by mail or in-person with the help of a Navigator or qualified helper. For more information and to apply online you can go to
www.GetCoveredIllinois.gov .
There is also a toll-free Help Desk at 1-866-311-1119, open from 7:00am to 10:00pm March 24-28, and from 7:00am until midnight March 29-31.
Several qualified organizations are holding extended in-person enrollment hours in the final days of open enrollment.

District open until 10:00pm for enrollment assistance before March 31. You can also visit
