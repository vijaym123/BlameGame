"Every day my
team works to help district residents, including seniors, cut through
bureaucratic red tape to get the services they need," said Rep.
Lipinski.
"During my time in office, we have helped countless retirees
get answers and solve problems involving Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security, veterans' benefits, the Postal Service, and other federal
issues.
Seniors have worked hard and sacrificed much for our
nation, so it is my hope that the upcoming fairs will make life a little
easier for them.
I will continue to work to make sure my
constituents dont lose access to their doctor through further cuts to Medicare,
and Ill fight to protect Social Security for todays seniors and
strengthen it for future retirees.
I am committed to being a leader
who brings people together to address important issues in a
bipartisan manner.
