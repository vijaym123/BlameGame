Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last week, we celebrated Constitution Day and commemorated the great history and heritage of our American government. On September 17, 1787, George Washington presided over the convention that issued the Constitution to the states for ratification. Each week as I walk to Rules Committee, I pass an inspiring painting in the Capitol depicting the signing. No other government document in history has done as much to promote the general welfare or secure the blessings of liberty as the Constitution of the United States of America.

It was great to welcome Renaut and Brooke van der Riet to Washington. Having adopted several children themselves, Renaut and Brooke lead by example and have encouraged many others to think both intentionally and creatively about how to care for children. Mosaic Church, where Renaut serves as Lead Pastor, has been a model of Gods love as numerous members have opened their hearts and homes to receiving children who so desperately need care and attention. It was my pleasure to honor their dedicated service to our community as my nominees for the Angels in Adoption Program.

Having owned and operated our own family business, I am very familiar with both the economic opportunities and challenges of small businesses. This week, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) recognized me with their Guardian of Small Business award based on my strong voting record on behalf of Americas small business owners. You can read the
press release they sent out here .

I was grateful to participate in the Healthy Families Florida lunch on Friday to recognize their flawless national accreditation and thank Carol McNally for the tremendous work of her team. Carol is retiring after sixteen faithful years as Executive Director and passionate advocate of Healthy Families Florida and it was a pleasure to reflect on the lives of countless children and families in the State of Florida that have been changed due to her efforts and care.

On Saturday morning, three of my adult sons joined me to lay the roof decking at a Habitat for Humanity home in Winter Garden. Unfortunately rain stopped our effort, but we will be back to finish the job. Thank you to St. Lukes United Methodist church for leading the way for this project. I have been a supporter of West Orange Habitats vision to give a hand up to those who are willing to work hard for a home of their own. The Fikes are the future owners of this Habitat home.
For more pictures and information on these and additional visits that I made in the district this week, you can follow me on Twitter

Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office regarding an early termination mistake on his Medicare Part B coverage. Although the constituent had voluntarily requested a specific termination date, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) had cancelled his benefits prior to the requested date without informing him of the status change.
During this time, the constituent accrued thousands of dollars in provider charges as part of an effort to diagnose a neurological disorder he was experiencing. When the provider submitted the Medicare claims on behalf of the constituent, the claims were denied, and the provider began threatening to release his account to collection agencies.
When the constituent called my office, we reached out to SSA and CMS on his behalf and continued to follow up with them until the issue was resolved. We received an email from the constituent saying, I just wanted to tell you how appreciative I am for your help in untangling this mess. I could never have succeeded in doing this by myself. Thanks again."
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
During a Senate Committee Hearing last week, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remarked that there may come a point where he would assess the threat of the Islamic State high enough to require American troops on the ground.
If our top military and security personnel were to consider this a necessary aspect to destroying ISIS and protecting America, would you support a military strategy that included American troops fighting these Islamic terrorists on the ground in Iraq and Syria?
Yes
No
