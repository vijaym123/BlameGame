Friend -
I wanted to share with you an
article
I read that focuses on students relationships with technology.
In today's world, our students lives revolve around the computer
studying, perusing social media sites, etc.
However, many students dont consider computer technology as a career path.
Over the next ten years, 70% of new jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) will be for computing professionals.
I believe that we must encourage students to get involved in STEM at an early age, not only to develop their interest in those subjects, but to allow them to see that what they enjoy doing
like playing on computers
can be what they do for a living.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I supported the Academic Competition Resolution,
H. Res.77 , to establish an academic competition to spur student interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.
