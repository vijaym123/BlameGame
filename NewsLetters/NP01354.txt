The
American People Deserve a Voice in the
Iran Nuclear Negotiations
Dear Friend,
The prospect of Iran attaining the
capability to produce a nuclear weapon is
one of the most grave threats we face as a
nation, and it must be our policy to do
everything within our power to prevent this
from happening. The terms of Irans
preliminary nuclear understanding with the
United States, China, France, Germany,
Russia, and the United Kingdom is a cause
for concern due to Irans
longstanding commitment to see the demise
of the United States and Israel, our
greatest ally in the Middle East.
Last month, the American people had the
opportunity to receive Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahus invaluable
perspective on the danger of Iran gaining
nuclear capability. After details of the
preliminary understanding emerged,
Netanyahu called it,
a
dream deal for Iran and a nightmare deal
for the world.
Prime Minister
Netanyahus reaction provides another
stark reminder of the hatred and evil that
the Iranian regime represents, and I am
grateful for his continued leadership in
the effort to prevent a nuclear Iran.
I believe that Congress must conduct
rigorous oversight over any agreement and
must continue its efforts to impose a
regime of sanctions that maintains pressure
on Iran to abandon its nuclear aspirations.
I will continue to closely monitor the
negotiations as we wait for more specific
details.
Given Irans nuclear ambitions and
history, I am skeptical that Iran will act
in good faith and adhere to any of the
terms of a deal. Last Wednesday, Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani arrogantly
asserted that Iran was negotiating with
world powers and
not
the United States Congress . So I was
encouraged to see that the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee unanimously approved
legislation to allow Congress 30 days to
review any nuclear agreement with Iran.
The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
would prohibit the President from
suspending or waiving congressional
sanctions on Iran until the congressional
review period is complete and would also
require the President to certify to
Congress every 90 days that Iran is
complying with terms of any final
agreement. It is my hope that the Senate
will pass this legislation expeditiously so
the House can consider it in a timely
fashion. I was also pleased that the
President backed away from his initial
opposition to such legislation, saying that
he
no longer intends to veto legislation
that enables congressional oversight of the
agreement.
The American people and their
representatives in Congress must
immediately be afforded the opportunity to
meaningfully participate in this debate. We
must ensure that negotiations of such great
magnitude are as transparent as possible
and remain focused on our ultimate goal of
eliminating the threat of a nuclear
Iran.
