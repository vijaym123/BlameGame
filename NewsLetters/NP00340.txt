"Crucial Face-to-Face Services at the Social Security Administration"
By: Senator Susan Collins
Nearly one in four Maine residentsmore than 325,000
individualsreceives retirement, survivor, or disability benefits
through the Social Security Administration (SSA).
Of these
beneficiaries, more than 225,000 are seniors over age 65.
These
individuals are served by eight field offices located throughout our
state, where trained staff can help them obtain important documents and
navigate through the complexities of the Social Security and Medicare
programs so they can apply for, and receive the benefits which they
have earned.
The Baby Boom generation is entering retirement at a rapid rate, and
the number of individuals over the age of 65 is increasing
significantly.
At the same time, the population of those on disability
has increased. That is why I have long been concerned by SSAs efforts
to reduce person-to-person services, including closing field offices or
restricting hours of service, and to force beneficiaries to interact
with the agency online or over the phone.
The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, has spent a great
deal of time looking into this issue.
In the past six years, SSA has closed 64 of approximately 1,245 field
officesthe largest field office reduction in its historyand shuttered
533 temporary mobile offices. It has also reduced field office hours,
and in 2013, the agency began closing field offices at noon on
Wednesdays.
To be clear, there are many instances where it works well for
beneficiaries to call the SSA or log onto its website to take actions
such as request a new or replacement Social Security card, replace a
Medicare card, or to request a name change, for example. There may also
be situations where more complicated matters can be dealt with in this
manner.
I certainly do not object to SSA providing services this way
where it is appropriate.
My concern has been that the SSA has not sought public input with
regard to decisions about field offices, nor has it taken into account
the impact on the beneficiaries they are supposed to be serving.
Even
though computer and broadband technologies have become widespread, the
idea that the SSA can serve beneficiaries primarily online ignores the
very real needs of many in the senior and disabled populations.
The fact is, millions of seniors and disabled Americans are not
accustomed to doing business online, and particularly in rural areas,
many do not have access to computers and high-speed Internet.
If a
beneficiary has a complex issue to resolve, solving the matter may take
the attention of a trained field officer through a face-to-face
interaction with the beneficiary.

Senator Collins Raises Concerns Regarding Burden of Student Loan Debt
on Students Who Don't Complete College

The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held
a hearing this week titled, "Ensuring College Affordability." The focus
of this hearing was on students ability to pay for their education.
College affordability is a broad and construct issue that touches
several topics including college costs, federal financial aid
opportunities, student debt, a graduates ability to repay his or her
loans, and the role of state funding.
During the hearing, Senator Collins spoke on her experience working at
Husson University, questioning the panel of post-secondary education
experts on the debt burden held by students who left their
post-secondary education institutions without completing their degree.
Senator Collins expressed support for programs, such as the federal
TRIO programs, which provide counseling and support to students prior
to and during their college careers.
Senator Collins Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Help Businesses
Become Energy Efficient
Senator Susan Collins
and Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced the
Power Efficiency and Resiliency (POWER) Act this afternoon that will
help increase U.S. energy efficiency and independence and create new
American jobs. Rep. Tom Reed (R-New York) and Rep. Blumenauer
(D-Oregon) have introduced a companion bill in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
At present, U.S. utilities and factories send enough wasted energy in
the form of heat up their chimneys to power all of Japan each year.
Utilizing this formerly wasted energy has the potential to increase
electrical generation efficiency by nearly 80 percent and reduce costs
for industrial users.
Industrial energy efficiency technologies, including combined heat and
power (CHP) and waste heat to power (WHP), have proven successful in
using this previously squandered energy to warm or cool buildings and
generate additional electricity.
To make the current incentives more accessible and spur investment in
energy efficient technology across our country, The POWER Act would
place CHP and WHP on par with other forms of renewable energy by
expanding tax incentives for these systems and reducing the initial
cost of deploying these projects.

Speech click here
.
June 1st was the 65th anniversary of the legendary "Declaration of
Conscience" speech by Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, one of the
first public stands against the actions of Senator Joseph McCarthy.
Margaret Chase Smith serves as source of inspiration for Senator
Collins, who, as a high school senior, had the opportunity to speak
with Senator Smith. Senator Collins continues to honor the legacy of
Margaret Chase Smith by sitting at her desk on the Senate floor and
never missing a roll call vote.
Senator Collins Celebrates Maines Craft Beer Industry
This week, Senator Collins met with members of the Maine Brewers Guild
and Brewers Association. Maine is home to 62 active breweries that
produce more than 200 different varieties. These craft breweries employ
more than 1,500 people in Maine, strengthening the economy and creating
good jobs. In support of American Craft Beer Week, Senator Collins and
a bipartisan group of her colleagues introduced a resolution commending
the small and independent craft brewers across the nation.
Earlier this year, Senator Collins and Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland
introduced the Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce Act,
or Small BREW Act, highlighted in Senator Collins' weekly column
. The Small BREW Act offers a
practical means to spur the creation of new jobs as well as great
products in this growing industry by reducing the federal excise tax on
small craft brewers. This reduction would free up capital so these
small business owners can reinvest in their companies and create more
jobs.
Senator Collins Urges Fellow Senators to Support of the National
Defense Authorization Act

Speaking from the Senate floor, Senator Susan Collins called on her
colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA),
which funds the Defense Department through fiscal year 2016. This
legislation has successfully been enacted for over 50 years and
provides our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with the critical
resources they need to meet our national security missions.
In her speech, Senator Collins highlighted key provisions which would
fund the construction of the Navy's vital DDG-1000, built at Bath Iron
Works; support our nation's public shipyards, such Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard in Kittery; and improve upon the militarys response to sexual
assault.
The NDAA also reins in unnecessary and wasteful spending by directing
the Pentagon to cut headquarter and administrative costs by 7.5 percent
in the year 2016.
Senator Collins Greets Summer Interns
Every summer, Senator Collins provides students with a chance to serve
as interns in her Washington, D.C. office and Maine Constituent Service
Centers. Serving as an intern provides an opportunity for these
students to gain first-hand experience working alongside Senator
Collins and her staff in serving the people of Maine. Senator Collins,
who once served as an intern, places a strong emphasis on the program
so that future leaders will be able gain an understanding of Congress
and the federal government.
This week, Senator Collins welcomed several students to her Washington,
D.C. office. Listed clockwise in the photo above:

Potomac, MD. majoring in global studies with a concentration in
economics.
Miss Maine America Joins Senator Collins

During their visit, Kelsey presented Senator Collins with a mug
inscribed with the phrase, Got Lobstah?
Senator Susan Collins welcomed Miss Maine America 2015, Kelsey Earley
of Lebanon, to Washington, D.C. on Monday. Crowned in April, Kelsey
makes superhero capes for children who are fighting illness or living
with disabilities as part of her "Be a Superhero" platform. She has
hand-sewn more than 100 capes and donated them to The Barbara Bush
Childrens Hospital in Portland.
Kelsey is currently a junior at the University of New England and hopes
to become a dental hygienist. Kelsey is the first member of her
immediate family to attend college and is a literacy tutor for her
father. She will represent Maine at the national competition in
September.
Kelseys drive and determination to pursue her education is
inspiring, said Senator Collins. I was proud to welcome her to
Washington and look forward to seeing her use the Miss Maine platform
to expand the Be a Superhero project and help even more children.
Meeting with Mainers
Senator Collins always makes time to meet individually with
constituents either Mainers who are visiting Washington, D.C. or at
home in Maine.
She values hearing from Mainers on a wide range of topics. Here are a

"Crucial
Face-to-Face
Services
at
the
Social
Security
Administration"
By:
Senator
Susan
Collins
Nearly
one
in
four
Maine
residents&#151;more
than
325,000
individuals&#151;receives
retirement,
survivor,
or
disability
benefits
through
the
Social
Security
Administration
(SSA).
Of
these
beneficiaries,
more
than
225,000
are
seniors
over
age
65.
These
individuals
are
served
by
eight
field
offices
located
throughout
our
state,
where
trained
staff
can
help
them
obtain
important
documents
and
navigate
through
the
complexities
of
the
Social
Security
and
Medicare
programs
so
they
can
apply
for,
and
receive
the
benefits
which
they
have
earned.
The
Baby
Boom
generation
is
entering
retirement
at
a
rapid
rate,
and
the
number
of
individuals
over
the
age
of
65
is
increasing
significantly.
At
the
same
time,
the
population
of
those
on
disability
has
increased.
That
is
why
I
have
long
been
concerned
by
SSA&#146;s
efforts
to
reduce
person-to-person
services,
including
closing
field
offices
or
restricting
hours
of
service,
and
to
force
beneficiaries
to
interact
with
the
agency
online
or
over
the
phone.
The
Senate
Special
Committee
on
Aging,
which
I
chair,
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
looking
into
this
issue.
In
the
past
six
years,
SSA
has
closed
64
of
approximately
1,245
field
offices&#151;the
largest
field
office
reduction
in
its
history&#151;and
shuttered
533
temporary
mobile
offices.
It
has
also
reduced
field
office
hours,
and
in
2013,
the
agency
began
closing
field
offices
at
noon
on
Wednesdays.
To
be
clear,
there
are
many
instances
where
it
works
well
for
beneficiaries
to
call
the
SSA
or
log
onto
its
website
to
take
actions
such
as
request
a
new
or
replacement
Social
Security
card,
replace
a
Medicare
card,
or
to
request
a
name
change,
for
example.
There
may
also
be
situations
where
more
complicated
matters
can
be
dealt
with
in
this
manner.
I
certainly
do
not
object
to
SSA
providing
services
this
way
where
it
is
appropriate.
My
concern
has
been
that
the
SSA
has
not
sought
public
input
with
regard
to
decisions
about
field
offices,
nor
has
it
taken
into
account
the
impact
on
the
beneficiaries
they
are
supposed
to
be
serving.
Even
though
computer
and
broadband
technologies
have
become
widespread,
the
idea
that
the
SSA
can
serve
beneficiaries
primarily
online
ignores
the
very
real
needs
of
many
in
the
senior
and
disabled
populations.
The
fact
is,
millions
of
seniors
and
disabled
Americans
are
not
accustomed
to
doing
business
online,
and
particularly
in
rural
areas,
many
do
not
have
access
to
computers
and
high-speed
Internet.
If
a
beneficiary
has
a
complex
issue
to
resolve,
solving
the
matter
may
take
the
attention
of
a
trained
field
officer
through
a
face-to-face
interaction
with
the
beneficiary.

The
Senate Health,
Education,
Labor,
and
Pensions
(HELP)
Committee
held
a
hearing
this
week
titled,
" Ensuring
College
Affordability."
The
focus
of
this
hearing
was
on
students&#146;
ability
to
pay
for
their
education.
College
affordability
is
a
broad
and
construct
issue that
touches
several
topics
including
college
costs,
federal
financial
aid
opportunities,
student
debt,
a
graduate&#146;s
ability
to
repay
his
or
her
loans,
and
the
role
of
state
funding.
During
the
hearing,
Senator
Collins
spoke
on
her
experience
working
at
Husson
University,
questioning the
panel
of
post-secondary
education
experts
on
the
debt
burden
held
by
students
who left
their post-secondary
education
institutions
without
completing
their
degree.
Senator
Collins
expressed
support
for
programs,
such
as
the
federal TRIO
programs, which
provide
counseling
and
support
to students
prior
to
and
during
their
college
careers.
Senator
Collins
Introduces
Bipartisan
Legislation
to
Help
Businesses
Become
Energy
Efficient
Senator
Susan
Collins
and
Senator
Bob
Casey
(D-PA)
introduced
the
Power
Efficiency
and
Resiliency
(POWER)
Act
this
afternoon
that
will
help
increase
U.S.
energy
efficiency
and
independence
and
create
new
American
jobs.
Rep.
Tom
Reed
(R-New
York)
and
Rep.
Blumenauer
(D-Oregon)
have
introduced
a
companion
bill
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives.
At
present,
U.S.
utilities
and
factories
send
enough
wasted
energy
in
the
form
of
heat
up
their
chimneys
to
power
all
of
Japan
each
year.
Utilizing
this
formerly
wasted
energy
has
the
potential
to
increase
electrical
generation
efficiency
by
nearly
80
percent
and
reduce
costs
for
industrial
users.
Industrial
energy
efficiency
technologies,
including
combined
heat
and
power
(CHP)
and
waste
heat
to
power
(WHP),
have
proven
successful
in
using
this
previously
squandered
energy
to
warm
or
cool
buildings
and
generate
additional
electricity.
To
make
the
current
incentives
more
accessible
and
spur
investment
in
energy
efficient
technology
across
our
country,
The
POWER
Act
would
place
CHP
and
WHP
on
par
with
other
forms
of
renewable
energy
by
expanding
tax
incentives
for
these
systems
and
reducing
the
initial
cost
of
deploying
these
projects.

Guild
and
Brewers
Association.
Maine
is
home
to
62

that
produce
more
than
200
different
varieties.
These
craft
breweries
employ
more
than
1,500

In
support
of
American

Senator
Collins
and
a
bipartisan
group
of
her
colleagues
introduced
a

across
the
nation.
Earlier
this
year,
Senator
Collins

Senator
Susan
Collins
called
on
her
colleagues
to
support
the
National
Defense

Act
(NDAA),
which funds
the
Defense
Department through fiscal
year
2016 .
This
legislation
has
successfully
been
enacted
for
over
50
years
and provides
our
soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,
and

with
the
critical
resources
they need
to
meet
our

with
a
chance
to
serve
as
interns
in
her
Washington,

provides an
opportunity
for
these
students
to
gain
first-hand
experience
working
alongside
Senator
Collins
and
her
staff
in
serving
the
people
of
Maine. Senator
Collins,
who
once
served
as
an

places
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
program
so
that
future
leaders
will
be

Senator
Susan
Collins
welcomed
Miss
Maine
America
2015,
Kelsey
Earley
of
Lebanon,
to
Washington,
D.C.
on
Monday.
Crowned
in
April,
Kelsey makes
superhero
capes
for
children
who
are
fighting
illness
or
living
with
disabilities
as
part
of
her
"Be
a
Superhero"
platform.
She
has
hand-sewn
more
than
100
capes
and
donated
them
to
The
Barbara
Bush
Children&#146;s
Hospital
in
Portland.
Kelsey
is
currently
a
junior
at
the
University
of
New
England
and
hopes
to
become
a
dental
hygienist.
Kelsey
is
the
first
member
of
her
immediate
family
to
attend
college
and
is
a
literacy
tutor
for
her
father.
She
will
represent
Maine
at
the
national
competition
in
September.
&#147;Kelsey&#146;s
drive
and
determination
to
pursue
her
education
is
inspiring,&#148;
said
Senator
Collins.
&#147;I
was
proud
to
welcome
her
to
Washington
and
look
forward
to
seeing
her
use
the
Miss
Maine
platform
to
expand
the
&#145;Be
a
Superhero&#146;
project
and
help
even
more
children.&#148;
Meeting
with
Mainers
Senator
Collins
always
makes
time
to
meet
individually
with
constituents&#151;
either
Mainers
who
are
visiting
Washington,
D.C.
or
at
home
in
Maine.
She
values
hearing
from
Mainers
on
a
wide
range
of
topics.
