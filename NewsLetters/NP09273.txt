Advocating for Granite State Veterans
Hi All!
I hope you all had a fantastic holiday weekend. Last week, I advocated
on behalf of our veterans and their families, and fought to bring an
end to human trafficking. Over the weekend, I joined Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse to discuss the effects of climate change on New England's
outdoor recreation economy and I helped honor Granite State veterans
and their families around the state on Memorial Day.
Honoring our veterans in Nashua
Honoring our Veterans on Memorial Day
This Memorial Day, we honored the memory of the valiant men and women
who sacrificed their lives in order to serve and protect our nation.
They are part of what makes this country great, and we owe them and
their families our gratitude and respect. We also honor our courageous
men and women who today continue to serve, and who are making extreme
personal sacrifices to keep our nation out of harm's way. On Monday and
Tuesday, I helped honor and celebrate our veterans in Concord, Nashua,
and at the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton.
Discussing Climate Change with Senator Whitehouse
On Friday, I co-hosted a roundtable discussion on the effects of
climate change on New Hampshire's economy
with Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse from Rhode Island, who is one of the lead voices in the
Senate on the urgent need to address climate change on the federal
level. During the roundtable, we discussed how warmer winters and
climate change are altering the landscape of New Hampshire's natural
environment, which many of the state's outdoor recreation and tourism
industry businesses rely on to succeed.
With Senator Whitehouse at the roundtable
Senator Whitehouse and I were joined by a variety of New Hampshire
small business owners and local ski area, snowmobiling, maple sugar,
and hospitality representatives to discuss how climate change is
directly affecting their businesses and New Hampshire's economy on the
whole. We also discussed the recently released National Climate
Assessment report, and outlined steps that leaders on the federal level
should take to curb the effects of climate change and prevent
additional harm to New Hampshire's economy.
Fighting for our Veterans in Washington
Last week, I continued to push the VA to immediately rectify any issues
at VA facilities around the country and to provide details about
alleged mismanagement and falsifications at the Phoenix VA medical
facility. On Wednesday, I voted in favor of legislation giving the
Department of Veterans Affairs more authority to fire VA personnel for
underperformance.
Then on Thursday during a House Veterans' Affairs
Committee meeting, I voted to approve the issuance of subpoenas to VA
officials pending their appearance to testify in front of the Committee
the following week.
Our veterans made extreme personal sacrifices to serve and protect our
great nation, and no veteran should ever have trouble accessing high
quality health care services. As a Member of the U.S. House Veterans'
Affairs Committee, I'm shocked and appalled by the Office of the
Inspector General's (IG) interim report detailing mass, systemic
mismanagement of wait times at the VA. This report, coupled with the
VA's gross failure to comply with the House Veterans' Affairs Committee
investigation into this matter, leads me to believe it is time for new
leadership at the VA. Last night, I called on VA Secretary Eric
Shinseki to tender his resignation, so a new Acting Secretary can take
his place and work to immediately provide care for any veteran who is
still waiting for health services.
Pushing to End Human Trafficking
I was so proud that my fellow Members of Congress crossed party lines
and came together last week to pass four pieces of legislation that
will help put an end to the vile practice of human trafficking and
provide increased support for victims. I was a cosponsor of the package
of legislation and a strong advocate for its passage. Many like to
believe that human trafficking is a foreign issue, but this simply is
not the case. Tragically, an estimated 293,000 American youth are at
risk of commercial exploitation and sex trafficking right here in the
United States. These statistics are simply unacceptable, and we must do
more to end this horrific practice. We must also ensure victims of
human trafficking have access to the support and resources they need to
recover.
I recently hosted a roundtable discussion in Concord, N.H.
where I heard from victims
and advocates about instances of trafficking that occurred right here
in the U.S. It is on behalf of these extremely brave individuals - and
all the many others like them - that I fought for passage of these
bills, and will continue to fight for additional measures in the House
to put an end to human trafficking once and for all. (Please watch my
floor speech here

Have a good week and thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire
such a great place to live!

Fighting
for
our
Veterans
in
Washington
Last
week,
I
continued
to
push
the
VA
to
immediately
rectify
any
issues
at
VA
facilities
around
the
country
and
to
provide
details
about
alleged
mismanagement
and
falsifications
at
the
Phoenix
VA
medical
facility.
On
Wednesday,
I
voted
in
favor
of
legislation
giving
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
more
authority
to
fire
VA
personnel
for
underperformance.
Then
on
Thursday
during
a
House
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee
meeting,
I
voted
to
approve
the
issuance
of
subpoenas
to
VA
officials
pending
their
appearance
to
testify
in
front
of
the
Committee
the
following
week.
Our
veterans
made
extreme
personal
sacrifices
to
serve
and
protect
our
great
nation,
and
no
veteran
should
ever
have
trouble
accessing
high
quality
health
care
services.
As
a
Member
of
the
U.S.
House
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee,
I&#8217;m
shocked
and
appalled
by
the
Office
of
the
Inspector
General&#8217;s
(IG)
interim
report
detailing
mass,
systemic
mismanagement
of
wait
times
at
the
VA.
This
report,
coupled
with
the
VA&#8217;s
gross
failure
to
comply
with
the
House
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee
investigation
into
this
matter,
leads
me
to
believe
it
is
time
for
new
leadership
at
the
VA.
Last
night,
I
called
on
VA
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
to
tender
his
resignation,
so
a
new
Acting
Secretary
can
take
his
place
and
work
to
immediately
provide
care
for
any
veteran
who
is
still
waiting
for
health
services.

Many
like
to
believe
that
human

a
foreign

but
this
simply
is
not
the
case.
Tragically,
an
estimated
293,000
American
youth
are
at
risk
of
commercial

and
sex

in
the

These
statistics
are
simply

and
we

horrific
practice. We
must
also

of

I
