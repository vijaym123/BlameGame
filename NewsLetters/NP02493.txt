David --
During the month of March, we&rsquo;re proud to celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month -- a time to reflect on the women who have inspired our nation.
Over the last century, women have made enormous strides. Cheri&rsquo;s proud to be the first woman to represent our region of Illinois in the House, and to serve with a historic number of women in Congress.
But the fight continues. In 2015, women are STILL struggling for paycheck equality. In fact, women in our district earn a shocking 73 cents for every dollar men earn.
We&rsquo;ve got to close the pay gap.
Sign your name to support equal pay for equal work &gt;&gt;

Equal pay isn't just a women's issue, it means less money for families to put food on the table or to pay their bills.
For families, children, and communities to succeed, we must achieve economic equality for all women.
