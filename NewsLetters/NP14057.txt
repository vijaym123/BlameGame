Health Care Reform Helping Inland Empire Residents
Earlier this week, Rep. Mark Takano read a letter from a local resident
about the benefits her family received from the Affordable Care Act. In
the letter, Moreno Valley resident Karrie Brooks said, "Recently,
Anthem let me know I would have to change to a compliant plan. The plan
they suggested is similar to what I had, but it will cost me $53 less
each month. Yes, less. Most important, I know that I cannot be
cancelled, and if I so choose next year, the peace-of-mind and security
that these changes have given me is huge."

Rep. Takano Reads Letters from Local Residents on the Need for
Immigration Reform
Last week, Rep. Takano read letters from local Inland Empire residents
about the need for immigration reform and how the broken system has
affected their lives.
"I also received a letter from a wife and mother saying, "I myself am
one of those many families that unfortunately have to go through this
injustice. My husband was deported on his way to work about three years
ago, and during these few years, it has been really hard for my new
five year old daughter and me. The stress I go through every day is
unhealthy and unfortunately, my daughter has to go through it as well.
My daughter really wants to be with her father and it really hurts to
see her have to go through this situation."

Rep. Takano Celebrates American Education Week
This past week, Rep. Takano celebrated American Education Week, which
presents all Americans with a wonderful opportunity to celebrate public
education and honor individuals who are making a difference in ensuring
that every child receives a quality education.
"Our public schools need the proper resources to compete in the global
economy and American Education Week gives us the opportunity to pledge
our support," said Rep. Takano. "I am proud to "Raise My Hand" for our
public education system and am committed to its success."

Rep. Takano Sends Condolences to Filipino Community
Earlier this month, Super Typhoon Haiyan made landfall and caused
damage across several Southeast Asian nations, particularly the
Philippines. Currently, more than 4,000 have been confirmed dead and
tens of thousands have been displaced.
Rep. Takano sent his condolences to the Filipino community saying, "The
images coming out of the Philippines are absolutely heartbreaking. I
urge the appropriate federal agencies to offer assistance and relief
efforts so that Filipinos can begin the rebuilding process as soon as
possible and I encourage residents in my district to contact my office
if they are having difficulty reaching loved ones. My thoughts and
prayers are with the Filipino people in this time of need."
Rep. Takano also signed onto a letter requesting acting Secretary of
Homeland Security Rand Beers exercise the Department of Homeland
Security's authority to designate the Philippines for Temporary
Protected Status (TPS). This would allow the Homeland Security
Secretary to designate a foreign state for special protection if a
natural disaster prevents it from being able to handle the return of
its nationals.
