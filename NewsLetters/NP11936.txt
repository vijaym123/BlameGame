>From The Desk Of Congressman Ted S. Yoho
Dear Friends,
On my flight back to Washington yesterday, I was reflecting on the time
I spent with the people I represent. I always enjoy coming home. I was
in Florida for the past week traveling around our district listening to
your concerns, meeting with local officials, hearing about all the
great things that are happening in our schools, and meeting with civic
groups and other constituents. Being home connects me to what is
important to North Central Florida -that is what I take with me to
Washington. There were a lot of meetings while I was home, here are
just a couple highlights I would like to share.
Meeting with Keystone Heights HS:
While spending the day in Clay County, it was a pleasure teaching and
discussing the Constitution with our future leaders at Keystone Heights
High School. President Reagan once said;
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We
didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought
for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we
will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's
children what it was once like in the United States where men were
free."
There were over 100 students in attendance, including members of first
year JROTC and student government. It is essential that we take the
time to pass along the importance of the Constitution to our children.
There will come a time when we will entrust to them its safekeeping and
defense. In addition to the Constitution, we discussed community issues
and recent legislation. I then encouraged them to get involved and find
an issue they are passionate about.
Camp Blanding Joint Training Center:
It was an honor meeting the men and women at the Camp Blanding Joint
Training Center, in Clay County. This joint training center is the
crown jewel of Florida's National Guard. I have always believed in the
importance of a strong military. The world is a dangerous place, and
the best way to preserve the peace is to project unity and strength -at
home and abroad - in defense of the nation we love. I'm always amazed
at the continued dedication of the men and women of the Florida
National Guard for their service to our communities, state, and
country. I am proud to be their representative in Congress.
National Entrepreneurship Week:
Last week was National Entrepreneurship Week. This annual celebration
is designed to expand the visibility of entrepreneurs and make sure
that everyone learns about entrepreneurship and how it drives our
economy. While in Gainesville, I was asked to be the keynote speaker at
the annual membership luncheon for the Builders Association of North
Central Florida (BANCF). The building industry is one of Florida's
three largest industries and it is important we celebrate the
contributions of these entrepreneurs to Florida's economy. After my
speech, they honored me with the 2013 Good Government Award. I will
always do my best to support legislation that doesn't stand in the way
of business, helps create jobs, and strengthens our economy. Thank you
BANCF.
This was just a sample of the many stops I made while driving around
our district. If you'd like to schedule an appointment or have me visit
a location, I'd be honored. All you have to do is click here.
Best,
Ted

By

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single

inches

because
they

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Ted
S.
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
On
my
flight
back
to
Washington
yesterday,
I
was
reflecting
on
the
time
I
spent
with
the
people
I
represent.
I
always
enjoy
coming
home.
I
was
in
Florida
for
the
past
week
traveling
around
our
district
listening
to
your
concerns,
meeting
with
local
officials,
hearing
about
all
the
great
things
that
are
happening
in
our
schools,
and
meeting
with
civic
groups
and
other
constituents.
Being
home
connects
me
to
what
is
important
to
North
Central
Florida
-that
is
what
I
take
with
me
to
Washington.
There
were
a
lot
of
meetings
while
I
was
home,
here
are
just
a
couple
highlights
I
would
like
to
share&#8230;
Meeting
with
Keystone
Heights
HS:
While
spending
the
day
in
Clay
County,
it
was
a
pleasure
teaching
and
discussing
the
Constitution
with
our
future
leaders
at
Keystone
Heights
High
School.
President
Reagan
once
said;
&#8220; Freedom
is
never
more
than
one
generation
away
from
extinction.
We
didn't
pass
it
to
our
children
in
the
bloodstream.
It
must
be
fought
for,
protected,
and
handed
on
for
them
to
do
the
same,
or
one
day
we
will
spend
our
sunset
years
telling
our
children
and
our
children's
children
what
it
was
once
like
in
the
United
States
where
men
were
free.&#8221;
There
were
over
100
students
in
attendance,
including
members
of
first
year
JROTC
and
student
government.
It
is
essential
that
we
take
the
time
to
pass
along
the
importance
of
the
Constitution
to
our
children.
There
will
come
a
time
when
we
will
entrust
to
them
its
safekeeping
and
defense. In
addition
to
the
Constitution,
we
discussed
community
issues
and
recent
legislation.
I
then
encouraged
them
to
get
involved
and
find
an
issue
they
are
passionate
about.
Camp
Blanding
Joint
Training
Center:
It
was
an
honor
meeting
the
men
and
women
at
the
Camp
Blanding
Joint
Training
Center,
in
Clay
County. This
joint
training
center
is
the
crown
jewel
of
Florida's
National
Guard.
I
have
always
believed
in
the
importance
of
a
strong
military.
The
world
is
a
dangerous
place,
and
the
best
way
to
preserve
the
peace
is
to
project
unity
and
strength
&#8211;at
home
and
abroad
-
in
defense
of
the
nation
we
love. I'm
always
amazed
at
the
continued
dedication
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
Florida
National
Guard
for
their
service
to
our
communities,
state,
and
country. I
am
proud
to
be
their
representative
in
Congress.
National
Entrepreneurship
Week:
Last
week
was
National
Entrepreneurship
Week.
T his
annual
celebration
is
designed
to
expand
the
visibility
of
entrepreneurs
and
make
sure
that
everyone
learns
about
entrepreneurship
and
how
it
drives
our
economy.
While
in
Gainesville,
I
was
asked
to
be
the
keynote
speaker
at
the
annual
membership
luncheon
for
the
Builders
Association
of
North
Central
Florida
(BANCF).
The
building
industry
is
one
of
Florida's
three
largest
industries
and
it
is
important
we
celebrate
the
contributions
of
these
entrepreneurs
to
Florida's
economy.
After
my
speech,
they
honored
me
with
the
2013
Good
Government
Award.
I
will
always
do
my
best
to
support
legislation
that
doesn&#8217;t
stand
in
the
way
of
business,
helps
create
jobs,
and
strengthens
our
economy.
Thank
you
BANCF.
This
was
just
a
sample
of
the
many
stops
I
made
while
driving
around
our
district.
If
you'd
like
to
schedule

appointment
or

me

a

I'd
be
honored.
