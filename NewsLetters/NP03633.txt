Dear Friends:
Mikey and I would like to extend our warmest wishes to you and yours
during this holiday season. We hope each of you had a happy, merry
Christmas surrounded by family and friends. We also want to acknowledge
and thank the brave servicemen and women who were unable to be with
their loved ones this year because they were overseas fighting for our
freedom. Thank you for your service, sacrifice and commitment.
As the Christmas season comes to a close, we start to set our sights
toward the new year. I'm confident the new Republican-led Congress in
2015 will mark the beginning of getting America back on track. It is
time to seize this opportunity and enact legislation to help small
businesses, farmers and the entire economy.
These past few weeks, I worked to ensure several provisions were passed
to help North Dakota's farmers and ranchers. The first was a bill
making it easier to get permits for grazing on federal lands, which you
can read here
.
I also continue working to stop the EPA's Waters of the U.S. proposed
regulation, which would place unnecessary burdens on farmers and
ranchers. We took an important first step by defunding the Waters of
the U.S. Interpretive Rule, which the EPA issued to implement the
Waters of the U.S. regulation for farmers and ranchers. I will continue
to work in the new Congress to defund and eliminate the regulation in
its entirety. You can read more about that here
.
In closing, I want to take a moment to say goodbye to Fargo Mayor
Dennis Walaker
. He dedicated his life to serving
Fargo. His tireless efforts to promote Fargo and protect the city from
flooding have made the city a better place for future generations. We
will all miss you, Denny Walaker.
Mikey and I wish everyone a Happy New Year. We can't wait to see what
2015 has in store.
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

Government Funding
Congress Passes Omnibus Appropriations Legislation for 2015
Hoeven Supports Bill Which Reduces Spending, Sets Timeline for
Immigration Action and Withdraws Waters of the U.S. Rule
WASHINGTON - Senator John Hoeven voted with a bipartisan group of
senators to fund most government programs for Fiscal Year 2015.
"It is important to keep the government funded - providing resources
for our veterans, law enforcement and education system, among other
things. The legislation isn't perfect, but it reduces spending, which
is important to reduce the national debt. It only funds the Department
of Homeland Security until the end of February 2015, which will give
the new Congress time to address immigration and strengthen our
borders. Importantly, too, we begin to reduce the EPA's overreach by
directing a withdrawal of Waters of the U.S." Click here to read more.

Tax Extensions
Senate Passes Tax Increase Prevention Act
Measure Helps Farmers, Ranchers and Small Businesses
WASHINGTON - Senator John Hoeven joined 75 other senators to pass the
Tax Increase Prevention Act, extending some tax credits and deductions
to the end of this year. The measure includes an extension of Section
179 which means farmers, ranchers and small businesses can expense
equipment purchased in 2014.
""These extensions, and especially the Section 179 expensing and
depreciation provision, will provide immediate tax relief and greater
certainty to individuals, farmers, ranchers and small businesses. This
is good not only for small businesses, but also for the economy because
it helps businesses grow and hire." Click here to read more.

Defense Authorization Legislation Passed
Hoeven's Work Keeps ICMB Silos and Global Hawk Funded, Blocks Proposal
to Close Bases
WASHINGTON - Senator John Hoeven included important provisions to
benefit North Dakota and bolster America's defense in the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
"We worked to ensure that the defense authorization legislation
supports North Dakota priorities and provide the resources and tools
our military needs to protect and defend our country." Click here to

2014 Dear
Friends:
Mikey
and
I
would
like
to
extend
our
warmest
wishes
to
you
and
yours
during
this
holiday
season.
We
hope
each
of
you
had
a
happy,

we
start
to

I'm

the

mark
the
