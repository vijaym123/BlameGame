Senator Stabenow's Farm Bill Passes Senate, Heads to President
Legislation Makes Landmark Reforms;
Big Win for Michigan
The U.S. Senate today voted overwhelmingly to approve the bipartisan
Farm Bill authored by U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the
Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, by a vote of
68-32.
The bill represents rare bipartisan agreement on a major jobs bill,
legislation that will help grow Michigan's agriculture economy, the
state's second-largest industry. The 2014 Farm Bill reduces the deficit
by $23 billion and represents the most significant reform of American
agriculture policy in decades. The Farm Bill was approved by the House
last week and will now head to the White House for the president's
signature.
"This isn't your father's Farm Bill.
It is a bill for our future that
grows our agriculture economy, helps provide greater access to healthy
Michigan-grown foods, preserves our land and water, and cuts unnecessary
spending. The Farm Bill is a rare example of a major bipartisan jobs
bill and a bipartisan deficit reduction bill," Chairwoman Stabenow said.
"We were also able to protect food assistance for families in need of
support, while finding savings solely by focusing on fraud and misuse.
"We proved that by working together across party lines, Congress can
save taxpayer money and strengthen critical investments that lay the
foundation for economic growth.
"It's been a long road, with many challenges.
I'm very proud that we
maintained strong bipartisanship throughout this entire process.
In the
end, Congress came together to support 16 million American jobs, save
taxpayers billions and implement the most significant reforms to
agriculture programs in decades."
The bill has received widespread support and has been endorsed by a
broad coalition of agriculture groups in Michigan, including the
Michigan Agri-Business Association, Michigan Farm Bureau, Michigan
United Conservation Clubs, Michigan Corn Growers, Michigan Milk
Producers Association, Potato Growers of Michigan, Michigan Bean
Commission, Cherry Marketing Council, Michigan Sugar Company, Michigan
Soybean Association, and GreenStone Farm Credit Services, Cadillac Area
Land Conservancy, Muskegon River Watershed Assembly, Leelanau
Conservancy, Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council, Michigan Forest Products
Council and Six Rivers Land Conservancy.
The bipartisan, five-year Farm Bill, entitled the Agricultural Act of
2014, will reform agriculture programs, reduce the deficit by $23
billion and help farmers and business owners grow Michigan's agriculture
economy.
Agriculture is critical to Michigan's economy:
*	Agriculture is Michigan's second-largest industry.
*	Agriculture supports nearly one in four jobs in Michigan.
*	Strengthens crop insurance and makes it available to Michigan's
specialty crop (i.e., fruit and vegetable) growers.
*	Agriculture exports are a bright spot in Michigan's continuing
economic recovery.
