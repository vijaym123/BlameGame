Text of Congressman Jason Smith&#39;s response to President Obama&#39;s State of the Union Address:
Tonight we heard President Obama&#39;s vision for America. The President believes more government and more executive action are the solutions to every problem facing our country. When I talk to folks back home in Missouri, they tell me big government is the problem, not the solution.
Families are burdened with excessive regulations. In the first 3 days of 2014, the Obama Administration posted 141 new regulations - 141 regulations in just 3 days. President Obama seems intent to regulate everything from how we meet our energy needs to when we are allowed to use rivers for Baptism services.
President Obama is issuing new regulations through executive orders because he knows his agenda is too extreme to get through Congress. It&#39;s time for the president to stop side stepping Congress. The President needs to abandon his &#34;my way or the highway&#34; approach and start working with Congress.
During my short time in Washington I have become convinced that we must put an end to the burdensome Obama regulations that stifle creativity and limit our freedoms. New regulations from executive action are not the solution.
This is Congressman Jason Smith, thank you for listening.
