Dear
Friend,
It was
a good week for veterans with VA announcing that the Lake Baldwin VA
clinic will remain open and serving our veterans following the opening
of the new VA hospital at Lake Nona.
Additionally, Congress
passed a historic bill that will significantly overhaul and improve the
VA services.
The good news began on Tuesday morning, just as
I was about to chair a Government Operations Subcommittee hearing
regarding idle and vacant federal properties.
I received a response
from Acting VA Secretary, Sloan Gibson stating that the VA had
reviewed the need for keeping the Lake Baldwin VA clinic open and that the
figures the VA complied justified keeping the clinic open.
This
is a huge victory for Central Floridas veterans and will go a long way
in insuring that our veterans receive the best possible care and
shorter wait periods for appointments.
Additionally, I would like to
thank all of the local veterans and community leaders for their
support in getting this accomplished.
It is a testament to the fact
that when we all work together, there is nothing we can not
accomplish.
Furthermore, this week the new Orlando VA Hospital at Lake
Nona is 91 percent complete and significant progress is being made to
open that hospital as soon as possible, hopefully by the end of the
year.
Passed this week,
The Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act,
is a major step forward in reforming the VA
and improving veterans health care quality and access.
This bill
will significantly change the way the VA conducts its business and
will allow those who continue to mismanage their duties to be held
accountable.
Below are just a few of the key provisions in the
bill:
Require the VA to offer non-VA care to any
veteran who is unable to secure an appointment at a VA medical facility
within 30 days or resides more than 40 miles from the nearest VA medical
facility.
Require an independent assessment
of VA medical care and establish a Congressional Commission on Care to
evaluate access to care throughout the VA health care system.
Provide $5 billion to VA to increase access to care
through the hiring of physicians and other medical staff and by
improving VAs physical infrastructure.
Authorize 27 major medical facility leases in 18 states and Puerto Rico.
Authorize the VA to fire or demote Senior
Executive Service (SES) employees for poor performance or
misconduct.
Finally, the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald as the new
Secretary of the VA.
It is my hope that with his confirmation,
combined with the new authority given to the Secretary contained in
The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act,
we will soon
begin to see a major change in the way the VA cares for our
veterans.
While this is just a start and much more work needs to
be done, I am more confident than ever that our veterans will finally
begin to get the treatment and care that they have so rightly
earned.
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
