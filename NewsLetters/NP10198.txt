News from Representative John Delaney
May 1, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week the House of Representatives came together to pass an
appropriations bill funding critical improvements to the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Providing additional funds to reduce the backlog
in processing veteran's claims, the VA appropriations bill passed the
House in a bipartisan vote on Wednesday. I was proud to join colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to send a clear message that the United
States will make good on its commitment to protect the men and women
who have served our country.
Today, more than 865,000 claims are pending with the VA, nearly 70
percent of which have remained unresolved for more than four months. In
our own state, the VA's Baltimore office remains the slowest in the
country at processing disability claims, with wait times average about
a year. Our veterans deserve better than that, short and simple. Having
worked for twenty years in the private sector, I understand that to fix
a problem you have to put a focus on transparency and provide the right
resources to get results. This week, I was happy to see a bill in the
House that provides for both.
The VA appropriations bill would require the VA to provide monthly
reports on claims processing and remediation efforts for
underperforming offices that are slowing the process down. With
hundreds of thousands of former service members waiting to receive the
benefits they were promised, Congress has a responsibility to keep an
eye on this problem and monthly reports should provide some
transparency.
The bill that passed on Wednesday would also increase funds available
to the VA for updating offices with digital equipment and for
additional staffing to reduce the backlog. These targeted
appropriations will bring needed updates to VA offices and provide our
federal workforce with the flexibility they need to fix the backlog.
During my first term in the House of Representatives, I've acted as a
strong voice for our veterans, by supporting bills like yesterday's
appropriations act, through communications with the VA, and by
introducing my own legislation. In December of 2013, I joined six of my
colleagues from Maryland to write VA administrators, asking that
veterans with a pending claim be allowed to submit their information
for inclusion in an expedited claims process. I've also introduced my
own bill to provide veterans with a voice at the VA in the
administration of educational benefits.
As a nation, we cannot afford to fail our veterans and military
families. While I was happy to support the VA appropriations bill that
came to the floor this week, we have more work to do to ensure that all
veterans receive the benefits they were promised in a timely manner. As
Congress considers the VA backlog, I will continue my work to act as a
voice for our men and women in uniform. I welcome your feedback
on this important issue.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
May

2014
Dear
Friend,
This
week
the
House
of
Representatives
came
together
to
pass
an
appropriations
bill
funding
critical
improvements
to
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
Providing
additional
funds
to
reduce
the
backlog
in
processing
veteran&#8217;s
claims,
the
VA
appropriations
bill
passed
the
House
in
a
bipartisan
vote
on
Wednesday.
I
was
proud
to
join
colleagues
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
to
send
a
clear
message
that
the
United
States
will
make
good
on
its
commitment
to
protect
the
men
and
women
who
have
served
our
country.
Today,
more
than
865,000
claims
are
pending
with
the
VA,
nearly
70
percent
of
which
have
remained
unresolved
for
more
than
four
months.
In
our
own
state,
the
VA&#8217;s
Baltimore
office
remains
the
slowest
in
the
country
at
processing
disability
claims,
with
wait
times
average
about
a
year.
Our
veterans
deserve
better
than
that,
short
and
simple.
Having
worked
for
twenty
years
in
the
private
sector,
I
understand
that
to
fix
a
problem
you
have
to
put
a
focus
on
transparency
and
provide
the
right
resources
to
get
results.
This
week,
I
was
happy
to
see
a
bill
in
the
House
that
provides
for
both.
The
VA
appropriations
bill
would
require
the
VA
to
provide
monthly
reports
on
claims
processing
and
remediation
efforts
for
underperforming
offices
that
are
slowing
the
process
down.
With
hundreds
of
thousands
of
former
service
members
waiting
to
receive
the
benefits
they
were
promised,
Congress
has
a
responsibility
to
keep
an
eye
on
this
problem
and
monthly
reports
should
provide
some
transparency.
The
bill
that
passed
on
Wednesday
would
also
increase
funds
available
to
the
VA
for
updating
offices
with
digital
equipment
and
for
additional
staffing
to
reduce
the
backlog.
These
targeted
appropriations
will
bring
needed
updates
to
VA
offices
and
provide
our
federal
workforce
with
the
flexibility
they
need
to
fix
the
backlog.
During
my
first
term
in
the
House
of
Representatives,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
strong
voice
for
our
veterans,
by
supporting
bills
like
yesterday&#8217;s
appropriations
act,
through
communications
with
the
VA,
and
by
introducing
my
own
legislation.
In
December
of
2013,
I
joined
six

my
colleagues
from
Maryland
to

VA
administrators,
asking
that
veterans
with
a
pending
claim
be
allowed
to
submit
their
information
for
inclusion
in
an
expedited
claims
process.
I&#8217;ve
also
introduced
my
own
bill
to
provide
veterans
with
a
voice
at
the
VA
in
the
administration
of
educational
benefits.
As
a
nation,
we
cannot
afford
to
fail
our
veterans
and
military
families.
While
I
was
happy
to
support
the
VA
appropriations
bill
that
came
to
the
floor
this
week,
we
have
more
work
to
do
to
ensure
that
all
veterans
receive
the
benefits
they
were
promised
in
a
timely
manner.
As
Congress
considers
the
VA
backlog,
I
will
continue
my
work
to
act
as
a
voice
for
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
I
welcome
your
feedback
on
this
important
issue.
