Dear Friends,
This Monday, November 11 marks Veterans Day, commemorating both the anniversary of the end of World War I and the courageous men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping us safe every day.
Our veterans have earned the thanks of a grateful nation for their service, and I will continue to fight to ensure our service members receive the benefits they deserve. During my time in Congress, I have been a strong advocate for veterans and their families. It&rsquo;s been an honor to serve as a Ranking Member on the Veterans Committee for over 20 years, and I continue to fight for the rights, benefits and services due to our Veterans.
As always, if you or a family member need assistance with veterans benefits or any other issue, please
contact my office .

I am pleased to share with you this photo in which I'm standing alongside members of the Montford Point Marines in the shadow of the Capitol steps. It was my honor to play a role in making sure these marines who paved the way, over 70 years ago, were
paid tribute for their trailblazing path.
I have been an elected official for over 20 years, and truly one of the proudest moments I have experienced in all my years was when the House passed the bill to grant a Congressional Gold Medal to the Montford Point Marines. If you would like to attend at a 2013 Veterans Day ceremony, the Department of Veterans Affairs has created
this resource
to help you find one in your neighborhood.
There are also a variety of ways to support veterans on Veterans Day or at any time of the year. These include:
Volunteer to help a veteran.
Put your unique talents to work by volunteering through the Veterans Administration (VA). The
VA Voluntary Service Office
can provide you information on how to help local veterans in our area.
Give to soldiers currently serving.
Organize friends and family to
send care packages and letters
to Americans serving here and abroad.
Display the American flag.
Show your national pride and display our nation&rsquo;s flag in front of your home. To find proper ways to display the flag,

Help a vet find a job.
First Lady Michelle Obama's initiative,
Joining Forces , connects our servicemen and women, veterans, and military spouses with the resources they need to find jobs at home.
Once again from my family to yours, I would like to personally extend my deepest thanks to all those who have served and are currently serving in the Armed Forces. Your service in protecting this country and our freedom is a debt we will never be able to fully repay.
With kindest regards, I am,
Corrine Brown
Member of Congress
