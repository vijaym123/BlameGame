Wicker: RESTORE Act Progress Important to Long-Term
Recovery
Legal Fight
Over Fines Against BP Has Led to Uncertainty,
Delays
In 2012, Congress offered a new strategy for restoring the Gulf
Coast in the wake of the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
Enactment of the RESTORE Act ensured that the majority of Clean Water Act
fines for the Deepwater Horizon disaster would go toward recovery
efforts in Mississippi and other Gulf states.
In the past, these
fines went to the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which was
established to provide emergency funds for future
spills.
Implementation of RESTORE, however, has been
hampered by the legal fight over the fines against BP, which is
expected to resume next spring.
Until the courts determine the amount
of civil penalties against those responsible, RESTORE projects will be
put on hold.
Mississippi, for instance, has not even been asked
to submit proposed projects for funding under the law.
'One Chance to Get This
Right'
Congress has a responsibility to oversee how the
laws it passes are put into place, providing oversight and ensuring
accountability among those who carry out these policies.
Recently,
the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast
Guard held a hearing to examine the progress being made along the Gulf
Coast, including the implementation of RESTORE.
As
a member of this subcommittee, I was pleased to welcome Trudy Fisher,
the outgoing executive director of the Mississippi Department of
Environmental Quality, as one of the hearing's expert witnesses.
Her
testimony highlighted Mississippi's efforts to secure early
restoration projects and the state's readiness to utilize RESTORE dollars for
additional projects.
She sensibly noted, "We only have one chance
to get this right and those of us privileged to represent our fellow
citizens in this effort bear a fiduciary duty to those back at home to
turn our discussions into projects."
Early Restoration
Success
Mississippi has already made great strides in using funds under the
Natural Resource Damage Assessment to complete restoration projects.
A project to enhance existing reefs in the Mississippi Sound will
boost harvestable oyster production within three to six years.
Another project to enhance artificial reefs in our state's coastal waters
will improve the overall marine ecosystem.
These projects
represent the vision and commitment in our state to replenish important
habitats and resources.
RESTORE is a crucial part of the
recovery process, giving states the authority and flexibility to
address their most critical needs.
In addition to environmental
harm, the spill caused extensive economic damage along the Gulf Coast,
devastating livelihoods and threatening the long-term way of life in our
coastal communities.
RESTORE recognizes the complexity of the
oil spill's repercussions and will empower local leaders to be
decision-makers in finding solutions.
Positive Action by U.S. Treasury
As a
cosponsor of the RESTORE Act, I worked diligently toward its passage
in Congress and will continue to monitor its implementation.
Recovering from this disaster will not happen overnight, but we must
remain resolute in our commitment to keep moving forward.
Earlier
this month, the U.S. Treasury Department issued an Interim Final Rule
related to the RESTORE Act, which is important to unlocking the funds
for RESTORE projects once the legal fight over the fines is
settled.
I hope this constructive step will help break the logjam and that
Gulf states will soon have the needed certainty about RESTORE funding
to get key projects underway.
