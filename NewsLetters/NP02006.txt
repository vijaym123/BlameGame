Friend,
This week, Ami was the only member of the House of Representatives to receive the
2015 Planned Parenthood Champion of Women&rsquo;s Health award , a national recognition of his dedication to protect women&#39;s access to reproductive health care.
Politicians have no place in the exam room.
And as a doctor, father and husband, Ami has fought tirelessly to ensure health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor.
Click here and stand with Ami in the fight to protect women&rsquo;s health care.
We have seen what happens when people play politics with women&rsquo;s health care and we can&rsquo;t let that happen again--
sign your name today.
Thanks again for your help,
Team Bera
