Friend ,
Tonight the President will lay out his plan for our country in his State of the Union address.
We all agree there are many important issues that face our country, and I look forward to hearing the President&#39;s vision for the next year and beyond.
As you know, I&#39;m proud of my work as part of the No Labels Problem Solvers. In an effort to address the gridlock and inaction in Washington, we&#39;ve put forth a National Strategic Agenda, which includes goals we believe will find widespread support and move our country forward.
The agenda includes four initial goals: create 25 million jobs over the next 10 years, balance the federal budget by 2030, secure Social Security and Medicare for the next 75 years, and make America energy secure by 2024.
Would you like to weigh in? Click here to share your opinion about which of these four goals is most important to you.
Now more than ever, we need strong leadership to address the challenges facing our country. It is my hope that the ideas introduced in our Strategic Agenda are addressed in the State of the Union, as a first step towards progress.
I remain optimistic about what we can accomplish this year and look forward to keeping you updated.
Be well,
Ami
