Friend,
I want to share a few updates about my work in Washington this week and
invite you to help me welcome the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Bob
Sherman to Rhode Island this Saturday, March 29 at 3 p.m.at the
Brightridge Club on Brightridge Avenue in East Providence. Rhode
Island's Portuguese community has made many wonderful contributions to
our state and I look forward to working with Ambassador Sherman to
strengthen the deep ties that bind our two nations.
I hope you will be
able to join us.

Closing the Skills Gap
This week I recognized Building Futures, a providence-based work
training program that prepares Rhode Islanders for careers in the
construction industry, on the House Floor for their work to help place
hardworking Rhode Islanders in good paying jobs.
Building Futures'
success is due in large part to its dedicated and talented staff led by
Director and Founder Andrew Cortes.
In fact, they have made a real
difference in the lives of 145 Rhode Islanders by placing them in
registered apprenticeships as bricklayers, carpenters, electricians,
plumbers, and other construction trade apprenticeships.
Watch my full
remarks here

Supporting Social Enterprise
This week I organized a social enterprise forum in Washington, D.C. to
bring private, non-profit, and government leaders together to discuss
this fast-growing sector of our economy.
I also invited two Rhode
Islanders - Kelly Ramirez, CEO of Social Enterprise Greenhouse, and
Amelia Friedman, a Brown University student and Executive Director of
the Student Language Exchange - who helped brief policymakers during
this forum.
Social enterprises serve as economic engines that create
jobs, revitalize our neighborhoods, and rebuild our communities.
In
Rhode Island there are more than 140 social ventures, 41 percent of
which serve populations with barriers to employment. And, in the last 5
years, these ventures have generated more than 700 jobs.
Working to Fix Our Broken Immigration System
Congress must act to fix our broken immigration system.
That's why I
stood with my House Democratic colleagues demanding a vote on H.R. 15 -
a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill that honors our
nation's values and our history. We began a discharge petition, a
procedure that if successful, would bring the bill to the floor for a
vote.
This legislation will secure our borders, protect workers, unite
families by stopping deportations, and offer hardworking immigrants an
earned pathway to citizenship.
And, according to the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office, this much-needed bill will reduce the
deficit by $900 billion - $900 billion - over the next two decades.
Supporting the Sovereignty of Ukraine
I continue to monitor the ongoing situation in Ukraine and this week
worked with my colleagues to pass legislation that will impose
sanctions on Russia and support the people of Ukraine.
This package,
which the President is expected to sign into law soon, sends a strong
message that the United States, along with our allies, is committed to
imposing penalties on Russia for this gross violation of international
law.
As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I was pleased
this legislation included language that I offered to protect the human
rights of all Ukrainians.
I will continue to work to find a resolution
to this crisis that protects America's national security interests.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
