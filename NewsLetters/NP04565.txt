Dear Friends,
Every November, we commemorate Veterans Day
and celebrate the men and women who have selflessly answered the call to
protect our freedom and liberty by serving in the armed forces.
Throughout our nations history, these heroes have volunteered to
protect our values and ideals.
During my time in
Congress, I have worked tirelessly to advance the interests of our courageous
men and women in uniform.
Recently, I co-sponsored
the
Veteran Access to Care Act , which would ensure that every
veteran has access to the best medical care available. This bill would allow
veterans whose healthcare needs are not being met in a timely manner
to seek care outside of the VA hospital system.
I also
co-sponsored the
Protecting the Freedoms and Benefits for All Veterans
Act , which would ensure that all surviving military spouses
receive the benefits that their loved ones earned.
We live
in a great nation; a shining city on a hill that has been forged by
the sacrifices of brave men and women who have put themselves in the
path of danger to protect our democracy and freedom.
Every
Veterans Day we honor the sacrifices of all our veterans and those
currently serving in all branches of our armed forces. Our country will
continue to keep those who have served, past and present, close to our
hearts every day.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
