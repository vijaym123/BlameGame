Dear Friends,
Today is National Manufacturing Day! In recognition of the occasion, this morning
I visited the Erie Institute of Technology
(EIT) for a fascinating event
that brought together multiple regional employers, local high school juniors and seniors, along with many EIT students and staff. The day featured numerous presentations and product displays by local manufacturers and was designed to showcase a variety of manufacturing careers in our region.
Click here to watch a local news segment by WJET TV about the event .
American manufacturers -- including those we're so fortunate to have here in Western Pennsylvania -- provide millions of good-paying jobs to hardworking men and women and constantly make our nation's economy stronger. Today we celebrate and thank them all for their tremendous contributions to our great nation!
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Reiterates Open Invitation to
President Obama
to Visit Western PA Coal Mine
White House rejects Rep. Kelly's initial offer to tour coal mine, meet Americans most threatened by EPA's war on coal
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Wednesday regarding his
open invitation to President Obama
to visit a coal mine in Western Pennsylvania, which the White House has now officially declined. The visit would have been personally arranged by Rep. Kelly and was meant to give the president an opportunity to meet the workers whose jobs are most directly threatened by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new
Clean Power Plan
proposal. In response to
the plan's announcement , Rep. Kelly and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced
the
Coal Country Protection Act
in the House and Senate respectively. Rep. Kelly's original invitation to the president can be viewed
here .
"My invitation to President Obama will remain on the table until he reconsiders his decision and chooses to see firsthand where ' the workhorse of the US power system ' comes from-and how it's directly threatened by his policies. More importantly, I believe the president should have an opportunity to meet and speak with the hardworking men and women whose livelihoods are most in jeopardy under his administration's ideological crusade against coal. From providing thousands of jobs to keeping energy bills low to
keeping American manufacturing competitive , the benefits of this abundant energy source are far too important to my constituents and to our country to let be taken away by out-of-touch operators inside the Washington bubble."
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT:
On Monday, August 4, 2014,
The Wall Street Journal
published a guest op-ed written by Rep. Kelly on the economic danger of the EPA's anti-coal regulations proposed under President Obama titled, "
Pushing Back Against Obama's War on Coal ."
