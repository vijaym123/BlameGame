Dear Friend,
One of the most rewarding parts of being your Representative is helping you cut through the red tape you may encounter when working with federal agencies.
While my district office is centrally located, Indianapolis is large and I realize it can be difficult at times to visit.
That is why I am committed to ensuring the resources my office offers are more accessible by bringing these services closer to you.
It is important to hear from my constituents so I can do my job well.
I hope you will take this opportunity to reach out to my office to share your thoughts and concerns on the issues that matter most to you and your family.
Most importantly, if you are in need of assistance, my staff and I stand ready to help.
We are able to assist you with a range of issues dealing with any federal agency, including the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security, Medicare, Immigration, and others.
I remain devoted to serving each and every constituent of the 7 th
Congressional District and ensuring the services my office provides are available.
I hope you will stop by and visit my staff in your neighborhood soon.
Details are listed below!
As always, it is an honor to serve you.

Help with the IRS
Recently, my office received a call from Jeff, who needed help receiving his 2012 tax return from the IRS.
After working diligently with the agency and providing all of the requested documents multiple times, the IRS continued to hold his refund and was unable to provide a timeline for the release.
My staff quickly got in touch with the Taxpayer Advocate Service to ensure Jeff would be issued a check promptly.
After just a couple of weeks, Jeff received his full refund plus interest owed to him by the IRS for the delay.
