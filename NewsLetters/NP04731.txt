Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
At the Rotary Club of College Park on Thursday morning, I was privileged to thank the members for their service both in Orlando and as a part of Rotary International. As with the other community service organizations in my district, it was a pleasure to offer myself as a partner to help make their efforts successful. One of the participants at the rotary meeting, Michael Freeman, wrote about the visit in an article for the Orlando Sentinel. You can read it here
Webster: Congress can learn a lot from the College Park Rotary.

This week, I was honored to participate in the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Lake Technical College Center for Advanced for Manufacturing in Eustis. The economic impact of manufacturing education, manufacturing careers and manufacturing-led research will benefit our community by providing business and technical expertise, innovation, workforce training and industry networking. I am excited for the job preparation and economic growth that this training will bring to Lake County as we compete in the twenty-first century global
economy.
Some of the other visits I made in North Lake County this week included:
-	Hillcrest Insurance Agency
-	Powerhouse Recovery Center
-	United Southern Bank
-	Mount Dora Noon Kiwanis
-	Holden &amp; Darby, PA

During my time in Polk County, I was happy to deliver a flag to Daniel Penzien for the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter #1040. Flown over the Capitol on Memorial Day, it was an honor to donate this American flag for their upcoming Operation Christmas auction as a small token of my appreciation for their incredible sacrifice and service for our country.
I was privileged to participate in other Polk County events this week,
including:
-	Cancer Unity Ribbon Event (CURE) in Winter Haven
-	First United Methodist Church of Lake Alfred's Pumpkin Festival
-	Auburndale Rotary
-	Mount Olive Neighborhood Coffee and Pickleball
-	Dedication Ceremony for the Polk City 3:4 Project

On Wednesday, the South Lake Chamber held their annual trustee luncheon to discuss public policy goals and legislative initiatives for the upcoming year. It was good to hear firsthand what their priorities are for economic development, education, sport and tourism, and technology. I provided an update on federal transportation issues, and look forward to continuing to work with them to accomplish their new goals that will enhance our South Lake community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office regarding her Medicare card. At the beginning of this year, the constituent had received her Medicare insurance card, but realized that it listed her husbands social security number, rather than her own. She completed the required documentation for withdrawal and applied for Medicare benefits under her social security number, but was still waiting months for her card.
In frustration, the constituent contacted my office, and we reached out to the Social Security Administration. After following up with them and monitoring her case, a new Medicare card was issued with the correct social security number. The constituent expressed her appreciation for the help that my office was able to provide.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
On Friday, I was invited to speak to the Robotic Assisted Microsurgical &amp; Endoscopic Society (RAMSES) Surgical Conference in Montverde to discuss medical tourism. International medical tourism involves people who live in one country, but travel to another country to receive medical, dental and surgical care of equal or greater quality than they would receive in their own country. Domestic medical tourism includes individuals who travel internally to another city, region or state to receive equal or greater care from that region.
Medical tourism generally provides higher quality and more affordable health care options. In 2012, an estimated 800,000 international patients travelled to the U.S. for medical care, and the U.S. ranks third internationally in medical tourism.
Within Central Florida, the Orlando Regional Medical Center receives more than 6,000 international patients each year, and the PUR Clinic at South Lake Hospital, which I recently toured, treats an average of 5 to 6 international patients each week. Central Florida has defined itself as a world-class tourism destination, and patients with family or friends traveling with the patient have many options for activities before, during or after the medical care is received.
Central Florida is also a medical innovation hub, with everything from Lake Nonas Medical City; to UCFs College of Medicine, co-located with UFs Research and Academic Center and Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute; to the Orlando Veterans Affairs Medical Center, with its VHA SimLEARN National Simulation Center, which will provide cutting edge medical simulation training in an immersive environment.
Two bills that I cosponsored will also aid in supporting medical tourism to our Central Florida region.
The Travel Promotion Act,
which reauthorized Brand USA, allows up to $100 million from federal fees assessed on foreign travelers to be coupled with matching donations from the tourism industry to be spent on overseas advertisements for travel to the U.S. The
JOLT Act
also streamlines and permits technological advances to be used to process more tourist visas from countries with large potential for tourism growth such as China and Brazil. Both of these federal policies will enhance the opportunity and impact of medical tourism on Central Florida.
Whether traveling to Central Florida to see Mickey Mouse or a medical specialist, visitors inject billions of dollars into our economy and support countless jobs across our community.
