Dear
Friends,
No one who works full time should live in poverty.
All
Americans deserve to earn a decent days pay for a hard days work.
In order to accomplish this, it is time to raise the federal minimum
wage.
This week, I led the effort to bring the Fair
Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010) to the House floor for a vote by filing a
discharge petition.
Once we get 218 signatures on this petition, we
will be able to bypass the committee that has been holding up a vote on
this legislation and bring it to the floor for an up or down
vote.
The Fair Minimum Wage Act would increase the federal
minimum wage to $10.10 over three years and thereafter index the minimum
wage to inflation.
According to the Economic Policy Institute this
increase will mean a pay raise for at least 25 million Americans and
would generate at total of $35 billion for working
families.
I would like to know your thoughts on raising the minimum
wage.
Please take a moment to answer the survey in this email
message.
