DISTRICT
October

Dear
Friend,
An entrepreneurial spirit and a diverse sense of
creativity have always permeated the Third District. Combined, these two
well-known and long-standing characteristics of our region have resulted in
some extraordinary and innovative business ventures. I have made it a
priority of my time in Congress to meet with as many local businesses
as possible to discuss the issues important to them and ways my office
can assist in local job growth and economic development. Recently, I
held a week long
Creative Economies Tour , that
focused on creative businesses in Haverhill, Clinton, Lowell and
Fitchburg. I have also visited numerous local companies, such as Cedars
Mediterranean Foods in Haverhill; Straumann USA in Andover, a maker of
dental devices; and
Quest Diagnostics in
Marlborough . And just this week I spoke at the Merrimack Valley Chamber of
Commerce
Women in Business Conference , and I met with
a series of Cambodian-owned businesses in Lowell during my Small
Business Walking Tour. Below, you can read more about my initiatives to
help boost local business.
In this edition of the
e-Newsletter, youll also find photos and information about
Col.
Michael Lynch from Dunstable , to whom I recently presented the
prestigious Legion of Merit Award that he had earned. There are also
links to my recent interview with Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on
WGBHs Boston Public Radio
where we discussed the current
situation in Iraq and Syria, domestic manufacturing and my work to
combat sexual assault in the military.
As always, I look
forward to your feedback at my
website , or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thanks for staying engaged and enjoy
this week's edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
