Dear Friend,
We owe our military the very best care our nation can provide. I am
working every day to provide meaningful support to those that have
sacrificed so much for our country.
Like many of you, I was deeply concerned that the recent budget cuts
benefits for some military retirees. While we must be fiscally
responsible, we also have to live up to the promises we made to our
veterans.
I voted to repeal the cut to the benefits for veterans and
current service members.
How can we best serve our veterans?
Help veterans find jobs
End the VA's benefits backlog
Assist homeless veterans in finding housing
All of the above
Other
Open survey in new window
We owe our troops more than "thank you for your service;" we owe them
real action.
If you or someone you know is struggling with a pending VA claim, my
office is here to help
. My office can assist East Bay
veterans with health and pension discrepancies, locating military
records, securing replacement medals, and burial ceremonies. Please do
not hesitate to contact one of our East Bay Offices at 510-370-3322 or
925-460-5100.
Thank you to all of our brave veterans in the East Bay and across the
country. Your service and sacrifice will always be remembered by a
grateful nation.
For more information on events and what I am doing to help East Bay
veterans, follow me on Twitter
and like me
