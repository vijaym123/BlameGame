Dear Friends,
President Obama's
Environmental Protection Agency released a proposed carbon emissions
rule this week that threatens our states way of life and would
irreparably damage our states economy.
Coal powers West Virginias
economy and provides paychecks to tens of thousands of West Virginia
families, and this rule would reduce demand for West Virginia coal
while driving up electricity prices.
We need policies that
allow coal to be part of a national all-of-the-above energy strategy to
produce secure, affordable, abundant domestic energy. Instead, the
president is circumventing Congress to impose a national energy tax on
Americans to further his environmental agenda, and the working families
of West Virginia will bear the burden of fewer jobs and higher energy
prices.
I will do everything in my power to fight back
against this rule and protect West Virginia's families, economy and
jobs.
VA WAITING LIST
A recent Pittsburgh Tribune-Review report
alleged that
the Pittsburgh Veterans Affairs Healthcare System has a waiting list of
700 veterans, many of whom have been waiting for more than a
year.
Veterans from West Virginia seek care from the Pittsburgh VA
either through referrals or geographic boundaries, and so I'm asking
whether any veterans from our state on are on a waiting list for care at
the Pittsburgh VA.
In a letter to Pittsburgh VA Director
and Chief Executive Officer Terry Gerigk Wolk, I asked for details on
how many West Virginians use the Pittsburgh VA, how many West
Virginians are waiting for care, and details on how the facility works with
rural veterans to accommodate their unique needs in scheduling
appointments.
Our veterans have defended this nation, and they
deserve the best care and benefits for the injuries they have sustained in
that service. As public servants, it is essential that we do our very
best to ensure that these brave men and women receive the care they
have earned, expect and deserve, I wrote.
A PDF of the letter is available here.
WEST VIRGINIA EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL
On Monday, I spoke to emergency management
officials and first responders at the West Virginia Emergency Management
Council conference in Huntington (pictured here with Roger Bryant,
director of the Logan County Office of Emergency
Management).
Thank you for reading my

on
Facebook
and

Sincerely,
