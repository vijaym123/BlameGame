On May 31, the Obama Administration announced that Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban since 2009, had been freed, in exchange for the release of
five senior Taliban commanders
from the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The Taliban detainees, all deemed
high risk
in a 2008 Pentagon report, are now under the supervision of the government of Qatar and are subject to a one-year travel ban.
Current law requires notification to Congress at least 30 days before the transfer or release of a Guantanamo detainee, and the Secretary of Defense must also certify that actions taken will substantially mitigate the risk of the individual re-engaging in any terrorist activity that threatens the United States.
Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel
stated
that the U.S. acted quickly
without prior notification to Congress
because Sgt. Bergdahls safety and health were in jeopardy.
