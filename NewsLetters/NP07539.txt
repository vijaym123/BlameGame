The White House just announced that they believe John Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit could lead to the
impeachment of President Barack Obama.
We are now on full
RED ALERT
at Democratic Headquarters. We are scrambling to defend the President in every way we can at this critical moment.

According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to fight back since the vote. We still need 3,185 more Democrats to chip in before midnight.
