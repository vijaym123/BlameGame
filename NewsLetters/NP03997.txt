Colorado Congressional Delegation Sends Letter Urging VA,
KT to Negotiate a Path Forward for VA
Hospital
12/11/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined his colleagues in the
Colorado Delegation in sending a joint letter to the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), Kiewit Corporation, and Turner Construction,
urging immediate negotiations to determine a path forward to continue
construction of the VA hospital in Aurora. The letter, co-signed by the
entire Congressional delegation, laid out the need for a short and
long-term solution and the importance of the construction project for
the veterans of the Rocky Mountain region and the State of
Colorado.
"The veterans of the Rocky Mountain West have waited more than a
decade for this hospital, and 1,400 construction workers are being sent
home right before the holidays with their jobs in jeopardy as this
project sits idle," the delegation wrote. "Given the size, scope, and
importance of this construction project to our veterans and the State of
Colorado, we urge in the strongest terms possible, for immediate
negotiations between the VA and KT resulting in a new contract modification
to allow continued construction for 60
days."
The letter is in
response to a Civilian Board of Contract Appeals ruling that
determined the VA was in material breach of the contract. Kiewit Turner has
since responded to this ruling by stopping all work on the project. The
letter urges both parties to consider the long-term consequences of
any action and for immediate negotiations to result in a new contract
modification negotiated by the Army Corps of
Engineers.
