Dear
Friend,
Last week I joined my Republican colleague Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio for a
series of home and home visits, where we went to each others
districts in a showing of across-the-aisle partnership. We held a series of
meetings and demonstrations dealing with important issues facing our
military and economic development in both our home states, spending
time in Massachusetts at New Balance in Lawrence, UMass Lowell, Hanscom
Air Force Base and more. Below youll find video and news stories
about this great showing of how Republicans and Democrats in Congress
CAN
work together to get things done. Also in this
edition, youll find my interview on
WGBH's Greater
Boston
and video of my interview with Andover TVs
Boomer Being show , as well as information about
Make it in America and student loans . As always, I look forward
to your feedback at my website, or on Facebook and
Twitter.
Thanks for staying engaged and enjoy this week's edition of
Congress in your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
