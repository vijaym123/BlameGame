David, I&rsquo;ve got some bad news:
As you read this, Republicans are in the midst of a multi-million dollar ad blitz.
If we&rsquo;re not prepared, Democrats like Cheri Bustos could be left hanging. But don&rsquo;t worry -- I&rsquo;ve also got some good news:
There&rsquo;s still time to close the gap. The election is exactly 8 days away. If you step up right now, Cheri can fend off the attacks, get out the facts to Illinois voters, and win. The choice is yours, David.
Can I count you in?
