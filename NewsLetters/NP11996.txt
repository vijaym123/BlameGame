Dear Friends,
It's hard to believe we are already two months into 2014. The New Year
is proving to be a busy time in Congress, as we work to stop government
abuse and pass legislation to reduce government regulations and spur
economic growth.
Congressman Collins spoke in support of the Beginning Farmer and
Rancher Opportunity Act at Post Dairy Farms in Oakfield, NY.
One of the first major acts of Congress this year was to pass a
five-year comprehensive Farm Bill.
As a member of House Agriculture
Committee representing a heavily agricultural district, I was proud to
work on this legislation and support its passage. Like any bipartisan
compromise, the Farm Bill is not perfect, but it does include real
reforms and spending reductions, while removing regulatory barriers for
farmers and strengthening American's safety net. This bill not only
saves $23 billion in mandatory federal spending, but also provides our
farmers and producers with the certainty they deserve. The bill saves
taxpayers billions of dollars, includes historic reform for our dairy
policy by repealing outdated programs, and strengthens crop insurance
and other protection programs our famers need. And despite the
rhetoric, the Farm Bill does not take away Food Stamps from those who
are truly eligibly. Instead, it protects Food Stamp funding by closing
loopholes to stop ongoing fraud and abuse. The Farm Bill addresses many
of the critical issues facing our famers in NY-27 and across the
country.
Congressman Collins introduced the Kids Before Cons Act in February.
I have also introduced legislation to help protect your tax dollars
from Governor Cuomo's recently announced plan to fund college
educations for convicted criminals. I believe this plan is an insult to
the law-abiding citizens all across our state that are struggling to
pay for higher education or find employment in this stagnant economy.
This is why I introduced the Kids Before Cons Act. This legislation
will prohibit states from using federal taxpayer dollars to fund
college educations for convicted criminals. With 60 percent of New York
college graduates carrying student debt, we must put our college kids
before cons. I have heard a lot of opposition to the Governor's plan
from constituents across NY-27, and I will continue to do what I can to
fight it.
This month, I was also humbled to introduce legislation to rename the
U.S. Post Office on Broadway in the Town of Alden the "Sergeant Brett
E. Gornewicz Memorial Post Office." An Alden native, Army Sergeant
Brett Gornewicz died while serving in Afghanistan in November of 2012.
Renaming a post office in honor of Sergeant Gornewicz is only a small
step in recognizing his bravery and service to his country. It is my
hope that this post office will allow the people of Alden, and those
throughout NY- 27, to continue to honor the memory of Sergeant
Gornewicz, and ensure that his legacy of service and sacrifice lives
on. I am grateful that Senator Gillibrand has introduced companion
legislation in the Senate.
Congressman Collins and Neal McCluskey, Associate Director of the Cato
Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, at the Common Core
Telephone Town Hall.
There are few issues as important to the future of our country as the
education of our children. Unfortunately, in today's world, too many of
the decisions surrounding our children's education are being made by
government bureaucrats far removed from the classroom. That's why I
recently took the opportunity to hold a district-wide Telephone Town
Hall about Common Core. During the Telephone Town Hall, parents voiced
concerns about Common Core's student testing standards, mandated
curriculum, and teacher/school evaluations tied to test results. Common
Core is a typical one-size-fits-all approach generated by big
government bureaucrats. I believe strongly that parents, teachers and
local school leaders know what is best for our children.
I urge
parents and educators to continue to raise awareness of Common Core and
push NYS leaders for changes to its implementation, if not full repeal.
This past month also brought the 5th anniversary of the crash of Flight
3407 in Clarence Center. I spoke on the floor of the House of
Representatives in honor of the 50 men and women, and the one unborn
child, who died that tragic night. Being on the scene following the
crash, and witnessing the grief of the victims' family members the next
day, will stay with me forever. Flight 3407 families had their loved
ones ripped away in such a horrible and preventable way. But with grace
and courage, these families turned their loss into a crusade to make
the skies safer for all our families. Against very steep obstacles,
Flight 3407 families prevailed and forced Congress to pass legislation
requiring airlines to put well-trained pilots in every cockpit.

to honor Flight 3407 victims and families.
As always, thank you to everyone who continues to contact my office.
Your questions, input and feedback allow me to better represent you in
Washington.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS

Dear
Friends,
It&#8217;s
hard
to
believe
we
are
already
two
months
into
2014.
The
New
Year
is
proving
to
be
a
busy
time
in
Congress,
as
we
work
to
stop
government
abuse
and
pass
legislation
to
reduce
government
regulations
and
spur
economic
growth.
Congressman
Collins
spoke
in
support
of
the
Beginning
Farmer
and
Rancher
Opportunity
Act
at
Post
Dairy
Farms
in
Oakfield,
NY. One
of
the
first
major
acts
of
Congress
this
year
was
to
pass
a
five-year
comprehensive
Farm
Bill.
As
a
member
of
House
Agriculture
Committee
representing
a
heavily
agricultural
district,
I
was
proud
to
work
on
this
legislation
and
support
its
passage.
Like
any
bipartisan
compromise,
the
Farm
Bill
is
not
perfect,
but
it
does
include
real
reforms
and
spending
reductions,
while
removing
regulatory
barriers
for
farmers
and
strengthening
American&#8217;s
safety
net.
This
bill
not
only
saves
$23
billion
in
mandatory
federal
spending,
but
also
provides
our
farmers
and
producers
with
the
certainty
they
deserve.
The
bill
saves
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars,
includes
historic
reform
for
our
dairy
policy
by
repealing
outdated
programs,
and
strengthens
crop
insurance
and
other
protection
programs
our
famers
need.
And
despite
the
rhetoric,
the
Farm
Bill
does
not
take
away
Food
Stamps
from
those
who
are
truly
eligibly.
Instead,
it
protects
Food
Stamp
funding
by
closing
loopholes
to
stop
ongoing
fraud
and
abuse.
The
Farm
Bill
addresses
many
of
the
critical
issues
facing
our
famers
in
NY-27
and
across
the
country.
Congressman
Collins introduced
the
Kids
Before
Cons
Act
in
February.
I
have
also
introduced
legislation
to
help
protect
your
tax
dollars
from
Governor
Cuomo&#8217;s
recently
announced
plan
to
fund
college
educations
for
convicted
criminals.
I
believe
this
plan
is
an
insult
to
the
law-abiding
citizens
all
across
our
state
that
are
struggling
to
pay
for
higher
education
or
find
employment
in
this
stagnant
economy.
This
is
why
I
introduced
the
Kids
Before
Cons
Act.
This
legislation
will
prohibit
states
from
using
federal
taxpayer
dollars
to
fund
college
educations
for
convicted
criminals.
With
60
percent
of
New
York
college
graduates
carrying
student
debt,
we
must
put
our
college
kids
before
cons.
I
have
heard
a
lot
of
opposition
to
the
Governor&#8217;s
plan
from
constituents
across
NY-27,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
what
I
can
to
fight
it.
This
month,
I
was
also
humbled
to
introduce
legislation
to
rename
the
U.S.
Post
Office
on
Broadway
in
the
Town
of
Alden
the
&#8220;Sergeant
Brett
E.
Gornewicz
Memorial
Post
Office.&#8221;
An
Alden
native,
Army
Sergeant
Brett
Gornewicz
died
while
serving
in
Afghanistan
in
November
of
2012.
Renaming
a
post
office
in
honor
of
Sergeant
Gornewicz
is
only
a
small
step
in
recognizing
his
bravery
and
service
to
his
country.
It
is
my
hope
that
this
post
office
will
allow
the
people
of
Alden,
and
those
throughout
NY-
27,
to
continue
to
honor
the
memory
of
Sergeant
Gornewicz,
and
ensure
that
his
legacy
of
service
and
sacrifice
lives
on.
I
am
grateful
that
Senator
Gillibrand
has
introduced
companion
legislation
in
the
Senate.
Congressman
Collins
and
Neal
McCluskey,
Associate
Director
of
the
Cato
Institute's
Center
for
Educational
Freedom,
at
the
Common
Core Telephone
Town
Hall. There
are
few
issues
as
important
to
the
future
of
our
country
as
the
education
of
our
children.
Unfortunately,
in
today&#8217;s
world,
too
many
of
the
decisions
surrounding
our
children&#8217;s
education
are
being
made
by
government
bureaucrats
far
removed
from
the
classroom.
That&#8217;s
why
I
recently
took
the
opportunity
to
hold
a
district-wide
Telephone
Town
Hall
about
Common
Core.
During
the
Telephone
Town
Hall,
parents
voiced
concerns
about
Common
Core&#8217;s
student
testing
standards,
mandated
curriculum,
and
teacher/school
evaluations
tied
to
test
results.
Common
Core
is
a
typical
one-size-fits-all
approach
generated
by
big
government
bureaucrats.
I
believe
strongly
that
parents,
teachers
and
local
school
leaders
know
what
is
best
for
our
children.
I
urge
parents
and
educators
to
continue
to
raise
awareness
of
Common
Core
and
push
NYS
leaders
for
changes
to
its
implementation,
if
not
full
repeal.
This
past
month
also
brought
the
5th
anniversary
of
the
crash
of
Flight
3407
in
Clarence
Center.
I
spoke
on
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Representatives
in
honor
of
the
50
men
and
women,
and
the
one
unborn
child,
who
died
that
tragic
night.
Being
on
the
scene
following
the
crash,
and
witnessing
the
grief
of
the
victims&#8217;
family
members
the
next
day,
will
stay
with
me
forever.
Flight
3407
families
had
their
loved
ones
ripped
away
in
such
a
horrible
and
preventable
way.
But
with
grace
and
courage,
these
families
turned
their
loss
into
a
crusade
to
make
the

all
our
families.
Against
very
steep

Flight
3407

prevailed
and
forced
Congress
