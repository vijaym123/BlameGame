(February 28, 2014 - Laconia, NH - U.S. Senator
Jeanne Shaheen at Lakes Region Community
College)
Dear Friend,
This week my colleague Senator
Rob Portman and I renewed our push to advance a national energy
strategy in the Senate. Along with ten bipartisan cosponsors, we reintroduced
the
Shaheen-Portman Energy Savings and Industrial
Competitiveness Act (ESIC)
a bill that will create jobs, save
people billions, and reduce pollution by making our country more energy
efficient. Im very excited about the bipartisan support our bill has
received; both Democrats and Republicans as well as environmental
groups and industry leaders have rallied behind Shaheen-Portman because
its great for our economy and our environment.
Earlier today
I was in Laconia where I saw first-hand what is possible when you
invest in energy efficiency. Lakes Region Community College (LRCC) is
doing great work preparing young people in New Hampshire for jobs that
will be an important part of an energy-efficient economy in the future.
And the Energy Services and Technology Program at LRCC is a perfect
example of the type of program we should promote across the
country.
When Shaheen-Portman came before the Senate last year, it was
the first major piece of energy legislation to be considered since
2007. Unfortunately, the measure failed to advance because of debate on
unrelated amendments. But we didnt give up. Our reintroduced bill
includes 10 bipartisan amendments and with those amendments, weve secured
the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Now were hoping to get
this back to the floor for a vote.
A recent study by
the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has estimated
that Shaheen-Portman would create more than 190,000 jobs, save consumers
$16.2 billion a year, and cut CO2 emissions and other air pollutants
by the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road
all by
2030.
Taken together, all of this means one thing: the
time to act on our bill is now. This bill is great for our economy, great
for our environment, and great for taxpayers, so I hope I can work
with my colleagues to pass it as quickly as
possible.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
