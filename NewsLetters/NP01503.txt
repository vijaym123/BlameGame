Congress and the Iran
Deal President Obamas deal to stop Iran from gaining
nuclear weapons might not come through Congress for approval. Considering the scope and
importance of this deal, do you think Congress should weigh in on it?
YES, Congress should play
a part. NO, the
President has the power to make deals like this by himself. *By answering
