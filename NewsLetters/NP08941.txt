WEEK IN REVIEW
Last week,
Representative Justin Amash (MI-3) and I cast our 2,500th vote in the
House of Representatives, giving us both the longest continuous
voting streak among our current House colleagues.
I recognize that
representing Third District Arkansans in the U.S. House of
Representatives is an honor and privilege, and I take seriously the responsibility
of making sure your voice is heard on every single vote we take.
I am grateful that nothing has prevented me from doing so.
Make
sure to watch
KNWAs story
or read
the National Journal piece
on
it!
I spent Monday and Tuesday of this week in Port Canaveral,
Florida, at the Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU), which was established
in 1950 and serves the country by supporting and testing sea-based
weapons systems.
Learn more about the NOTU
here .
While in Port Canaveral, I toured the United Launch Alliance
(ULA).

On Thursday, I
rode along with UPS driver, Steve Ledlow, and even through the rain, I
had a great time!
Thanks for showing me the latest technology
on the UPS trucks and letting me deliver packages to several local
Rogers businesses.
Today, I joined
Senators Pryor and Boozman, as well as Congressmen Griffin (AR-2), to
announce over $3.1 million in grant funding from the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) for facility upgrades and expansions at four
Arkansas airports - Springdale Municipal Airport, Clinton Municipal
Airport, Bill and Hillary Clinton National/Adams Field Airport, and
Texarkana Regional-Webb Field Airport.
Continued investment in
Springdale Municipal Airport and our airports throughout the state means the
continued growth of these cities and their contributions to Arkansass
economy.
We are grateful for this grant
funding.
Last, but certainly not least, today
is the 70th anniversary of D-Day, the beginning of the end of World
War II in Europe.
On this day in 1944, 160,00 of our brave
soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, to fight Nazi Germany,
and every day since
and especially today
we are grateful for
and will never forget the bravery of our D-Day
veterans.
From the
Front...
