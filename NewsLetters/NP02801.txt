HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

H.R. 851 aims to increase federal funding for PSS - This week I introduced legislation that would increase federal education funding for our Public School System by over $7 million each year. I have waited since i got to Congress six years ago for the opportunity to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It has not been reauthorized since 2001, but this week reauthorization began. My bill, H.R. 851 , removes the Commonwealth and other U.S. insular areas from a fixed percentage of education funds that the Secretary of Education now divides between the Bureau of Indian Education and island schools. H.R. 851 does away with that Secretarial discretion and uses the same funding formula for the insular areas that applies to the 50 states, although at a reduced rate in recognition of the relatively smaller populations of the islands. The Congressional Research Service estimates that, if enacted, my bill would increase federal funding for PSS from this year's $7 million to $14 million.

The Committee on Education and the Workforce held a markup this week on H.R. 5, the Republican majority's bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I offered an amendment to make the Investing in Innovation competitive grant a permanent part of the law-and make the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands eligible to compete , along with a letter from 117 organizations nationwide in support of my proposal . But, like all amendments offered by Committee Democrats, mine was voted down by the GOP majority.
USDA hosting rural energy training webinars - The U.S. Department of Agriculture is hosting a series of webinars on applying for financial assistance through the Rural Energy for America Program . In 2014 REAP awarded $500,000 as part of the financing package for the Marianas Business Plaza solar power system. The first of three webinars focuses on energy efficiency improvements and is scheduled for February 19 at 5 a.m. ChST. Participants in the Northern Mariana Islands may dial in toll-free to 888-669-0676 or join online at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/789/7246. On March 12 the REAP webinar looks at renewable energy systems and begins at 4 a.m. The toll-free number is 888-669-0685; on the web: https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/789/7311. A third webinar highlights project financing. That's on April 3 at 4 a.m. Call 888-669-0676 or go to https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/789/7312. REAP provides guaranteed loan financing and grant funding to agricultural producers and rural small businesses to purchase or install renewable energy systems or make energy efficiency improvements. This support helps farmers, ranchers, and small business owners save money on their energy bills and cut carbon pollution.

Ray, Cindy, Al and Emet Saures visited their congressional office this week. Cindy, Al and their son Ray, who live in Arizona, were in this area for a family event and stopped by to say hello and take a tour of the U.S. Capitol. Emet, Al's brother, is a longtime resident of Virginia. Thank you all for visiting and come back soon!
Preventing diabetes before it begins - Work to broaden screening guidelines for diabetes, which could help prevent this disease in some people, continues to move forward. Along with a number of my colleagues in Congress from both sides of the aisle, I wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in September recommending that the guidelines, now under review, include more risk factors. Currently, the guidelines only require screening for hypertension, but abnormal blood glucose, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other factors have been recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Recently, Secretary Sylvia Burwell sent me an update on the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the panel of experts looking at the guidelines. The Secretary reports that "the Task Force has proposed greatly expanding screening when compared to its prior recommendation," what we asked for. You can read the Secretary's response and see the draft recommendations from the Task Force here .
Erratum - In last week's e-kilili newsletter we reported that the CNMI Public School System serves 432 students at Head Start centers on Tinian, Rota, and Saipan. A sharp-eyed reader caught our mistake. The correct number of Head Start pupils is 462.
