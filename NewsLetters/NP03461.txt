Dear Friend,
As we begin the
114 th
Congress, House Republicans are proving we are ready to get to
work and ensure Americas key priorities are addressed.
This
past week, the House took action to address two major hurdles stifling
job growth.
During this first week of the new Congress, we
passed Keystone XL pipeline legislation
that protects
Americas national security, lowers gasoline prices, and creates
high-paying American jobs for American workers.
In addition, the House
passed the Save the American Workers Act and the Hire More Heroes
Act, two bills focused on especially egregious portions of the
Presidents healthcare law.
While I remain committed to repealing
ObamaCare in full, Im pleased the House is making it a priority to address
this flawed law.
The difference between 2014 and 2015 is a
November election wherein the American people voted out Senate gridlock
and voted in bipartisan cooperation, economic growth, and better jobs
for struggling American families.
I pray President Obama will
heed American voters and join Congress in a bipartisan effort to make
Americas future a better one.
President Obama can do that by
approving the Keystone pipeline.
Tackling Illegal
Immigration
I
continue the fight
against the Presidents unlawful executive amnesty in the 114 th
Congress.
As such, I have
reintroduced a
resolution
which empowers the House of Representatives to initiate
litigation against the Obama Administration on immigration matters,
because the federal courts are best suited to determine if Obama is
exceeding his authority, and, if so, how to reverse it.
The bill is
supported by the American Conservative Union, the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, and the American Center for Law and Justice, and
has already garnered 16 cosponsorships from members of
Congress.
Im also supporting a lawsuit by 25 states challenging the
constitutionality of President Obamas immigration action by signing an
amicus brief filed by the American Center for Law and Justice.
Further, I cosponsored the Separation of Powers Act, which prohibits
funding for any deferred deportation action under Obamas plan and also
stops funding for any new green cards that would be created by the Obama
Administration.
These are three initial steps I have taken to
fight back against the Presidents overreach this
Congress.
For what it is worth, and according to Numbers USA, in the just-finished
113 th
Congress I had the top border security record among
all 435 Congressmen.
The Week Ahead
This week, my
colleagues and I will have the opportunity to pass legislation to rein in
President Obamas immigration executive actions through the
Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act .
Im
very proud that Alabamas own Congressman Robert Aderholt (AL-04) has
taken a lead, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, and
included language in this bill that blocks any funds from being used to
support the Presidents executive amnesty.
Tuesday morning
I will join the Center for Immigration Studies in hosting a briefing
for Congressional offices to discuss upcoming legislative proposals
and the best path forward to combat the Presidents executive
actions.
President Obamas reckless adding of millions of illegal
aliens to the pool of lawful workers both takes American jobs from
already struggling American families and undermines the wages of those
Americans fortunate enough to have jobs.
I disagree with the
presidents go-it-alone attitude and threat to our constitutional
principles.
The only way to address immigration reform is with
incremental steps, with the first critical step being to secure Americas
borders.
Also scheduled for a vote this
week:
H.R. 37 :
Promoting Job Creation and
Reducing Small Business Burdens Act
H.R.
185 :
Regulatory Accountability Act of
2015
As always, please continue to
write,
call, and email
your opinions to my office.
It is an honor
and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
