Congressman Griffiths 2014 Congressional Issues Survey
Thursday, February 6, 2014
My team and I always want to hear from the people of the Ninth District.
We are currently doing our 2014 Congressional Issues Survey, which asks for your views on a number of important issues.
Thank you to those of who have already taken the time to respond and share your views with me.
If you have not yet filled out our annual issues survey, I encourage you to do so.
The survey can be found
here
on my website, or by visiting

With concerns, comments, or to request a physical copy of the 2014 Congressional Issues Survey, you can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.
