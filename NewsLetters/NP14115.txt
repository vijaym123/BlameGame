Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter! Here are some of the
issues I've been working on this week:
The Nuclear Option
Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Obama
invoked the nuclear option this week, changing the rules in order to
make it easier for the president to get his way and to shift attention
away from the Obamacare disaster. This unprecedented power grab is
short sighted, and it carries implications Democrats are going to have
to live with when Republicans retake the Senate.
It is also unfortunate that Senator Reid and Senate Democrats have
developed amnesia in regards to how they acted when Republicans were in
the majority. While they held up nominations for up to a thousand days
under President Bush, Democrats have now decided to invoke the nuclear
option over nominees for a court that doesn't even have the workload to
keep the judges it has busy.
Savannah River Site
This week, I led the South Carolina Congressional delegation in asking
the Obama administration to save taxpayer dollars by supporting nuclear
waste cleanup at Savannah River Site. The administration is currently
on track to receive over $150 million in fines for failing to deal with
this problem - fines that will have to be paid with taxpayer dollars.
Savannah River Site is important to our state and our country. I will
continue to work to ensure the Obama administration understands that.
'On the Record' Tonight
I'll be 'On the Record' with Greta Van Susteren tonight at 7 p.m. on
Fox News. I hope you can tune in!
It's a privilege to serve you and all of South Carolina.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

Dear
Friends,
Thank
you
for
subscribing
to
my
e-newsletter!
Here
are
some
of
the
issues
I&#8217;ve
been
working
on
this
week:
The
Nuclear
Option
Unfortunately,
Senate
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid
and
President
Obama
invoked
the
nuclear
option
this
week,
changing
the
rules
in
order
to
make
it
easier
for
the
president
to
get
his
way
and
to
shift
attention
away
from
the
Obamacare
disaster.
This
unprecedented
power
grab
is
short
sighted,
and
it
carries
implications
Democrats
are
going
to
have
to
live
with
when
Republicans
retake
the
Senate.
It
is
also
unfortunate
that
Senator
Reid
and
Senate
Democrats
have
developed
amnesia
in
regards
to
how
they
acted
when
Republicans
were
in
the
majority.
While
they
held
up
nominations
for
up
to
a
thousand
days
under
President
Bush,
Democrats
have
now
decided
to
invoke
the
nuclear
option
over
nominees
for
a
court
that
doesn&#8217;t
even
have
the
workload
to
keep
the
judges
it
has
busy.
Savannah
River
Site
This
week,
I
led
the
South
Carolina
Congressional
delegation
in
asking
the
Obama
administration
to
save
taxpayer
dollars
by
supporting
nuclear
waste
cleanup
at
Savannah
River
Site.
The
administration
is
currently
on
track
to
receive
over
$150
million
in
fines
for
failing
to
deal
with
this
problem
&#8211;
fines
that
will
have
to
be
paid
with
taxpayer
dollars.
Savannah
River
Site
is
important
to
our
state
and
our
country.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
ensure
the
Obama
administration
understands
that.
&#8216;On
the
Record&#8217;
Tonight
I&#8217;ll
be
&#8216;On
the
Record&#8217;
with
Greta
Van
Susteren
tonight
at
7
p.m.
on
Fox
News.
I
hope
you
can
tune
in!
It&#8217;s
a
privilege
to
serve
you
and
all
of
South
Carolina.
