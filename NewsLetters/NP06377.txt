CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Schneider leads Dold in new Democratic poll of Illinois 10
We&rsquo;re up, but
barely.
The latest poll shows Brad ahead, but just outside the margin of error.
Three different outside groups are spending against Brad.
Boehner&rsquo;s preparing a $1.85 million October ad blitz.
With just 50 days to go, all signs say this race is a dead heat. If we let up, even for a second, reliable Republican Bob Dold could surge into the lead.
David, we set a big online goal this month: $144,000. But right now, we&rsquo;re seriously behind. If you were thinking about chipping in for Brad -- or making another donation -- now&rsquo;s the time to do it.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for stepping up,
Schneider HQ
