Hello,
It was a busy week both at home in our 14th District
as well as in D.C.
Here's a look at some of what I did this
week:
Hearings
If you've read my Weekly Wrap before, you know
that I serve on the Appropriations Committee in the House and, within
that, I serve on three different subcommittees. This was a busy week as
those subcommittees held 9 different hearings, where I had a chance to
grill our agency leaders about their budget
requests.
I questioned the
Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs about what is
being done to make sure our heroes are getting proper care and the
respect they deserve from the
VA
I had the
chance to directly question the Federal Aviation Administration
Administrator about why taxes on the airplane tickets you buy are so
high.
Back
Home
Before I went to D.C. on Monday, I
had a chance to tour a growing business called
Premier Truck Sales . At the end of the week, I went to the
Mentor Area Chamber of Commerce
on Friday morning and had a
productive discussion with the lively group
Meeting some of the workers and getting
a tour of Premier Truck
Sales
Speaking with the Mentor
Chamber
United
Solutions
When I entered Congress two years
ago, I got together with my freshman colleagues to help form the
United Solutions Caucus in Congress, a group of Democrats and Republicans
who are committed to putting their party labels aside so we can work on
the problems facing our nation.
We get
together as often as we can to have a substantive discussion about policy
areas we agree on, in an effort to find more common ground and get
rid of some of the gridlock in D.C. This week, I had a chance to address
the group and give them my thoughts on what we need to do to move our
country forward.

Solutions Caucus

National Agriculture
Day
Thursday was National Agriculture Day, and I had a chance to sit
down in my D.C. office and discuss agriculture with local folks the
Lake County, Geauga County &amp; Ashtabula County chapters of the Ohio
Farm Bureau Federation.
I hope you enjoyed seeing
what I was up to this week.
I work hard every day to
serve and represent you to the best of my ability.
