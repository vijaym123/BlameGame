Dear
David,
Yesterday, our region achieved a major victory when the
United States Army announced that it was creating an open and fair
bidding process to supply our men and women in uniform with
state-of-the-art radios.
In addition to ensuring that our military has
the best equipment, this policy change will also support more than
2,100 jobs at Harris RF, a Rochester-based military radio maker. Harris
Corporation will now be able to compete against the biggest and most
powerful multinational corporations for $1.2 to $1.5 billion worth of
Army radio contracts. As I have always said, I am confident that when
given a level playing field, Rochesters talented workforce will
win.
In addition to supporting local jobs, the open and fair
bidding process will ensure that our military is purchasing the most
advanced and dependable equipment while driving down costs and saving
taxpayers money.
I have been fighting to create this level
playing field for years, and below is a brief timeline of my work on
this issue.
Dec 2011
Rep.
Slaughter secured language in the Defense Authorization bill to withhold funds
unless Army uses open competition.
May
2012
Rep. Slaughter defeated an amendment offered in the Rules
Committee that would have blocked Harris from competing openly for Army
contracts.
March 2013
Rep. Slaughter
spoke with Secretary of the Army John McHugh and asked him to change
the Armys acquisition strategy.
May
2013
Rep. Slaughter sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of the Army
for Acquisitions Heidi Shyu regarding a change in acquisition
strategy.
June 2013
Rep. Slaughter secured
report language in the Defense Appropriations and Defense Authorization
bills directing the Army to use open
competition.
July 2013
Rep. Slaughter sent letter to Under Secretary
Kendall pushing for open competition in Army radio
acquisition.
Summer/Fall 2013
Rep. Slaughter and her
office continued to advocate for an open, multi-vendor acquisition
strategy
I will continue to fight everyday to protect
our troops. Indeed, it is a cause that has driven me throughout my
career. In 2009, I successfully persuaded the Department of Defense to
recall 16,000 pieces of body armor and replace them with safer armor to
protect our troops in harm's way. In 2011, I secured language improving
the prevention and prosecution of sexual assault in that years
National Defense Authorization Act. Finally, just this year, I announced
plans for a new, state-of-the-art Veterans Administration facility to
deliver the best care to Monroe Countys veterans.
I look
forward to achieving even more victories in the months and years to come
for our men and women in uniform and leveling the playing field for
Rochester workers- the most talented workforce on
Earth.
Sincerely,
Tell A Friend
