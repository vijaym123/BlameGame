Multiple Town Halls, One Important Dialogue
Last week I had the opportunity to hold
town hall meetings in West Valley City and Kaysville, Utah. I
appreciated the many hundreds of people who took time out of their evenings to
visit with me and discuss important issues facing our country.
Despite the snow flurries, technical difficulties, and the landing of Air
Force One and visit by the President of the United States, the town
halls were well attended and a great success.
Some notable
topics that we discussed during these town halls were national defense,
tax reform, immigration reform, separation of powers, congressional term
limits, higher education reform, over-regulation, and more.
If
you were unable to attend these events, you can find
the full recording of these events here .
Join my Next
Tele-Townhall
I will be holding my next monthly
tele-townhall event on Wednesday, April 15 at 7:00 p.m. MT. As April 15 is the
deadline for Americans to file their taxes, I look forward to
discussing
my tax reform ideas
during the event. Of course
the tax code is only one area where a broken government in Washington
is limiting opportunity for Americans. I invite you
to register for this free, live event
to share your feedback with
me on any other issues that are important to you.
