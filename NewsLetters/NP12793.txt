Day in the Life: State of the Union Edition
I was honored to have Karyn Dickerson, North Carolina&rsquo;s Teacher of the Year, as my guest at the State of the Union address this week. The chance to spend time with Karyn and hear about the creative ways she&rsquo;s working with her students reinforced the importance of supporting North Carolina&rsquo;s teachers, who have helped our state lead the way in education for years.
I hope you'll take a moment to watch a brief video of our time together on Tuesday. The behind-the-scenes video shows us talking about education and Karyn joining me around the Senate in the hours leading up to the State of the Union address.

Karyn, who is an English teacher at Grimsley High School in Greensboro, was named the 2013-2014 Burroughs Wellcome Fund North Carolina Teacher of the Year last May. She serves as an example of the wonderful teachers working across North Carolina, many of whom don't feel respected and supported. When I served in the state senate, I raised teacher pay by a total average of 21 percent. I will continue working to support our teachers as they make a difference in the lives of North Carolina students everyday.
Sincerely,
