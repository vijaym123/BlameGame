Dear Friends,
It was a gamble for the President to promise Americans "if you like
your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan".
Today, millions of Americans are losing their coverage as a result of
the mandates now being imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
despite promises made by the President and his administration that this
would not be the case. In addition to millions of people who have lost
their insurance coverage, the President promised premiums would go
down, telling Americans that families would save an average of $2,500.
Instead, folks are being met by rate shock, with some premiums
increasing by as much as 400 percent. We were promised we could keep
our policies, coverage and doctors, yet these choices are now being
denied.
In the 5th Congressional District, I've heard from hundreds of
constituents who have received notices that their current policies have
become more expensive or, worse, are now cancelled. I've also heard
from countless small businesses that can no longer afford to offer
insurance coverage to their employees or, alternatively, have cut back
on the number of hours their employees are allowed to work - all due to
the law's burdensome and costly requirements. Over the past several
weeks, I have made sure these stories are represented and heard
loud-and-clear in Washington (click here
).
More than half of the ACA's deadlines have been missed or delayed,
according to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, and the
Obama Administration has changed the law 19 times since it was passed
in 2010, through a variety of unilateral executive actions. Despite
these actions, the President has offered little assurance that he can
save the plans that he promised would not be cancelled and his
administration appears incapable of correcting the law's mounting
number of flaws.
We have a responsibility to prevent even more economic harm from being
imposed upon hard working Americans. For this reason, on November 15, I
voted to support
H.R.
3350, the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013, which allows health plans
currently available on the individual market to continue next year,
providing Americans the opportunity to continue to enroll in those
plans without the ACA's individual mandate penalty. Similar proposals
have been put forward in the Senate, which are drawing support from a
growing number of Democrats.
The lackluster roll out and website crashes may be corrected over time.
Unfortunately, the insurance cancellations and cost increases are going
to continue regardless of an executive order or another "promise" from
the White House.
Ultimately, we must repeal this overreaching,
ill-conceived law and replace it with a set of reforms that actually
lower health care costs and expand access.
As always, it is a distinct honor to represent you in Washington.
With
Thanksgiving and Hanukkah upon us, I want to wish you and your family a
safe and happy holiday celebration!
Sincerely,
Protecting Our Privacy Rights and Ending the Dragnet Collection of
Americans' Private Information: There is a just and legal way to go
about preventing terrorism, without violating our individual privacies.
Congress must use its powers to provide oversight of the National
Security Agency (NSA) and all surveillance activities. On November 8th
I joined in support of H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act, a bill to
restore Americans' privacy rights by ending the government's dragnet
collection of phone records and requiring greater oversight,
transparency, and accountability under NSA's surveillance programs.
This bill is aimed at reworking the PATRIOT Act, to stop NSA's mass
data collection and ensure that the constitutional rights of Americans
are protected. Congress did not intend for any law to authorize the
indiscriminate collection of personal information of Americans. As a
member of the bipartisan House Privacy Caucus, I look forward to
working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to advance these
commonsense improvements and vital protections to our civil liberties.

Discussing Pathways to Educational and Career Success with Forest
County High School Students: This past week, I had the opportunity to
meet with Forest County High School students during visits to East
Forest High School, in Marienville, Pa., and West Forest High School,
in Tionesta, Pa.
It was a great opportunity to hear what is on the
minds of our students and discuss issues of interest from Washington,
D.C. and across the 5th District. I also discussed my own career path
and how my passion to serve others guided my educational and career
decisions. Prior to serving in Congress, I spent 28 years in a
non-profit health care setting as a therapist, rehabilitation services
manager and a licensed Nursing Home Administrator. It was helping
individuals with life-changing disease and disability find health and
dignity that led me into the field of health care and ultimately on to
run for Congress. "The discussion was informative," stated School
District Superintendent Amanda Hetrick, "and helped our students see
that Congressman Thompson is a leader who is accessible and interested
in the opinions of his constituents in helping to shape the policies of
our nation." Click here

Recognizing National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month:
On November
4th I joined with U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah (D-PA) in
introducing a resolution to recognize November as National Alzheimer's
Disease Awareness Month.
This resolution is a mark of appreciation for
the amazing work being done through medical research, education, and
awareness to improve the lives of millions of Americans coping with
this debilitating disease, but also recognition of how much work must
still be done. Through continued public advocacy, research, and the
dedicated work of the scientific community, we can and will find a
cure.
During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we
rededicate ourselves to this critically important mission. Click here

Energy Action in the House: It's time for us to get serious about
ending our reliance on foreign sources of energy, which begins by
developing more energy here at home.
The House last week acted on
three separate bills that will expand domestic energy production,
facilitate and improve energy transport, and ultimately increase energy
affordability for consumers and American families across the country.

Centre Daily Times: Thompson Special Needs Fairness Bill gets more
senate support: "U.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Howard Township, gained
more support for a bill he's been involved with since last year, when
four other lawmakers introduced the same bill Thursday in the Senate to
help those living with disabilities have more control over their
futures. The Special Needs Trust Fairness Act would allow people to
independently create their own special needs trust accounts. Current
law prevents disabled individuals from independently creating a special
needs trust, instead forcing them to have a guardian or court create
the trust, even though they might have the mental capacity to do it
themselves. Special needs trusts allow those living with disabilities
to have their assets held in a trust to supplement daily living
expenses and care...(Centre Daily Times

Dear

Private

There
is
a
just
and
legal
way
to
go
about
preventing
terrorism,
without
violating
our
individual
privacies.
Congress
must
use
its
powers
to

the
USA

collection
of

records
and
requiring

This
bill
is
aimed
at
reworking
the
PATRIOT
Act,
to
stop
NSA&#8217;s
mass
data
collection
and
ensure
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
Americans
are

Congress
did
not

to
authorize
the
indiscriminate

of

As

I
look

to
working
with
my

This

I
also

&#8220;The
