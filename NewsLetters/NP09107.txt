Yesterday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified before the House Judiciary Committee for the first time, at an oversight hearing on the Department's lack of enforcement of our nations current immigration laws.
I questioned Secretary Johnson about the 36,007 illegal immigrants convicted of crimes and released from detention last year. The Secretary was unable to say whether those released were members of violent criminal gangs, or if they had even been asked if they were gang members when first detained.
This state of affairs is not only unacceptable, it is inexcusable. America deserves the answers to these questions.
