Highlights in the Legislative Program
Rota National Park study goes to President; Senate passes NDAA - Legislation instructing the Interior Department to study whether areas of Rota should be designated as part of the National Park system is on its way to the President for signature. I was able to add the necessary language to the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act , which the House passed last week and the Senate passed today. Establishing a Rota National Park has been part of my legislative agenda since my first term in Congress. Stand-alone legislation authorizing a suitability and feasibility study for the Park has passed the House three times without action by the Senate, but attaching the study to the larger Defense bill finally did the trick. A 2005 Park Service reconnaissance, requested by Rota Senator Diego Songao, found that archeological, historical, and natural resources on Rota have national significance, the first criteria for a Park. But without a finding of suitability and feasibility Congress will not make the final designation. A 2001 study, for instance, found that the Commonwealths lease of Tinian to the military meant that North Field was not feasible for a Park, so that area could not be included in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park that Congress voted to establish this month. Dayton, Ohio, where polonium was made for the atom bomb, likewise, was found not feasible for inclusion in the Manhattan Project Park. Creating a Rota National Park will still require active participation by the people of Rota, when the study moves forward over the next five years or so. But adding the National Park brand to Rota has the potential to make the island an international destination for tourists, a game changer for Rotas economy.

Saipan food stamps up 16% January 1 - Very good news for people on Saipan, who get help from the federal government to feed their families: their food stamp benefit will go up 16 percent on January 1. For an average family of four that is an increase from $444 a month to $515. This follows increases for Rota, the Northern Islands, and Tinian in May to reflect the higher cost of food on those islands. But there was still money left over from previous years grants, so I have been encouraging the Commonwealth and the Agriculture Department to raise benefits for Saipan, too. Agriculture gave the okay last Friday, allowing the Commonwealth the option of raising benefits on Saipan anywhere from 10 to 16 percent. I spoke with the Governor several weeks ago in anticipation of this decision and recommended that he go for the full 16 percent. And I understand that the Governor has decided to raise food stamps for Saipan to the maximum possible. That is the right decision.
[cid:image005.jpg@01D0163B.17B62940]
Increasing benefits for Saipan is one more step forward in my work to get food assistance in the Northern Mariana Islands raised to the U.S. level. When I was elected to Congress in 2008, people in the Northern Marianas were getting half the benefits of people on Guam
but no one seemed to care. Within 4 months of arriving in Washington I convinced Agriculture Secretary Vilsack to increase the Northern Marianas food stamp grant 13 percent. And earlier this year I added a $32.5 million pilot program to the Agricultural Act, Public Law 113-79 , raising benefits for the NMI at the same time food stamp funding was being cut nationwide. The pilot program will bring us an additional $13.5 million starting next October
on top of our $12 million annual grant
and another $8.5 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 each. The five-year pilot should eventually lead to full participation in the national food assistance program, SNAP.

House okays extension of asylum bar, H visa exemption, investor visa - H.R.83 , with my language extending critical immigration policies in the Northern Mariana Islands for another five years, is now the vehicle for funding the federal government for fiscal year 2015. The House approved the bill 219 to 206 late Thursday night and the Senate is expected to act over the weekend. The White House says the President will sign the measure.
If enacted, H.R.83
will continue three policies set to expire on December 31. The first, exemption from the national cap on the number of H visas will enable big construction projects like Best Sunshine to bring in short-term workers. The second, the E-2C investor visa, will allow 261 foreign investors, who entered the NMI under the Commonwealths own immigration law, to stay another five years. The third, continuing the bar on claims of asylum from our islands, will secure the parole policy that allow tourists from China and Russia to enter the NMI visa free. Without this bar the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the U.S. would have to spend $16 million dealing with asylum claims.
This weeks action is the result of two years of work. I first included the necessary language in my bill, H.R.2200 , and in its companion, S.1237 , which got a hearing in 2013 and passed the Senate this June. I also introduced the language in H.R.4296 , which the House Natural Resources Committee okayed in May. In September, Senator Lisa Murkowski agreed to add my language to H.R. 83, dealing with insular energy policy, when that bill passed the Senate. Procedural requirements then made the five-page H.R.83
a convenient vehicle for the additional 1,603 pages needed to appropriate $1.1 trillion for fiscal 2015. So in an historical first an insular area bill is poised to fund most of the federal government for the year.
I am very grateful to Congresswoman Donna Christensen (D
Virgin Islands), who wrote the original H.R.83 , to Senator Murkowski (R
Alaska), and to Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Maryland), who took a special interest in making sure my language passed the House. I also want to thank Governor Eloy Inos, who understood the economic importance of extending these immigration policies and made his views known to the Speaker of the House, John Boehner.

The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus met with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Len Rodrguez (fifth from left) earlier this week.
I thanked him for his decision to extend humanitarian parole for the stateless and immediate relatives of U.S. citizens in the Northern Marianas and for the tremendous efforts of the USCIS staff who have worked to ease the transition to federal immigration.
Territories included specifically under Travel Promotion Act H.R.83 , the 2015 spending bill, also adds the Northern Mariana Islands and other non-state areas officially to provisions of the Travel Promotion Act, Public Law 111-145 . The Act established a Corporation for Travel Promotion, which does business as Brand USA and is tasked with bringing more international visitors to our country. The NMI and other non-state areas were not mentioned specifically in the definition of United States when the law passed in 2009, so I, engaged in the practice known as a colloquy with the bill managers on the floor of the House . Mr. Delahunt (D
Massachusetts) in the colloquy that the Act should be agreed
as granting the corporation both the authority and obligation to promote tourism in the territories. And it has. Marianas Visitors Authority, for instance, worked effectively with Brand USA promoting travel to the Marianas from Japan . But H.R.83
dots the i and crosses the t by putting the non-state areas specifically into the law. Brand USA is funded with a $10 fee from travelers from countries that have a visa waiver agreement with the U.S. The travel and tourism industry also contributes to the budget. The public-private partnership is credited with attracting 1.1 million visitors to the U.S., creating $32 million worth of economic activity in 2013. H.R.83
extends the program for another five years.

Another $7 million for NMI water and sewer improvements - Another important benefit for the Northern Marianas in H.R.83
is continuation of the formula change for drinking water and sewer construction that we got started in 2010 and that has resulted in over $47 million dollars in the years since. That money has brought Saipan very close to 24-hour water. The 2015 spending bill keeps the set-aside for insular areas at 1.5 percent, 5 times more than the set-aside in the authorizing law.
[cid:image011.jpg@01D0163B.17B62940]
Water and sewer funding increased sharply with a formula change first achieved in Public Law 111-88 and continued every year since then. Before the change, Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act funding averaged $1.1 million per year. After the formula change the average annual funding has been $7.9 million.
Energy teams for insular areas approved by House - The original intent of H.R.83 , before it became the means to fund the federal government, was to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assemble teams of technical, policy, and financial experts to send to each of the insular areas with the goal of helping local governments lower energy costs. And the original intent was maintained when the House passed H.R.83
Thursday night. These energy action teams will develop comprehensive energy plans addressing the immediate, near-term, and long-term energy needs of the Northern Mariana Islands and the other insular areas. Addressing high energy costs in the islands has always been a goal for me and this bill could result in lower energy costs for everyone. My colleague Donna Christensen (D-Virgin Islands) introduced H.R.83
with the support of all the insular area representatives in Congress.
back to top
Tax extension package packed with good news for NMI - The House passed a one-year extension of tax expenditures this week, H.R.5771
including an extension of the American Opportunity Tax Credits (AOTC) special treatment of mirror-code territories, and the 9 percent rate floor on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which increases the attractiveness of new low-income housing investments in the NMI. As a mirror-code territory, the NMI mirrors the federal tax code; however, the onus for paying for credits in the code is placed on the local and not the federal treasury. With the extension and special provision attached to the AOTC, not only can qualified higher education expenses incurred by NMI residents be credited against his or her tax liabilities up to $2,500, but the U.S. Treasury will pay the NMI the amount equal to the cost of issuing the credit. The extension of the LIHTC rate floor is great news to the NMI, as well. The LIHTC Program is an indirect federal subsidy used to finance the development of affordable rental housing for low-income households. Developers of affordable housing have already realized the potential of the LIHTC program in the NMI, and new housing developments are on their way to providing low-cost housing choices for our islands residents. The bill now moves on to the U.S. Senate for further action.
