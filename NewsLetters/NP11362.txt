However, Congress failed to renew the unemployment insurance program in December 2013 and now millions of Americans -- including tens of thousands of Georgians -- are suffering without it. I've met with folks around the district who are struggling with unemployment and not a single person wants to be without a job. People want to work but while we're still trying to address long-term unemployment, we need to do everything we can to help those in immediate need.
I'm a firm believer that we are our brothers' and sisters' keepers. Everyone must work toward standing on their own two feet, but if there's a way we can all help them get there, we should extend unemployment insurance while people are looking for a job.
That's why last week I signed a discharge petition that would force an up-or-down vote to extend unemployment insurance for more than 2 million Americans. The bill extends emergency unemployment insurance for nearly 5 million Americans looking for work through the end of the year, including 80,000 Georgians.
I ran for Congress to help people. Now is the time for action on unemployment insurance. I'm ready to vote on that today. For more, click HERE . To see my floor speech, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
When someone in your family, one of your friends or someone in your neighborhood gets sick or hurt and can&#8217;t work, you help them out. That&#8217;s the idea behind unemployment insurance, which
provides Georgians who have been out of work for a long time with the resources they need to shelter and feed their families while they look for work.
