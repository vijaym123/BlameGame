ICYMI: Rubio: Making Putin Pay
In the Washington Post, Marco urged
Congress to impose sanctions on Russia and
provide assistance to the people of
Ukraine. An excerpt of the op-ed is
below:
Vladimir Putins
annexation of Crimea is a direct
challenge and long-term threat to the
post-World War II international order for
which the United States and our allies
have made great sacrifices over the past
seven decades. If Putin is allowed to
take land from a neighboring nation
through deceit and raw military force
without serious consequences, the
precedent could have global
repercussions, including in Asia.
Some have suggested that Crimea is not
worth triggering tensions with Russia,
given other interests that are more
important. While it is best to avoid
conflict whenever possible, history shows
that illegitimate aggressions that go
unchallenged are a virtual guarantee of
even more dangerous conflict in the
future.
Fortunately, Putins
illegitimate actions have united the
United States and its allies in the free
world in opposition. But while the steps
taken so far by President Obama and the
United States European allies are
welcome, they clearly will not be enough
in the face of a determined Russian
effort to forcibly redraw Europes
borders. Putins annexation of
Crimea must be met with immediate and
meaningful consequences for his regime
and those who benefit from it.

Rubio Addresses The Palm Beach
Republican Club
On Wednesday, Marco addressed economic
opportunities of the 21
st
century at an event hosted by
The Palm Beach Republican Club.
Marcos remarks come on the heels of
last weeks
speech
outlining new policies to unleash
American innovation and create well paying,
middle class jobs.
The
Sun-Sentinels
Anthony Man
wrote about the event. An excerpt of
the article is available below:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio didn't mince
words Wednesday, telling a packed house:
"We do have some challenges in America.
It starts with we have a bad
president."
The audience erupted in applause.
Florida's Republican senator described
himself as optimistic, despite what he
sees as Barack Obama's disastrous
presidency. "We've had that before, and
we've overcome it, and we'll overcome it
again."
He said Democrats' focus on income
inequality is misplaced; the real problem
is "opportunity inequality." He chided
Obama for offering what Rubio said is a
vision that "big government" will improve
the economy and solve the nation's
problems. Instead, he said, the country
needs much more rapid growth, promoted by
changes in tax laws, a reduced national
debt and greater innovation.
And with the preface that "this is
where some people get nervous," Rubio
said: "Values still matter." He said
that's not a prescription for whether or
how people should worship, but a premise
that standards such as hard work and
discipline are important and a lament
that strong families and culture have
eroded.
