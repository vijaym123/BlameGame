Creating the Government We Do Want
On Wednesday,
February 20, I delivered my annual report to the Utah Legislature.
I take very seriously my responsibility to stand accountable to the
legsilature on a regular basis to keep them abreast of what I am doing
in the Senate.
I spent about twenty minutes with both the Utah
House of Representatives and the Utah Senate to introduce to them some
of my recent legislative proposals and to answer their
questions.

I highlighted several elements of my
Conservative Reform Agenda .
Our
country is currently facing an inequality crisis where those on the
bottom of the income scale are trapped in poverty, those in the middle
class face economic insecurity, and those at the top of the income
scale enjoy an environment of cronyist privilege.
I have
introduced several proposals recently to address this inequality crisis, and
several of my proposals are designed to return power that has become
concentrated in Washington back to the states and their state
legislatures.
For example, the
Higher Education Reform Act
would enable states to create
alternative accreditation standards for higher education institutions.
The
Transportation Empowerment
Act
would lower the federal gas tax and empower states to build and
maintain their own transportation infrastructure without all of the
bureaucratic overhead costs that come from sending the money to
Washington first.
I also introduced the
Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act
to Utah's
legislators.
This proposal will strengthen work requirements for social
welfare programs to turn these into programs that help Americans earn
a good living and build a good life.
As this proposal will also
improve state administration of welfare programs, I was encouraged to
see a strong reception of these proposals by Utah's state
legislature.

Local governments solve local problems better than an
expensive, centralized government in Washington D.C., and when I meet
with Utah's local officials, I am convinced that they need to be equal
partners and allies when it comes to solving our nation's greatest
problems.
In addition to sharing some of my recent
legislative proposals to this group, I also shared my 2013 Annual Report,
which provides an in depth review of my service as your senator over
the last year:
