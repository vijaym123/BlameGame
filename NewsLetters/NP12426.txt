Dear Friends,
As you may have heard, the
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a field hearing
in Charleston Monday, "The Charleston, W.Va., Chemical Spill: Cause,
Response and Prevention." And while the hearing brought a number of
different opinions and issues to the table for an open and free
discussion, the biggest takeaway is the disconcerting fact that no one is
willing to say that our water is safe to drink.
In response to
the events of Jan. 9, I introduced the Ensuring Access to Clean Water
Act Monday, legislation that would require oversight and inspection of
chemical storage facilities and aboveground storage
tanks.
The legislation would require states to create programs to oversee
chemical storage facilities and inspect aboveground storage tanks. States
without primacy would have programs created by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
It would establish minimum requirements
for these state oversight and inspection programs, including design
standards, leak detection, spill and overfill control, inventory
control, emergency response and communication, employee training, lifecycle
maintenance, and notice regarding the potential toxicity of stored
chemicals. Inspections would be required at least every three years for
tanks located in source water assessment areas, and at least every five
years for other tanks.
Families need to know that the
water that comes out of their tap is clean and safe. The chemical spill in
Charleston highlighted a number of gaps in existing regulations that
must be closed. Chemical storage facilities and aboveground storage
tanks must be routinely inspected, particularly if they are located near
rivers. Public utilities must know what chemicals are nearby and how
to respond should chemicals enter the water system. I urge Congress to
pass this critical legislation to ensure that everyone in America has
access to clean water in their homes.
NO TO DEBT LIMIT
INCREASE
I voted no this week on legislation to raise the
nations debt limit without spending cuts or reforms.
With more
than $17 trillion in debt, our nation cannot afford to borrow even
more money while ignoring our addiction to deficit spending. This bill
gives the Obama administration unconditional authority to borrow money
through March 15, 2015, while keeping in place the same deficit
spending policies that will necessitate future increases to the debt
ceiling. Taxpayers expect that if the nation borrows money, it will cut
spending elsewhere. This legislation allows this administration to continue
business as usual, and I cannot support raising the debt ceiling
without putting our fiscal house in order.
MILITARY COST-OF-LIVING
BENEFITS
I voted yes this week to restore full
cost-of-living adjustment benefits to current military retirees and military
personnel. The bill, S. 25, passed the U.S. House of Representatives
326-90.
Under the legislation, the COLA change would only
apply to those who joined the armed forces after Jan. 1, 2014, and would
not apply to current retirees or personnel serving before Jan.
1.
The men and women of our armed forces are willing to give their
all to protect our nation, and our veterans have made great
sacrifices in the name of liberty. After all they have given our country,
Congress must fulfill the promise made to them and provide them with the
benefits they have earned.
