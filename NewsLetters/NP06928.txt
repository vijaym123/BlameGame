Dear Fellow Nevadan,
August is a significant time
for parents across Nevada as their children return to school to
develop their young minds and make new friends. But back to school also
means exposure to viruses and diseases, which is why immunizations for
our children are so very important. Immunizations prevent many diseases
and deaths, and they are one of the most effective public safety tools
that exists. In recognition of National Immunization Awareness Month,
I encourage all parents to get their young children vaccinated.
Because of the Affordable Care Act, recommended childhood vaccines are
covered without cost-sharing requirements.
Infectious diseases
like polio and measles have not disappeared, but vaccines help impede
their spread. It is therefore vitally important that Nevadas children
have the immunizations recommended for their ages. We cannot leave
any of our states youth vulnerable to infectious diseases that can so
easily be prevented. Providing vaccines for children is easier now than
it has ever been before, thanks to the Affordable Care
Act.
The Affordable Care Act requires all new health coverage plans to
offer preventive services--like immunizations and wellness visits--to
families with no additional out-of-pocket cost. By eliminating the
co-pay and coinsurance costs of important regular check-ups and preventive
screenings, we can identify, treat, and in some instances prevent
long-term illnesses, ensuring Nevadans are able to live longer, healthier
lives. So this month, give your children a healthy environment by
getting their immunizations.
