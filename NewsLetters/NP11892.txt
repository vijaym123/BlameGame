Dear Friend,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Appropriations Hearing on Alzheimer's Disease
On Wednesday, the Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee held a
hearing titled "Taking a Toll on Families and the Economy: The Rising
Cost of Alzheimer's in America." As Ranking Member of this
subcommittee, I requested this hearing to examine the impacts of
Alzheimer's disease - both economic and personal - and the state of
current research initiatives. I invited my former colleague,
Congressman Dennis Moore of Lenexa, to share his personal story at the
hearing. Rep. Moore was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in June 2011, after
serving Kansas' Third District from 1999-2011. I thank Dennis for
testifying about his own difficult challenges. He and his wife,
Stephene, have focused their efforts helping individuals and families
struggling with this terrible disease. Seth Rogen, actor, comedian, and
Alzheimer's Association Celebrity Champion, also shared personal
testimony at this hearing. Additionally, the witness panel included Dr.
Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health; Dr.
Richard Hodes, Director of the National Institute on Aging; Dr. Story
Landis, Director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders
and Stroke; and Dr. Michael Hurd, Director of the RAND Center for the
Study of Aging.
Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United
States, with more than five million Americans currently living with the
disease. Caring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is
expected to cost $203 billion this year, with $142 billion covered by
the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid. Testimony by the
RAND Corporation indicated the cost of dementia care is projected to
double over the next 30 years, surpassing health care expenses for both
heart disease and cancer. Without a way to prevent or effectively treat
Alzheimer's, it will be difficult - if not impossible - to rein in our
nation's health care costs. Last year, I worked to prioritize funding
for the National Institute on Aging - the lead institute for Alzheimer's
research at the NIH - in the Fiscal Year 2014 omnibus appropriations
bill. I also supported the initial year of funding for the new
initiative to map the human brain. Both of these projects will increase
our understanding of the underlying causes of Alzheimer's, unlock the
mysteries of the makeup and functioning of the brain, and bring us
closer to effective treatments and one day, hopefully, a cure.

The following Kansans attended the hearing as my guests. I thank them
for their interest in this important matter and willingness to join me.

Disease Center in Fairway

practicing in Wichita and specializing in adult and older adult
psychotherapy. Dr. Benson is active with the Alzheimer's Association in
the Wichita community.

Americans Have Right to Voice Opinions on Obamacare
On Thursday evening, I spoke on the Senate floor to refute Senator
Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) assertion that Americans with stories of struggle
under Obamacare are liars and "all of them are untrue." On Wednesday,
Senator Reid used a column written by his own political consultant to
discredit the stories being told of Americans who have very real
struggles and have lost their health care coverage as a result of
Obamacare. Occasionally, a Kansan will share with me the benefits of
the Affordable Care Act, but I have heard directly from numerous
Kansans about the devastating effects Obamacare has had on their
families. I can assure the Majority Leader that Kansans are salt of the
earth people. They are, most assuredly, not liars. And they do not
deserve to be called liars by any member of the Senate.
In addition to calling Americans liars, the Majority Leader went on to
accuse those working to bring light to the broken promises of the
Affordable Care Act of being "as un-American as anyone I can imagine."
Accusations of who is un-American are deeply unfortunate but all too
common. From the earliest days of our Republic, it has been a tactic
exerted by those in power to humiliate and discredit those who come
from different backgrounds or have views that challenge those in power.

full speech on the Senate floor.
U.S. Air Force Academy Board of Visitors
I was recently appointed to the U.S. Air Force Academy Board of
Visitors, which will allow me the opportunity to continue advocating
for airmen in Kansas and all those who serve around the country. The
board provides the Secretary of Defense and members of the House and
Senate Armed Services Committees independent advice and recommendations
on matters relating to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Americans are
fortunate to have so many intelligent, hard-working and patriotic young
men and women interested in serving our country in the Air Force. I
feel privileged each year when I have the chance to recommend Kansans
for admission to the Academy, and I'm fortunate to be in a position to
make certain this institution provides the best possible education and
training for the next generation. I also look forward to working with
former McConnell AFB 22nd Wing Commander Lt. Gen. Michelle D. Johnson
who is the first female superintendent of the Academy.
Reauthorizing Critical Drought Information Program
This week, the Senate passed my bipartisan legislation that would
reauthorize the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS),
which provides vital drought information to farmers, ranchers, and
other industries affected by weather. The reauthorization of this
program provides certainty for farmers and ranchers while they are
still grappling with the devastating effects of drought. This
legislation will extend the program for five years and supports an
interactive "early warning system" of timely and accurate drought
information, as well as an integrated weather monitoring and
forecasting system. The bill now heads to the president for his
signature. Click here
to learn more.
Speaking to Chiropractors at National Legislative Conference
This week, I had the opportunity to speak with Doctors of Chiropractic
from across the country, including many Kansans, who had gathered in
Washington for a national conference. Our discussion focused on the
difficulties many Americans are facing in accessing quality health care
services - especially our nation's veterans. As a member of the Senate
Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have the opportunity to help veterans
get the care they need and deserve, and I am committed to keeping our
promise to those who have served our country.
In 2003, I introduced the Department of Veterans Affairs Chiropractic
Act, legislation that required the VA to appoint Doctors of
Chiropractic and integrate them into the agency to provide care to
veterans. Portions of this bill were incorporated into a veterans
health care bill that passed Congress and became law. While I was
pleased with passage of this legislation, our work has continued. Last
February, I joined Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut in introducing
legislation, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act, to
further increase access to chiropractic care at VA medical centers
nationwide. Our legislation would direct the VA to provide chiropractic
care at a minimum of 75 VA medical centers by the end of this year, and
at all VA medical centers by the end of 2016. A special thanks to Dr.
Carl Cleveland, President of Cleveland Chiropractic College in Overland
Park, for his kind introduction.
Meeting with Textron CEO Scott Donnelly
On Friday, I sat down with Scott Donnelly, CEO of Textron, Inc., to
discuss his company's pending purchase of Wichita's Beechcraft. Textron
is currently undergoing the regulatory review process, and both sides
hope the transaction can be completed this spring. As the parent
company for Cessna, Textron will bring together two of the legendary
names in general aviation. Mr. Donnelly informed me that Textron will
maintain the universally-recognized and respected Beechcraft brand and
that a team of leaders from each company has initiated discussions
about the transition.
I also appreciated the chance to discuss issues of importance to not
only Textron but all of general aviation, including: how general
aviation fees would damage the industry and how a streamlined FAA
certification process would allow American companies to better compete
in the global marketplace.
Thank you to Mr. Donnelly and his Textron team for their continued
presence in Kansas, and for the important role they play in ensuring
that Wichita remains the Air Capital of the World. Click here

University of Kansas Internship Program
Thursday, I enjoyed meeting with college students from across the state
who are interning in Washington, D.C., this spring semester as part of
an intern program through the University of Kansas. It was a pleasure
learning about the current interests and future plans of these
students. I shared with them how my interest in politics began when I
came to Washington as an intern during college. I also appreciated
their questions on various topics of the day. I was glad to have the
opportunity to visit with the next generation of leaders in our
communities, state, and nation. Click here
