Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Omnibus Spending Bill
This week the House approved an omnibus spending package, H.R. 3547,
the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. In reviewing the bill, I
took the same approach I do in business negotiations. When negotiating,
you have to know what you want and what you will accept. While merits
did exist in the bill, I could not support the measure due to various
issues that were of concern to me and fell below what I could accept.
Those issues included the creation of new government programs, an
increase in spending, and mandates on business.
Additionally under the bill, there is a decrease for military retirees'
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). Our veterans sacrificed much for the
country they love, so I could not support this bill knowing we were
retracting our commitment already negotiated with them.
Another specific issue that contributed to my "no" vote was the loss of
jobs that will result from the lack of funding for federal inspectors
in the horse processing industry. Without federal inspectors this
industry cannot exist.
Click the picture below to hear my remarks on the omnibus spending
package.
America is a country of entrepreneurs. I ran for Congress because my
biggest threat was no longer my competitor, but the federal government.
This attack on the horse processing industry is an attack on the
entrepreneurial spirit and a prime example of the federal government
effectively putting an entire industry out of business.
In our current economy, we have to be focused on creating jobs and not
picking winners and losers. We have to look for ways to eliminate waste
and remain good stewards of taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, this
omnibus spending bill did not achieve that goal.
Marriage Ruling
We witnessed an unfortunate ruling this week when U.S. District Judge
Terence Kern declared Oklahoma's ban on gay marriage 'unconstitutional'.
Our constitution protects the sovereignty of states, and with Judge
Kern's ruling, that right has clearly been violated.
Oklahomans overwhelming voted nearly a decade ago to define in our
state's constitution that marriage is between one man and one woman.
Unfortunately we have yet again witnessed the voices of the governed
being disregarded. Today's ruling is disappointing and an unfortunate
reflection of federal overreach.
Unemployment System
I took to the House floor this week to discuss our country's
unemployment system. America is a country of entrepreneurs. Click the
picture below to hear my remarks.
Exchange Information Disclosure Act
We passed H.R. 3362, the Exchange Information Disclosure Act, in the
House this week by a vote of 259-154. Last week we passed a bill that
created protections for Americans at risk of data compromise within the
health care exchanges. This week, H.R. 3362 builds upon that measure
and provides even more accountability for the exchanges.
This President has been trying to convince the American people that
Obamacare is a success, and yet we have seen countless failures that
would prove otherwise. The lack of concrete enrollment information on
the exchanges and the lack of transparency on Healthcare.gov issues has
created uncertainty across the nation.
The Exchange Information Disclosure Act requires the reporting of
various data such as the number of website visits, as well as the
number of legitimate enrollments and premium payments. This data would
be given to Congress and then made accessible to governors and state
insurance commissioners as well as the public.
The act additionally requires problems with Healthcare.gov to be
reported, and requires solutions on how these problems will be resolved
and the cost associated with them to be fixed.
A business cannot maintain goodwill among its customers without
honesty. And just like a service rendered by a business, the American
people deserve to know the truth about a mandate that is being imposed
on them.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
Omnibus
Spending
Bill This
week
the
House
approved
an
omnibus
spending
package,
H.R.
3547,
the
Consolidated
Appropriations
Act
of
2014.
In
reviewing
the
bill,
I
took
the
same
approach
I
do
in
business
negotiations.
When
negotiating,
you
have
to
know
what
you
want
and
what
you
will
accept.
While
merits

the
bill,
I
could
not

the
measure
due
to
various
issues
that
were
of
concern
to
me
and
fell

what
I

Those
issues
included
the
creation
of
new
government
programs,
an
increase
in
spending,
and
mandates
on
business.
Additionally
under
the
bill,
there
is
a
decrease
for
military
retirees&#8217;
Cost
of
Living
Adjustment
(COLA).
Our
veterans
sacrificed
much
for
the
country
they
love,
so
I
could
not
support
this
bill
knowing
we
were
retracting
our
commitment
already
negotiated
with
them.
Another
specific
issue
that
contributed
to
my
&#8220;no&#8221;
vote
was
the
loss
of
jobs
that
will
result
from
the
lack
of
funding
for
federal
inspectors
in
the
horse
processing
industry.
Without
federal
inspectors
this
industry
cannot
exist.

America

I
ran

Congress
because
my
biggest
threat
was
no

my
competitor,
but
the
federal
government.
This
attack
on
the
horse

industry
is
an
attack
on
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
a
prime
example
of
the
federal
government
effectively
putting
an
entire
industry
out
of

goal.
Marriage
Ruling
We
witnessed
an
unfortunate
ruling
this
week
when
U.S.
District
Judge
Terence
Kern
declared
Oklahoma&#8217;s
ban
on
gay
marriage
&#8216;unconstitutional&#8217;.
Our
constitution
protects
the
sovereignty
of
states,
and
with
Judge
Kern's
ruling,
that
right
has
clearly
been
violated.
Oklahomans
overwhelming
voted
nearly
a
decade
ago
to
define
in
our
state&#8217;s
constitution
that
marriage
is
between
one
man
and
one
woman.
Unfortunately
we
have
yet
again
witnessed
the
voices
of
the
governed
being
disregarded.
Today&#8217;s
ruling
is
disappointing
and
an
unfortunate
reflection
of
federal
overreach.
Unemployment
System
I
took
to
the
House
floor
this
week
to
discuss
our
country's
unemployment
system.
America
is
a
country
of
entrepreneurs.
Click

my
remarks.
Exchange
Information
Disclosure
Act
We
passed H.R.
3362,
the
Exchange
Information
Disclosure
Act, in
the
House
this
week by
a
vote
of
259-154.
Last
week we
passed
a
bill
that
created
protections
for
Americans
at
risk
of
data
compromise
within
the
health
care
exchanges.
This
week,
H.R.
3362
builds
upon
that
measure
and
provides
even
more
accountability
for
the
exchanges.
This
President
has
been
trying
to
convince
the
American
people
that
Obamacare
is
a
success,
and
yet
we
have
seen
countless
failures
that
would
prove
otherwise.
The
lack
of
concrete
enrollment
information
on
the
exchanges
and
the
lack
of
transparency
on
Healthcare.gov
issues
has
created
uncertainty
across
the
nation.
The
Exchange
Information
Disclosure
Act
requires
the
reporting
of
various
data
such
as
the
number
of
website
visits,
as
well
as
the
number
of
legitimate
enrollments
and
premium
payments.
This
data
would
be
given
to
Congress
and
then
made
accessible
to
governors
and
state
insurance
commissioners
as
well
as
the
public.
The
act
additionally
requires
problems
with
Healthcare.gov
to
be
reported,
and
requires
solutions
on
how
these
problems
will
be
resolved
and
the
cost
associated
with
them
to
be
fixed.
A
business
cannot
maintain
goodwill
among
its
customers
without
honesty.
And
just
like
a
service
rendered
by
a
business,
the
American
people
deserve
to
know
the
truth
about
a
mandate
that
is
being
imposed
on
them.
