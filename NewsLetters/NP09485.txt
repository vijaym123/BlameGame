The Public Deserves To Know Who's Financing Our Elections
Congressman Van Hollen recently spoke at the American Enterprise
Institute on the corrosive role secret money is playing in our

public," he said, "should be informed about who is spending vast sums
of money to influence their decision to vote for or against candidates
for public office."
