Dear Friend,
Today, let us pause and remember the men and women of our Armed
Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We honor them
as a celebration of their lives and a reminder of the true cost of
the freedoms we enjoy today. While we can never truly repay our debt to
those who gave their lives for us, we must not forget what we owe to
those still living as well. We have over 350,000 veterans in Louisiana
who served our country with honor and valor. Here in Congress we are
taking steps to ensure that our veterans have access to first-class
healthcare, find good-paying jobs, and are able to continue their
education.
I remain committed to doing all we can to ensure our
veterans have access to timely, quality healthcare. The recent
allegations of misconduct within the VA medical community are deplorable and
are being thoroughly investigated to hold those responsible at every
level accountable. With my support, the House recently passed the
Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act as a first step
to address these allegations.However, we must also improve the
healthcare our veterans receive overall through the VA healthcare system by
reducing wait times and increasing efficiency. I will continue to
support actions that address those goals.
I have supported
veterans hiring initiatives, which increase employment opportunities for
our veterans through establishing tax credits for businesses that hire
them. By boosting hiring for veterans America can welcome our Soldiers,
Sailors, Marines, Coast Guard and Airmen back into their communities
as entrepreneurs, small business owners, and
workers.
According to VA statistics, over 1.1 million veterans or eligible military
family members have been able to continue their education. Service
members are provided a tuition and fee payment to their school on their
behalf, as well as a monthly housing allowance, so they can attend
top-level colleges and universities.
Funds can also be used for
trade schools, on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and flight schools
for those who choose to pursue those routes.
As we join our fellow Americans to remember those who have made the
ultimate sacrifice and salute those who have served our country
around the world, understand that I am working hard for our veterans. Just
as the military pledges to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield,
we must also pledge to leave no veteran behind here at home. There is
still work to be done, but we will allow nothing to stand in our way
to honor those who defend us in the name of freedom and
democracy.
Happy Memorial Day
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd Congressional District of
Louisiana
