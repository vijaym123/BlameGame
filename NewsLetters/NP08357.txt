Dear Friends:
The
Middle East over the last three years has been besieged by a resurgence
of instability, violence and terrorism. The Obama administration has
chosen to confront this challenge - which has major implications for
U.S. national security - by leading from behind and relying on an
ineffective diplomatic strategy that involves few concrete security
measures.
Violent extremism is on the rise in the Middle East and
the warning signs have been visible for years. These warning signs
include the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, the resurgence of ISIL, the
fall of Mosul and the rise of al-Qaida affiliated extremist groups
like the al-Nusrah Front in Syria. Just last week we saw a terrorist
flag raised over the largest oil refinery inside of Iraq.
Despite
these stark warning signs, the administration has only been willing to
take very limited steps to curb this disturbing trend. Instead of
focusing on making counterterrorism operations more effective, the
administration has been focused on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
while Americas enemies grow stronger. This approach has been a huge
gamble that continues to jeopardize Americas
security.
Whether it is Iraq, Afghanistan, or other parts of the Middle East,
Americans have fought and died in the war against al-Qaida. Our nation is
weary of war, but threatening elements still remain. We cannot abandon
the gains weve made in the fight against terrorism since
9/11.
