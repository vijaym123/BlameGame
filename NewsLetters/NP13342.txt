Good Tidings of Great Joy
Friends,
As your representative in Congress, it is rare that I can report "good tidings of great joy".
That is why I am so thankful this Christmas season to be reminded that our hope does not come from Washington, and that true peace and joy cannot be taken from us.
I am inspired to reflect on a story of shepherds visited by an angel in a field.
Of a child born in a manger in Bethlehem.
And of a message that brings peace on earth and good will toward men.
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
