Dear
Friends,
I get plenty of questions about Medicare, which
provides health insurance to about 243,000 Idahoans, or 15 percent of our
population.
The most important advice I have is that
beneficiaries reassess their health needs during the annual enrollment
period. That window is now open and will remain so until Dec. 7. If youre
satisfied with your current coverage and your plan is still being
offered, you need not do anything.
If youd like to shop and
compare coverage options, you may go online to www.medicare.gov. You also
can get excellent assistance from counselors at the Idaho Department
of Insurance. To speak with a senior health benefits advisor by phone
or make an appointment for a face-to-face visit, call 1-800-247-4422.
Youll reach dedicated and well-trained folks who provide free,
unbiased information about Medicare plans.
For all but the
wealthiest Americans, Medicare Part A is free
if you or your spouse paid
Medicare taxes while working. Part A covers hospitalizations, hospice,
home health services, skilled nursing facilities and non-custodial
nursing home care.
From there, things get more
complicated.
Part B principally covers visits to doctors, other providers
and labs. Even if you have insurance as a retirement benefit from an
employer, through your spouses employer or the TriCARE plan, you
should verify whether you need to sign up for Plan B. Many insurers require
you carry Plan B.
Its important to carefully evaluate
your individual needs. The least expensive plan isnt always the best
choice. How much are your deductibles? What does the plan pay for
hospital stays? How much for doctor visits? You may be healthy now, but what
happens should you experience a significant health change a few months
into 2015? I urge you to look at plans with high approval ratings and
find the one best suited to you with the least amount of
out-of-pocket expenses.
Medicare Part C provides supplemental or
Medigap policies. These are optional and sold by private companies. They
help cover the gap between what original Medicare pays and what you
must pay, including copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. You must
have Part A and Part B to buy a Part C plan. If you and your spouse each
want Medigap, you must buy separate policies.
Part D covers
prescriptions. Its important to review your plan for deductibles,
what pharmacies are available and whether mail-order prescriptions are
included.
Most plans offer preventative tests and screenings
at little or no cost. All Medicare plans offer free annual wellness
screenings and flu vaccinations. I urge you to take advantage of those
services.
If you need assistance paying your premiums, call
2-1-1, the Idaho CareLine, a free statewide hotline with information
about programs to help pay your premiums.
Also, you should
know that if you, or someone you know, is having problems with a
federal agency, you can visit my
Constituent Services
webpage for assistance. As your elected representative, my staff and I
are here to help; we will do our best to untangle any federal
complications you might have.
Thank
you ,
