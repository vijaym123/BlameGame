Simpson Continues His Fight to Include Potatoes in WIC Program
Idaho Congressman and Colleagues Send Letter to Agriculture Secretary Requesting Reconsideration of Potato Exclusion
Idaho Congressman Simpson is the Republican lead on a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack expressing disapproval of the USDA decision to continue the exclusion of potatoes in the final WIC rule.
On March 13th, 67 bipartisan members of Congress signed Simpsons letter expressing disappointment with the Obama Administrations disregard for the very clear direction from Congress to include fresh, white potatoes in the WIC program.
The members of Congress ask Secretary Vilsack to revisit his decision based on current nutrition science and the direction of Congress.
I am deeply disappointed in the USDAs decision to ignore legislation that directed the agency to include fresh potatoes in the WIC Program, said Simpson. This letter further demonstrates the congressional support for including potatoes in the WIC program, and I will continue to ask the Administration to reconsider their decision.
I intend to use every means available to me, and any possible legislative vehicle that develops, to reverse this ban and restore the rightful inclusion of nutritious fresh, white potatoes in the WIC program.

Simpson Praises Mexico's Final Rule to Allow Potato Trade
Idaho Congressman Simpson is pleased the Mexican government published its final rule allowing the importation of fresh potatoes from the United States.
Since the Market Access Agreement was signed by the U.S. and Mexico in 2003, I have consistently urged the USTR, USDA and White House to sustain efforts encouraging Mexico to meet its commitment and allow full market access for U.S. fresh potatoes, said Simpson. I am pleased the Mexican government has issued its final rule allowing full market access for U.S. fresh potatoes.
In 2003, the United States and Mexico signed a market access agreement that allowed for the shipment of U.S. fresh potatoes into a 26-kilometer area along the border of Mexico.
The agreement called for increased access to the five northern Mexican states in 2004 and for consideration of full access by 2005. However, Mexico has continued to limits shipments of U.S. potatoes to areas within 26 kilometers of the border. In 2012, the Mexican government started its rulemaking process to allow of the expansion U.S. fresh potato trade between the two countries.
The original regulation is available at http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5337533&amp;fecha=19/03/2014 and a translated version is available at http://nationalpotatocouncil.org/files/3813/9531/6659/031914.COFEMER.pdf
The USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is expected to publish its final rule in the Federal Register next week.
Shipments of potatoes between the U.S. and Mexico should begin in May.
