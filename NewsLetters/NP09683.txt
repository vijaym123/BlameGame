Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
I am outraged!
As a mother of a soldier currently serving in the 101st
Airborne, I am furious the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) tried to
conceal veterans' long wait times for medical care.
It breaks my heart
to learn that at least 40 veterans died while waiting for appointments
at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system.
This outrageous level of incompetence and neglect has also impacted our
veterans at the VA hospital in St. Louis.
The former chief of
psychiatry for the St. Louis VA hospital system claims he was demoted
after complaining about an "artificial backlog" of mental health care.
As a result, veterans were waiting over a month to receive treatment
they desperately needed.
For far too long, senior executives at the VA have been held
unaccountable to our nation's heroes. That's why the House will vote on
legislation next week to fire those responsible for this travesty and
restore accountability to the American people.
Unfortunately, government abuse is all around us.
This week, we learned the ObamaCare train wreck continues with alleged
taxpayer dollars being misused at a Serco facility in Wentzville,
Missouri.
The Department of Health and Senior Services awarded Serco
Inc. a billion dollar contract to help review and process paper
applications from consumers who apply for ObamaCare.
However,
according to a whistleblower, claims can pass weeks without receiving a
single application to process. That's why I supported a letter by my
good friend, Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer, to the head of Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid studies to investigate these matters to make sure
no taxpayer dollars are wasted.
It seems like a day doesn't go by without a new scandal rocking the
very foundation of our democracy.
Whether it's the IRS targeting
conservatives for political gain, to the NSA collecting our personal
information, and the FDA trying to tell us what food we can eat -
government overreach and abuse is rampant.
At the core of all the scandals emerging from Washington is one simple
question:
do you trust government?
A question that says more about the state of our union than it says
about the President's ability to lead the American people.
Like you, I'm tired of yelling at my television every night asking
myself whatever happened to accountability and leadership from our
elected officials!
I hear your shouts, I read your letters and I will not stop fighting
until you have a government that you can trust in again.
That's why I'm
fighting to bring accountability back to the American people, and honor
Abe Lincoln's prayer, "that government of the people, by the people,
for the people shall not perish from the earth."
As always, it is an honor to serve you and I look forward to speaking
with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Ann's
Weekly
Roundup
Dear
Friend,
I
am
outraged!
As
a
mother
of
a
soldier
currently
serving
in
the
101st
Airborne,
I
am
furious
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
tried
to
conceal
veterans'
long
wait
times
for
medical
care.
It
breaks
my
heart
to
learn
that
at
least
40
veterans
died
while
waiting
for
appointments
at
the
Phoenix
Veterans
Affairs
Health
Care
system.
This
outrageous
level
of
incompetence
and
neglect
has
also
impacted
our
veterans
at
the
VA
hospital
in
St.
Louis.
The
former
chief
of
psychiatry
for
the
St.
Louis
VA
hospital
system
claims
he
was
demoted
after
complaining
about
an
&#8220;artificial
backlog&#8221;
of
mental
health
care.
As
a
result,
veterans
were
waiting
over
a
month
to
receive
treatment
they
desperately
needed.
For
far
too
long,
senior
executives
at
the
VA
have
been
held
unaccountable
to
our
nation's
heroes.
That&#8217;s
why
the
House
will
vote
on
legislation
next
week
to
fire
those
responsible
for
this
travesty
and
restore
accountability
to
the
American
people.
Unfortunately,
government
abuse
is
all
around
us.
This
week,
we
learned
the
ObamaCare
train
wreck
continues
with
alleged taxpayer
dollars
being
misused
at
a
Serco
facility
in
Wentzville,
Missouri.
The
Department
of
Health
and
Senior
Services
awarded
Serco
Inc.
a
billion
dollar
contract
to
help
review
and
process
paper
applications
from
consumers
who
apply
for
ObamaCare.
However,
according
to
a
whistleblower,
claims
can
pass
weeks
without
receiving
a
single
application
to
process.
That&#8217;s
why
I
supported
a
letter
by
my
good
friend,
Congressman
Blaine
Luetkemeyer,
to
the
head
of
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
studies
to
investigate
these
matters
to
make
sure
no
taxpayer
dollars
are
wasted.
It
seems
like
a
day
doesn't
go
by
without
a
new
scandal
rocking
the
very
foundation
of
our
democracy.
Whether
it&#8217;s
the
IRS
targeting
conservatives
for
political
gain,
to
the
NSA
collecting
our
personal
information,
and
the
FDA
trying
to
tell
us
what
food
we
can
eat
&#8211;
government
overreach
and
abuse
is
rampant.
At
the
core
of
all
the
scandals
emerging
from
Washington
is
one
simple
question:
do
you
trust
government?
A
question
that
says
more
about
the
state
of
our
union
than
it
says
about
the
President&#8217;s
ability
to
lead
the
American
people.
Like
you,
I&#8217;m
tired
of
yelling
at
my
television
every
night
asking
myself
whatever
happened
to
accountability
and
leadership
from
our
elected
officials!
I
hear
your
shouts,
I
read
your letters
and
I
will
not
stop
fighting
until
you
have
a
government
that
you
can
trust
in
again.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
fighting
to
bring
accountability
back
to
the
American
people,
and
honor
Abe
Lincoln&#8217;s
prayer,
&#8220;that
government
of
the
people,
by
the
people,
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth.&#8221;
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
I
look
forward
to
speaking with
you
again
soon.
Sincerely,
Ann
Wagner Member
