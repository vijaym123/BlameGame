7th DISTRICT
March 14, 2014
Dear Friend,
Two bills passed by the House this week will
help to restore balance to the separation of powers. The ENFORCE the Law
Act and the Faithful Execution of the Law Act provides Congress and
targets federal officials who fail to enforce federal law, and gives
Congress the ability to legally hold the President accountable for
failing to faithfully execute the law.
These important bills will
help curb the unbridled expansion of executive power weve seen from
this Administration and provide the American people with certainty
that the laws on the books will be followed.
As we have seen,
the current Administration has unilaterally decided which laws to
enforce and which ones they will ignore.
We must hold this
Administration accountable for its actions.
For more information on
this or any other issue, please visit our 7th Congressional District

WIth my
regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
