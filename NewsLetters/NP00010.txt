Dear Friend,
In 2014, wildfires cost Oregon $280 million and charred 847,000 acres.
And, as record drought continues across the West, more severe fire
seasons are expected in 2015 and beyond.
But, even when exceptionally large and devastating wildfires occur, the
cost of fighting them is not covered by natural disaster emergency
funding. As a result, in bad fire years, agencies must cut from
critical programs -including wildfire prevention - to pay for the full
costs of fighting fires that are already causing enormous damage.
This approach to fighting fires is unsustainable and no way to maintain
a healthy ecosystem or improve fire prevention.
That's why it's very good news that the Senate Appropriations Committee
just passed legislation to finally end this practice of
"fire-borrowing" and allow wildfire-fighting efforts to use natural
disaster emergency funds during the worst fire years.
I fought to include this provision because by allowing
wildfire-fighting agencies to use natural disaster emergency funds, we
can finally end a vicious cycle in which fire prevention funds are
robbed to pay for fires that are already burning. We need to stop
fueling a cycle of disaster, and while there's still a ways to go for
this provision to become law, this week we took a big step in the right
direction.
As we face down another extreme fire season in the West, I am hopeful
we can rise above politics and come together on this important,
bipartisan, common-sense fix to make sure we aren't robbing fire
prevention funds to pay for fires that are already burning.
All my best,
Jeff

Dear
Friend,
In
2014,
wildfires
cost
Oregon
$280
million
and
charred
847,000
acres.
And,
as
record
drought
continues
across
the
West,
more
severe
fire
seasons
are
expected
in
2015
and
beyond.
But,
even
when
exceptionally
large
and
devastating
wildfires
occur,
the
cost
of
fighting
them
is
not
covered
by
natural
disaster
emergency
funding.
As
a
result,
in
bad
fire
years,
agencies
must
cut
from
critical
programs
&mdash;including
wildfire
prevention
&mdash;
to
pay
for
the
full
costs
of
fighting
fires
that
are
already
causing
enormous
damage.
This
approach
to
fighting
fires
is
unsustainable
and
no
way
to
maintain
a
healthy
ecosystem
or
improve
fire
prevention.
That's
why
it's
very
good
news
that
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
just
passed
legislation
to
finally
end
this
practice
of
"fire-borrowing"
and
allow
wildfire-fighting
efforts
to
use
natural
disaster
emergency
funds
during
the
worst
fire
years.
I
fought
to
include
this
provision
because
by
allowing
wildfire-fighting
agencies
to
use
natural
disaster
emergency
funds,
we
can
finally
end
a
vicious
cycle
in
which
fire
prevention
funds
are
robbed
to
pay
for
fires
that
are
already
burning.
We
need
to
stop
fueling
a
cycle
of
disaster,
and
while
there's
still
a
ways
to
go
for
this
provision
to
become
law,
this
week
we
took
a
big
step
in
the
right
direction.
As
we
face
down
another
extreme
fire
season
in
the
West,
I
am
hopeful
we
can
rise
above
politics
and
come
together
on
this
important,
bipartisan,
common-sense
fix
to
make
sure
we
aren't
robbing
fire
prevention
funds
to
pay
for
fires
that
are
already
burning.
All
my
best,
