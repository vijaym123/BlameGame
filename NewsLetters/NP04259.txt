In our e-newsletter
published yesterday, it was mistakenly noted that Nestl Waters North
America is expanding in Marion County instead of Chesterfield County.
Earlier this month, Nestl announced it will build a $40 million
Deer Park Spring Water bottling plant near McBee in Chesterfield
County.
This expansion will greatly impact our local economy and is
expected to create 40 to 50 jobs.
During a public meeting this summer, Nestl said it was
considering the location on S.C. 151, south of McBee, for a bottling plant.
Lance Tully, Senior Natural Resource Specialist for Nestl
Waters, told
Florence Morning News , Weve been studying
water in Chesterfield County for several years and we look forward to
continuing to build strong relationships in the community as this new
facility becomes
operational.
With 15 leading bottled water brands, Nestl Waters North America
is the number one bottled drinking water company in the country.
Nestl is committed to promoting hydration and creating shared value
by being a good neighbor in the communities the company calls home.
We are fortunate to have Nestl Waters North America expand in
Chesterfield County and on behalf of South Carolinas Seventh District,
welcome to our community!
