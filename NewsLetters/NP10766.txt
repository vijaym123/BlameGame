A budget that trusts the American people
Op-Ed by Paul Ryan
For the fourth year in a row, House Republicans have passed a balanced
budget
.
Each time, we've put forward a plan that stops spending money we don't
have, creates jobs with pro-growth reforms, strengthens the safety net,
and expands opportunity for all. And each time we've learned a little
bit more about where the two parties stand.
If you look at President Barack Obama's budget -- Senate Democrats
refused to write one this year -- it's clear where he and his party
place their trust: Washington.
He wants to raise taxes by $1.8 trillion -- on top of the $1.7 trillion
he's already raised. He wants to increase spending by $791 billion. And
he never balances the budget -- ever.
Time and again, the President and his party put government in the
driver's seat. They want to take more from families to spend more in
Washington. Whether it's health care, energy, or taxes, Democrats want
the federal government to play a bigger role in the lives of Americans
and our economy.
And that's great for Washington; it thrives on more power. But the
American people will lose out. They'll face less opportunity, more
debt, and fewer jobs.
By contrast, House Republicans have put forward a plan that puts our
trust in the people. Our plan balances the budget in just 10 years. We
cut $5.1 trillion in spending over the next decade by eliminating waste
and making much-needed reforms.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the deficit reduction
in our budget will grow the economy
. Under our plan, in 2024, economic output will be
1.8% greater than it otherwise would be. That works out to about $1,100
per person.
A quick reality check for the critics and big spenders in Washington:
On the current path, the federal government will spend roughly $48
trillion over the next 10 years. By contrast, this budget will spend
nearly $43 trillion. On the current path, spending will grow, on
average, by 5.2% a year. Under our budget, spending will grow, on
average, by 3.5% a year. Nearly $43 trillion is enough. Increasing
spending by 3.5% instead of 5.2% is hardly draconian.
Responsible spending restraint is just one part of our plan. We also
call for pro-growth tax reform and greater energy production. We repeal
Obamacare and clear the way for patient-centered reforms. We protect
and strengthen Medicare. We repair the safety net so it's there for
those who need it, and we give states the flexibility they need to help
people move up the ladder of life.
Our budget will root out cronyism, because we believe the American
people deserve a level playing field. In fact, we eliminate $7 billion
of corporate welfare within the Department of Commerce alone. We want
the best and brightest to lead the way. Businesses shouldn't succeed
because of the connections they have in Washington. They should succeed
based on the value they generate and the jobs they create. We can
expand opportunity by empowering people, not bureaucrats.
All of these solutions would help create jobs. Instead of sending more
money to Washington -- instead of funding more Solyndras and racking up
more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and
wasteful spending. Under our plan, people will spend less time
navigating the maze that is Washington and more time developing the new
ideas that will power our economy.
So this debate boils down to a question of trust. Do we trust
Washington to know what's best for our health care, our economy, or our
families? Or do we trust the people of this country to make an honest
assessment about what's best for their lives?
Republicans have made our choice. We've put forward a budget that
harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of
every person. We trust the American people to lead our country forward.
Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, is the chairman of the House Budget
Committee.

A
budget
that
trusts
the
American
people
Op-Ed
by
Paul
Ryan
For
the
fourth
year
in
a
row,
House
Republicans
have
passed
a
balanced
budget .
Each
time,
we've
put
forward
a
plan
that
stops
spending
money
we
don't
have,
creates
jobs
with
pro-growth
reforms,
strengthens
the
safety
net,
and
expands
opportunity
for
all.
And
each
time
we've
learned
a
little
bit
more
about
where
the
two
parties
stand.
If
you
look
at
President
Barack
Obama's
budget
--
Senate
Democrats
refused
to
write
one
this
year
--
it's
clear
where
he
and
his
party
place
their
trust:
Washington.
He
wants
to
raise
taxes
by
$1.8
trillion
--
on
top
of
the
$1.7
trillion
he's
already
raised.
He
wants
to
increase
spending
by
$791
billion.
And
he
never
balances
the
budget
--
ever. Time
and
again,
the
President
and
his
party
put
government
in
the
driver's
seat.
They
want
to
take
more
from
families
to
spend
more
in
Washington.
Whether
it's
health
care,
energy,
or
taxes,
Democrats
want
the
federal
government
to
play
a
bigger
role
in
the
lives
of
Americans
and
our
economy.
And
that's
great
for
Washington;
it
thrives
on
more
power.
But
the
American
people
will
lose
out.
They'll
face
less
opportunity,
more
debt,
and
fewer
jobs.
By
contrast,
House
Republicans
have
put
forward
a
plan
that
puts
our
trust
in
the
people.
Our
plan
balances
the
budget
in
just
10
years.
We
cut
$5.1
trillion
in
spending
over
the
next
decade
by
eliminating
waste
and
making
much-needed
reforms.
The
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
says
the
deficit
reduction
in
our
budget
will
grow
the
economy .
Under
our
plan,
in
2024,
economic
output
will
be
1.8%
greater
than
it
otherwise
would
be.
That
works
out
to
about
$1,100
per
person.
A
quick
reality
check
for
the
critics
and
big
spenders
in
Washington:
On
the
current
path,
the
federal
government
will
spend
roughly
$48
trillion
over
the
next
10
years.
By
contrast,
this
budget
will
spend
nearly
$43
trillion.
On
the
current
path,
spending
will
grow,
on
average,
by
5.2%
a
year.
Under
our
budget,
spending
will
grow,
on
average,
by
3.5%
a
year.
Nearly
$43
trillion
is
enough.
Increasing
spending
by
3.5%
instead
of
5.2%
is
hardly
draconian.
Responsible
spending
restraint
is
just
one
part
of
our
plan.
We
also
call
for
pro-growth
tax
reform
and
greater
energy
production.
We
repeal
Obamacare
and
clear
the
way
for
patient-centered
reforms.
We
protect
and
strengthen
Medicare.
We
repair
the
safety
net
so
it's
there
for
those
who
need
it,
and
we
give
states
the
flexibility
they
need
to
help
people
move
up
the
ladder
of
life.
Our
budget
will
root
out
cronyism,
because
we
believe
the
American
people
deserve
a
level
playing
field.
In
fact,
we
eliminate
$7
billion
of
corporate
welfare
within
the
Department
of
Commerce
alone.
We
want
the
best
and
brightest
to
lead
the
way.
Businesses
shouldn't
succeed
because
of
the
connections
they
have
in
Washington.
They
should
succeed
based
on
the
value
they
generate
and
the
jobs
they
create.
We
can
expand
opportunity
by
empowering
people,
not
bureaucrats.
All
of
these
solutions
would
help
create
jobs.
Instead
of
sending
more
money
to
Washington
--
instead
of
funding
more
Solyndras
and
racking
up
more
debt
--
we
return
power
to
the
people
by
cutting
tax
rates
and
wasteful
spending.
Under
our
plan,
people
will
spend
less
time
navigating
the
maze
that
is
Washington
and
more
time
developing
the
new
ideas
that
will
power
our
economy.
So
this
debate
boils
down
to
a
question
of
trust.
Do
we
trust
Washington
to
know
what's
best
for
our
health
care,
our
economy,
or
our
families?
Or
do
we
trust
the
people
of
this
country
to
make
an
honest
assessment
about
what's
best
for
their
lives?
Republicans
have
made
our
choice.
We've
put
forward
a
budget
that
harnesses
the
power
of
economic
freedom
and
respects
the
dignity
of
every
person.
We
trust
the
American
people
to
lead
our
country
forward.
