Dear Friends,
Our National Parks have always been a point of pride for all Californians. From Yosemite to Sequoia to Kings Canyon, these places are home to some of our most treasured memories and a destination for visitors from around the world.
This
National Parks Week , I invite you to rediscover and go wild for what has been called America&rsquo;s best idea. Bring your friends and family out for upcoming
events
at nearby National Parks. There is something for everyone at our parks.
As a long-time advocate for our parks, I have introduced legislation that would expand Yosemite to include 1,600 acres that were originally intended to be a part of the park. My legislation aims to restore the park to John Muir&rsquo;s original vision while also protecting its vulnerable western boundary. In addition, it would prevent the potentially problematic and costly development of these remote areas.
Because Yosemite holds a special place in the hearts of all Californians, my legislation has gained broad bipartisan support across the state. Local homeowners, conservation groups, and state and local officials have called for action on my bill that would authorize the sale of this land to the Park Service.
These are America&rsquo;s parks. It is our obligation to preserve them as a legacy of our country&rsquo;s natural beauty for future generations. Enjoy them now; share them with the ones you love.
Sincerely,
Jim Costa
