A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
April 24, 2015
Dear Friends,
On Wednesday, the Senate finally took steps to end modern slavery
through the passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
by a vote of 99-0.
I am both pleased and relieved that the Senate has passed this
important legislation that will provide help for these oppressed
victims. I hope we can quickly reconcile the differences between the
House-passed bill and the
Senate-passed bill and send a final bill to the presidents desk to be
signed into law.
This legislation establishes the Domestic Victims Trafficking Fund a
private, non-profit grant-making institution, which would fund programs
outside the United States that will help victims recover, prevent
trafficking, and enforce laws to punish individual and corporate
offenders of modern slavery.
VA Committee Seeks Answers
Today, I held a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee field hearing
regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs construction of a new
medical center in Denver, Colo.
Our hearing addressed the mismanagement of the construction of a new
hospital being built to replace the Denver VA Medical Center. The
ongoing projects cost has climbed to $1.7 billion, which is hundreds
of millions of dollars over budget and makes this project the most
expensive hospital construction in the VAs history.
The committee made it very clear at todays hearing that we expect a
full report from the VA about its plans to address the unacceptable
surge in costs, delays and mismanagement of the construction at the
replacement Denver VA Medical Center. We also expect VA Secretary Bob
McDonald and the VA to hold accountable those responsible for this
gross mismanagement that led to the waste of hundreds of millions of
taxpayer dollars and to see to it that necessary steps are taken to
prevent further waste in Denver or at any future VA construction
project.
Time to Repeal Obamacare
Since the day Obamacare was signed into law, I have fought to repeal
this terrible legislation. This week, I co-sponsored the Preserving
Freedom and Choice in Health Care Act
that would help Americans who are
negatively impacted by Obamacare.
This legislation is crucial in the event that the United States Supreme
Court rules in the case known as King v. Burwell that patients enrolled
in the federal exchange are not eligible for tax credits. It would
allow anyone who would lose their tax credits to continue receiving the
subsidy through August 2017 for any offered health plan of their
choice. Also, states would have the freedom and flexibility to develop
alternatives that protect Americans from the harmful effects of
Obamacare. This bill also repeals the individual and employer mandates
and allows health care plans that would have been canceled by Obamacare
restrictions, to continue through 2017.
Loretta Lynch
Yesterday, I voted against the presidents nomination of Loretta Lynch
as the next United States Attorney General. Since her nomination, I
have been very concerned about her acceptance of President Obamas
amnesty proposal and her approval of Eric Holder's record to undermine
the Second Amendment. Our country needs an attorney general who will
uphold the Constitution and not seek to pick and choose which laws to
enforce.
Congressional Gold Medal Presentation
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to present to Amelia Jones of
Savannah, Ga., a Congressional Gold Medal for her service with the
Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. Our nation is indebted to her, and
it is because of the sacrifices of our nations veterans that future
generations will continue to live in freedom.
Serving Our Women Veterans
This week, I called on the Department of Veterans Affairs to strengthen
its programs and health care for women veterans.
Women continue to play an important role
in our national security, and we must ensure that our women veterans
are able to receive the same services that women expect in the private
sector.
Shepherds Men Runners Stop in D.C.
It was a pleasure to greet the Shepherds Men runners who stopped in
the nations capital on their 911-mile run from the Freedom Tower in
New York City to the Shepherd
Center in Atlanta, Ga., and I applaud these
men for making this run to carry the important message that traumatic
brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are serious
issues facing our veterans today.
The Shepherds Men started their 911-mile run on April 19, 2015, to
raise awareness for the SHARE Military Initiative, a rehabilitation
program at Shepherd Center that helps veterans who have sustained TBI
and PTSD.
Patriot Award
Yesterday, I was humbled to receive the Patriot Award
presented by the Employer Support of the
Guard and Reserve office within the U.S. Department of Defense.
The Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve office was established in
1972 to promote cooperation and understanding between Reserve Component
Service members and their civilian employers and to assist in the
resolution of conflicts arising from an employees military commitment.
I was honored to be nominated for this award by 2LT Tommy Nguyen of the
Georgia Army National Guard, who is a member of my staff.
Passing of Longtime Georgia Veterans Service Commissioner Pete Wheeler
I was saddened to learn of the passing of Pete Wheeler this week. Pete
Wheeler dedicated a lifetime of service to our state and nation and his
fellow veterans. As commissioner of the Georgia Department of Veterans
Service from 1954-2015, he made tremendous strides in modernizing and
advancing services to benefit Georgias veterans and their families.
Pete will be deeply missed by all Georgians and the millions of
veterans across the country who have benefitted from his immeasurable
contribution and courageous leadership.
Whats on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will continue debate on Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act of 2015.

Johnny Isakson

Dear
Friends,
On
Wednesday,
the
Senate
finally
took
steps
to
end
modern
slavery
through
the
passage
of the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
by
a
vote
of
99-0.
I am
both
pleased
and
relieved
that
the
Senate
has
passed
this
important
legislation
that
will
provide
help
for
these
oppressed
victims.
I
hope
we
can
quickly
reconcile
the
differences
between
the
House-passed
bill
and
the
Senate-passed
bill
and
send
a
final
bill
to
the
president&#146;s
desk
to
be
signed
into
law.
This
legislation
establishes
the
&#147;Domestic
Victims
Trafficking
Fund&#148;&#151;
a
private,
non-profit
grant-making
institution,
which
would
fund
programs
outside
the
United
States
that
will
help
victims
recover,
prevent
trafficking,
and
enforce
laws
to
punish
individual
and
corporate
offenders
of
modern
slavery.
VA
Committee
Seeks
Answers
Today,
I
held
a
Senate
Veterans&#146;
Affairs
Committee
field
hearing
regarding
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
construction
of
a
new
medical
center
in
Denver,
Colo.
Our
hearing
addressed
the
mismanagement
of
the
construction
of
a
new
hospital
being
built
to
replace
the
Denver
VA
Medical
Center.
The
ongoing
project&#146;s
cost
has
climbed
to
$1.7
billion,
which
is
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
over
budget
and
makes
this
project
the
most
expensive
hospital
construction
in
the
VA&#146;s
history.
The
committee
made
it
very
clear
at
today&#146;s
hearing
that
we
expect
a
full
report
from
the
VA
about
its
plans
to
address
the
unacceptable
surge
in
costs,
delays
and
mismanagement
of
the
construction
at
the
replacement
Denver
VA
Medical
Center.
We
also
expect
VA
Secretary
Bob
McDonald
and
the
VA
to
hold
accountable
those
responsible
for
this
gross
mismanagement
that
led
to
the
waste
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
taxpayer
dollars
and
to
see
to
it
that
necessary
steps
are
taken
to
prevent
further
waste
in
Denver
or
at
any
future
VA
construction
project.
Time
to
Repeal
Obamacare
Since
the
day
Obamacare
was
signed
into
law,
I
have
fought
to
repeal
this
terrible
legislation.
This
week,
I
co-sponsored
the
Preserving
Freedom
and
Choice
in
Health
Care
Act
that
would
help
Americans
who
are
negatively
impacted
by
Obamacare.
This
legislation
is
crucial
in
the
event
that
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
rules
in
the
case
known
as
King
v.
Burwell
that
patients
enrolled
in
the
federal
exchange
are
not
eligible
for
tax
credits.
It
would
allow
anyone
who
would
lose
their
tax
credits
to
continue
receiving
the
subsidy
through
August
2017
for
any
offered
health
plan
of
their
choice.
Also,
states
would
have
the
freedom
and
flexibility
to
develop
alternatives
that
protect
Americans
from
the
harmful
effects
of
Obamacare.
This
bill
also
repeals
the
individual
and
employer
mandates
and
allows
health
care
plans
that
would
have
been
canceled
by
Obamacare
restrictions,
to
continue
through
2017.
Loretta
Lynch
Yesterday,
I
voted
against
the
president&#146;s
nomination
of
Loretta
Lynch
as
the
next
United
States
Attorney
General.
Since
her
nomination,
I
have
been
very
concerned
about
her
acceptance
of
President
Obama&#146;s
amnesty
proposal
and
her
approval
of
Eric
Holder's
record
to
undermine
the
Second
Amendment.
Our
country
needs
an
attorney
general
who
will
uphold
the
Constitution
and
not
seek
to
pick
and
choose
which
laws
to
enforce.
Congressional
Gold
Medal
Presentation
I
am
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
present
to
Amelia
Jones
of
Savannah,
Ga.,
a
Congressional
Gold
Medal
for
her
service
with
the
Tuskegee
Airmen
during
World
War
II.
Our
nation
is
indebted
to
her,
and
it
is
because
of
the
sacrifices
of
our
nation&#146;s
veterans
that
future
generations
will
continue
to
live
in
freedom.
Serving
Our
Women
Veterans
This
week,
I
called
on
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
strengthen
its
programs
and
health
care
for
women
veterans.
Women
continue
to
play
an
important
role
in
our
national
security,
and
we
must
ensure
that
our
women
veterans
are
able
to
receive
the
same
services
that
women
expect
in
the
private
sector.

It
was

the
Shepherd&#146;s
Men
runners
who
stopped
in
the
nation&#146;s
capital
on
their
911-mile

from
the
Freedom

and
I

these

for
making
this

to
carry
the
important
message
that
traumatic
brain

(TBI)
and
posttraumatic

(PTSD)
are

The

2015,
to
raise
awareness
for
