Examining Ways to Protect VA
Whistleblowers
7/8/14
This evening at 5:30pm MT/ 7:30pm ET,
Congressman Doug Lamborn will be taking part in a House Veterans Affairs
Committee Hearing discussing and examining how the VA Department handles
the complaints and actions of whistleblowers. These brave men and
women have stepped forward to reveal very disturbing information on the
VA system. It is important that their efforts are protected and that
they are not punished for speaking
out.
Information from the House Veterans Affairs
Committee
According to
the Office of Special Counsel, a federal whistleblower protection
agency, VA whistleblower complaints represent more than a quarter of all
such matters across the federal government being investigated by
agency. The OSC is currently investigating more than 50 VA whistleblower
complaints and has sharply criticized VAs Office of the Medical
Inspector for repeatedly undermining whistleblowers by downplaying their
concerns.
This hearing will examine the systemic problems identified by
whistleblowers and look at VAs failure to safeguard them from
retribution. Additionally, the hearing will explore the steps VA is taking to
correct these problems and hold employees who have engaged in
whistleblower retaliation
accountable.
The following event is open to the
press:
