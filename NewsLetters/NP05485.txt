Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Whether it has
touched the lives of family members or friends, breast cancer has affected
us all in some way. Breast cancer takes a devastating toll on Nevadas
women, with approximately 1,770 women diagnosed in our state in 2013
alone. That is why I have worked to provide doctors, scientists,
cancer advocates and survivors with the tools they need to fight this
devastating disease.
Our best hope in the fight against breast
cancer still rests with early detection of the disease. Unfortunately,
many women did not have access to important screening tools like
mammograms. To ensure women in Nevada and throughout the U.S. can access
the tools they need to stay healthy, the health reform law increases
access to preventive measures and prevents insurance companies from
discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, such as breast
cancer.
Before the health reform law was enacted, more than
half of women throughout the U.S. delayed receiving important care
because of cost. Under the Affordable Care Act, since August 2012, all
new plans are required to provide coverage of preventive health care
services, including mammograms, without imposing out-of-pocket costs like
copayments or deductibles. Approximately 222,000 women in Nevada now
have access to free preventive services like mammograms as a result of
this provision of the health reform law. Removing cost-sharing
requirements encourages more women to seek preventive services and will aid
in early breast cancer detection and treatment efforts. The Education
and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act, known as the EARLY Act, was
also included in the Affordable Care Act to improve education and
awareness of breast cancer among young women, particularly those in
heightened risk groups. I support continuing the important work this
program has established.
I also authored the Breast Cancer
Environmental Research Act, which is now law. This legislation boosted
research and developed a national strategy to study the role of the
environment in the development of breast cancer. Last year, the Interagency
Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Coordinating Committee
established by this law released their recommendations to identify and
prevent the environmental causes of breast cancer. I am proud that, as a
direct result of this legislation, we are seeing meaningful action to
improve our knowledge of this disease.
I have also supported
funding for prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control,
like the Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, known as
Womens Health Connection in Nevada, as well as crucial research programs
at the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense
Breast Cancer Research Program, a program that seeks to eradicate breast
cancer through innovative, high-impact research.
We have
fundamentally changed the way women who risk being diagnosed with
breast cancer are covered by their health insurance since the health reform
law was enacted. I will continue working to build on this effort to
provide funding for research and programs that make a difference in
detecting and treating breast cancer. In a country as great as ours, no
one should be forced to struggle without medical coverage because of an
illness that could have been detected and treated.
