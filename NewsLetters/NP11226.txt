Dear Friend,
The deadline to enroll in health coverage for 2014 in the Tennessee
Marketplace
is just 10 days away and I will be hosting a telephone town hall
on Monday evening. Keep reading to learn about what happened this week
and how you can get covered.

Join My Telephone Town Hall on Monday, March 24th
On Monday evening at 6:25PM CT I will host a telephone town hall to
answer your questions and discuss a variety of topics including what
Memphians can do to better take advantage of the Affordable Care Act
before this year's enrollment deadline on March 31st. If you would like
to participate in this telephone town hall on Monday, March 24th,
please fill out the form here
with your home phone
number - unfortunately, we are unable to call cell phones.
Don't Forget to Get Covered by March 31st
The open season deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year is
March 31st-just 10 days away. All Memphians should have quality health
insurance and the President's landmark Affordable Care Act is making
affordable, high-quality coverage available to millions of Americans.
Thanks to the law, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage
in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. And luckily, if you do not have health
insurance coverage, you may also be eligible to save money on your
health care premiums
in the Marketplace-but you have to act in the next 10 days to
take advantage of the savings this year.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341.
You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the Marketplace
Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a
coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans
who needs health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
If you have trouble accessing the website or prefer not to enroll
online, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace Hotline at 1
(800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act "Navigators" at
Seedco's Mid-South office for in-person assistance. Their office is
located at 22 North Front Street, Suite 900. Seedco can be reached by
phone at (901) 528-8341 as well, and if you have any other questions,
you should also feel free to call my office at (901) 544-4131.
Helping Memphis Ministers Get the Word Out about the Affordable Care Act
This morning, I hosted a meeting with Memphis-area ministers to discuss
what can be done to reduce the racial disparity in Memphis breast
cancer outcomes and how they can help their congregations and their
communities get health insurance coverage by the March 31st open season
enrollment deadline. Acacia Bamberg Salatti, the Acting Director of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Faith-Based
and Neighborhood Partnerships, also joined us at my meeting.
We also discussed how one of the vital parts of the Affordable Care Act
was expanding Medicaid, but Governor Haslam has decided not to take
advantage of this expansion. That has left thousands of Memphians
without insurance-more than 30,000, or about 30% of uninsured adults in
the area, according to the Urban Institute. The Governor is costing the
state money and countless people their lives. I hope he'll make the
right decision and expand Medicaid. As I have expressed personally to
him, I will be happy to work together to make that happen.
Also, please don't forget that-for the next 10 days-you can still
enroll online at HealthCare.gov
or by calling the 24-hour hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596.
Protecting the HOPE Scholarship for Tennessee Students
This week, Governor Haslam continued to push his ill-advised "Tennessee
Promise" plan - a plan that siphons $300 million from HOPE Scholarships
- through the General Assembly without allowing adequate time for
public consideration and comment.
When the HOPE Scholarship program was created, it was only after the
Tennessee General Assembly heard testimony and recommendations from
educators and fiscal experts. Legislators in the House and the Senate
should be very careful with any plan that dismantles one of the most
prominent and successful programs that the General Assembly has ever
created. Before moving forward, the Governor's 'Tennessee Promise'
program needs to go to a study committee that hears from the experts.
Since its creation, the HOPE Scholarship's value has diminished as
tuition has increased-and this plan will cut the scholarships even
further. All future lottery revenue gains will flow to the Governor's
free-tuition, no-standards community college program, and the HOPE
Scholarship will fade into irrelevance when it should be growing to
match the rising costs of attending college. This is especially true
when we need to be doing everything we can to decrease the student loan
debt burden on young adults.
It is wrong to cut lottery scholarships to create a massive new
government program, and it is wrong to siphon $300 million meant to
strengthen HOPE Scholarships for the governor's pet project. Doing so
will sentence HOPE Scholarships to a slow and certain death. Any
changes to lottery scholarships should be based on expert
recommendations and evidence-not politics.
Over the weekend, I wrote a column in the Tennessean about why the
"Promise" should be studied further-you can read it here
. When the experts have weighed in, I am confident that the
General Assembly will find that the best use of these funds would be to
strengthen HOPE by extending more benefits to middle-class and
low-income students and keeping them here in Tennessee.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Refunds They Deserve
April 15th - the deadline to file your 2013 federal tax return - is
just a few weeks away. As you prepare your return, I hope you won't
overlook the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if you are eligible for
it. It is an important credit that can give families a financial boost.
But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby County have
not taken full advantage of the program. Last year alone, as much as
$70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by area
taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. This year, I helped open one of 15
new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites that are now operating
throughout Shelby County.
The VITA sites are available to provide tax
return guidance and advice free of charge to ensure that Memphians take
full advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. A list of all VITA locations and their hours is
available here
, and I encourage you to find one near you to help ensure you get
every penny you are owed.
Meeting with Young Memphis Professionals
I had the opportunity this week to meet with young Memphians at my
Young Professionals Roundtable. I was glad to have the opportunity to
hear their perspectives about the challenges facing our city and our
nation including how we can work to reduce the racial disparity in
breast cancer outcomes, reform our nation's outdated criminal drug laws
that arrest four times as many African Americans as Caucasians, protect
the HOPE Scholarship for students as well as otherwise address mounting
student loan debt, and several other issues.
Reducing Homelessness in Memphis
Yesterday, I joined several local officials including Mayor A C Wharton
and Community Alliance for the Homeless Executive Director Katie
Kitchin in highlighting two consecutive years of Memphis-area
homelessness drops. According to the Alliance's annual "Point In Time"
survey, homelessness in Shelby County is down 21% overall since 2012,
while family homelessness also dropped 30% and chronic homelessness
fell by 39% over the last two years.
This is good news for our city and it marks a major step forward in
proving that we are committed to reducing homelessness. A country as
wealthy as ours should care for those who are less fortunate. Although
we are still recovering from the Great Recession, we must continue to
focus substantial resources towards eliminating homelessness and do all
that we can to provide adequate shelter for those who need it. Most of
the programs that help in the fight to reduce homelessness in Shelby
County are almost entirely funded by federal dollars, and I will
continue to support legislation and funding to assist those who are
less fortunate.
Improving Trade and Passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform
This week, I spoke at the National Hispanic Professional Organization's
monthly meeting about the need to pass comprehensive immigration reform
and increase trade with Mexico and South American nations. They are
important trading partners for our country and I will continue doing
all that I can to improve trade relations with them to help our economy.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding any
property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along to
your friends and family as well!
VA Rolls Out Secure Veteran Health ID Cards
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced the phased
roll out of newly designed, more secure Veteran Health Identification
Cards. The new cards are distinguished by additional security features
and will have a different look and feel.
Similar to a typical health insurance card, the VHIC displays the
veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as a Plan ID,
reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. The card
replaces the Veteran Identification Card (VIC), which was introduced in
2004. As part of a phased rollout, the card will only be offered to
newly enrolled and other veterans who have not been issued a VIC. In
early April, the VA will begin a three month effort to automatically
issue the more secure VHIC to current VIC cardholders. The VA
recommends veterans safeguard their VIC as they would a credit card,
and cut up or shred the card once it is replaced. While not required to
receive VA health care, all enrolled Veterans are encouraged to get a
VHIC.
Enrolled veterans can get more information about the VHIC by visiting
their VA medical facility enrollment coordinator or the website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their
local VA health care facility. Veterans who are not enrolled in the VA
health care system can apply for enrollment at any time by visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their local
VA health care facility.
As always, I remain.

Helping
Memphis
Ministers
Get
the
Word
Out
about
the
Affordable
Care
Act
This
morning,
I
hosted
a
meeting
with
Memphis-area
ministers
to
discuss
what
can
be
done
to
reduce
the
racial
disparity
in
Memphis
breast
cancer
outcomes
and
how
they
can
help
their
congregations
and
their
communities
get
health
insurance
coverage by
the
March
31 st
open
season
enrollment
deadline.
Acacia
Bamberg
Salatti,
the
Acting
Director
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services&#8217;
Center
for
Faith-Based
and
Neighborhood
Partnerships,
also
joined
us
at
my
meeting.
We
also
discussed
how
one
of
the
vital
parts
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
was
expanding
Medicaid,
but
Governor
Haslam
has
decided
not
to
take
advantage
of
this
expansion.
That
has
left
thousands
of
Memphians
without
insurance&#8212;more
than
30,000,
or
about
30%
of
uninsured
adults
in
the
area,
according
to
the
Urban
Institute.
The
Governor
is
costing
the
state
money
and
countless
people
their
lives.
I
hope
he&#8217;ll
make
the
right
decision
and
expand
Medicaid.
As
I
have
expressed
personally
to
him,
I
will
be
happy
to
work
together
to
make
that
happen.
Also,
please
don&#8217;t
forget
that&#8212;for
the
next
10
days&#8212;you
can
still
enroll
online
at
HealthCare.gov
or
by
calling
the
24-hour
hotline
at
1
(800)
318-2596.
Protecting
the
HOPE
Scholarship
for
Tennessee
Students
This
week,
Governor
Haslam
continued
to
push
his
ill-advised
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
plan
&#8211;
a
plan
that
siphons
$300
million
from
HOPE
Scholarships
&#8211;
through
the
General
Assembly
without
allowing
adequate
time
for
public
consideration
and
comment.
When
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
was
created,
it
was
only
after
the
Tennessee
General
Assembly
heard
testimony
and
recommendations
from
educators
and
fiscal
experts.
Legislators
in
the
House
and
the
Senate
should
be
very
careful
with
any
plan
that
dismantles
one
of
the
most
prominent
and
successful
programs
that
the
General
Assembly
has
ever
created.
Before
moving
forward,
the
Governor&#8217;s
&#8216;Tennessee
Promise&#8217;
program
needs
to
go
to
a
study
committee
that
hears
from
the
experts.
Since
its
creation,
the
HOPE
Scholarship&#8217;s
value
has
diminished
as
tuition
has
increased&#8212;and
this
plan
will
cut
the
scholarships
even
further.
All
future
lottery
revenue
gains
will
flow
to
the
Governor&#8217;s
free-tuition,
no-standards
community
college
program,
and
the
HOPE
Scholarship
will
fade
into
irrelevance
when
it
should
be
growing
to
match
the
rising
costs
of
attending
college.
This
is
especially
true
when
we
need
to
be
doing
everything
we
can
to
decrease
the
student
loan
debt
burden
on
young
adults.
It
is
wrong
to
cut
lottery
scholarships
to
create
a
massive
new
government
program,
and
it
is
wrong
to
siphon
$300
million
meant
to
strengthen
HOPE
Scholarships
for
the
governor&#8217;s
pet
project.
Doing
so
will
sentence
HOPE
Scholarships
to
a
slow
and
certain
death.
Any
changes
to
lottery
scholarships
should
be
based
on
expert
recommendations
and
evidence&#8212;not
politics.
Over
the
weekend,
I
wrote
a
column
in
the
Tennessean
about
why
the
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
should
be
studied
further&#8212;you
can
read
it
here .
When
the
experts
have
weighed
in,
I
am
confident
that
the
General
Assembly
will
find
that
the
best
use
of
these
funds
would
be
to
strengthen
HOPE
by
extending
more
benefits
to
middle-class
and
low-income
students
and
keeping
them
here
in
Tennessee.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Refunds
They
Deserve
April
15th
&#8211;
the
deadline
to
file
your
2013
federal
tax
return
&#8211;
is
just
a
few
weeks
away.
As
you
prepare
your
return,
I
hope
you
won&#8217;t
overlook
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
if
you
are
eligible
for
it.
It
is
an
important
credit
that
can
give
families
a
financial
boost.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program.
Last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
This
year,
I
helped
open
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
are
now
operating
throughout
Shelby
County.
The
VITA
sites
are
available
to
provide
tax
return
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
Memphians
take
full
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
A
list
of
all
VITA
locations
and
their
hours
is
available
here ,
and
I
encourage
you
to
find
one
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.

with
Young
Memphis
Professionals
I
had
the
opportunity
this
week
to
meet
with
young
Memphians
at
my
Young

Roundtable.
I
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
their
perspectives
about
the
challenges
facing
our
city
and
our
nation
including
how
we
can

outcomes,
reform
our
nation&#8217;s
outdated
criminal

Yesterday,
I
joined
several
local
officials
including
Mayor
A
C
Wharton
and
Community
Alliance
for
the
Homeless
Executive
Director
Katie
Kitchin
in
highlighting
two
consecutive
years
of
Memphis-area
homelessness
drops.
According
to
the
Alliance&#8217;s
annual
&#8220;Point
In
Time&#8221;
survey,
homelessness
in
Shelby
County
is
down
21%
overall
since
2012,
while
family
homelessness
also
dropped
30%
and
chronic
homelessness
fell
by
39%
over
the
last
two
years.
This
is
good
news
for
our
city
and
it
marks
a
major
step
forward
in
proving
that
we
are
committed
to
reducing
homelessness.
A
country
as
wealthy
as
ours
should
care
for
those
who
are
less
fortunate.
Although
we
are
still
recovering
from
the
Great
Recession,
we
must
continue
to
focus
substantial
resources
towards
eliminating
homelessness
and
do
all
that
we
can
to
provide
adequate
shelter
for
those
who
need
it.
Most
of
the
programs
that
help
in
the
fight
to
reduce
homelessness
in
Shelby
County
are
almost
entirely
funded
by
federal
dollars,
and
I
will
continue
to
support
legislation
and
funding
to
assist
those
who
are
less
fortunate.
Improving
Trade
and
Passing
Comprehensive
Immigration
Reform
This
week,
I
spoke
at
the
National
Hispanic
Professional
Organization&#8217;s
monthly
meeting
about
the
need
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
increase
trade
with
Mexico
and
South
American
nations.
They
are
important
trading
partners
for
our
country
and
I
will
continue
doing
all
that
I
can
to
improve
trade
relations
with
them
to
help
our
economy.

VA
Rolls
Out
Secure
Veteran
Health
ID
Cards
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
recently
announced
the
phased
roll
out
of
newly
designed,
more
secure
Veteran
Health
Identification
Cards.
The
new
cards
are
distinguished
by
additional
security
features
and
will
have
a
different
look
and
feel.
Similar
to
a
typical
health
insurance
card,
the
VHIC
displays
the
veteran&#8217;s
Member
ID,
a
new
unique
identifier,
as
well
as
a
Plan
ID,
reflecting
the
veteran&#8217;s
enrollment
in
VA
health
care.
The
card
replaces
the
Veteran
Identification
Card
(VIC),
which
was
introduced
in
2004.
As
part
of
a
phased
rollout,
the
card
will
only
be
offered
to
newly
enrolled
and
other
veterans
who
have
not
been
issued
a
VIC.
In
early
April,
the
VA
will
begin
a
three
month
effort
to
automatically
issue
the
more
secure
VHIC
to
current
VIC
cardholders.
The
VA
recommends
veterans
safeguard
their
VIC
as
they
would
a
credit
card,
and
cut
up
or
shred
the
card
once
it
is
replaced.
While
not
required
to
receive
VA
health
care,
all
enrolled
Veterans
are
encouraged
to
get
a
VHIC.
Enrolled
veterans
can
get
more
information
about
the
VHIC
by
visiting
their
VA
medical
facility
enrollment
coordinator
or
the
website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Veterans
who
are
not
enrolled
in
the
VA
health
care
system
can
apply
for
enrollment
at
any
time
by
visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
As
always,
I
remain.

sincerely,
