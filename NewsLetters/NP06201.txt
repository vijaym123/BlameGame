David, I wasn&rsquo;t planning on emailing you tonight.
But I just turned on the TV and guess what I saw: Bobby Schilling&rsquo;s brand new ad. The one USA Today calls &ldquo;shamefully misleading.&rdquo;
We already knew Mr. Schilling was desperate to return to Congress. But downright lying?
It&rsquo;s
pathetic.
If you agree, I need your help. Please chip in on my website: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
