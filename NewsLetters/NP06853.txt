Over the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to travel across
our state and meet with Ohioans from all walks of life, from veterans
to teachers to business owners, workers, farmers and families. They
told me about the problems they are facing in their lives and we talked
about some of the things Washington should be doing-by helping create a
better environment for job growth, through tax reform, smarter
regulations, and worker retraining-and by playing a more constructive
role with local and state government.
I saw an example of that in Toledo early in August where there was a
water crisis; a drinking water ban for nearly 500,000 people resulting
from toxins caused by harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie. This is a
serious issue in the Great Lakes and many other freshwater lakes and
reservoirs in Ohio and one I've been working on since my election to
the Senate. I recently authored the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia
Research and Control Amendments Act of 2013
, which improves the coordination and
partnership between the federal agencies like the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency and
local and state entities. Even in this time of divided government and
gridlock, I was able to guide this legislation through the Senate and
the House, and in June, President Obama signed it into law. For the
first time ever, this legislation ensures federal agencies prioritize
research, monitoring, and mitigation efforts of harmful algal blooms in
fresh water bodies such as Lake Erie.
I am hopeful that my legislation will help to ensure that events like
the one we saw in Toledo can become a thing of the past. Of course, for
folks who were out of water during the recent crisis, they needed help
immediately. So we loaded my pickup with bottled water from Canton
where I was at other meetings, and headed to Toledo. When we arrived, I
was moved by the hundreds of Red Cross and other volunteers who were
doing what they could, no matter how small, for their friends and
neighbors.
I have also had the chance to visit with workers and management at some
of our great manufacturers in Ohio. Over the past few weeks, I've held
townhalls with employees from companies around our state, including
Navistar, Honda, and Arcelor Mittal Steel. At each one, I heard a
similar message. Ohio workers can compete with anyone, anywhere on a
level playing field. What they need from Washington is better
representation on the world stage and less red tape from DC. That means
opening up new markets to our goods. When products stamped Made in
America are sold in stores from Beijing to Berlin, American workers
benefit. We also need to make sure that the regulations Washington is
imposing are worth their costs. I have introduced bipartisan
legislation that would require a more comprehensive cost-benefit
analysis of proposed new rules to ensure that the federal government
doesn't hold back job creators.
Lastly, I had the distinct privilege recently of honoring fifteen
airmen, sailors, and soldiers who served in conflicts ranging from
World War I to the Vietnam War as they finally received the military
funeral they had earned. I joined members of the Missing in America
Project-an organization dedicated to ensuring that veterans whose
remains remain unclaimed receive a proper burial-at a ceremony at the
Dayton National Cemetery to ensure these brave men are never forgotten.
To help with this cause, I have introduced the Honor Those Who Served
Act of 2014
, which would
expand the definition of persons eligible to request headstones or
markers furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs for unmarked
graves for our nation's veterans.
As a state and a nation, we face challenges. But in my role as your
United States senator, I am fortunate to see examples, every day, of
Ohioans who are facing those challenges and making the world a better
place. I will continue to do my part to ensure that the federal
government is an ally, rather than a stumbling block, in their efforts.

Went out on the Ohio River with the U.S. Coast Guard for an update on
next steps for the continued cleanup efforts after last week's diesel
fuel spill.
Attended a moving ceremony to honor fifteen previously unknown veterans
at Dayton National Cemetery. Their remains were identified through the
Missing in America Project. I was honored to thank those who helped
pass the MIA bill which is now law and for their efforts on my new bill
to obtain headstones for veterans.
Visited Navistar International's Springfield Assembly Plant for a tour
and townhall meeting with the impressive workforce.
Visited the Ohio State Fair to thank so many of our state's farmers.
Agriculture is Ohio's number one business, contributing $107 billion to
Ohio's economy.
Saw Honda's assembly plant in East Liberty. It's always inspiring to
meet with workers and see Ohio's manufacturing strength.
Toured Akron Children's Hospital to talk about my bill that just passed
the U.S. Senate
that
broadens federal support for trauma care and helps the nationally
renowned burn unit there. One highlight from the visit was meeting
Lysander from Salem, Ohio who was born premature but is now doing great
thanks to the team there.
Stopped by the historic Weldon's Ice Cream Factory with Jane in
Millersport.
Held a roundtable at Buckeye Lake Marina in Millersport to discuss my
bill that was recently signed into law to combat harmful algal blooms.

Over

This
is
a

Ohio
and
one
I&#8217;ve

since
my

I

Even

I

the

and
in

For

this

federal

of
harmful

as
Lake

I
am
hopeful
that
my
legislation
will
help
to
ensure
that
events
like
the
one
we
saw
in
Toledo
can
become
a

Of

for
folks
who

they
needed

So we

I

That

When

American

We
also
need
to

a
more

Lastly,
I

I

ensuring
that
veterans
whose

remain
unclaimed
receive
a
proper
burial&#8212;at
a
ceremony
at
the
Dayton

to
ensure
these
brave
men
are
never

To

I

As

I
am
fortunate

every

I

rather
