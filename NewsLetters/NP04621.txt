We just defeated Republican Congressman Steve Southerland!!!
You might remember Steve Southerland as the guy who opposed the Violence Against Women Act (then tried to trick voters into believing he supported it).
Or maybe you remember Congressman Southerland for holding an all-male fundraiser where the invite actually said, &ldquo;Tell the Misses not to wait up [&hellip;] because the after dinner whiskey and cigars will be smooth &amp; the issues to discuss are many.&rdquo;
Either way we&rsquo;ve defeated Congressman Southerland and replaced him with a strong Democratic woman -- Gwen Graham.
We couldn&rsquo;t be prouder!
Now, it&rsquo;s time to get back to work. Polls are still open in California, so we&rsquo;re making calls reminding voters to get out to the polls. Will you join us?
