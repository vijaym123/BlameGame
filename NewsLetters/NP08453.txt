Stopping Unparalleled Waste in Afghanistan
Click the image above to watch the U.S. House of Representatives adopt
my amendment to prohibit funding for all military and civilian
construction projects in Afghanistan.
Dear Friend,
Continued U.S. funding for military and civilian construction projects
in Afghanistan would be a prescription for unparalleled waste of
taxpayer money, and I'm proud to tell you that last week the House
passed my bipartisan amendment to put a stop to it.
The amendment is included in the $570 billion defense appropriations
bill (H.R.4870) the House approved on Friday, and it's simple. Funding
for all military and civilian infrastructure projects in Afghanistan is
prohibited.
As a result, U.S. taxpayer funds that would almost certainly have ended
up in the hands of criminals, warlords, and corrupt officials cannot
and will not be spent - period.
As I told my colleagues in a speech late Wednesday night on the House
floor, the cash keeps disappearing, while the projects go uncompleted.
We have already spent tens of billions of dollars on reconstruction
projects in Afghanistan, and the Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) and his 225 investigators are unable
to account for where most of the money has ended up.
Why? Because Afghanistan is one of the most corrupt nations in the
world. Since traditional banking services do not exist in most of the
country, construction projects are financed, quite literally, with
truckloads of American cash. As our troops withdraw from Afghanistan,
more and more of the country is outside the areas in which U.S.
personnel can travel and operate safely - and there is no way to
properly audit or inspect these projects. So it's time to put an end to
so-called "Afghanistan reconstruction" and use that money to rebuild
America - our highways, bridges, harbors, schools, and other
infrastructure - creating good middle-class jobs and opportunities, and
laying the groundwork for even more business and economic growth in the
future.
In addition to passing my amendment to cut off construction funds for
Afghanistan, the House also passed a bipartisan amendment I cosponsored
to prohibit the sale or distribution of shoulder-fired missiles to the
rebel factions in Syria. These terribly dangerous weapons would only
worsen a conflict in which we have no friends - and very probably end
up being used against America.
Finally, I also supported an amendment authored by Rep. Barbara Lee
(D-CA) that would have prohibited any U.S. combat troops in Iraq. Since
the House Majority voted down that amendment, I have introduced a
similar measure as a standalone bill. More on that soon.
I'll keep you posted as the defense appropriations bill moves through
the Senate to the President's desk. Have a good week.
Sincerely,
_____
The Defense Appropriations Act in a Nutshell
The Positive:
. Includes the Nolan amendment to cut off military and civilian
reconstruction funds to Afghanistan.
. Bans the transfer of hand-held missiles to combatants in
Syria, a Nolan cosponsored amendment.
. Provides additional funding for the National Guard, including
vital equipment and maintenance, including an amendment I supported for
maintaining the A-10 "Warthog" combat support aircraft.
. Prohibits NSA and other agencies from searching government
databases for information on U.S. citizens without a warrant.
. Provides a pay raise for our troops and 100% of troop housing
allowance, providing relief for service members with young families.
. Strengthens health care services for our troops and their
families - including increased resources for traumatic brain injuries
and suicide prevention.
. Fully funds the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and
Response program.
. Retains important "Buy America" provisions for defense
procurement.
The Negative:
. Fails to include our amendment to prohibit new U.S. military
intervention in Iraq.
. Prevents transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to
countries of origin or any other foreign country willing to accept them.
. Fails to include a provision to allow for the closing of
military installations the Pentagon considers unnecessary.
. Provides for an increase in defense spending of $4.1 billion
overall, which is $202 million above the President's request.

Continuing to Battle Rising Waters
Helping local volunteers and officials sandbag in advance of the
rapidly-rising Rainy River in the borderland.
As flooding continues across northern and southwestern Minnesota, I'm
working closely with Governor Dayton and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al
Franken to secure assistance from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). Governor Dayton's State of Emergency declaration last
week in 35 Minnesota counties automatically triggers this initial
request for federal help, and also makes a wide range of state
resources available - including the 100 Minnesota National Guard
soldiers the Governor sent to Koochiching County last week to help in
storm affected areas.
Meanwhile, I cancelled my regular schedule last Monday and headed for
International Falls to see the situation for myself, meet with local
officials, volunteers, business people, and homeowners to draw
attention to this rapidly developing crisis in our region. What I
witnessed was considerable damage to private housing and property,
public infrastructure, and business and commercial facilities - but
what I saw and experienced from the community was inspiring. People of
all ages and walks of life pitching in to fill and stack sandbags,
prepare and deliver meals, move precious possessions to higher ground -
people encouraging and helping one another in that "Minnesota way" we
all know so well.
Of course I'll keep you posted as events develop. Thankfully, the
weather forecasts are calling for drier weather this week.

A Big Fix for the "Big Dip"
During my flood tour last Monday, Lake Kabetogama area residents
brought to my attention a massive, washed out pothole they call "the
Big Dip" on Highway 53, which links Duluth, the Range, and
International Falls. Commuters, loggers, tourists, cyclists, and
pedestrians have been complaining about this crater (located between
International Falls and Orr) for five years, with no action from the
Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). That "roadblock"
literally ended last week when I brought the matter up with Minnesota
Department of Transportation Commissioner Charlie Zelle during a
meeting in my Washington office. As I told Commissioner Zelle, five
years is far too long to wait for road repair. He agreed - and saw to
it that the dip got an immediate tar hole filling. This is a chronic
problem in this stretch of road, however, and while we're pleased with
the temporary fix, I've asked Commissioner Zelle to look into a longer
term solution.
_____
Stop the Foreign Steel Dump!
Enough is enough. We need to enforce the law and put an end to Korea's
illegal dumping of steel pipeline into the U.S. market - a trade crime
that's taking our jobs, undercutting our price and stalling our
economy. In fact, this Korean steel dump has already led to reduced
hours at three American steel manufacturing facilities, and the closing
of another.
That was the message 150 of us - Democratic and Republican members of
the Congressional Steel Caucus - recently conveyed in no uncertain
terms to Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker as Korea continues to
dump steel pipeline into the U.S. market at unprecedented rates -
800,000 metric tons last year alone. Read our letter here
.
Korea's not the only culprit. Taken together, foreign imports of steel
pipeline from China, Russia, India, and Korea have more than doubled
since 2010 - an additional $2 billion worth of cheap, subsidized, often
poor quality steel and steel pipeline dumped into our market.
If this trend continues, the experts tell us we're going to lose 12
domestic steel mills, and some 50,000 good middle class jobs across our
nation in the not too distant future.
That's why I've introduced my American Pipeline and Jobs Safety Act of
2014 to require that virtually all pipelines built and federally
permitted in the United States contain 100% American iron ore and
steel, processed or reprocessed right here in America. Read more about
my bill here
.
Make no mistake. We must change our tax and trade policies to encourage
- and require - that American iron ore and steel - mined and produced
by American workers be used to build and rebuild America here in the
21st Century.
Nothing else is good enough. Nothing else will do.

Our Week in Pictures
Visited with some truly brilliant students from Minnesota's Eighth
District, in town to compete in the National History Day competition!
My special Capitol Tour took these visitors from the 8th District to
important and historic places inside the U.S. Capitol they wouldn't see
during the regular guided tour most tourists receive. Here we are in
one of the meeting rooms just down the hall from the House Floor.
The great student delegates of Minnesota Rural Electric's Annual Youth
Tour stopped by my D.C. office last week. Proud to say that Minnesota's
Eighth District was well represented, including students from Little
Falls, Milaca, Hillman, Two Harbors, Grand Rapids, Nevis, Aitkin,
Pequot Lakes, Sebeka, and Bemidji.

how current and future EDA programs can best address the economic
development needs and priorities of Minnesota's Eighth District.
.
Join my colleagues on the Livestock, Rural Development, and
Credit Subcommittee on Agriculture to review how best we can make
credit available for rural farmers, which includes measures I'm working
on as part of H.R.1727, the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity
Act, to help those farmers and ranchers who are just starting out.
.
Join the House in considering H.R.4413, the Customer
Protection and End User Relief Act, to reauthorize the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to ensure farmers, ranchers, and end
users have the certainty and stability they need to keep costs low for
their customers.

Finally...
Saving Our Pollinators
A friendly helper points to ways we can help save our pollinators in
our home gardens at a recent "Saving Our Pollinators" event at the U.S.
Capitol, held in collaboration with the USDA, the U.S. Department of
the Interior, and the Congressional Pollinator Protection Caucus (CP2C).
Honeybees are crucial to the world's ability to produce nutritious
food, but disease, pesticides, and habitat loss are causing them to
disappear at an alarming and dangerous rate. In fact, the number of
managed U.S. honey bee colonies has dropped from 6 million in 1947 to
just 2.5 million today. So as a cosponsor and supporter of multiple
measures to address the disappearance of honey bees across our land,
I'm delighted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has decided to
provide an additional $8 million in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
incentives to farmers and ranchers in Minnesota, Michigan, North and
South Dakota, and Wisconsin who establish new habitats for declining
honey bee populations. The program allows for managing or replacing
existing vegetation known as cover crops, with lower cost,
high-nutrition seed mixes that can support the blooming cycles of
plants that benefit pollinators. This is one of a series of important
and welcome steps the Administration is taking to pursue solutions to
the multiple problems affecting honey bee health.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Stopping
Unparalleled
Waste
in
Afghanistan
Click
the
image
above
to
watch
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
adopt
my
amendment
to
prohibit
funding
for
all
military
and
civilian
construction
projects
in
Afghanistan.
Dear
Friend,
Continued
U.S.
funding
for
military
and
civilian
construction
projects
in
Afghanistan
would
be
a
prescription
for
unparalleled
waste
of
taxpayer
money,
and
I&#8217;m
proud
to
tell
you
that
last
week
the
House
passed
my
bipartisan
amendment
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
The
amendment
is
included
in
the
$570
billion
defense
appropriations
bill
(H.R.4870)
the
House
approved
on
Friday,
and
it&#8217;s
simple.
Funding
for
all
military
and
civilian
infrastructure
projects
in
Afghanistan
is
prohibited .
As
a
result,
U.S.
taxpayer
funds
that
would
almost
certainly
have
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
criminals,
warlords,
and
corrupt
officials
cannot
and
will
not
be
spent
&#8211;
period.
As
I
told
my
colleagues
in
a
speech
late
Wednesday
night
on
the
House
floor,
the
cash
keeps
disappearing,
while
the
projects
go
uncompleted .
We
have
already
spent
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
on
reconstruction
projects
in
Afghanistan,
and
the
Special
Inspector
General
for
Afghanistan
Reconstruction
(SIGAR)
and
his
225
investigators
are
unable
to
account
for
where
most
of
the
money
has
ended
up.
Why?
Because
Afghanistan
is
one
of
the
most
corrupt
nations
in
the
world .
Since
traditional
banking
services
do
not
exist
in
most
of
the
country,
construction
projects
are
financed,
quite
literally,
with
truckloads
of
American
cash.
As
our
troops
withdraw
from
Afghanistan,
more
and
more
of
the
country
is
outside
the
areas
in
which
U.S.
personnel
can
travel
and
operate
safely
&#8211;
and
there
is
no
way
to
properly
audit
or
inspect
these
projects.
So
it&#8217;s
time
to
put
an
end
to
so-called
"Afghanistan
reconstruction"
and
use
that
money
to
rebuild
America
-
our
highways,
bridges,
harbors,
schools,
and
other
infrastructure
-
creating
good
middle-class
jobs
and
opportunities,
and
laying
the
groundwork
for
even
more
business
and
economic
growth
in
the
future.
In
addition
to
passing
my
amendment
to
cut
off
construction
funds
for
Afghanistan,
the
House
also
passed
a
bipartisan
amendment
I
cosponsored
to
prohibit
the
sale
or
distribution
of
shoulder-fired
missiles
to
the
rebel
factions
in
Syria .
These
terribly
dangerous
weapons
would
only
worsen
a
conflict
in
which
we
have
no
friends
&#8211;
and
very
probably
end
up
being
used
against
America.
Finally,
I
also
supported
an
amendment
authored
by
Rep.
Barbara
Lee
(D-CA)
that
would
have
prohibited
any
U.S.
combat
troops
in
Iraq .
Since
the
House
Majority
voted
down
that
amendment,
I
have
introduced
a
similar
measure
as
a
standalone
bill.
More
on
that
soon.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
posted
as
the
defense
appropriations
bill
moves
through
the
Senate
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk.
Have
a
good
week.
Sincerely,
The
Defense
Appropriations
Act

a

The
Positive:
&#8226;
Includes
the
Nolan
amendment
to
cut
off
military
and

The
Negative:
&#8226;
Fails

&#8226;
Prevents

&#8226;
Provides

an
increase
in

overall,
which
is
$202

above
the

Continuing
to
Battle
Rising
Waters
Helping
local
volunteers
and
officials
sandbag
in
advance
of
the
rapidly-rising
Rainy
River
in
the
borderland.
As
flooding
continues
across
northern
and
southwestern
Minnesota,
I'm
working
closely
with
Governor
Dayton
and
Senators
Amy
Klobuchar
and
Al
Franken
to
secure
assistance
from
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(FEMA) .
Governor
Dayton's
State
of
Emergency
declaration
last
week
in
35
Minnesota
counties
automatically
triggers
this
initial
request
for
federal
help,
and
also
makes
a
wide
range
of
state
resources
available
-
including
the
100
Minnesota
National
Guard
soldiers
the
Governor
sent
to
Koochiching
County
last
week
to
help
in
storm
affected
areas.
Meanwhile,
I
cancelled
my
regular
schedule
last
Monday
and
headed
for
International
Falls
to
see
the
situation
for
myself,
meet
with
local
officials,
volunteers,
business
people,
and
homeowners
to
draw
attention
to
this
rapidly
developing
crisis
in
our
region.
What
I
witnessed
was
considerable
damage
to
private
housing
and
property,
public
infrastructure,
and
business
and
commercial
facilities
-
but
what
I
saw
and
experienced
from
the
community
was
inspiring.
People
of
all
ages
and
walks
of
life
pitching
in
to
fill
and
stack
sandbags,
prepare
and
deliver
meals,
move
precious
possessions
to
higher
ground
-
people
encouraging
and
helping
one
another
in
that
"Minnesota
way"
we
all
know
so
well.
Of
course
I'll
keep
you
posted
as
events
develop.
Thankfully,
the
weather
forecasts
are
calling
for
drier
weather
this
week.
A
Big
Fix
for
the
"Big
Dip"
During
my
flood
tour
last
Monday,
Lake
Kabetogama
area
residents
brought
to
my
attention
a
massive,
washed
out
pothole
they
call
"the
Big
Dip"
on
Highway
53,
which
links
Duluth,
the
Range,
and
International
Falls.
Commuters,
loggers,
tourists,
cyclists,
and
pedestrians
have
been
complaining
about
this
crater
(located
between
International
Falls
and
Orr)
for
five
years,
with
no
action
from
the
Minnesota
Department
of
Transportation
(MnDOT).
That
"roadblock"
literally
ended
last
week
when
I
brought
the
matter
up
with
Minnesota
Department
of
Transportation
Commissioner
Charlie
Zelle
during
a
meeting
in
my
Washington
office.
As
I
told
Commissioner
Zelle,
five
years
is
far
too
long
to
wait
for
road
repair.
He
agreed
-
and
saw
to
it
that
the
dip
got
an
immediate
tar
hole
filling .
This
is
a
chronic
problem
in
this
stretch
of
road,
however,
and
while
we're
pleased
with
the
temporary
fix,
I've
asked
Commissioner
Zelle
to
look
into
a
longer
term
solution.
Stop
the
Foreign
Steel
Dump!
Enough
is
enough.
We
need
to
enforce
the
law
and
put
an
end
to
Korea&#8217;s
illegal
dumping
of
steel
pipeline
into
the
U.S.
market
&#8211;
a
trade
crime
that&#8217;s
taking
our
jobs,
undercutting
our
price
and
stalling
our
economy.
In
fact,
this
Korean
steel
dump
has
already
led
to
reduced
hours
at
three
American
steel
manufacturing
facilities,
and
the
closing
of
another.
That
was
the
message
150
of
us
&#8211;
Democratic
and
Republican
members
of
the
Congressional
Steel
Caucus
&#8211;
recently
conveyed
in
no
uncertain
terms
to
Secretary
of
Commerce
Penny
Pritzker
as
Korea
continues
to
dump
steel
pipeline
into
the
U.S.
market
at
unprecedented
rates
&#8211;
800,000
metric
tons
last
year
alone.
Read
our
letter
here .
Korea&#8217;s
not
the
only
culprit.
Taken
together,
foreign
imports
of
steel
pipeline
from
China,
Russia,
India,
and
Korea
have
more
than
doubled
since
2010
&#8211;
an
additional
$2
billion
worth
of
cheap,
subsidized,
often
poor
quality
steel
and
steel
pipeline
dumped
into
our
market.
If
this
trend
continues,
the
experts
tell
us
we&#8217;re
going
to
lose
12
domestic
steel
mills,
and
some
50,000
good
middle
class
jobs
across
our
nation
in
the
not
too
distant
future.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
introduced
my
American
Pipeline
and
Jobs
Safety
Act
of
2014
to
require
that
virtually
all
pipelines
built
and
federally
permitted
in
the
United
States
contain
100%
American
iron
ore
and
steel,
processed
or
reprocessed
right
here
in
America.
Read
more
about
my
bill
here .
Make
no
mistake.
We
must
change
our
tax
and
trade
policies
to
encourage
&#8211;
and
require
&#8211;
that
American
iron
ore
and
steel
&#8211;
mined
and
produced
by
American
workers
be
used
to
build
and
rebuild
America
here
in
the
21st
Century.
Nothing
else
is
good
enough.
Nothing
else
will
do.

Coming
Up
in
Washington
This
week
I'll:
&#8226;
Meet
with
Jay
Williams,
the
new
Assistant
Secretary
of
Commerce
for
the
Economic
Development
Administration
(EDA) ,
to
discuss
how
current
and
future
EDA
programs
can
best
address
the
economic
development
needs
and
priorities
of
Minnesota's
Eighth
District.
&#8226;
Join
my
colleagues
on
the
Livestock,
Rural
Development,
and
Credit
Subcommittee
on
Agriculture
to
review
how
best
we
can
make
credit
available
for
rural
farmers ,
which
includes
measures
I'm
working
on as
part
of
H.R.1727,
the
Beginning
Farmer
and
Rancher
Opportunity
Act, to
help
those
farmers
and
ranchers
who
are
just
starting
out.
&#8226;
Join
the
House
in
considering
H.R.4413,
the
Customer
Protection
and
End
User
Relief
Act,
to
reauthorize
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
(CFTC),
to
ensure
farmers,
ranchers,
and
end
users
have
the
certainty
and
stability
they
need
to
keep
costs
low
for
their
customers.
Finally...
Saving
Our
Pollinators
A
friendly
helper
points
to
ways
we
can
help
save
our
pollinators
in
our
home
gardens
at
a
recent
"Saving
Our
Pollinators"
event
at
the
U.S.
Capitol,
held
in
collaboration
with
the
USDA,
the
U.S.
Department
of
the
Interior,
and
the
Congressional
Pollinator
Protection
Caucus
(CP2C).
Honeybees
are
crucial
to
the
world's
ability
to
produce
nutritious
food ,
but
disease,
pesticides,
and
habitat
loss
are
causing
them
to
disappear
at
an
alarming
and
dangerous
rate.
In
fact,
the
number
of
managed
U.S.
honey
bee
colonies
has
dropped
from
6
million
in
1947
to
just
2.5
million
today.
So
as
a
cosponsor
and
supporter
of
multiple
measures
to
address
the
disappearance
of
honey
bees
across
our
land,
I'm
delighted
that
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
has
decided
to
provide
an
additional
$8
million
in
Conservation
Reserve
Program
(CRP)
incentives
to
farmers
and
ranchers
in
Minnesota ,
Michigan,
North
and
South
Dakota,
and
Wisconsin
who
establish
new
habitats
for
declining
honey
bee
populations.
The
program
allows
for
managing
or
replacing
existing
vegetation
known
as
cover
crops, with
lower
cost,
high-nutrition
seed
mixes
that
can
support
the
blooming
cycles
of
plants
that
benefit
pollinators.
This
is
one
of
a
series
of
important
and
welcome
steps
the
Administration
is
taking
to
pursue
solutions
to
the
multiple
problems
affecting
honey
bee
health.
