David, I wasn&rsquo;t planning on sending you an email this early in the morning. But then I saw our fundraising numbers&hellip;
The fact that I'm writing you this email should tell you all you need to know.
Let me be clear: These Republicans have no business running Congress. They just spend all day sabotaging President Obama. It&rsquo;s unacceptable. And it has to stop.
But if we don't pick up the pace before tonight&rsquo;s final quarterly fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;ll be stuck with the status quo -- or worse.
Our team is telling me that they've already got a triple-match opportunity going. But it doesn't mean anything if nobody takes advantage of it. Can you chip in $5 right now? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy Pelosi
