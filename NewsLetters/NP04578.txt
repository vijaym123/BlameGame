Friends,
HUGE news. We just got updated numbers from the Registrar of Voters -
Ami is now LEADING Doug Ose by 711 votes!
There&#39;s plenty of ballots left to count, but these numbers are encouraging - and they let us know we have to kick things into high gear.
This race is still incredibly close - within 1000 votes - and we need to be ready for a recount.
We MUST be prepared to keep our team on the ground for as long as it takes to ensure an accurate outcome. To do that, we need your help. Click below and give what you can, right now.

Thanks for not throwing in the towel. Thanks for being in this thing with us.
