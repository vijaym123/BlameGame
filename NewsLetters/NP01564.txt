David --
Earlier today, former Senator Hillary Clinton announced that she&rsquo;s running for president.
After months of speculation about GOP presidential candidates, today the spotlight is on Democrats.
Hillary will be traveling to swing states like Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters. And so are we -- because these are among the
states Democrats need to win
to keep the White House and take back the Senate.
If we&rsquo;re successful, the Democratic president we elect in 2016 will have a Democratic Senate to work with.
If you&rsquo;re ready to make that happen, pitch in now to give Democrats the resources to keep this exciting momentum going.

It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were senators before they ran for president. And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that top Republican candidates like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio are using the Senate as a platform for their presidential runs.
Who we elect to the Senate matters
-- which is why the DSCC will never stop working to elect Democratic senators and defeat and replace extreme Republicans.
Pitch in today and make sure our next President has the Democratic Senate majority he or SHE needs to get things done.
Onward to victory,
