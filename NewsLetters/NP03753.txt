Dear
David,
Merry Christmas!
With a grateful heart,
I want to extend to you and your families warm wishes during this
holiday season. As Calvin Coolidge once said "To cherish peace and good
will, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of
Christmas. If we think on these things, there will be born in us a Savior and
over us will shine a star sending its gleam of hope to the world. This
joyous season is an opportune time to express our gratitude for the
love we share with our friends and family and the countless blessings
that have been bestowed upon us. May this spirit of joy and happiness
unite us all, not only this season but into the coming
year.
As Americans, we are blessed to live in a great county, home to so
many brave men and women who have dedicated their lives to defending our
freedoms. During this season, amidst all the hustle and bustle, I
hope we can make time to share our thoughts and prayers with our service
members overseas who are not home with their loved ones. These
individuals exemplify the true meaning of Christmas, the willingness to help
others at their own expense. For that, may God bless them and look
over them and their families.
As this year comes to an end, I
am very humbled for the opportunity you have given me to serve you in
the North State. We have another busy year ahead of us, and I am
thankful for the opportunity you have given me to represent your voice here
in Congress. To learn about how I can serve you and to follow me
throughout the week, please visit my
website.
and
stay in touch with me on
my Facebook
page as well!
From the LaMalfa family and our 1st District
team, Merry
Christmas!
Sincerely,
Isaiah
