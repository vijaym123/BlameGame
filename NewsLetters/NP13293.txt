Happy
New Year Friend,
At the beginning of each year,
many people make New Years resolutions that are often encouragement to
have a better year than the one just past.
The productivity of
Congress in 2013 has been widely criticized and for a good
reason.
We did not accomplish enough of our goals and could have put
Americans in a better place but I am hopeful this will be the case in
2014.
Below are reflections of some accomplishments and
drawbacks of the US House of Representatives from last year.
In a
sense, my New Years resolution is to work across the aisle and pass more
sensible legislation that will continue to improve the lives of
residents in the 11th District.
It is my hope that we begin to
operate in a more efficient way in 2014.
Sincerely,
Marcia L.
Fudge
Member of Congress
Highlights of
Congress in 2013
I was pleased to join the House
Agriculture Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight and
Nutrition at the beginning of last year as a champion on ending the childhood
obesity epidemic.
Proper nutrition and physical activity play
an important part in curbing this trend.

Areas of
Opportunity for Congress in 2013
The Violence
Against Women Act bipartisan legislation that gives law enforcement the
tools to protect victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual
assault and stalking as well as prosecute offenders was reauthorized
early last year despite determined efforts
to weaken its
protections.
Nonetheless, the passage of this legislation was
accomplished with support across the aisle.

Rep. Fudge discusses
the
importance of STEM
(Science,

with Akron public school students
and
recognizes them for an
outstanding
project.
I cant think of
any member affiliated with government that worked so diligently,
competently and with such grace as your assistantMy mother is 80 years old
and misplaced her passport on Wednesday prior to her Saturday
departure to Germany.
I reached out to your office and your staff
quickly acted upon our request - during the government shutdown.
She
made the necessary phone calls and relayed the information in a timely
fashion.
I cant describe the seeming miraculous efforts to
alleviate this situationIn times of low congressional favorability; your
staff has demonstrated government working for the
people.

a direct result of your assistance and involvement, the FCC granted
