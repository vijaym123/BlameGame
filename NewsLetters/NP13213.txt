Dear David,
On
December 23rd, I introduced H.R. 3804, legislation to repeal an
ill-conceived provision of an otherwise bipartisan budget bill that reduced the
Cost-of-Living-Adjustment for military retirees. As a member of the
House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I believe our servicemembers,
veterans, and their families must receive the benefits they have earned and
deserve. There is substantial bi-partisan support to correct
this.
These brave men and women who have served our
country with such valor should not be punished because of Congress
failure to get our fiscal house in order. Please view my remarks on the
House Floor urging Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on my
bill.
Congresswoman Brownley urges Speaker Boehner to bring her
bill repealing cuts to the military retiree COLA to a vote on the
House Floor.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
JULIA
BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
Should Congress Repeal the Reduction to the Military Retiree
COLA? Yes, our servicemembers and
their families deserve these benefits. Yes, but we must find other government spending to
cut first. No, this
provision of the budget should remain in effect. Other *By answering this survey, you are
