News from Representative John Delaney
February 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
Today, I write with an update on my work to gather
feedback from across the district. During my first term in Congress,
I've worked hard to reach out to families and individuals in our area
to hear their thoughts on the issues facing our country. In the last
month, I've held a number of events, from town hall-style coffees to
issue-oriented panels to talk about our district's top priorities.
This week, I hosted and moderated a panel discussion in Boyds about
voting rights in the United States and my efforts to ensure that all
Americans have access to the polls come Election Day. Over the last
month, I've worked to recognize Black History Month online and offline,
and this panel provided an opportunity to discuss some of the
challenges that minority voters face today. The panel was hosted in a
historic one-room school house, the only school available to local
African American students for more than half a century, providing a
fitting venue for our talk on civil rights and voter protections.
On Monday, I hosted a town hall-style coffee at the Bulls and Bears
Restaurant in Hagerstown to hear more from constituents about the
issues that matter most to them. While many issues were raised, one of
the most important discussions we had was about infrastructure
development in Western Maryland. During my first term in Congress, I've
introduced major bipartisan legislation
that
would invest $750 billion in infrastructure projects across the country
at no cost to the taxpayer. Not only would this legislation help to
repair our crumbling roads and bridges, but my bill would also provide
for the transportation, energy and water infrastructure that American
businesses need to stay competitive in today's economy.
In addition to my bill, I've acted as a strong voice for projects in
our district that promise to help repair our infrastructure and support
the economy. Last week, I authored a letter
to the Washington County
Delegation expressing my support for federal funding for improvements
to Interstate 81 in Maryland. As the primary north-south corridor in
Washington County, I-81 receives some of the highest traffic in the
region, and the current four-lane structure is inadequate. As a Member
of Congress, I've promised to act as a champion for the further
development of I-81 as well as increased investment in our
infrastructure nationwide.
As a Member of Congress, it's my responsibility to bring your concerns
to the floor of the House, and as the 113th Congress moves forward, I
will continue my work to do just that. As my first term in Congress
moves forward, I'll be sure to keep you up to date and to continue
listening
.
Sincerely,
John

John
Delaney

Dear
Friend,
Today,
I
write
with
an
update
on
my
work
to
gather
feedback
from
across
the
district.
During
my
first
term
in
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
worked
hard
to
reach
out
to
families
and
individuals
in
our
area
to
hear
their
thoughts
on
the
issues
facing
our
country.
In
the
last
month,
I&#8217;ve
held
a
number
of
events,
from
town
hall-style
coffees
to
issue-oriented
panels
to
talk
about
our
district&#8217;s
top
priorities.
This
week,
I
hosted
and
moderated
a
panel
discussion
in
Boyds
about
voting
rights
in
the
United
States
and
my
efforts
to
ensure
that
all
Americans
have
access
to
the
polls
come
Election
Day.
Over
the
last
month,
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
recognize
Black
History
Month
online
and
offline,
and
this
panel
provided
an
opportunity
to
discuss
some
of
the
challenges
that
minority
voters
face
today.
The
panel
was
hosted
in
a
historic
one-room
school
house,
the
only
school
available
to
local
African
American
students
for
more
than
half
a
century,
providing
a
fitting
venue
for
our
talk
on
civil
rights
and
voter
protections.
On

I

Hagerstown

While
many
issues

one
of

this

but
my

would
also
provide

the

that
American

in
our

that

of

As a

it's

the

and
as
the
113th

I
will
continue
my

to
do
just
that.
As
my
first

moves
forward,
I&#8217;ll
be

to
keep
you
