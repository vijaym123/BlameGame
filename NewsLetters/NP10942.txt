A Minute with Mike - March, 2014
Dear Friend,
Monday was the final deadline to enroll in new health care coverage
options created by the Affordable Care Act. As a proponent of this
legislation, I am proud to announce that Covered California, our
state-run exchange, has registered over 3.5 million people in new
health care options. This is a victory for every American that believes
that health care is a right, not a privilege.
I am also thrilled to announce that the United States Postal Service
will not be closing the historic Franklin Mall Post Office in downtown
Santa Clara. Knowing what this facility means to the community, I had
multiple conversations with the Postmaster General's office about
keeping it open. Deputy Postmaster General Ron Stroman was receptive to
the concerns and suggestions of Santa Clara residents and the more than
6,000 people who spoke out about the plans for possible consolidation.
I look forward to this facility continuing to serve Santa Clara for
generations to come.
Celebrating our success saving the Franklin Mall Post Office with
community actisits
As always, it is an honor serving the people of Santa Clara and Alameda
Counties in Congress. Feel free to connect with me by email, or through
social media, at any time.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress
P.S. I hope you enjoyed my April Fools
prank!

District Grant Workshop
CA-17 Grants workshop
My staff hosted a Grant Workshop last month for the residents of
California's 17th Congressional district. I'm glad my staff was able to
bring speakers from federal agencies to help so many people with the
grant application process, which can be obtuse and complicated.

Remembering the Korean War with the Korean Ambassador
Honoring our veterans
It was a special honor to join the Korean Ambassador to the United
States, Ahn Ho-Young, in a tribute to the Korean War veterans in our
district and across the nation. As both our countries celebrated our
peaceful cooperation of over 60 years, we remembered the sacrifices
made by these brave soldiers and their families. I assure you that in
their honor, I will continue working so that all our veterans receive
world-class health care and have the support they have earned for their
service.

Discussing Opportunities in Bangladesh with US Ambassador Dan Mozena
Speaking at a town hall, hosted by Agami
US Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan Mozena and I had an excellent
conversation with members of the community on expanding opportunities
for American entrepreneurs and NGOs in Bangladesh. Strengthening our
ties to Bangladesh, and continuing educational development efforts on
the ground, will benefit both our nations. I am happy that Agami, a
local non-profit working to promote education for underprivileged
children in Bangladesh, was able to host this town hall discussion.

Meeting with Labor Secretary Tom Perez
Speaking with Labor Sec. Perez
I had a great conversation with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez last
month. We discussed the need to provide all Americans with a chance to
earn a living wage, our shared goal of closing the wage gap for women
and minorities, and ways to continue to grow and improve workforce
training opportunities in the South Bay area. He was gracious and
understanding, and I look forward to working closely with him to create
more and better opportunities for working Americans in our district and
across the nation.

Urging the FBI to Use Technology to Reduce Rape Kit Backlog
Questioning FBI Director James Comey (2:49)
Last month, in my role as a senior member of the House Appropriations
Committee, I urged FBI Director James Comey to use technology to assist
in processing the rape kit backlog. I also asked the FBI to allow
Alameda County to serve as a pilot project for this plan. Alameda
County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley, who is leading the way on
these efforts, attended the hearing at my invitation.

Women's History Month/International Women's Day
My statement on Women's History Month (1:57)
This past month, we celebrated Women's History Month, as well as
International Women's Day. The theme of Women's Day couldn't ring more
true: "Equality for women is progress for all." From the workplace to
public service; from a seat at the table of peace negotiations to
access to education and healthcare - equality for women in every facet
of our society propels us forward.

Happy Nowruz!
Addressing the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans
Happy Nowruz! It was a pleasure to celebrate the Iranian New Year with
the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. Celebrated by nearly
300 million people worldwide, Nowruz is a wonderful holiday that
embodies the principle of always regarding our fellow human being with
compassion and open-mindedness. My H. Res. 267, which passed the House
in 2010, recognizes the cultural and historical significance of Nowruz
and expresses appreciation to Iranian-Americans for their contributions
to society. As Spring begins, it is an honor to celebrate the
rejuvenation and renewal of our shared humanity.
