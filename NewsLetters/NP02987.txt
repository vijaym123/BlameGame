U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s eNewsletter - - Week of February 2, 2015
Senate Back to Work Bipartisan Bill for Veterans Suicide Prevention Passes Senate
&lsquo;We lose thousands of veterans every year to suicide. Now is the time for practical, bipartisan action to do something about it.&rsquo;
On Tuesday, the United States Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would provide the mental-health and suicide-prevention support to our veterans. The
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act , which earlier passed the House of Representatives unanimously, now goes to the President for his signature.
Senator McConnell delivered remarks on the Senate Floor in support of the bill saying, &ldquo;This bill would offer critical support to the men and women who&rsquo;ve already sacrificed so much for us. It would extend a helping hand to heroes when they need it. And it&rsquo;s just the kind of common-sense bipartisan action the new Congress can deliver for the American people.&rdquo;

Senator McConnell Comments on the President&rsquo;s Budget
On Monday, the President submitted to Congress his budget plan for Fiscal Year 2016, which begins Oct. 1. Senator McConnell commented saying, &ldquo;President Obama promised in the State of the Union to deliver a budget filled with &lsquo;ideas that are practical, not partisan.&rsquo; Unfortunately, what we saw this morning was another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances&mdash;ever. The new Congress will focus on ways to help the Middle Class instead as we work to pass the serious kind of budget all Americans deserve: one that roots out and reforms wasteful spending, and that aims to grow Middle-Class jobs and opportunity instead of Washington&rsquo;s bureaucracy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking the President to abandon the tax-and-spend ways of yesterday and join us in this practical and future-oriented approach.&rdquo;
Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony Honoring 1st Special Service Force, the &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Brigade&rdquo;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a true story about a fearless group of young Canadians and Americans &mdash; including many Kentuckians &mdash; who were willing to put their lives on the line in the truest sense of the term&hellip;And today, here they are. Champions of freedom.&rsquo;
On Tuesday, leaders of the U.S. House and Senate held a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the WWII &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Brigade.&rdquo; Senator McConnell delivered remarks during the ceremony, which took place in Emancipation Hall, in the U.S. Capitol.
Senator McConnell said, &ldquo;Members of the elite &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Brigade&rsquo; excelled in rock-climbing and amphibious assault. They advanced on skis and through the air. They survived by stealth, and trained in demolitions. Some of their more daring mission plans would&rsquo;ve made James Bond blush. And through it all, they helped save a continent in chaos. They helped defeat some of the greatest menaces our world has known.&rdquo;

Senator McConnell Welcomes the Announcement of Pope Francis Visit
On Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner announced that Pope Francis will address a joint meeting of Congress at the United States Capitol on September 24th; he will be the first Pope to do so.
Senator McConnell welcomed the announcement of Pope Francis&rsquo; visit to the Capitol, saying, &ldquo;The American people look forward to hearing Pope Francis&rsquo; call to love our neighbors and to find new and creative ways to meet the pressing needs of those who exist on the fringes of society. From the slums of Buenos Aires to St. Peter&rsquo;s Square, Pope Francis is moving the hearts of millions and inspiring a new generation with an engaging and compelling style. I join Speaker Boehner in welcoming this inspirational leader, with his simple message of compassion and openness to others, to the Capitol.&rdquo;
Welcoming Kentuckians to Washington, D.C.
On Tuesday, Senator McConnell had the honor of speaking at an event in Washington, D.C. hosted by the
Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship , which conducts civic education for high school and college students, and the Kentucky Distillers&rsquo; Association, a non-profit trade group founded in 1880.
During his address, Senator McConnell said, &ldquo;It makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see Henry Clay&rsquo;s legacy live on, whether it is through the Clay Center, through the U.S. Senate, or through all of us here today&hellip;to see the imprint the Bluegrass State has made on the history of this country. Not only Clay, but famous Kentuckians like Abraham Lincoln, John Sherman Cooper, Alben Barkley, and the recently departed Wendell Ford.&rdquo;
