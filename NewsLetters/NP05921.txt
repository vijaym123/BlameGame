Yesterday, a radical anti-choice hate group announced plans to defeat Cheri. Why?
Ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling voted to defund Planned Parenthood
He stood with Todd Akin to co-sponsor a bill to &ldquo;redefine rape&rdquo;
He accused pro-choice advocates of supporting
genocide
David, we can&rsquo;t let Illinois fall into the hands of anti-choice extremists.
But if we miss tonight&rsquo;s goal, our chance to defeat Mr. Schilling could slip through our fingers.
Please, don&rsquo;t let that happen. Chip in $5 or more today:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
