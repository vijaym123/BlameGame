Renacci Statement On Health Exchange Security And Transparency Act
>From health plan cancellations to higher premiums, the negative effects
of the President's health care law have proven disastrous.
Increasingly, it has become apparent that the exchanges pose
significant security risks to Ohioans and Americans everywhere.
Americans deserve to be informed if their personal, private information
has been compromised due to the President's health care law, and this
bill would require it. I was proud to support the Health Exchange
Security and Transparency Act, and I am hopeful that the Senate will
take action. Read my full statement HERE

Renacci Statement On December Jobs Report
Today's jobs report is deeply troubling. Though the unemployment rate
ticked down, it was largely due to our shrinking labor force - the
participation rate is the lowest it's been since 1978 because more and
more people are dropping out of the workforce or giving up their search
all together. Furthermore, our economy added only 74,000 jobs, the
lowest number in over three years and over 60 percent fewer than
economists predicted. It's no coincidence that these dismal jobs
numbers coincide with enrollment in the exchanges created by the
President's health care law, which has caused a chilling effect on our
economy. Read more HERE

We Must Protect Military Benefits For Our Veterans
As we enter a new year, we do so with the first budget agreement in a
divided government in nearly 30 years. Not only does this agreement
represent compromise, but also it represents a willingness to meet at
the negotiating table and work out our differences. It was a positive
step forward and signified to the American people that Republicans and
Democrats alike can overcome partisanship and will work together to
make America a better place in 2014 and beyond. Read more HERE

Renacci
Statement
On
December
Jobs
Report
Today&#8217;s
jobs
report
is
deeply
troubling.
Though
the
unemployment
rate
ticked
down,
it
was
largely
due
to
our
shrinking
labor
force
-
the
participation
rate
is
the
lowest
it&#8217;s
been
since
1978
because
more
and
more
people
are
dropping
out
of
the
workforce
or
giving
up
their
search
all
together.
Furthermore,
our
economy
added
only
74,000
jobs,
the
lowest
number
in
over
three
years
and
over
60
percent
fewer
than
economists
predicted.
It&#8217;s
no
coincidence
that
these
dismal
jobs
numbers
coincide
with
enrollment
in
the
exchanges
created
by
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law,
which
has
caused
a
chilling
effect
on
our
economy.
