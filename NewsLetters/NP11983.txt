David -- My supporters never cease to amaze me:
We asked you to join us in fighting back against ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling&rsquo;s deceptive campaign tactics -- and so far hundreds of you have stepped up -- thank you. Your dedicated support means so very much to me.
But to be quite honest with you, things are just getting started. Mr. Schilling has only been in this race a few short months and he&rsquo;s already launching personal attacks against me. There&rsquo;s no telling what will happen before election day.
David -- this is when we need you most.
Can I count on you for your support before midnight? Chip in $3 or more right now to help me build the grassroots foundation we need to win this November &gt;&gt;
This deadline could make or break our ability to fight back against deceitful attacks and get the truth out to voters.
We've got to close this gap before midnight. Please, step up before the deadline: http://action.cheribustos.com/Midnight-Deadline
I know we can do this together.
Thank you for your support,
Cheri
