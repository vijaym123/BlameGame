OVERRIDE THE SUPREME COURT'S BIRTH CONTROL DECISION &gt;&gt;
Democrats in Congress have developed legislation that would override the Supreme Court&rsquo;s wrong-headed decision. We need to get to 100,000 signatures today supporting it.
YOUR NAME: David Johnson PETITION SIGNATURE:
PENDING &gt;&gt;
Five Supreme Court Justices -- all of them men -- decided that a corporation&rsquo;s beliefs can override a woman&rsquo;s access to contraceptive coverage. You would think we were in the 1950s. A woman&rsquo;s boss should not be in control of her health care decisions. No one's boss should.
We want to get 100,000 standing with women and supporting an override of the Hobby Lobby decision. Are you in?
