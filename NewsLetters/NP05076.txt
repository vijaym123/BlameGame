We&rsquo;re out of options.
We&rsquo;ve told you that Republicans are spending more against Ami than anyone in the country.
And we&rsquo;ve told you that your grassroots support is the only way we can compete.
But with only 24 hours to go before our final week ad buy deadline, we&rsquo;re still coming up $3,472 shy.
Folks, what else can we say?
If we want to make sure Ami wins, we can&rsquo;t afford to fall short even once between now and Election Day.
Can you rush an urgent gift before midnight? There&rsquo;s 8 days left, and every dollar helps.
