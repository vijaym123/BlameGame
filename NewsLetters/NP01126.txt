Black Lives Matter
The tragic deaths of people of color at the hands of law enforcement must stop. Freddie Gray's death is another in too long a list of unjustified and senseless murders.
I am proud of the East Bay residents who have been peacefully marching for justice. Through the committed work of protesters and activists, we can chip away at the institutionalized racism that still exists in our nation.
I spoke with Erin Burnett on CNN
about the need to keep up the peaceful momentum for justice.
Stop Fast Track for TPP
Last week,
I joined KPFAs Kris Welch
to discuss my opposition to the secretive Fast Track process for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Congress has a vital oversight role and Fast Track prevents us from ensuring American jobs arent sent overseas.
Congress should have an opportunity to weigh in on these trade deals and protect American jobs, our health, and our environment.
Loretta Lynch Confirmed...Finally!
I was deeply honored to watch Loretta Lynch's confirmation as Attorney General from the Senate floor with the proud women of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Its terrible that Senate Republicans held her nomination hostage for more than 160 days
longer than the last seven Attorneys General combined. Loretta Lynch has made history as the first woman of color to serve as the top law enforcement official for the United States.
Read my full statement on her confirmation.
