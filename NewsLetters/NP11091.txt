Obamacare
Obamacare remains in the news this week as another deadline arrives,
another unilateral Administration delay is implemented, and another
court case challenging the law is heard.
With each new headline about
the Obamacare train wreck, I hope that the President will choose a day
to approach Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.
You and I -- and
the President for that matter -- all know that America deserves better
and that together we can do better.

Internal Revenue Service Investigation
Many of you have contacted me over the past two years concerned about
the status of Congress' IRS 501(c)(4) targeting investigation. The
House Republican Conference is hosting a website that details all the
investigative work that the House has done and continues to do.
Despite all of the Administration's stonewalling, we are
getting closer and closer to the truth.
Empowering States and Preventing Federal Overreach
Last week the House passed two significant pieces of legislation - with
bipartisan support-which rein in Federal overreach, protect private
property rights, and empower states to control their own lands.
*
H.R. 1459
gets the American people more involved in the process of establishing
National Monuments and ensures that the Federal government abides by
all necessary environmental laws and respects private property rights.
*
H.R. 2824
ends years of waste and inter-governmental squabbling by codifying into
law a 2008 regulation on coal mining that has been wrapped-up in
unnecessary delays by the Obama Administration for almost six years. By
putting an end to the partisanship and unnecessary fighting between
industry and environmentalists, we can move forward together supporting
economic growth and jobs.
NSA Phone Data Collection Program
Last week the issue of the National Security Agency's (NSA) bulk phone
data collection program reached center stage in Congress and for the
Obama Administration.

NSA phone program.

The world community continues to deal with the tense situation between
Russian and Ukraine, and the U.S. and Europe are working together to
ensure that Russian aggression is met with strong leadership from the
West.

Vietnamese-American Meet Up
The House Republican Conference hosted our Second Annual
Vietnamese-American conference at the Capitol last Thursday where
hundreds of Vietnamese-American community leaders from across the
country gathered for an open discussion with a number of House
Republicans about what issues are critically important to this vibrant
community. Vietnamese-Americans comprise over 10 percent of the
Asian-American population, and the most recent Census data shows that
Georgia - especially the Atlanta Metro area - is blessed to have over
45,000 people of Vietnamese decent. Our great state has the sixth
largest Vietnamese-American population in the country, and this vibrant
community is growing every day. I was honored to work with these
community leaders and to welcome so many of our neighbors from the
Seventh District to Washington for the event.
Rep. Rob Woodall speaks at the 2nd Annual Vietnamese-American Meet Up
on March 27th
The Week Ahead
This week the House Budget Committee is going to consider the FY15
budget. Though the Senate has already declared that it won't go to work
on a budget this year, you and I know that passing a budget is an
important part of governing, and I am proud that Chairman Paul Ryan and
my colleagues on the Budget Committee are moving forward.
On the House floor this week will be a very important bill - H.R. 2575 -
which fixes a major problem thrust on our nation's workers and
employers by the Affordable Care Act. I'm talking about a measure that
will restore the traditional 40-hour work week
, which was cut
back to 30 hours by the ACA. This bill will help hard-working Americans
move back into full-time work, instead of the patchwork of part-time
jobs that too many of our friends and neighbors are struggling with
today.

Member of Congress
