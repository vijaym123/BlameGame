Week in Review
Thanks to change in leadership
in the 114th Congress, the last
couple of weeks have brought real
bipartisan discussion to the Senate
floor with an open process to allow
Senators from both sides of the
aisle to offer their
amendments.
The last week of January focused
on the Keystone XL Pipeline. On
multiple occasions, in just one
day, we voted on more amendments
than in all of 2014. The
legislation passed with 61 votes,
providing a sound energy policy
that not only encourages energy
independence but also promotes
needed job growth.
After the the White House
released its budget this week, the
Senate turned its focus on
different key issues included in
the proposal.
I believe the Administration's
budget continues to spend wildly
out of control and fails to address
Washingtons long-term
spending problem. The President has
failed to recognize Americas
debt crisis is due to the
government spending too much. The
Presidents plan taxes more
instead of spending less. Far too
many Nevadans are living paycheck
to paycheck, and President
Obamas budget does very
little to change that.
This week, I also introduced and
cosponsored bills that I believe
are important for Nevadans. Click

The last couple of weeks have

see Congress functioning as it
should.
