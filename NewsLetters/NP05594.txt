The Scalise Capitol Report
October 13,
2014
Supporting
innovation
Last week I had the privilege of kicking off
NOLATech Week
in New Orleans at the Louisiana State Museum. The
New Orleans technology industry is thriving and has experienced a 33
percent increase since 2007. It is vital that we keep this industry free
from needless regulation because it is one of the few bright spots in
our economy that continues to grow and create jobs. As a computer
scientist by trade, I understand how important technology is to driving
Louisianas economy, and I am committed to improving the
competitiveness and job growth of Southeast
Louisiana.
What you
need to know about
Ebola
With so many questions
about Ebola, knowledge is power, and it is crucial to take the appropriate
precautionary measures to protect your family.
On my
website , youll find a list of facts, symptoms,
prevention methods, resources and tools so that you can be fully
informed about this virus and what Congress is doing to prevent the spread
of Ebola and protect your family.

News.
Obamacare continues to fail Louisiana
families
I have serious concerns about
recent reports
that health insurance premiums in Louisiana
are expected to increase by double digits in 2015 due to the
president's health care law. The people of Louisiana are seeing first hand
that the second year of Obamacare is even worse than the first
higher
costs, fewer choices, and more broken promises. This is unacceptable
and further evidence that the government takeover of health care has
failed hard-working taxpayers. I will continue fighting to protect
Louisiana families from the sticker shock of Obamacare rate
hikes.
Urging aggressive action to eradicate Islamic
terrorists
There is a serious lack of a strategy from the White House to
defeat the terrorist organization that is ISIL. My colleagues in Congress
and I have asked for a broader plan from the president, not just
airstrikes, but he has yet to provide a clear strategy to eradicate ISIL.
He is the Commander-in-Chief and if theres anything else the
president needs from Congress to combat Islamic terrorists, we stand
ready to address it as soon as it is brought forward. We must eliminate
ISIL, no doubt, but the president would be well served to leave all
options on the table rather than telegraphing to our enemy which military
options he has already removed.

thereof, on MSNBC's Morning
