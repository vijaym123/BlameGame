This week, I had the privilege
of speaking at the Heritage Foundations Conservative Policy Summit, in
which I talked about a bill I introduced to protect religious freedom
on the issue of marriage.
Regardless of where you stand on
the issue of marriage, all Americans can agree that religious freedom
is one of our most important values.
In fact, its the reason
we became a nation.
This is not a Republican or Democratic
issue.
As President Obama declared, Americans hold a wide range of
views on marriage and maintaining our nations commitment to religious
freedom is vital. I agree.
Thats why I introduced the
Marriage and Religious Freedom
Act .
This bill would protect freedom of conscience for those who
believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, protecting
them from adverse federal action.
This is an urgent
issue because the Supreme Court overturned Section 3 of the
Defense
of Marriage Act
in a controversial ruling last year.
Section
3 required that, for purpose of federal enactments, marriage was
defined as the union of one man and one woman.
Now, because of the
Supreme Courts decision, federal statutes that refer to a marriage for
federal purposes are interpreted as applying equally to same-sex
marriages, when they are recognized by the state.
The Supreme
Courts ruling opens the door for potential legal action against churches,
organizations, non-profits or even individuals who hold a religious or
moral belief that marriage is defined as a union between one man and
one woman.
At the state level, things are already
moving in the wrong direction.
Last August, the New Mexico Supreme
Court ruled that a Christian photographer violated a state law by
refusing to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony even though doing so
would have violated his deeply-held religious
beliefs.
Other cases involve Christian adoption and foster care agencies that have
been forced to stop providing those services because they object to
placing children in same-sex households. Still other cases include a
baker, a florist, a bed-and-breakfast, a t-shirt company, a student
counselor, and the Salvation Army.
In California, a bill was
making its way through the legislature that would have removed from the
Boy Scouts of America certain state-level tax exemptions and threaten
similar groups who hold traditional views about marriage.
It
passed the California Senate 27-9 before being tabled in the
Assembly.
Such policies are creating a climate of intolerance for
citizens who believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman.
And this climate could escalate to the federal
level.
Thats why I introduced H.R. 3133, the
Marriage and Religious
Freedom Act .
My bill would prohibit the federal government
from inappropriately targeting organizations or individuals who hold the
religious belief that marriage is the union of one man and one
woman.

H.R. 3133 currently has 100 cosponsors, and it
has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform, plus the House Ways and Means Committee. This is a common-sense,
unifying bill that is generating support in both parties and can earn
enough support to pass Congress.

Heritage advocating for my bill, please click

I will continue to advocate for religious freedom and
freedom of conscience for all Americans.
Its one of our
proudest traditions, and its one we must always
preserve.
