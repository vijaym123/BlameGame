Dear Friend,
With Congress back in session for the New Year, it's been a busy week-
but I'm glad that it ended well, with a great Memphis win over
Louisville last night. I hope you'll join me in congratulating Coach
Pastner and our Tigers on their second-ever win over a defending
national champion. Keep reading to learn what else happened this week.

Celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Day of Service with Pastor
Kenneth T. Whalum, Jr.
On January 20th, I will be observing Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Day of
Service by collaborating with Pastor Kenneth T. Whalum, Jr. and Seedco
Mid-South to host an education and volunteer training event for
Memphians to learn more about the Affordable Care Act and help their
communities enroll and take advantage of the law's many benefits. I
hope you will join me at Pastor Whalum's New Olivet Baptist Church
(3084 Southern Avenue) from 10 a.m. to noon on the 20th to get trained
as a volunteer so that you can help make affordable healthcare a
reality for more citizens of the Ninth District. If you can make it,
please RSVP to my Memphis office by calling (901) 544-4131.
2014 District Issues Meeting
On Monday morning, I hosted my 2014 District Issues Meeting in my
Memphis office. Hearing what constituents like you have to say about
the issues is very important to me. At the meeting, I discussed a
number of topics with Memphians, including what I hope Congress can
accomplish in the coming year, how to strengthen the middle class by
raising the minimum wage and extending emergency unemployment
insurance, and how we all can take advantage of the Affordable Care
Act's many benefits.
Hearing what Memphians like you think about these important issues, as
well as others like supporting our veterans, helping minority farmers
recover from unfair discrimination, and growing jobs, helps me better
represent the Ninth District in Congress.
At this year's District Issues Meeting, I had a chance to visit with
recording artist Ekpe. He shared with me his style of positive
affirmation rap which encourages children to believe in themselves and
their ability to learn. I was impressed with his efforts to improve the
lives of children in the Memphis community, including his songs "Don't
Touch a Gun" and "I am a Genius" - I hope you'll take a moment to
listen to his work.
50th Anniversary of the War on Poverty
This week marked the 50th Anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson
declaring "War on Poverty." As a nation, we've made great progress
toward reducing poverty in America over the last 50 years. But while
the poverty rate has dropped nearly 10% since 1967, there still
remained nearly 50 million American citizens living in poverty as
recently as 2012-including more than 13 million children. These numbers
only highlight how much more work we have left ahead of us and the
urgency with which it must be addressed.
We must do more to help people work their way to the American Dream,
and that means extending the lifeline of unemployment insurance to more
than 1.4 million hardworking Americans struggling to find work and
fighting for the 30 million employees who still don't take home a
decent wage after a long week's work. It means preventing crippling
cuts to the food stamp program that would take food out of the mouths
of children and seniors, making sure that women receive equal pay for
equal work, and creating the good-paying jobs that allow people to get
back on their feet. This must be done now because the need is now.
Cutting Short the "School-to-Prison" Pipeline
Unless dealt with early and effectively, young perpetrators of minor,
non-violent offenses may fall into a pattern of violent conduct later
in life. Instead of focusing on conflict resolution methods that could
limit this cycle, too often our schools rely on overly harsh
punishments like incarceration that feed the "school-to-prison"
pipeline. This week, President Obama's Administration issued new
guidelines for public school officials aimed at cutting short the
"school-to-prison" pipeline that wastes public funds and, more
importantly, human lives.
The guidelines address the same issue as my Restorative Justice in
Schools Act, which I reintroduced in October to reduce youth
incarceration throughout America by helping train school personnel such
as teachers and counselors in innovative conflict resolution methods
that are less likely to result in non-violent juveniles entering the
penal system. Currently, many school systems involve the police in
non-violent incidents on school property, which helps feed the
"school-to-prison" pipeline when other methods may be more effective
and produce more positive outcomes.
President Obama's Administration introduced guidelines to cut short a
cycle that disproportionately harms minority communities. By
redesigning school disciplinary policies and training educators in
alternative conflict resolution methods that yield better results for
everyone, we can keep our young people out of jail and provide better
outcomes and improved healing for victims while saving taxpayer money.
I applaud the Administration's new guidelines and will continue working
to pass the Restorative Justice in Schools Act in Congress.
Working to Designate Memphis as a "Promise Zone" Community
On Thursday afternoon, President Obama designated the first 5 of 20
"Promise Zone" communities, which will give those communities vital
support to help reduce poverty and grow local economies. While Memphis
was not eligible for the first round of designations made by President
Obama, the funding and support provided by the program is critical for
our city. So we must do everything in our power to be one of the next
15 communities designated.
As the nation's poorest large metropolitan area, Memphis deserves
substantial support from the federal government to help recover from
the devastating impacts of the Great Recession. I am doing all within
my power to ensure that the Administration gives Memphis the
consideration it deserves for the next round of "Promise Zone"
designations-it's a great way for us to eliminate concentrated poverty
and increase the economic vitality of the city. I will continue working
closely with Mayor Wharton to see Memphis included in the "Promise
Zone" initiative.
AutoZone Park
I am very pleased that the Memphis City Council approved the purchase
of AutoZone Park, which will result in the St. Louis Cardinals taking
over the management of the Redbirds. It will be good for our city and
for our economy. I was particularly proud as the purchase of AutoZone
Park is financed through the sales tax rebate which I initiated and
passed as a Tennessee State Senator.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not
had access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to
afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in
Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. Open enrollment for coverage in 2014 will continue until March
31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage, you may also be
eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage
option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need
health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open enrollment period
closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on
Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription
medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health
insurance companies can no longer discriminate against patients with
pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on
their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care
Act Navigators at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street
(Suite 900) for in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at
(901) 528-8341, and they will be hosting an informational session at
Christ Missionary Baptist Church (480 S. Parkway East) from 6 to 8 PM
on Tuesday evening. If you have any other questions, you should feel
free to call my office at (901) 544-4131.
Taking Advantage of the Affordable Care Act
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A
recent New York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major American city for
African-American women with breast cancer." A primary reason for the
high mortality rate is late diagnosis, when the disease is harder to
treat and has much lower survival rates. If you are at risk, please
take a moment in the coming weeks to take advantage of provisions of
the Affordable Care Act and get screened for breast cancer-it can help
save your life.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

2014
District
Issues
Meeting
On
Monday
morning,
I
hosted
my
2014
District
Issues
Meeting
in
my
Memphis
office.
Hearing
what
constituents
like
you
have
to
say
about
the
issues
is
very
important
to
me.
At
the
meeting,
I
discussed
a
number
of
topics
with
Memphians,
including
what
I
hope
Congress
can
accomplish
in
the
coming
year,
how
to
strengthen
the
middle
class
by
raising
the
minimum
wage
and
extending
emergency
unemployment
insurance,
and
how
we
all
can
take
advantage
of
the
Affordable

Act&#8217;s
many
benefits.
Hearing
what
Memphians
like
you
think
about
these
important
issues,
as
well
as
others
like
supporting
our
veterans,
helping
minority
farmers
recover
from
unfair
discrimination,
and
growing
jobs,
helps
me
better
represent
the
Ninth
District
in
Congress.
At
this
year&#8217;s
District
Issues
Meeting,
I
had
a
chance
to visit
with recording
artist
Ekpe.
He
shared
with
me
his
style
of
positive
affirmation
rap
which
encourages
children
to
believe
in
themselves
and
their
ability
to
learn.
I
was
impressed
with
his
efforts
to
improve
the
lives
of
children
in
the
Memphis
community,
including
his
songs
&#8220;Don&#8217;t
Touch
a
Gun&#8221;
and
&#8220;I
am
a
Genius&#8221;
&#8211;
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
take
a
moment
to
listen
to
his
work.
50 th
Anniversary
of
the
War
on
Poverty
This
week
marked
the
50 th
Anniversary
of
President
Lyndon
Johnson
declaring
"War
on
Poverty."
As
a
nation,
we&#8217;ve
made
great
progress
toward
reducing
poverty
in
America
over
the
last
50
years.
But
while
the
poverty
rate
has
dropped
nearly
10%
since
1967,
there
still
remained
nearly
50
million
American
citizens
living
in
poverty
as
recently
as
2012&#8212;including
more
than
13
million
children.
These
numbers
only
highlight
how
much
more
work
we
have
left
ahead
of
us
and
the
urgency
with
which
it
must
be
addressed.
We
must
do
more
to
help
people
work
their
way
to
the
American
Dream,
and
that
means
extending
the
lifeline
of
unemployment
insurance
to
more
than
1.4
million
hardworking
Americans
struggling
to
find
work
and
fighting
for
the
30
million
employees
who
still
don&#8217;t
take
home
a
decent
wage
after
a
long
week&#8217;s
work.
It
means
preventing
crippling
cuts
to
the
food
stamp
program
that
would
take
food
out
of
the
mouths
of
children
and
seniors,
making
sure
that
women
receive
equal
pay
for
equal
work,
and
creating
the
good-paying
jobs
that
allow
people
to
get
back
on
their
feet. This
must
be
done
now
because
the
need
is
now.
Cutting
Short
the
&#8220;School-to-Prison&#8221;
Pipeline
Unless
dealt
with
early
and
effectively,
young
perpetrators
of
minor,
non-violent
offenses
may
fall
into
a
pattern
of
violent
conduct
later
in
life.
Instead
of
focusing
on
conflict
resolution
methods
that
could
limit
this
cycle,
too
often
our
schools
rely
on
overly
harsh
punishments
like
incarceration
that
feed
the
"school-to-prison"
pipeline.
This
week,
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
issued
new
guidelines
for
public
school
officials
aimed
at
cutting
short
the
"school-to-prison"
pipeline
that
wastes
public
funds
and,
more
importantly,
human
lives.
The
guidelines
address
the
same
issue
as
my
Restorative
Justice
in
Schools
Act ,
which
I
reintroduced
in
October
to
reduce
youth
incarceration
throughout
America
by
helping
train
school
personnel
such
as
teachers
and
counselors
in
innovative
conflict
resolution
methods
that
are
less
likely
to
result
in
non-violent
juveniles
entering
the
penal
system.
Currently,
many
school
systems
involve
the
police
in
non-violent
incidents
on
school
property,
which
helps
feed
the
&#8220;school-to-prison&#8221;
pipeline
when
other
methods
may
be
more
effective
and
produce
more
positive
outcomes.
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
introduced
guidelines
to
cut short
a
cycle
that
disproportionately
harms
minority
communities.
By
redesigning
school
disciplinary
policies
and
training
educators
in
alternative
conflict
resolution
methods
that
yield
better
results
for
everyone,
we
can
keep
our
young
people
out
of
jail
and
provide
better
outcomes
and
improved
healing
for
victims
while
saving
taxpayer
money.
I
applaud
the
Administration&#8217;s
new
guidelines
and
will
continue
working
to
pass
the
Restorative
Justice
in
Schools
Act
in
Congress.
Working
to
Designate
Memphis
as
a
&#8220;Promise
Zone&#8221;
Community
On
Thursday
afternoon,
President
Obama
designated
the
first
5
of
20
&#8220;Promise
Zone&#8221;
communities,
which
will
give
those
communities
vital
support
to
help
reduce
poverty
and
grow
local
economies.
While
Memphis
was
not
eligible
for
the
first round
of designations
made
by
President
Obama,
the
funding
and
support
provided
by
the
program
is
critical
for
our
city.
So
we
must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
be
one
of
the
next
15
communities
designated.
As the
nation&#8217;s
poorest
large
metropolitan
area,
Memphis
deserves
substantial
support
from
the
federal
government
to
help
recover
from
the
devastating
impacts
of
the
Great
Recession.
I
am
doing
all within
my
power
to
ensure that
the
Administration
gives
Memphis
the
consideration
it
deserves
for
the
next
round
of
"Promise
Zone"
designations&#8212;it&#8217;s
a
great
way
for
us
to
eliminate
concentrated
poverty
and
increase
the
economic
vitality
of
the
city.
I
will
continue
working
closely
with
Mayor
Wharton
to
see
Memphis
included
in
the
"Promise
Zone"
initiative.
AutoZone
Park
I
am
very
pleased
that
the
Memphis
City
Council
approved
the
purchase
of
AutoZone
Park,
which
will
result
in
the
St.
Louis
Cardinals
taking
over
the
management
of
the
Redbirds.
It
will
be good
for
our
city
and
for
our
economy.
I
was
particularly
proud
as
the
purchase
of
AutoZone
Park
is
financed
through
the
sales
tax
rebate
which
I
initiated
and
passed
as
a
Tennessee
State
Senator.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Open
enrollment
for
coverage
in
2014
will
continue
until
March
31st. And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.
Visit
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
look
at
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
recent
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
Many
of
the
Marketplace
website
issues
that
have
been
in
the
news
recently
have
been
resolved. However,
the
Marketplace
website
is

Taking
Advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
recent
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
If
you
are
at
risk,
please
take
a
moment
in
the
coming
weeks
to
take
advantage
of
provisions
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
get
screened
for
breast
cancer&#8212;it
can
help
save
your
life.
