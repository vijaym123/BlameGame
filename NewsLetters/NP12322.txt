Dear
Friends:
It was great to hear Governor Rick Scott's announcement of State
support of Orlando International Airport's new Intermodal
Transportation Center after having just completed a tour of Miami's similar
facility.
I am standing in front of the new Tri-Rail station
that will soon open connecting commuter rail, Metrorail and the Miami
Airport together with car rental, bus and surface transportation
systems. While its taken three decades for South Florida to finally connect
all these transportation modes together plus costly retrofits, Central
Florida can do it right the first time avoiding a costly piecemeal
approach. This is great news for our regions future stable growth, jobs
and our economy. You can read my press relase on this important
infrastructure project
here .
For additional information on this or any other issue,

With my regards and
best wishes, I remain
Most
respectfully,
John L.
