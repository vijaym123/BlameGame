Forbes Receives Navy Leagues Sea Service Award
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, has been honored with the Navy League National Capital Council Sea Services Award in recognition of his long-time advocacy for Americas Sea Services.
Providing for the national security of the United States is the principal responsibility of all those privileged to hold public office, Congressman Forbes said. I am honored that the Navy League, an organization long committed to advocating on behalf of our Sea Services and its sailors, would present me with this prestigious award. I look forward to continuing to partner with the Navy League as we work to provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to defend American national security.
Given annually, this award is granted for outstanding contributions to the Sea Services of the United States involving the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine. To commemorate the award, recipient names are engraved on the compass binnacle from the Sioux Falls Victory Ship, which served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
