Nancy Pelosi emailed you today.
Vice President Biden emailed you today.
They&rsquo;re asking for your help because what happened today was unprecedented.

We cannot let this ugly attack on President Obama go unanswered. We still need 271 donations to hit our goal tonight. David, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in yet today -- can we count on you now?
