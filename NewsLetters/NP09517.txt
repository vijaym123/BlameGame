$121 million. That is the price for fixing and upgrading the Obamacare website for a second round of enrollments, according to
reports
by the Washington Times citing Accenture Federal Services, the company hired to replace the original contractor
who was fired in the face of the first disastrous roll out.
As hefty a bill as $121 million is to put on the taxpayers tab, unfortunately that is not the only price we have to pay. The Affordable Care Act is also costing some hardworking Americans their jobs. Its costing certain families their existing coverage. Its costing higher premiums for many previously insured individuals, and has created enormous instability in the health care industry.
The bottom line is this:
its going to take a lot more than tech guys to fix Obamacare. The $121 million website might work, but Obamacare still wont.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - I supported the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act,
H.R. 3811 , requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to quickly notify individuals of any security breach of health care exchange system information that results in personally identifiable information of the individual being stolen or unlawfully accessed.
