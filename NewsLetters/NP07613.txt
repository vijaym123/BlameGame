Top Election Forecaster: Illinois&rsquo;s 10th a &ldquo;Pure Toss Up&rdquo;
David --
If you thought Brad was going to coast to re-election, think again.
The nation&rsquo;s foremost election expert just shifted Brad&rsquo;s rematch against Republican Bob Dold to a &ldquo;PURE TOSS UP.&rdquo;
We knew this race was going to be tight -- but with this latest news, the entire Republican establishment will pour in cash to try and break the tie. Need proof?
Last election alone, Dold and right-wing groups spent a mind-boggling
$9,500,000
in the run up to Election Day. In 2014, it could be even worse.
David, it&rsquo;s time to go on offense for Brad. Are you in?
