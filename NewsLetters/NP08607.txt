Friends,
What a difference a week makes.
Seven days ago I was encouraged to learn of actions taken by the
Director of the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System to report
incidents of malfeasance and hold the employees accountable for
wrongdoing. But now, a week later, I am disturbed and disheartened
after discovering that the so-called action didn't really happen.
When our local VA director asked me for a meeting to discuss the
situation, I was eager to hear what he said. The director made it clear
to me and my staff that those responsible for falsifying wait list
records in Central Alabama were no longer working at the VA, due in
part to action he took to remove them.
As has been reported
by the Montgomery Advertiser and the Associated Press, it
turns out that wasn't true. No one was fired. Some retired and others
may have been moved around, but no one was removed. That means
employees responsible for falsifying wait list records are still
working
at the VA in
Alabama.
The director later apologized for what he called a misunderstanding of
him repeatedly saying employees were "relieved of their duties." I don't
think there was a misunderstanding at all. Based on the unmistakable
tenor of the conversation, I think it was misleading.
This breach of trust has caused my office to dig even deeper into what
is really going on at the VA in Montgomery. I believe there is more to
this story. This week I am dispatching top staff members
- my Chief of Staff and my Military Legislative
Counsel - to Alabama to field information and provide a specific
opportunity for face to face meetings with those who believe they have
important information or documents about the VA.
The purpose is to improve our understanding of what is happening so
that I can conduct the necessary oversight and take the necessary
legislative steps to correct the problem. I'll keep you updated on what
develops.
The House Acts to Aid Veterans
In an overwhelming show of support for our veterans, the House passed
the Veteran's Access to Care Act by a vote of 421-0.
This bill allows any veteran forced to wait more than 30 days for an
appointment the option to receive private-sector care. The Senate also
acted on broader VA legislation, part of which related to utilizing
local healthcare options.
I have long advocated for utilizing the many great doctors and
hospitals in our communities to get veterans the care they need right
away. Patient Centered Community Care already exists within the VA to
streamline veterans' access to local, private sector care. I'll
continue to push for this commonsense solution as the House and Senate
work out a final agreement on VA reforms.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the full House is expected to begin consideration of the
Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Appropriations bill. This bill has been
through the rigorous committee process and contains many key provisions
to help provide for strong national security.
Within the Defense Appropriations bill, there are important measures
that ensure Fort Rucker and Maxwell-Gunter continue to be among the
best military installations in the country.
Additionally, the House is expected to consider H.R. 4413, the Customer
Protection and End User Relief Act, which would reauthorize the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or a member of my
staff if we can ever be of help to you. It is an honor to serve as your
representative in Congress.
Sincerely,
Washington DC

Friends,
What
a
difference
a
week
makes.
Seven
days
ago
I
was
encouraged
to
learn
of
actions
taken
by
the
Director
of
the
Central
Alabama
Veterans
Health
Care
System
to
report
incidents
of
malfeasance
and
hold
the
employees
accountable
for
wrongdoing.
But
now,
a
week
later,
I
am
disturbed
and
disheartened
after
discovering
that
the
so-called
action
didn&#8217;t
really
happen.
When
our
local
VA
director
asked
me
for
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
situation,
I
was
eager
to
hear
what
he
said.
The
director
made
it
clear
to
me
and
my
staff that
those
responsible
for
falsifying
wait
list
records
in
Central
Alabama
were
no
longer
working
at
the
VA,
due
in
part
to
action
he
took
to
remove
them.
As
has
been
reported
by
the
Montgomery
Advertiser
and
the
Associated
Press,
it
turns
out
that
wasn&#8217;t
true.
No
one
was
fired.
Some
retired
and
others
may
have
been
moved
around,
but
no
one
was
removed.
That
means
employees
responsible
for
falsifying
wait
list
records
are
still
working
at
the
VA
in
Alabama.
The
director
later
apologized
for
what
he
called
a
misunderstanding
of
him
repeatedly
saying
employees
were
&#8220;relieved
of
their
duties.&#8221;
I
don&#8217;t
think
there
was
a
misunderstanding
at
all.
Based
on
the
unmistakable
tenor
of
the
conversation,
I
think
it
was
misleading.
This
breach
of
trust
has
caused
my
office
to
dig
even
deeper
into
what
is
really
going
on
at
the
VA
in
Montgomery.
I
believe
there
is
more
to
this
story.
This
week
I
am
dispatching
top
staff
members
&#8211;
my
Chief
of
Staff
and
my
Military
Legislative
Counsel
&#8211;
to
Alabama
to
field
information
and
provide
a
specific
opportunity
for
face
to
face
meetings
with
those
who
believe
they
have
important
information
or
documents
about
the
VA.
The
purpose
is
to
improve
our
understanding
of
what
is
happening
so
that
I
can
conduct
the
necessary
oversight
and
take
the
necessary
legislative
steps
to
correct
the
problem.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
