The Scalise Capitol Report

Big step toward coastal restoration: RESTORE funds flowing to Gulf
States
Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a rule allowing Gulf
States to begin applying for funds made available by the Resources and
Ecosystem Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities and Revived Economies
of the Gulf Coastal States (RESTORE) Act for the purpose of
environmental restoration and economic development projects. This
announcement is a victory and big step forward for the people of Louisiana.
The economy, culture and heritage of our great state are shaped and
influenced by our unique coastline and wetlands. As many families and
businesses continue to struggle in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon
spill, the RESTORE Act which I led the effort to pass, stands as the
single most significant action taken to revitalize our coastline. This
rule finally enables much-needed funds to start flowing to our coastal
communities as they continue to recover.
Cutting red tape for Louisiana
mariners
The recent rollout of the new Transportation Worker
Identification Credential (TWIC) OneVisit program, which resulted from legislation
I originally introduced in the House, will eliminate the requirement
for thousands of transportation workers to make multiple trips to a
TWIC enrollment center. It streamlines the process for transportation
workers, including Louisiana mariners, to obtain the credentials they
need so that they can do their jobs. We have finally cut wasteful red
tape so transportation workers no longer have to make multiple trips to
a TWIC enrollment center, which for some workers can be hundreds of
miles away. After listening to workers and business leaders throughout
southeast Louisiana, I led the effort in Congress to reform the TWIC
program and am thankful that the Department of Homeland Security has
finally implemented this common-sense reform. Reforms of this magnitude
would not have been possible without broad cooperation from a
bipartisan group of members of Congress dedicated to solving this problem by
eliminating the unnecessary TWIC Second Trip. This is a great example
of Congress working together to eliminate a burdensome federal mandate
and delivering results for hard-working
taxpayers.
Meeting with
you
Last
week, I had the opportunity to speak at the St. Tammany West Chamber and
the Rotary Club of Metairie. I shared what Im doing in Congress to
repeal and replace Obamacare, to ensure RESTORE funds are spent wisely,
to fight for a better quality of life for our nations veterans and
to stop the IRS from stifling free speech. We also discussed what House
Republicans are doing to create jobs, grow the economy and secure our
borders.
It is an
honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit
