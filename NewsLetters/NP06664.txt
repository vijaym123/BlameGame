David --
Millions of people are proud to have cast historic votes in 2008 and 2012 for President Obama.
And it&rsquo;s true that Barack Obama&rsquo;s name won&rsquo;t appear on the ballot this year. But November 2014 really is his last election.
The results this November will determine whether the President has a Congress that will work with him -- and for the middle-class -- in his final two years.
President Obama needs your vote this one last time -- and so do we.
So David -- Will you sign your name and commit to vote in 2014?

Believe it or not, today marks exactly 2 months until Election Day.
And in many states, early voting starts even sooner.
That doesn&rsquo;t leave us much time to reach Michelle Obama&rsquo;s goal of 1 million commitments to vote.
Will you add your name now?
