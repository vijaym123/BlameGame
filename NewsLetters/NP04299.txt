Last week, the President announced his executive actions to change the immigration laws of this country,
exempting millions
living here illegally from deportation.
This announcement came just over a year after the President
warned
against the belief that if Congress doesnt act, a president can, sign something and thatll take care of it and we wont have to worry about it. President Obama went on to say that would be, "ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.
I
believe
that the Presidents intention to act unilaterally to change our immigration laws is a blatant disregard of the separation of powers as laid out in the Constitution. Entry into the United States is not a right, but a privilege.
For these reasons, I will
continue
to oppose amnesty and support the
House Judiciary Committee
in using every tool at its disposal to fight the Presidents planned executive amnesty.
Question of the week :
Do you support changes to the immigration laws through executive action by the President, rather than through legislation passed by Congress?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
