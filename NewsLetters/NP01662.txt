David --
Child care is a major expense for working families across Illinois.
In fact, the average cost of child care in Illinois is $12,697 per year.
That&rsquo;s a huge burden for middle class families to bare -- and leaves many unsure on how to afford quality child care for their kids.
Cheri&rsquo;s standing up for Illinois families and demanding Congress help make child care more affordable.
Sign your name: Support making child care more affordable &gt;&gt;
Cheri&rsquo;s committed to ensuring economic opportunity for all Illinois families. And making child care more affordable is a common sense and important step in the right direction.
Stand with Cheri to support more affordable child care: http://action.cheribustos.com/affordable-child-care
