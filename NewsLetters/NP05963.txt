-- This election is TIED, 4O% - 4O%.
We repeat: control of Congress is at stake, and this election is TIED.
-- Boehner&rsquo;s determined to overpower our Democratic campaigns and take the lead. In fact, he&rsquo;s spending $6 million THIS WEEK to fill your TV with deceptive ads.
-- The most critical fundraising deadline we&rsquo;ll face is in just 24 hours. That is why we are offering a Democratic
TRIPLE-MATCH for only 24 hours.
