A Christmas Message
As families travel from far and wide to come together around this time
of year, I hope you also take a moment to think about those who don't
have a place to go, are struggling to make ends meet, or are dealing
with the heartbreak of losing loved ones.
As North Dakotans, we know that times can sometimes be tough. We have
faced severe winters, crop losses, and economic stresses. But we also
know the importance of resilience - because we always come out on top.
But we can't do it alone. We need the support of our family, friends,
neighbors, and others in our communities. We are a people that put
aside our differences and help each other - in good times and bad. The
holiday season is a particular reminder of that ethic and of why we are
proud to be North Dakotans.
This holiday season, my staff and I donated
Christmas gifts to foster children on the Standing Rock Sioux
Reservation.
This season, and throughout the entire year, I encourage all North
Dakotans to put this spirit into action. Whether it's visiting folks at
your local senior center, volunteering your time and energy at a food
bank or homeless shelter, giving a gift for an Angel Tree, or donating
some of the clothes you no longer wear, there are countless ways to
give back to your community. I know many of us can be incredibly busy
with our day-to-day lives. But we can't ever forget to press pause and
lend a hand to our neighbors in need. It's the North Dakota way.
God Bless and Merry Christmas.

A
Christmas
Message
As
families
travel
from
far
and
wide
to
come
together
around
this
time
of
year,
I
hope
you
also
take
a
moment
to
think
about
those
who
don&#8217;t
have
a
place
to
go,
are
struggling
to
make
ends
meet,
or
are
dealing
with
the
heartbreak
of
losing
loved
ones.
As
North
Dakotans,
we
know
that
times
can
sometimes
be
tough.
We
have
faced
severe
winters,
crop
losses,
and
economic
stresses.
But
we
also
know
the
importance
of
resilience
&#8211;
because
we
always
come
out
on
top.
But
we
can&#8217;t
do
it
alone.
We
need
the
support
of
our
family,
friends,
neighbors,
and
others
in
our
communities.
We
are
a
people
that
put
aside
our
differences
and
help
each
other
&#8211;
in
good
times
and
bad.
The
holiday
season
is
a
particular
reminder
of
that
ethic
and
of
why
we
are
proud
to
be
North
Dakotans.
This
holiday
season,
my
staff
and
I
donated
Christmas
gifts
to
foster
children
on
the
Standing
Rock
Sioux
Reservation.
This
season,
and
throughout
the
entire
year,
I
encourage
all
North
Dakotans
to
put
this
spirit
into
action.
Whether
it&#8217;s
visiting
folks
at
your
local
senior
center,
volunteering
your
time
and
energy
at
a
food
bank
or
homeless
shelter,
giving
a
gift
for
an
Angel
Tree,
or
donating
some
of
the
clothes
you
no
longer
wear,
there
are
countless
ways
to
give
back
to
your
community.
I
know
many
of
us
can
be
incredibly
busy
with
our
day-to-day
lives.
But
we
can&#8217;t
ever
forget
to
press
pause
and
lend
a
hand
to
our
neighbors
in
need.
It&#8217;s
the
North
Dakota
way.
God
Bless
and
Merry
Christmas.
