CONSTITUENT SERVICES
ISSUES AND LEGISLATION
June 21, 2015
Putting
Patients First:
This week and next, I am voting to repeal
two provisions of the Presidents healthcare law. On Thursday, I voted
to repeal the medical device tax, which increases the costs of
important medical devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators,
replacement joints and even dentures.
This misguided tax not only makes
healthcare costlier, it also impedes medical innovation in Kansas and
around the country. Next week, the House will act to stop the
Independent Panel Advisory Board (IPAB) which is a board of 15 members
appointed by President Obama to ration seniors access to
healthcare.
I am proud to be part of the Republican majority working to stop the
harmful effects of the Presidents healthcare law. It is the time for
us all to work together and stop the damage this law is doing to
America and replace it with solutions that lower costs and empower patients
to choose the care thats right for them.
On Tuesday at the weekly Republican
Leadership Press Conference I spoke about the Republican plan for
improving healthcare as well as on the potentially significant consequences
of the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the Obamacare subsidies
case. To watch my remarks,

Putting The American People In The Drivers Seat On
Trade:
This Thursday, the House once again voted to approve
Trade Promotion Authority in order to prevent the President from
negotiating bad trade deals by putting Congress and the American people in the
drivers seat.
Trade Promotion AuthorityorTPA is not a trade
deal, but a process that gives Congress and the American people the
power in trade deals. The fact is, we cant trust this President, and
that is exactly the reason we need TPA
to make sure that Congress has
the final say so this President has to listen to the priorities of
the American people.
To read more about why I think restricting
thePresident through TPA will create jobs and be good for Kansas, click here .
Discovering The Truth About
Benghazi :
Nearly three years after the tragic incidents in Benghazi, the
administration, Secretary Clinton, and her advisors still refuse to cooperate.
Just this week, Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal handed over even
more emails and documents between heand Secretary Clinton and admitted
he made no attempts to verify the information he gave to Secretary
Clinton. Finding out what happened in an American tragedy should be a
bipartisan priority, but time and again those with the necessary
information continue to stall. I applaud Chairman Gowdy for his worthy ongoing
efforts to discover the truth.
Hosting Pizza &amp;
Politics For GOP Interns:
This week I hosted a
Pizza &amp; Politics event for our congressional summer interns
featuring Chairman Paul Ryan. A couple of the great nuggets he shared with the
group is that attitude is everything and to know who you are and
what you believe in. That was definitely great advice from an
outstanding political leader and even better friend. It was a great event for
these future leaders who do an incredible job at our U.S. Capitol
every day!
Talking To The Kansas Electric Cooperatives Youth
Tour:
The Kansas Electric Cooperatives annual Youth Tour
kicked off this week where young people from all over Kansascome and learn
about our nations capital. It was a pleasure to meet and speak to
these bright minds from all over our state.
Chatting With 4-H
Students:
As a former 4-H student myself its always
great to see them stop by the office and tell me about their projects,
goals, and what they are learning in DC. Good luck to all these
fantastic students!
Meeting With Students From Seaman
MiddleSchool:
I really enjoyed meeting 7th grade students from
Seaman Middle School this week. These students were in town to present
their original history research projects here at the Capitol building
and I was definitely impressed. Keep up the great work!
Upcoming
Coffees with Your Congresswoman:
On Tuesday, June
30 th , and Wednesday, July 1 st , I will be hosting
several Coffees with your Congresswoman all over Eastern Kansas. I
hope you can drop by, have a cup of coffee, and speak with me directly
about the issues most important to you. Listening to Kansans is my top
priority and I look forward to hearing your ideas and bringing them
back to Washington.
