Dear
Friend,
Last week in Colorado
Springs, I was able to take a tour of the new VA Super Clinic opening
August 18th on Fillmore and Centennial just to the west of I-25. This
facility will be a monumental improvement for the tens of thousands of
veterans who call the Fifth Congressional District home. With expanded
staff, square footage, and options for care, this new Super Clinic will
help cut back on the trips Southern Colorado veterans have to make to
Denver for medical
care.

enjoyed by veterans at the new VA Super
Clinic
I also spent time during the Work Week
visiting our Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, meeting with the
Pikes Peak United Way, visiting Wagner Equipment, learning about the
great work being done at Colorado Engineering Inc., meeting with
constituents to discuss VA issues, and participated in a wonderful local
Independence Day parade. You will read more about these events, and what has
happened this week in Washington, in the rest of the
Ledger.
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's Happening in
Colorado
I
appreciate meeting with
President and CEO Jason Wood, Board Member Stephannie
Finley, and the team at the Pikes Peak United Way. We discus sed their "Making the Case for Change" approach
to charity and strengthening the
community.
I received a tour of the nearly complete
VA Super Clinic being constructed on Fillmore and Centennial just west
of I-25. This Super Clinic will provided expanded and additional
services to our Southern Colorado veterans, cutting down on the need for
trips to the VA Hospital in Denver. Thanks to Colorado Springs Clinic
Manager Carolyn Jewell and her team for taking me through this
fantastic new facility. I was also able to meet with Denver VA Director
Lynette Roth and question her face-to-face on wait times and issues in our
region. I feel like this was productive dialogue. I also took a tour of
the soon-to-be-closed Spruce Street VA Clinic. The difference between
this aged facility and the new Super Clinic will be night and day for
our veterans.

Thank you to Nancy and Larry Scally for taking me

done at their local small business, Colorado Engineering
Inc.

I also had
two very important meetings in my local office. First up, I met
with representatives from the Navy League to discuss their legislative
priorities for the upcoming year. Following that meeting, I was honored
to have constituent Rebecca Hussey meet with me. She discussed
with me some of the difficulties her father had with the VA medical
system in Nevada. I am grateful that she shared this information with me,
as it will be very helpful in future Veterans Affairs Committee
hearings.

Thank you to everyone who took part in the Monument Valley
Independence Day Parade. Every time that I take part in this parade, I am
very impressed with the patriotism and dedication to America that is
displayed each and every year.
I was also able to tour the Sandia National Laboratories. These
facilities are critical to our national security and nuclear science and
technology efforts. Thanks to the team at Sandia for giving me a very
comprehensive and informative tour.

FIGHTING FOR OUR
VETERANS
This week, I took part in two hearings of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee. The first discussed and examined
how the VA Department handles
the complaints and actions of whistleblowers. These brave men and
women have stepped forward to r eveal
very disturbing information on the VA system. It is important that
their efforts are protected and that they are not punished for speaking
out. The second hearing of the week addressed mental health and
suicide prevention programs in the VA. Both hearings resulted in extremely
powerful testimony, both from whistleblowers and families impacted by
suicide and other mental health issues. Thanks to everyone for
exhibiting the bravery and courage to participate in our hearings, it was
greatly
appreciated.

PARTNERING WITH SENATOR TED
CRUZ
I am honored to
once again partner with Senator Ted Cruz on important anti-terrorism
legislation. I am also pleased that this is a bipartisan leadership
effort thanks to the participation of my Democratic colleague, Congressman
Brad Sherman of California.
This legislation will offer a reward of up to $5 million for
information on or the capture of the Hamas terrorists who kidnapped and
murdered Naftali Fraenkel, an Israeli-U.S. citizen, on June 12, 2014.
Naftali was one of three Jewish teens who was killed by Hamas terrorists,
along with Gil-Ad Shaer and Eyal Yifra I was joined in filing the
House version of Senator Cruz's bill by Congressman Sherman
(CA-30).
The Israeli governments aggressive action against both the
kidnappers and Hamas is a just and appropriate action to both bring the
terrorists responsible to justice, and to degrade their capability to
launch further attacks, Sen. Cruz said. "No one doubts Israels
ability to carry out this mission, but given Naftalis citizenship, I
believe the United States should demonstrate our clear support for Israel by
offering a reward as we traditionally have in terrorist attacks
involving Americans. This support should be understood in the context of
our partnership with the nation of Israel in the fight against radical
Islamic terrorism, which is our fight as well. Im proud to work with
Congressman Lamborn on this
legislation.
This bill will require
the Secretary of State to use the Rewards for Justice program to offer a
five million dollar reward for information that leads to the capture
of the terrorists responsible for the death an American citizen,
ensuring that they will never again be allowed to murder innocent
teenagers. The silence from the Obama Administration is truly appalling. Doing
nothing in the face of such a heinous action is not an option. Thats
why Senator Cruz, Congressman Sherman, and I are working on moving
this solution forward in a bipartisan
manner.
FIGHTING TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN
BORDER
I spoke on the House
Floor regarding the current crisis taking place at our southern border. I
emphasized my leadership efforts to increase funding for our National
Guard, so that they are able to deploy more troops along the southern
border of the United States.

WORKING TO BRING BACK OUR
MARINE
This
week, I signed on to the Congressional letters of support being
sent to the lawyer and judge in the Sgt. Tahmooressi case. It is
important that Mexican officials understand our determination to bring Sgt.
Tahmooressi back to America. I have discussed this issue with the
State Department and have been partnering with Congressman Duncan Hunter
(CA-50) on this very important
issue.
SUPPORTING
ISRAEL
Please see below for my
recent letter to President Obama
calling for the United States to
show support for Israel in its struggle against the terrorists of
Hamas. The letter also questions the President's support for the
Hamas-supporting Palestinian unity
government.

incarceration in Mexico:

The real question is why isn't the Commander in Chief
taking care of this? It would take one phone
call.
Mike
Fernald
-
Boycott Mexico, end of story.
Fran

- I think that we should trade 3
million illegal immigrants for him.
Michael

-
I say we should march in there and relieve
Mexico of our Marine. Just to set a
standard.
