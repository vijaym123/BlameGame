Update from Senator Bob Corker
May 31,
2014
VA
Problems Run Much Deeper Than One Person
Senator
Corker released the following statement yesterday regarding the
resignation of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric
Shinseki.
I appreciate Secretary Shinsekis military and public
service to our country, and while a change in leadership was necessary
the problems run much deeper than one person, said Corker. The
administration must work with Congress to solve the chronic, systemic
problems that exist within the VA so that our nations veterans can receive
the quality and timely care they deserve.
Corker and
Senator Lamar Alexander recently
wrote to
Secretary
Shinseki calling on the VA to conduct a thorough, open and transparent
audit following reports of neglect at some medical facilities,
including allegations that up to 40 patients may have died because of
delayed care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. The senators urged the
department to consider using a third-party auditor to ensure the review
is independent and transparent," and also asked the VA to provide
specific information regarding the average time Tennessee veterans are
waiting for care at VA facilities.
The senators also
wrote to
Under Secretary Petzel, who has since resigned,
requesting an update on the implementation of recommendations made in
an October 2013 VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report on
emergency department patient deaths at the Memphis VA Medical
Center.
Last week, Corker and Alexander joined 23 of their Senate
Republican colleagues in
requesting
an immediate Senate
investigation into reported mismanagement, incompetence, and
corruption within the VA health care centers throughout the
country.
Meeting with Tennessee
Business and Community Leaders
Senator Corker
was in Middle Tennessee on Friday to meet with business and community
leaders at an event hosted by the Brentwood Rotary Club. The senator
provided an update on his work to solve the big issues facing our
nation.

Visiting Troops
Overseas
Over Memorial Day weekend, Senator Corker met with American troops of
the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne Brigade in Estonia, including Private
First Class (PFC) Steven Nunley of Winchester, Tennessee, sent to
conduct training exercises with members of the Estonian Army to further
demonstrate U.S. commitment to the NATO ally.
"My job gives me
the honor of meeting with members of our military stationed around the
world, and Im always deeply moved by my visits with them, said
Corker. On this Memorial Day weekend, it was a privilege to meet with
members of the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne that are far from home and loved
ones to represent the U.S. in Estonia and reassure our commitment to
NATO as the Putin regime continues efforts to destabilize
Ukraine.
In Paldiski, Estonia, Senator Corker speaks with Army PFC
Steven Nunley from Winchester, Tennessee.

aggression in Ukraine.
Troop Levels in Afghanistan
Senator
Corker released the following statement regarding the presidents recent
announcement
on U.S. troop levels in
Afghanistan.
While we all want to see our brave men and women in
uniform return home safely, I applaud the presidents announcement today
that he will support the size of the residual security forces requested
by U.S. commanders, said Corker. Although I am pleased the president
has acknowledged that abandoning Afghanistan at this important moment
would undermine the hard won gains of our armed forces who have
sacrificed so much to protect our country since the 9/11 attacks, it is my
strong desire that the administration revisit conditions on the ground
in 2015 and 2016 to determine if a full withdrawal is
warranted.
