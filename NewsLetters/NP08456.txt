An
Interim Report
from the Veterans Affairs Inspector General concluded that delays in access to care and wait lists are a systemic problem nationwide.
If the VA cant provide medical care to our veterans we need to get them care at a private doctor .
I supported legislation, the Veterans Access to Care Act ( H.R.4810 ), that requires the VA to authorize non-VA care to any enrolled veteran who lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility, or has waited longer than the wait-time goals for a medical appointment. This bill passed unanimously in the House.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - Our veterans are our heroes, and deserve better than waitlists, delays, and abuses.
I will keep
fighting
to make sure they receive the care and benefits theyve earned and deserve.
