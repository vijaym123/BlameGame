A Special Thanksgiving Message
Thanksgiving is a day when we take time out of our busy lives to gather
with family, friends, and neighbors. We remember all that we're
thankful for and enjoy the time we're able to spend with loved ones. We
reflect on all the accomplishments and challenges from the past year
and think about what next the year may hold for us.
As I gather with my friends and family this Thanksgiving, I'll be
thankful for having the privilege of representing California's 8th
District in Congress. I constantly keep in my thoughts and prayers all
the service men and women who are not home this holiday season. They're
serving our nation far away from their families and in harm's way. For
them and for their sacrifices, we are especially grateful. I'll
continue my work to protect our freedoms and to ensure that our
children and grandchildren inherit a stronger more prosperous nation. I
wish you and your family a safe and happy Thanksgiving!
Capitol Update
Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act
Congressman Cook voted last week to enhance America's energy security.
HR 1900 passed by a bipartisan majority of 252-165. It will help expand
energy exploration and lower energy costs for California's 8th
District. The vote speeds up the federal review process for
applications to build new natural gas pipelines, just like the Keystone
Pipeline.
Native American Code Talkers
On November 20, Congressman Cook attended the Congressional Gold Medal
Ceremony honoring Native American code talkers. During World Wars I and
II, Native American code talkers played a critical role in outsmarting
the enemy by transmitting tactical messages in their tribal languages.
An estimated 400 code talkers served in the two wars, according to the
Department of Defense. Congressman Cook was privileged to watch these
heroes being honored in the Capitol.
