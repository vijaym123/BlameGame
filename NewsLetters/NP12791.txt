CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
January 31, 2014
On Monday, I unveiled, along with Senators Coburn
and Hatch The Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and
Empowerment (CARE) Act, a legislative proposal that would repeal Obamacare
and then replace it with common-sense, patient-centered reforms that
reduce health care costs and increase access to affordable, high-quality
care. Unlike Obamacare, which is centered around government mandates
and regulations, the Patient CARE Act empowers the American people to
make their own decisions about their health care needs, and includes
adopting common-sense consumer protections and ensures that no one can
be denied coverage based on their pre-existing health condition. As
regular readers will know, Senator Coburn and I have been introducing
market-oriented health care reform legislation since
2007.
Yesterday, the Center for Health and Economy released an economic
analysis that found that The Patient CARE Act reduces healthcare costs,
lowers premiums, and provides more Americans with health care coverage
than Obamacare. The analysis also found that the proposal reduces the
nation's debt.
The analysis from Center for Health and
Economy can be found here.

Patient CARE Act can be found in the following places:

In
case you missed it, Fox ran an op-ed by Senators Coburn, Hatch and
myself and about our healthcare proposal.
You can read
it here.
On Tuesday, the President
gave his State of the Union address. In his address, President Obama
touched on many issues, most notably on what some would characterize as
income inequality. But it's as if the President, five years into his
term in office, still doesn't understand our country and what makes it
work. The greatest achievement of our modern, free society is not the
promise of equal outcomes -- history is littered with the wrecks of
nations that tried -- but rather equality of opportunity. Unfortunately,
the President's policies are destroying opportunities for families and
businesses across the country in the misguided belief that tearing
down some will benefit all.
The greatest source of
opportunity is economic growth. The surest path to economic growth is to free
our economy from the ineffective policies that the President has put
into place over the five years he has been in office. President Obama has
added more debt than all previous presidents combined. Unemployment,
and underemployment, remain high. If you count Americans who have
stopped looking for work and dropped out of the workforce entirely, it's
near record highs. And the income inequality that the President speaks
about is higher under his administration than at any point since
before the Great Depression. By any measure, our country is less free, more
in debt, less respected abroad, and facing a future where prosperity
and opportunity are reserved for the few.
It is my wish
that the President would stop looking for someone to blame, and instead
spend time thinking about how we can reach bipartisan solutions to the
issues he laid out this evening. I look forward to the President
reaching out for suggestions as how to change our nations current
unsustainable path.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
