Dear Friend -
I spent the last two weeks working in Nevada, traveling around the
Third District meeting with constituents, visiting small businesses,
and speaking with our students about the issues most important to them.
These conversations provide valuable insights for me to take back to
Washington so I can be an effective voice for you in Congress. If you'd
like me to come by your local event, business, or organization, please
contact me.
The best way to keep up with my latest work on your behalf is to
connect with me on social media.
You can find me on Facebook, Twitter,
and Youtube as Rep. Joe Heck.
I hope you'll keep reading to see some highlights from my work around
Nevada. As always, do not hesitate to contact me
any time an issue that concerns you comes before
Congress. It remains an honor and privilege to represent you in the
House.
Sincerely,
- Joe

WellHealth: a model for delivering quality healthcare
Being a physician, I always try to visit with local healthcare
practitioners when I am working in Nevada to get their perspectives on
the state of our healthcare system. Recently, I had the chance to meet
Doctors Volker & Boman and the rest of the leadership team at
WellHealth Quality Care in Las Vegas. WellHealth is part of the
Accountable Care Network, meaning they use a performance-based model
that measures patient care and cost effectiveness when delivering
healthcare treatments. Their innovative, collaborative delivery system
is improving healthcare for Valley residents by providing a truly
patient-centered healthcare experience. In Congress, I am advocating
for healthcare policies that will increase access to care and reduce
costs. To learn more about my work to strengthen healthcare, visit my

UNLV DECA students preparing to make a difference
I recently had a chance to visit with a chapter of DECA students at
UNLV. Nevada DECA is a non-profit organization dedicated to preparing
students for successful careers in marketing, finance, hospitality, and
business management. We met in UNLV's Startup Center where students are
encouraged to explore business ideas and even launch their own
companies. Young entrepreneurs, like the DECA students at UNLV, are an
important part of our country's continued economic recovery. It is
encouraging that UNLV has a group of motivated students willing to
develop their ideas and take risks in the business world. These UNLV
students are on track for success! To learn more about my work to
improve education, visit my education issue page

Spirit of '45 event honors veterans, celebrates "can do" attitude
Our World War II veterans are a special group of men and women worthy
of our utmost respect and gratitude. I had the privilege of
participating in a Spirit of '45 event at the Henderson Pavilion to
honor the achievements of America's Greatest Generation. The Henderson
event celebrated the courage, self-sacrifice, and service displayed by
both World War II veterans and individuals who aided the war efforts
here at home. In my remarks to the crowd, I expressed my sincere hope
that the national unity displayed by our Greatest Generation during the
trying times of World War II and the post-war years will forever
inspire America's future generations. To learn more about my work in
Congress to support all our nation's veterans, click here

Constituent coffee series continues
Over the past two years I have been holding informal constituent
gatherings called a "Cup of Joe" at local coffee shops around the Third
District. The idea is for me to visit with the local business or
franchise owner to talk about the hard work that goes into running a
business and to meet with constituents who stop in to grab their
morning coffee before starting their day. These events have been a
great success and I have enjoyed getting to know folks at the local
coffee shops. I recently stopped in at Dunkin Donuts at Durango & Warm
Springs to hear about how "America runs on Dunkin." I had a great time
visiting with Charlie Mootz as well as some of his customers and look
forward to my next Cup of Joe! If you have a suggestion for where I
should hold my next one, please email me
.
A productive day in Laughlin
Since taking office, my staff and I have worked hard to serve the
outlying areas of District 3 like Searchlight, Boulder City, and
Laughlin. We hold regularly scheduled mobile office hours in these
communities and I make it a point to get out to visit with residents
during district work periods. Last week I was down in Laughlin. My
first stop was Laughlin High School where I spoke to U.S. government
classes about public service, civics, and how our government works.
>From there, I had a chance to check on the status of a project that has
been one of my major local priorities: the Laughlin VA clinic. Progress
is being made and I am pleased to announce that the clinic is on
schedule to open in August.
Finally, I stopped in at
American Legion
Post 60 to end the day visiting with Laughlin residents.
The last two weeks were busy and I will be taking all that I heard in
the meetings and visits back to Washington. It remains an honor and
privilege to represent you in the House of Representatives.

Our
World

II
veterans
are
a
special
group
of
men
and

worthy
of
our
utmost
respect
and
gratitude.

the

displayed
by
both
World

veterans
and
individuals
who
aided
the
war
efforts
here
at

In

I
expressed
my
sincere
hope
that
the

our

A
productive
day
in
Laughlin
Since
taking
office,
my
staff
and
I
have
worked
hard
to
serve
the
outlying
areas
of
District
3
like
Searchlight,
Boulder
City,
and
Laughlin.
We
hold
regularly
scheduled
mobile

hours
in
these
communities
and
I
make
it
a

to
get
out
to
visit

during
district
work
periods.
Last
week
I
was
down
in
Laughlin.
My
first
stop
was
Laughlin
High
School
where
I
spoke
to
U.S.
government
classes
about
public
service,
civics,
and
how
our
government
works.
From
there,
I
had
a
chance
to
check
on
the
status
of
a
project
that
has
been
one
of
my
major
local
priorities:
the
Laughlin
VA
clinic.
Progress
is
being
made
and
I
am
pleased
to
announce
that
the
clinic
is
on
schedule
to
open
in
August.
Finally,
I
stopped
in
at
American
Legion
Post
60
to
end
the
day
visiting
with
Laughlin
residents.
The
last
two
weeks
were
busy
and
I
will
be
taking
all
that
I
heard
in
the
meetings
and
visits
back
to
Washington.
It
remains
an
honor
and
privilege
to
represent
you
in
the

of
Representatives.

you
