After Boehner&rsquo;s House Republicans blocked us from overturning
Citizens United
last week, we knew we couldn&rsquo;t just throw in the towel.
That&rsquo;s why earlier today, we sent you a one question instant poll:
Should we run a campaign holding
Citizens United -defending Republicans accountable for putting their billionaire-backers before the middle class?
91% of you said YES!
That&rsquo;s great news! It&rsquo;s clearer than ever that our community doesn&rsquo;t just support a Constitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United
-- we&rsquo;re willing to fight for it.
So now it&rsquo;s time to get to work. Will you help us raise the $500,000 we need to hold
Citizens United -backing Republicans accountable before tomorrow&rsquo;s mid-month fundraising deadline?
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
