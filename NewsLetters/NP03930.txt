Kansas Common Sense
December 8, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Serving as Senate Aerospace Caucus Co-Chair
On Tuesday, I was honored to be selected to co-chair the Senate
Aerospace Caucus. I will be replacing Senator Saxby Chambliss of
Georgia who is retiring from Congress. The Senate Aerospace Caucus,
founded in 2010, provides a forum for Senators and aerospace industry
representatives to discuss issues of importance to the nation's
defense, civil aviation and space sectors. This caucus strives to:
provide critical oversight of the U.S. government's aerospace defense
industry program; promote increased government investment in U.S.
aviation infrastructure and development; ensure a competitive
industrial base; and promote education and workforce development
programs that prepare Americans for careers in the aerospace industry.
Safeguarding our nation for future generations means both a strong
national defense and a strong economy. The aerospace industry is where
these two priorities converge, and has a direct impact on the
livelihood of many Kansans and particularly the Wichita community.
Wichita is known as the "Air Capital of the World" with roughly 32,000
Kansans who support hundreds of aerospace companies - from large
companies like Airbus, Spirit AeroSystems, Bombardier and Textron, to
smaller suppliers - and their work contributes more than $7 billion
annually Kansas' economy. Wichita ranks third in the United States for
the highest concentration of engineers with more than 7,000 engineers
and engineering technicians, and students continue to be attracted to
Wichita State University's National Institute for Aviation Research
(NIAR). Promoting education, workforce and research development, as
well as increasing manufacturing within the aerospace industry is vital
to our Kansas and national economies.
Kansas' impressive record of accomplishment in aerospace did not happen
by accident - it took hard work and innovation. I look forward to
bringing those same attributes into my work as co-chair of the Senate
Aerospace Caucus to make certain this historical and innovative
American industry remains strong, secure and globally competitive.
President Signs Moran-Jenkins Rural Health Legislation into Law
On Thursday afternoon, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4067,
legislation that prevents the federal government's enforcement of
unreasonable and inflexible regulation on the provision of outpatient
therapy services in Critical Access Hospitals and other small, rural
hospitals in 2014. I introduced the original version of this bill, S.
1954, and it passed the Senate on February 10. Congresswoman Jenkins
introduced an identical version of the bill in the House of
Representatives and she advanced it to passage in the House on
September 9.
In 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) - the
federal agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid - unexpectedly
mandated new rules for "direct supervision" of outpatient therapeutic
services, which include services such as drug infusions, blood
transfusions, casting or splinting fingers, outpatient psychiatric
services, wound debridement, and cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation.
These new rules require that a supervising physician be physically
present in the hospital department at all times when Medicare
beneficiaries receive outpatient therapy services. Imposing an
unrealistic and clinically unnecessary supervision policy jeopardizes
patients' access to important therapy services in their own
communities. Many Kansas hospitals have had to consider cutting
services for their patients or limiting hours of operation in order to
comply with this inflexible regulation. H.R. 4067 prevents CMS'
enforcement of these rules so that a reasonable policy can be
implemented that more adequately reflects the realities of providing
care in rural areas.
This commonsense legislation helps preserve patients' access to
important therapy services in Kansas communities and across the
country. Passage of this law is a positive development, and I plan to
reintroduce legislation in the new Congress to address this therapy
supervision issue on a permanent basis. Thanks to Congresswoman Jenkins
for her extraordinary efforts on this legislation in the House. Click
here
to read more about passage of this legislation.
House Passes the ABLE Act
On Wednesday evening, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the
Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE Act) by a 404-17 vote. As
a sponsor of the ABLE Act since 2012, I am pleased the House approved
this legislation and urge Senate leadership to bring the measure up for
vote in the Senate as soon as possible. The ABLE Act would enable the
creation of tax-exempt ABLE Accounts to assist an individual with a
disability in saving to pay for qualified disability expenses. These
accounts would be structured similar to the 529 tax-advantaged savings
program that allows families to save for college education.
ABLE Accounts will allow individuals with disabilities or the parents
of a child with a disability to save money to cover long-term expenses
such as education, housing, transportation, employment training and
assistive technology. By allowing individuals to save their own money
to support the unique needs of a loved one with a disability, the ABLE
Act encourages personal responsibility and eliminates barriers to work
that can exist within federal entitlement programs. Thanks to Jawanda
and Rachel Mast of Olathe, the Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas
City, and the Down Syndrome Society of Wichita for visiting with me
about this legislation over the past few years. Click here
to read an
article about Jawanda and Rachel's efforts in support of the ABLE Act
that ran in The Kansas City Star.
Greeting Made With Code Award Winner
On Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet Adrienne Cox, an impressive
young woman and Topeka High School student who helped develop the
coding for this year's Kansas State Christmas tree decoration in front
of the White House. Adrienne and other Topeka High students were part
of a national Google project called Made with Code intended to recruit
girls into coding, a field that many computer experts and educators -
as well as Senators like myself - are hoping more female students will
consider. She was in Washington, D.C., along with her teacher Anne
Hageman to see their coding in action at the National Christmas Tree
Lighting. Congratulations to Adrienne and her Topeka High classmates on
a job well done! To read more about the Topeka High School coders,

Kansas Listening Tour Continues
This week, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with two stops. Before
my flight to Washington, I held a town hall meeting in Anderson County
at the Garnett Public Library
. There, I met with area
residents who expressed concern about the role and U.S. involvement in
the United Nations. We also discussed the Keystone XL Pipeline,
concerns about EPA overreach, government spending and veterans' issues.
Thanks again to the staff at the library for hosting this conversation.
>From Garnett, I headed to Coffey County where I held a town hall
meeting in Burlington at the Lyon-Coffey Electric Cooperative, where
Kansans came out to share their thoughts. Topics ranged from veterans
issues and the EPA's proposed navigable waters rule, to tax reform and
concerns with Obamacare. In attendance were Coffey County Commissioner
Kimberly Skillman, Burlington Mayor Gene Merry, and Coffey Health
Systems CEO Randy Lindauer. It was also good to see Craig Meader,
chairman and president of First National Bank of Kansas. Thanks again
to Scott Whittington and Lyon-Coffey Electric Cooperative for hosting.
New Horizons RV in Junction City
Back from Washington this weekend, I had the opportunity to tour and
visit with employees of New Horizons RV in Junction City. In the photo
below, some of those employees are proudly standing in front of one of
the quality homes they build. We visited about a number of issues, but
the conversation focused on how the VA is failing them in their health
and disability needs.
New Horizons is a family owned and managed company that has been
building RVs for more than 25 years. Thanks to New Horizons President
and CEO Phil Brokenicky for the informative tour.
Touring Mercy Regional Health Center
I also had the opportunity to visit Mercy Regional Health Center (MRHC)
in Manhattan. MRHC is a 150-bed hospital providing a wide range of
health care services to the Manhattan community and the surrounding
area. Throughout my time representing Kansans in Washington, D.C., I
have had the opportunity to visit each of our state's 128 community
hospitals. As Ranking Member of Senate Appropriations Health
Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over funding for most agencies
within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, meeting with
Kansas hospital administrators and other health providers gives me
insight on the unique challenges they face caring for diverse groups of
patients across wide areas.
During my visit with MRHC administrators and staff, we discussed
various topics including the impact of the Affordable Care Act and
other federal policies on community hospitals and other health care
providers. Thanks to MRHC CFO Jim Frazier for guiding my tour and to
Jana Bowman for coordinating my visit.

Cheering on the Jayhawks
To end the week, Robba and I were pleased to join University of Kansas
Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little in Allen Fieldhouse as the Jayhawks
hosted the Florida Gators. The atmosphere was electric for the marquee
game, which the Jayhawks won 71-65. Coach Self's team is once again
establishing itself as one of the nation's best. Thanks to Chancellor
Gray-Little for inviting us to the game, and I wish the students good
luck as they prepare for finals.
Honoring Retiring KFB President Steve Baccus
Kansas Farm Bureau this week honored outgoing president Steve Baccus on
his retirement reception in Manhattan. Steve is retiring after serving
on the KFB Board for the past 17 years, the last 12 as its President. I
met Steve many years ago when he was on his local farm bureau board,
and over the years we grew to be friends. As agricultural issues
repeatedly come to the forefront of debate in Washington, Steve has
always been someone who I could count on to give me trustworthy advice
and counsel.
As I said on the Senate floor, Steve embodies many traits we can all
admire, including a deep love for the great state of Kansas, and
gratitude for the many hard working families who provide the food, fuel
and fiber Americans rely on. These traits have earned Steve the respect
of his peers across the country. Steve has been a true public servant
to agriculture and he did it all for the right reasons.
We all owe Steve a debt of gratitude for his service to Kansas
agriculture. I wish him and his wife Patricia well as they enter into
the next chapter of their lives. I look forward to working with
incoming president Steve Felts of Montgomery County. Click here

Serving
as
Senate
Aerospace
Caucus
Co-Chair
On
Tuesday,
I
was
honored
to
be
selected
to
co-chair
the
Senate
Aerospace
Caucus.
I
will
be
replacing
Senator
Saxby
Chambliss
of
Georgia
who
is
retiring
from
Congress.
The
Senate
Aerospace
Caucus,
founded
in
2010,
provides
a
forum
for
Senators
and
aerospace
industry
representatives
to
discuss
issues
of
importance
to
the
nation's
defense,
civil
aviation
and

This
caucus
strives
to:
provide
critical

of
the
U.S.
government&#8217;s
aerospace
defense
industry
program;
promote
increased
government
investment
in
U.S.

ensure
a
competitive
industrial
base;
and
promote
education
and
workforce

programs
that
prepare
Americans
for
careers
in
the
aerospace
industry.
Safeguarding
our
nation
for
future
generations
means
both
a
strong
national
defense
and
a
strong
economy. The
aerospace
industry
is
where
these
two
priorities
converge,
and
has
a
direct
impact
on
the
livelihood
of
many
Kansans
and
particularly
the
Wichita
community.
Wichita
is
known
as
the
&#8220;Air
Capital
of
the
World&#8221;
with
roughly
32,000
Kansans
who
support
hundreds
of
aerospace
companies
&#8211;
from
large
companies
like
Airbus,
Spirit
AeroSystems,
Bombardier
and
Textron,
to
smaller
suppliers
&#8211;
and
their
work
contributes
more
than
$7
billion
annually
Kansas&#8217;
economy.
Wichita
ranks
third
in
the
United
States
for
the
highest
concentration
of
engineers
with
more
than
7,000
engineers
and
engineering
technicians,
and
students
continue

workforce
and
research
development,
as
well
as
increasing
manufacturing
within
the
aerospace
industry
is
vital
to
our
Kansas
and
national
economies.
Kansas&#8217;
impressive
record
of
accomplishment
in
aerospace
did
not
happen
by
accident
&#8211;
it
took
hard
work
and
innovation.
I
look
forward
to
bringing
those
same
attributes
into
my
work
as
co-chair
of
the
Senate
Aerospace
Caucus
to
make
certain
this
historical
and
innovative
American
industry
remains
strong,
secure
and
globally
competitive.
President
Signs
Moran-Jenkins
Rural
Health
Legislation
into
Law
On
Thursday
afternoon,
President
Obama
signed
into
law
H.R.
4067,
legislation
that
prevents
the
federal
government&#8217;s
enforcement
of
unreasonable
and
inflexible
regulation
on
the
provision
of
outpatient
therapy
services
in
Critical
Access
Hospitals
and
other
small,
rural
hospitals
in
2014.
I
introduced
the
original
version
of
this
bill,
S.
1954,
and
it
passed
the
Senate
on
February
10.
Congresswoman
Jenkins
introduced
an
identical
version
of
the
bill
in
the
House
of
Representatives
and
she
advanced
it
to
passage
in
the
House
on
September
9.
In
2009,
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
&#8211;
the
federal
agency
that
administers
Medicare
and
Medicaid
&#8211;
unexpectedly
mandated
new
rules
for
&#8220;direct
supervision&#8221;
of
outpatient
therapeutic
services,
which
include
services
such
as
drug
infusions,
blood
transfusions,
casting
or
splinting
fingers,
outpatient
psychiatric
services,
wound
debridement,
and
cardiac
and
pulmonary
rehabilitation.
These
new
rules
require
that
a
supervising
physician
be
physically
present
in
the
hospital
department
at
all
times
when
Medicare
beneficiaries
receive
outpatient
therapy
services.
Imposing
an
unrealistic
and
clinically
unnecessary
supervision
policy
jeopardizes
patients&#8217;
access
to
important
therapy
services
in
their
own
communities. Many
Kansas
hospitals
have
had
to
consider
cutting
services
for
their
patients
or
limiting
hours
of
operation
in
order
to
comply
with
this
inflexible
regulation.
H.R.
4067
prevents
CMS&#8217;
enforcement
of
these
rules
so
that
a
reasonable
policy
can
be
implemented
that
more
adequately
reflects
the
realities
of
providing
care
in
rural
areas.
This
commonsense
legislation
helps
preserve
patients&#8217;
access
to
important
therapy
services
in
Kansas
communities
and
across
the
country.
Passage
of
this
law
is
a
positive
development,
and
I
plan
to
reintroduce
legislation
in
the
new
Congress
to
address
this
therapy
supervision
issue
on
a
permanent
basis.
Thanks
to
Congresswoman
Jenkins
for
her
extraordinary
efforts
on
this
legislation
in
the
House.

House
Passes
the
ABLE
Act
On
Wednesday
evening,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Achieving
a
Better
Life
Experience
Act
(ABLE
Act)
by
a
404-17
vote.
As
a
sponsor
of
the
ABLE
Act
since
2012,
I
am
pleased
the
House
approved
this
legislation
and
urge
Senate
leadership
to
bring
the
measure
up
for
vote
in
the
Senate
as
soon
as
possible.
The
ABLE
Act
would
enable
the
creation
of
tax-exempt
ABLE
Accounts
to
assist
an
individual
with
a
disability
in
saving
to
pay
for
qualified
disability
expenses.
These
accounts
would
be
structured
similar
to
the
529
tax-advantaged
savings
program
that
allows
families
to
save
for
college
education.
ABLE
Accounts
will
allow
individuals
with
disabilities
or
the
parents
of
a
child
with
a
disability
to
save
money
to
cover
long-term
expenses
such
as
education,
housing,
transportation,
employment
training
and
assistive
technology.
By
allowing
individuals
to
save
their
own
money
to
support
the
unique
needs
of
a
loved
one
with
a
disability,
the
ABLE
Act
encourages
personal
responsibility
and
eliminates
barriers
to
work
that
can
exist
within
federal
entitlement
programs.
Thanks
to
Jawanda

Rachel
Mast
of
Olathe,
the
Down

Greeting
Made
With
Code
Award
Winner
On
Thursday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
Adrienne
Cox,
an
impressive
young
woman
and
Topeka
High
School
student
who
helped
develop
the
coding
for
this
year&#8217;s
Kansas
State
Christmas
tree
decoration
in
front
of
the
White
House.
Adrienne
and other
Topeka
High
students
were
part
of
a
national
Google
project
called
Made
with
Code
intended
to
recruit
girls
into
coding,
a
field
that
many
computer
experts
and
educators
&#8211;
as
well
as
Senators
like
myself
&#8211;
are
hoping
more
female
students
will
consider.
She
was
in
Washington,
D.C.,
along
with
her
teacher
Anne
Hageman
to
see
their
coding
in
action
at
the
National

one
of
the
quality
homes
they
build.
We
visited
about
a
number
of
issues,
but
the
conversation
focused
on
how
the
VA
is
failing
them
in
their
health
and
disability
needs.

Touring
Mercy
Regional
Health
Center I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
Mercy
Regional
Health
Center
(MRHC)
in
Manhattan.
MRHC
is
a
150-bed
hospital
providing
a
wide
range
of
health
care
services
to
the
Manhattan
community
and
the
surrounding
area.
Throughout
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
our
state&#8217;s
128
community
hospitals.
As
Ranking
Member
of
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
which
has
jurisdiction
over
funding
for
most
agencies
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators
and
other
health
providers
gives
me
insight
on
the
unique
challenges
they
face
caring
for
diverse
groups
of
patients
across
wide
areas.
During
my
visit
with
MRHC
administrators
and
staff,
we
discussed
various
topics
including
the
impact
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
other
federal
policies
on
community
hospitals
and
other
health
care
providers.
Thanks
to
MRHC
CFO
Jim
Frazier
for
guiding
my
tour
and
to
Jana
Bowman
for
coordinating
my
visit.

Cheering
on
the
Jayhawks
To
end
the
week,
Robba
and
I
were
pleased
to
join
University
of
Kansas
Chancellor
Bernadette
Gray-Little
in
Allen
Fieldhouse
as
the
Jayhawks
hosted
the
Florida
Gators.
The
atmosphere
was
electric
for
the
marquee
game,
which
the
Jayhawks
won
71-65.
Coach
Self&#8217;s

Honoring
Retiring
KFB
President
Steve
Baccus Kansas
Farm
Bureau
this
week
honored
outgoing
president Steve Baccus
on
his
retirement
reception
in
Manhattan. Steve is
retiring
after
serving
on
the
KFB
Board
for
the
past
17
years,
the
last
12
as
its
President.
I
met Steve many
years
ago
when
he
was
on
his
local
farm
bureau
board,
and
over
the
years
we
grew
to
be
friends.
As
agricultural
issues
repeatedly
come
to
the
forefront
of
debate
in
Washington, Steve has
always
been
someone
who
I
could
count
on
to
give
me
trustworthy
advice
and
counsel.
As
I
said
on
the
Senate
floor, Steve embodies
many
traits
we
can
all
admire,
including
a
deep
love
for
the
great
state
of
Kansas,
and
gratitude
for
the
many
hard
working
families
who
provide
the
food,
fuel
and
fiber
Americans
rely
on.
These
traits
have
earned Steve the
respect
of
his
peers
across
the
country. Steve has
been
a
true
public
servant
to
agriculture
and
he
did
it
all
for
the
right
reasons.
We
all
owe Steve a
debt
of
gratitude
for
his
service
to
Kansas
agriculture.
I
wish
him
and
his
wife
Patricia
well
as
they
enter
into
the
next
chapter
of
their
lives.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
incoming
president
Steve
Felts
of
Montgomery
County .
