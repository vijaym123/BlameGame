Last week, I introduced H.Res 442, the Stop
This Overreaching Presidency Resolution, which would allow the House
to bring legal action against the Executive Branch for ignoring its
Constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
Below are four
actions that I have cited as overreaching in my resolution.
Which of the following decisions
do you think is the most egregious overreach of Executive
power? The Administration's
one-year delay of Obamacare's employer mandate without involving
Congress. The Administrations
announcement that Americans with cancelled plans can keep them for one
year without involving Congress.
The Administration granting temporary status to illegal
immigrants who entered the United States as children without involving
Congress.
The
Administration enacting a waiver initiative for the welfare work
requirement under TANF without involving Congress. I do not think any of these are overreaches of
Executive power. I have
no opinion.
