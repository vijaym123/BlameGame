Your State of the Union Priorities
Wednesday, January 21, 2015
Dear Friend,
As you probably know, President Obama gave his annual State of the Union address yesterday, laying out our country's current state of affairs and his priorities for the next two years. As my colleagues and I begin to tackle the issue facing our country in the new 114th Congress, I want to hear from you about the challenges you think we should focus on and the steps you believe Congress should take to address them.
Your input greatly informs my work and my legislative priorities, which is why I hope you&rsquo;ll complete this
brief survey
and tell me what you think. I am eager to roll up my sleeves and work with my colleagues on your behalf to get things done.
Additionally, I invite you to stay in touch with me through
Facebook
and
Twitter , and to
sign up to receive my e-newsletters . You'll be able to get the latest updates on my work on the Central Coast and in Washingtonand give me your thoughts on current topics.
I look forward to hearing from you, and I thank you for taking the time to share your views.
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
