Dear Friend,
I was privileged this week to have been given the honor of addressing
the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., marking the 41st
anniversary of that dark January day in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme
Court sanctioned the taking of innocent life with its Roe versus Wade
decision on abortion. Since that time, more than 56 million innocent
lives have been lost to abortion.
In my comments, I encouraged adoption as a life-giving alternative to
abortion, reminding the thousands of Americans - including many
Missourians - who had come to the National Mall in Washington that all
babies are wanted and that these babies, had they been allowed to live,
would have grown up to be our neighbors, friends, teammates, and
community leaders. And one of them might have discovered a cure for
cancer or some other disease. There have been more American lives lost
through abortion than as a result of combat in the Revolutionary War,
Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and the
Gulf War - combined. This must stop!
Later in the day, I returned home to Missouri to speak at a pro-life
event in Johnson County. It is heartening to know so many good people
here in Missouri and elsewhere across the country know that all life is
valuable and are working in our local communities to support women
facing unexpected pregnancies. I remain committed to doing what I can
in Congress and in Missouri's Fourth District to protect human life.
Life is precious and is a gift from God. I join the tens of millions of
people across this country who are praying that all babies get to enjoy
our nation's most fundamental right - the right to life.
On another matter, I congratulate the 15 outstanding students from
Missouri's Fourth Congressional District who have received nominations
to the U.S. Service Academies.
Many factors, including academic achievement, dedication to hard work,
and extracurricular achievements, went into the process that saw each
of these accomplished young men and women selected as Class of 2018
nominees to the U.S. Service Academies. It is an honor to be in a
position to nominate these young leaders of tomorrow.
I thank each of the nominees for their desire to serve our great
country. Their exceptional skills, character, and commitment to our
nation will serve them well and serve our country well.
The nominees, listed in alphabetical order with their hometowns and
service academies to which they have been nominated are:
Joshua R. Baumer, Columbia - US Air Force Academy, US Merchant Marines
Seth T. Boeke, Stockton - US Naval Academy, US Merchant Marines
Logan Brawley, Lebanon - US Air Force Academy, US Military Academy, US
Merchant Marines
Simeon Brewster, Belton - US Naval Academy
Kelsey J. Elbel, Holden - US Naval Academy, US Air Force Academy
Nicholas J. Forsythe, Warrensburg - US Air Force Academy
Mason-Wade A. Reed, Waynesville - US Military Academy
Remington C. Hoyer, Warrensburg - US Air Force Academy
Katherine E. Mason, Waynesville - US Military Academy, US Naval
Academy, US Merchant Marines
Elisha S. Phillips, Drexel - US Air Force Academy
Nicholas S. Piontek, Warrensburg - US Air Force Academy
Trevor A. Ratcliff, Harrisonville - US Air Force Academy
Adrian C. Shanahan III, Fort Leonard Wood - US Military Academy
Abby C. Stone, Columbia - US Naval Academy
Kimberley R. Wolfe, Waynesville - US Military Academy
The various Service Academies will make their final decisions for
acceptance and will notify nominees in early spring.
Students interested in applying for a Congressional nomination for the
class of 2019 should contact Congresswoman Hartzler's Columbia office
at 573-442-9311 or go to our website at www.hartzler.house.gov
and under the "Serving You" tab, click on "Academy
Nominations."
Finally, our Washington office recently celebrated the Missouri Tigers'
Cotton Bowl victory over Oklahoma State with some Tiger Stripe ice
cream and Shakespeare's pizza from Columbia. We shared our delicious
ice cream and pizza with the good folks from the office of Congressman
Mike Rogers of Alabama, whose district takes in Auburn University and
its Tigers. They needed a pick-me-up after coming up just a little
short in the National Championship Game.
Congresswoman Hartzler joins Congressman Mike Rogers of Alabama to
enjoy
Columbia's own Tiger Stripe ice cream and Shakespeare's Pizza
It was a great day to be a Tiger!
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
I
was
privileged
this
week
to
have
been
given
the
honor
of
addressing
the
annual
March
for
Life
in
Washington,
D.C.,
marking
the
41 st
anniversary
of
that
dark
January
day
in
1973
when
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
sanctioned
the
taking
of
innocent
life
with
its
Roe
versus
Wade
decision
on
abortion.
Since
that
time,
more
than
56
million
innocent
lives
have
been
lost
to
abortion.
In
my
comments,
I
encouraged
adoption
as
a
life-giving
alternative
to
abortion,
reminding
the
thousands
of
Americans
&#8211;
including
many
Missourians
-
who
had
come
to
the
National
Mall
in
Washington
that
all
babies
are
wanted
and
that
these
babies,
had
they
been
allowed
to
live,
would
have
grown
up
to
be
our
neighbors,
friends,
teammates,
and
community
leaders.
And
one
of
them
might
have
discovered
a
cure
for
cancer
or
some
other
disease.
There
have
been
more
American
lives
lost
through
abortion
than
as
a
result
of
combat
in
the
Revolutionary
War,
Civil
War,
World
War
I,
World
War
II,
Korean
War,
Vietnam
War,
and
the
Gulf
War
&#8211;
combined.
This
must
stop!
Later
in
the
day,
I
returned
home
to
Missouri
to
speak
at
a
pro-life
event
in
Johnson
County.
It
is
heartening
to
know
so
many
good
people
here
in
Missouri
and
elsewhere
across
the
country
know
that
all
life
is
valuable
and
are
working
in
our
local
communities
to
support
women
facing
unexpected
pregnancies.
I
remain
committed
to
doing
what
I
can
in
Congress
and
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District
to
protect
human
life.
Life
is
precious
and
is
a
gift
from
God.
I
join
the
tens
of
millions
of
people
across
this
country
who
are
praying
that
all
babies
get
to
enjoy
our
nation&#8217;s
most
fundamental
right
&#8211;
the
right
to
life.
On
another
matter,
I
congratulate
the

students
from
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional

Many

to
be
