Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
Earlier this week, Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the
House Judiciary Committee. Holder has since publicly complained that he
was treated poorly by the committee, but the main problem seems to me
to be Holder's refusal to answer questions honestly and forthrightly.
I queried Holder about whether the President possesses the
constitutional authority to suspend clear provisions of law and to make
unilateral changes to the law.
Holder did not offer a clear
justification for the actions of the administration, instead choosing
to parrot Democratic Party talking points about ObamaCare.
The U.S. Attorney General should be dedicated above all to the rule of
law and to our constitutional order. To the country's misfortune,
Holder has acted as an impediment to justice in high-profile matters
ranging from Operation Fast and Furious to the IRS targeting scandal.
You can watch my line of questioning by clicking here.
I believe that Holder should have resigned a long time ago. His refusal
to cooperate with the investigation into Operation Fast and Furious and
his false statements made before the Judiciary Committee last year are
two of many reasons why Holder does not inspire confidence in this
Justice Department's capacity to pursue equal justice under the law.
Thank you to the Interlachen Lions Club for hosting my Putnam County
Coffee with your Congressman event last weekend!
On Thursday, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress
for her refusal to cooperate with our investigation into the targeting
of conservative Americans. Since she waived her Fifth Amendment right
and since she has still refused to cooperate with the committee, she
deserved to be held in contempt.
Watch my interview with Neil Cavuto
regarding my vote by clicking here.
This past week was budget week in the House.
(The Senate, in case you
were wondering, has returned to its old habit of simply not producing a
budget at all.)
The House GOP budget passed 219-205 on Thursday.
The
House budget provides a blueprint to (1) expand opportunity by growing
the economy; (2) provide our troops the training, compensation, and
support they need; (3) repeal Obamacare to clear the way for
patient-centered reform; (4) provide families with a fair, simple tax
code to boost wages and create jobs; (5) secure seniors' retirement by
strengthening Medicare and other vital programs; (6) protect taxpayers
and promote work by reforming welfare programs; and (7) restore
fairness by cutting spending and combatting cronyism.
During the floor debate, President Barack Obama's proposed budget came
up for a vote.
Of the more than 400 members of Congress, only two -
count 'em, two - voted in favor of the Obama budget.
413 members of
Congress - including 189 Democrats - voted "no."
The Obama budget was
so decisively repudiated because it is so transparently irresponsible -
it contains massive tax hikes, big spending and debt increases, a
reaffirmation of ObamaCare and major reductions in military capability
(including cuts to troop pay).
The Obama budget is an invitation to
fiscal collapse and national decline.
No wonder even the members of
the President's own party so stunningly rejected it.
Finally, please mark your calendar! I will be joining local radio host
Cindy Graves on Wednesday, April 23, 2014 for a live town hall meeting
that will simultaneously be broadcast on WBOB Jacksonville. If you are
unable to attend, listen live on AM 600 WBOB - we will be taking
questions from both the live and radio audience! Please click here for

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Earlier
this
week,
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
testified
before
the
House
Judiciary
Committee.
Holder
has
since
publicly
complained
that
he
was
treated
poorly
by
the
committee,
but
the
main
problem
seems
to
me
to
be
Holder's
refusal
to
answer
questions
honestly
and
forthrightly.
I
queried
Holder
about
whether
the
President
possesses
the
constitutional
authority
to
suspend
clear
provisions
of
law
and
to
make
unilateral
changes
to
the
law.
Holder
did
not
offer
a
clear
justification
for
the
actions
of
the
administration,
instead
choosing
to
parrot
Democratic
Party
talking
points
about
ObamaCare.
The
U.S.
Attorney
General
should
be
dedicated
above
all
to
the
rule
of
law
and
to
our
constitutional
order.
To
the
country's
misfortune,
Holder
has
acted
as
an
impediment
to
justice
in
high-profile
matters
ranging
from
Operation
Fast
and
Furious
to
the
IRS
targeting
scandal.
You
can
watch
my
line
of
questioning
by
clicking
here.
I
believe
that
Holder
should
have
resigned
a
long
time
ago.
His
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
investigation
into
Operation
Fast
and
Furious
and
his
false
statements
made
before
the
Judiciary
Committee
last
year
are
two
of
many
reasons
why
Holder
does
not
inspire
confidence
in
this
Justice
Department&#8217;s
capacity
to
pursue
equal
justice
under
the
law.
Thank
you
to
the
Interlachen
Lions
Club
for
hosting
my
Putnam
County
Coffee
with
your
Congressman
event
last
weekend!
On
Thursday,
the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
voted
to
hold
former
IRS
official Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
her
refusal
to
cooperate
with
our
investigation
into
the
targeting
of
conservative
Americans.
Since
she
waived
her
Fifth
Amendment
right
and
since
she
has
still
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
committee,
she
deserved
to
be
held
in
contempt.
Watch
my
interview
with
Neil
Cavuto regarding
my
vote
by
clicking
here.
This
past
week
was
budget
week
in
the
House.
(The
Senate,
in
case
you
were
wondering,
has
returned
to
its
old
habit
of
simply
not
producing
a
budget
at
all.)
The
House
GOP
budget
passed
219-205
on
Thursday.
The
House
budget
provides
a
blueprint
to
(1)
expand
opportunity
by
growing
the
economy;
(2)
provide
our
troops
the
training,
compensation,
and
support
they
need;
(3)
repeal
Obamacare
to
clear
the
way
for
patient-centered
reform;
(4)
provide
families
with
a
fair,
simple
tax
code
to
boost
wages
and
create
jobs;
(5)
secure
seniors&#8217;
retirement
by
strengthening
Medicare
and
other
vital
programs;
(6)
protect
taxpayers
and
promote
work
by
reforming
welfare
programs;
and
(7)
restore
fairness
by
cutting
spending
and
combatting
cronyism.
During
the
floor
debate,
President
Barack
Obama&#8217;s
proposed
budget
came
up
for
a
vote.
Of
the
more
than
400
members
of
Congress,
only
two
&#8211;
count
&#8216;em,
two
&#8211;
voted
in
favor
of
the
Obama
budget.
413
members
of
Congress
&#8211;
including
189
Democrats
&#8211;
voted
&#8220;no.&#8221;
The
Obama
budget
was
so
decisively
repudiated
because
it
is
so
transparently
irresponsible
&#8211;
it
contains
massive
tax
hikes,
big
spending
and
debt
increases,
a
reaffirmation
of
ObamaCare
and
major
reductions
in
military
capability
(including
cuts
to
troop
pay).
The
Obama
budget
is
an
invitation
to
fiscal
collapse
and
national
decline.
No
wonder
even
the
members
of
the
President&#8217;s
own
party
so
stunningly
rejected
it.
Finally,
please
mark
your
calendar! I will be
joining
local
radio
host
Cindy
Graves
on
Wednesday,
April
23,
2014
for
