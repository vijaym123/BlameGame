David, I&rsquo;m asking for your urgent support.
Last night,
Roll Call
named me one of the
most vulnerable
Democrats in the country. Look David, I don&rsquo;t care how many of these lists I&rsquo;m on.
I won't stop fighting for you -- I won&rsquo;t stop fighting for Illinois families.
But I can&rsquo;t win this thing on my own. As you read this, Republicans are crisscrossing the district to get out the vote for Bob Dold. If we don&rsquo;t respond --
and exceed their efforts
-- we won&rsquo;t be celebrating on Election Day.
David, I&rsquo;m counting on you. Please pitch in what you can and help us finish strong. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thank you,
Brad
