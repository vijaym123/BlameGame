Dear Friend,
Our veterans were first and foremost in our thoughts as Representatives
of the people returned to Washington this week. I have shared with you,
for some time, my desire to make sure America's veterans receive the
health care they have earned. This week, the House unanimously approved
the Veterans Access to Care Act, H.R. 4810
, to give any veteran who has been
waiting for an appointment for more than 30 days the ability to get
care outside the VA system. It will also enable veterans who live more
than 40 miles from a VA facility to receive non-VA care. Finally, this
bill suspends bonuses for all VA employees for the next two years. It
makes no sense to pay bonuses to people who are simply doing a job they
were hired to do.
We have learned that 57,000 veterans are waiting for care, which is
unacceptable. We owe it to our veterans to put them first by making it
easier for them to access quality care. Our veterans stood for us. It
is now time for us to stand for them.
Another issue getting a lot of attention on Capitol Hill is the
prisoner exchange that involved five members of the Taliban being
released from Guantanamo for U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. My House Armed
Services Committee colleagues and I heard from Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel
who argued that he and President Obama
moved forward with the complete confidence that they were acting in a
lawful manner. He acknowledged, however, that the Administration could
have done a better job of keeping Congress informed of the actions
being taken.
This is a major concern at this time. There are many allegations
surrounding the Bergdahl case, and I do not intend to jump to
conclusions without the facts. But there is one fact that is not in
doubt - the Obama Administration took action without informing
Congress. That runs contrary to the law. The National Defense
Authorization Act requires an administration to give Congress 30 days'
notice in advance of such a deal. The Obama Administration failed to do
that. It did, however, admit to informing 80-90 people within the
Administration. Certainly the representatives of the people should have
had an opportunity to provide input as well, especially since that is
the law!
We must also assess whether the release of these five terrorists will
put the United States in jeopardy in the future. No one can look into
the future to predict what might happen, but we can be certain that the
threat of these five taking action against our country or our men and
women in uniform is of concern now that they are no longer being held
at Guantanamo. I appreciate Defense Secretary Hagel meeting with our
committee to answer questions, but it sets a dangerous precedent to
disregard the law of the land in this manner.
Looking ahead to next week, I want to share that I will be in Columbia
to host a Summit on Human Trafficking
. In May, my colleagues and I
passed a series of bills that work to prevent or eliminate the spread
of trafficking and to protect the victims of this horrific crime. My
Columbia Summit will be made up of a panel of experts, including
trafficking survivors, to speak on the issue and to answer questions. I
extend an invitation to all citizens throughout our district to attend
this important and educational event. Awareness predicates action,
education is one of the vital components in the fight against human
trafficking and is the first step in eliminating this issue in
Missouri. Human trafficking is not a crime that is restricted to other
parts of the world - it is happening in our own backyard. In fact, the
Department of Justice's Western District of Missouri is currently
prosecuting 15 cases of human trafficking. It is time to shed light on
this subject. I look forward to seeing you on Monday, June 16th, from
10:00 am to 12:00 noon, at the Missouri United Methodist Church at 204
South 9thStreet in Columbia.
Finally, I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of young FFA
students from our district that dropped into our Capitol Hill office.
Representatives of Holden FFA meet with Congresswoman Hartzler.

It is always a pleasure to meet with citizens from our district who are
visiting Washington, D.C.
Have a great week,

Dear
Friend,
Our
veterans
were
first
and
foremost
in
our
thoughts
as
Representatives
of
the
people
returned
to
Washington
this
week.
I
have
shared
with
you,
for
some
time,
my
desire
to
make
sure
America&#8217;s
veterans
receive
the
health
care
they
have
earned.
This
week,
the
House
unanimously
approved
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act,
H.R.
4810 ,
to
give
any
veteran
who
has
been
waiting
for
an
appointment
for
more
than
30
days
the
ability
to
get
care
outside
the
VA
system.
It
will
also
enable
veterans
who
live
more
than
40
miles
from
a
VA
facility
to
receive
non-VA
care.
Finally,
this
bill
suspends
bonuses
for
all
VA
employees
for
the
next
two
years.
It
makes
no
sense
to
pay
bonuses
to
people
who
are
simply
doing
a
job
they
were
hired
to
do.
We
have
learned
that
57,000
veterans
are
waiting
for
care,
which
is
unacceptable.
We
owe
it
to
our
veterans
to
put
them
first
by
making
it
easier
for
them
to
access
quality
care.
Our
veterans
stood
for
us.
It
is
now
time
for
us
to
stand
for
them.
Another
issue
getting
a
lot
of
attention
on
Capitol
Hill
is
the
prisoner
exchange
that
involved
five
members
of
the
Taliban
being
released
from
Guantanamo
for
U.S.
soldier
Bowe
Bergdahl.
My
House
Armed
Services
Committee
colleagues
and
I
heard
from
Defense
Secretary
Chuck
Hagel
who
argued
that
he
and
President
Obama
moved
forward
with
the
complete
confidence
that
they
were
acting
in
a
lawful
manner.
He
acknowledged,
however,
that
the
Administration
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
keeping
Congress
informed
of
the
actions
being
taken.
This
is
a
major
concern
at
this
time.
There
are
many
allegations
surrounding
the
Bergdahl
case,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
jump
to
conclusions
without
the
facts.
But
there
is
one
fact
that
is
not
in
doubt
&#8211;
the
Obama
Administration
took
action
without
informing
Congress.
That
runs
contrary
to
the
law.
The
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
requires
an
administration
to
give
Congress
30
days&#8217;
notice
in
advance
of
such
a
deal.
The
Obama
Administration
failed
to
do
that.
It
did,
however,
admit
to
informing
80-90
people
within
the
Administration. Certainly
the
representatives
of
the
people
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
provide
input
as
well,
especially
since
that
is
the
law!
We
must
also
assess
whether
the
release
of
these
five
terrorists
will
put
the
United
States
in
jeopardy
in
the
future.
No
one
can
look
into
the
future
to
predict
what
might
happen,
but
we
can
be
certain
that
the
threat
of
these
five
taking
action
against
our
country
or
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
is
of
concern
now
that
they
are
no
longer
being
held
at
Guantanamo.
I
appreciate
Defense
Secretary
Hagel
meeting
with
our
committee
to
answer
questions,
but
it
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
to
disregard
the
law
of
the
land
in
this
manner.
Looking
ahead
to
next
week,
I
want
to
share
that
I
will
be
in
Columbia
to
host
a
Summit
on
Human
Trafficking .
In
May,
my
colleagues
and
I
passed
a
series
of
bills
that
work
to
prevent
or
eliminate
the
spread
of
trafficking
and
to
protect
the
victims
of
this
horrific
crime.
My
Columbia
Summit
will
be
made
up
of
a
panel
of
experts,
including
trafficking
survivors,
to
speak
on
the
issue
and
to
answer
questions.
I
extend
an
invitation
to
all
citizens
throughout
our
district
to
attend
this
important
and
educational
event.
Awareness
predicates
action,
education
is
one
of
the
vital
components
in
the
fight
against
human
trafficking
and
is
the
first
step
in
eliminating
this
issue
in
Missouri.
Human
trafficking
is
not
a
crime
that
is
restricted
to
other
parts
of
the
world
&#8211;
it
is
happening
in
our
own
backyard.
In
fact,
the
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
Western
District
of
Missouri
is
currently
prosecuting
15
cases
of
human
trafficking.
It
is
time
to
shed
light
on
this
subject.
I
look

to
seeing
you
on
Monday,
June

from

to
12:00
noon,
at
the
Missouri

at

in
Columbia.
Finally,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
a

of
young
FFA
