Dear Friends,
As we enter the dog days of Summer, let&#39;s celebrate by showing off Pennsylvania&#39;s undeniable beauty. Submit your favorite summer photo with your first name, hometown, and photo location to
photos@casey.senate.gov . We&#39;ll select a few of our favorites and post them to
Facebook
and the photo that receives the most &#39;likes&#39; will be used as my Facebook cover photo for the rest of the year. Please submit your photos by August 15th to be considered!
I look forward to seeing your beautiful photos!
Sincerely,
Bob Casey
PS: Please note that submitted photos will be cropped to fit the facebook cover photo dimensions of 851 px by 315 px. Wide, landscape shots best fit these dimensions.
