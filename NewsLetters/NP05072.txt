Friend -- President Obama emailed yesterday.
Hillary Clinton emailed this morning.
And now I&rsquo;m emailing too because this is SO critically important.
Please, PLEASE pause what you&rsquo;re doing and read this:
Six Senate races are deadlocked right now.
Seriously, they&rsquo;re completely tied.
If we protect three of these six seats, Democrats keep the Senate.
But the scary fact remains: We have 50-50 odds with 8 days left.
Can we win? Honestly, it depends.
If we can raise $410,983
by our one-week-out advertising deadline tomorrow, we can answer EVERY Republican attack and hand the GOP a gruesome Election Day loss.
But if you don&rsquo;t act and we fail to close the spending gap, the Republicans will take over the Senate. Show Mitch McConnell you REFUSE to accept that fate.
Pitch in right away to stop a Republican Senate takeover. It&rsquo;ll be triple-matched.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
When we win this election, it will truly be because grassroots supporters like you refused to quit.
Mitch McConnell could be gone in just eight days if you step up and we win every tossup state.
Just think about how incredible that&rsquo;d be for a moment.
Please make a gift right away to keep the Senate blue, and we will triple-match it.
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
