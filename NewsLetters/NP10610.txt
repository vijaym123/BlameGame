A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
April 11, 2014
Dear Friends,
This morning, President Obama announced he will nominated Sylvia
Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to
replace Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services. In
her current position, Burwell recently prevented Georgia's number one
economic development project - the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project
- from moving forward. She ought to
prepare for some tough questions I'll be asking on behalf of Georgians
during the confirmation process in the Senate Finance Committee.
The President's Budget - Entitlement Reform, Medicaid Expansion
On Thursday, just hours before Sebelius announced she was resigning as
Health and Human Services Secretary, she testified at a hearing of the
Senate Finance Committee on the president's budget for Fiscal Year
2015.
I questioned her regarding the need for structural reforms to the
nation's unsustainable entitlement programs
. The actuarial clock is ticking on our
country in terms of debt and
deficit, and all of us, in
both parties, are going to have to sit around a table and have some
very difficult discussions. If we continue to promise more than we can
deliver, and don't reform the system, one day, the game is going to be
up and the American people are going to be left holding the bag.
Additionally, I voiced my concern regarding the federal government's
ability to live up to its promises of cost-sharing with states that
chose to expand Medicaid coverage under Obamacare.
Under Obamacare, the federal government will initially pay the full
cost of each state's expansion, but the amount of the federal
government's share will decline thereafter. President Obama himself has
previously suggested further reducing the federal share of the cost of
Medicaid expansion as a way to reduce the federal deficit.
As you are likely already aware, the federal government's track record
of cost-sharing with states is not great. For example, the federal
government has never fully funded its share of states' costs for
educating children with disabilities. You can watch my full exchange
with Secretary Sebelius here

This week, I enjoyed speaking with eighth graders at Hilsman Middle
School in Athens, Ga. via Skype technology. Their questions were
insightful and I had a lot of fun hearing from them. If your school or
class is interested in participating in a Skype session with me, please
contact my office using this webform
or give us a
call at (202) 224-3643.
Augusta, Ga., is hosting the annual Masters Tournament this week in
their fair city. I wish all of the golfers fortunate enough to
participate in this historic tournament my best, welcome our visitors
from around the globe and thank Augustans for the hospitality they show
each year.
What's on Tap?
The Senate will not be in session for the next two weeks in observance
of Passover and Easter holidays. When the Senate returns, work will
likely begin on a bill to increase the minimum wage for $7.25 to $10.10
per hour. The next e-newsletter will be sent on April 25, 2014.
Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson
