Dear Friend,
This past week,
Americans across the country went to the
polls to cast their votes. The results were
telling. Ohioans and Americans everywhere
reaffirmed their support for a limited
government and unlimited opportunities, and
I am thankful for their support.
This election was about restoring
opportunity for all of those looking for
work and creating an environment where our
small business owners can hire and expand.
As a former business owner for nearly 30
years, I know that Washington has been part
of the problem, not the solution. I share
the same frustration with Ohioans when it
comes to gridlock in Congress and its
inability to work together to get things
done.
We need to send people to Washington who
are willing to work together. Through my
work on the Ways &amp; Means Committee, my
Bipartisan Working Group, and the bills I
have introduced and cosponsored, I know how
important it is to work in a bipartisan
manner to get things accomplished.
Currently there are 352 House-passed
bills that are gathering dust in the
Senate. Over 98 percent of them have
support from both Republicans and Democrats
and 254 of these bills passed the House
with no opposition. More than 60 of these
bills were introduced by Democrats. I am a
firm believer that policy should trump
politics, and next year, once we have a
Republican majority in the Senate, I am
confident that these priority bills will
finally see the light of day. Its
time that we have some real leadership in
the Senate, and particularly leaders who
are willing to come to the table and
compromise.
Next year, I expect the House and Senate
to work together in a number of areas to
grow our economy and ease the squeeze on
hardworking Americans. Specifically, I
expect the Senate to consider the Keystone
XL Pipeline, a project that would create
20,000 jobs, lead to lower energy costs,
and strengthen our energy security. Second,
I expect Congress to work together on
comprehensive tax reform. As a member of
the Ways &amp; Means Committee, I have
played an active role in the
Committees draft proposal, which
would create a fairer, simpler tax code
reducing the burden on American
families and encouraging global
competitiveness. Lastly, we will work
together to mitigate the negative effects
of the Presidents health care law.
We in the House have already passed several
bills that would do just that, including
legislation that repeals the medical device
tax, provides relief to Ohioans by delaying
the individual mandate, and ensures
patients and their families, not unelected
bureaucrats, are in charge of their
treatment decisions by repealing the
Independent Payment Advisory Board
(IPAB).
I believe that it is our responsibility
to leave this country better than we found
it, and I look forward to working with my
friends on both sides of the aisle to pass
on a better America to our children and
grandchildren. I am honored to have the
opportunity to return to Washington this
week and next year to represent the good
people of Ohios 16
th
District and put forth
commonsense, bipartisan solutions that will
lead to renewed opportunities, a healthier
economy, and job creation in Northeast
Ohio.
