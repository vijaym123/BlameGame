High School students and parents are invited to attend my
Academy Day at MacDill Air Force Base
to learn about the congressional nomination process for the service academies and meet with representatives from each of the academies:
Air Force, West Point, Naval, Merchant Marine and Coast Guard.
In addition, representatives from
ROTC
programs of nearby colleges will be attendance.
My Academy Day event is this weekend -- Saturday, October 18, 9 a.m. - Noon -- so please call my office today at 813-871-2817 to
RSVP.
All attendees must
RSVP
in advance to gain access to MacDill Air Force Base.
I am proud to host this unique event for interested students -- it is the best and one of the largest Academy Day events held in Florida, with more than 100 students who attended last year.
Our nation's prestigious academies offer incredible academic and career opportunities. Every year I am thrilled and inspired to meet the best and brightest students who are interested in embarking on a path of building character, leadership and service to country.
