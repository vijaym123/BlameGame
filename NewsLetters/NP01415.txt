15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Today is one of the most daunting days of the year for a majority of Floridians: Tax Day. This year, Floridians are filing federal income taxes using a complex tax code that is over 70,000 pages long. Our current tax code is too complicated, slows growth, and creates a drag on our economy. A 2012 report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Taxpayer Advocate Service estimated it took a total 6.1 billion hours for all taxpayers to handle their taxes.
We must simplify our tax code, period.
Last month, the people's House passed a balanced budget that calls for a plan to fix our out of control tax code.
Today I will join my colleagues in the House of Representatives in passing a number of common sense bills that will rein in IRS abuse and protect the rights of tax taxpayers.
Legislation we passed today includes:
H.R. 1058, the
Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2015
This bill requires the Commissioner of the IRS to ensure all IRS employees are familiar with and comply with the rights of taxpayers, such as the right to quality service, the right to confidentiality and the right to appeal and have their challenge be heard.
H.R. 1152,
IRS Email Transparency Act
This bill prohibits IRS employees from using personal email accounts for official business, bringing more transparency to IRS employees.
H.R. 1026,
Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act
Under current law, victims who had their confidential tax information leaked (like when Lois Lerner shared confidential information with an outside organization) cannot receive information regarding an investigation into their case. This bill permits taxpayers the right to know the status of an investigation pertaining to their personal information.
H.R. 1314,
Ensuring Tax Exempt Organizations the Right to Appeal Act
This bill would require the IRS to establish procedures for an administrative appeal for organizations applying for tax-exempt status in the event of an adverse qualification determination against the organization.
H.R. 1295,
IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Act
This bill would allow groups to declare their tax exempt status rather than wait for the IRS' bureaucratic approval.
H.R. 709,
Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act
This bill would require IRS employees to be terminated if they target taxpayers for political purposes.
H.R. 1104,
Fair Treatment for All Gifts Act
This bill ensures that donations to tax-exempt organizations are not subject to the gift tax the IRS threatened to initiate to target Americans for their political beliefs.
H.R. 1562,
Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015
This bill would prohibit federal contracts from going to companies or individuals that have a seriously delinquent tax debt.
