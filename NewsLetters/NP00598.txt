Kansas Common Sense
May 26, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. It was a productive week on Capitol
Hill. Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
This Memorial Day, Courageous Veterans Fight Silent Battles at Home
Courage is often talked about but seldom witnessed. Each May, Americans
come together on Memorial Day to remember those courageous souls who
laid down their lives for our freedom. These service men and women did
not answer the call to serve in the name of Republicans or Democrats;
they did so to protect liberty and the American Dream for their
children and grandchildren.
This month is also a time to recognize that the members of our Armed
Forces who are fortunate to return from combat continue to fight
battles at home
including silent battles with mental health. Since
1949, May has been observed as Mental Health Awareness Month
a time
to expand awareness of the struggle of mental illness and help
eliminate the stigmas that prevent many from seeking the treatment they
need.
Members of our military are uniquely impacted by cognitive conditions
like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and
traumatic brain injury (TBI). These invisible wounds of war plague
thousands of veterans and service members across our country, and
healing those wounds takes tremendous courage from both the individuals
suffering and their families.
The courage of our service men and women has protected our democracy
for generations and allowed us to live in the strongest, freest,
greatest country in the world. It is our responsibility to make certain
no veteran feels abandoned by the country they served once they summon
the courage to tackle a mental health issue. Click here
to learn more about my efforts in the Senate to hold the VA
accountable for providing our nations veterans with the timely,
high-quality and specialized care they earned.
Spring Hill Memorial Day Ceremony
Yesterday, I joined veterans and local residents at the Spring Hill
Memorial Ceremony. Our nations young men and women continue to risk
their lives for the sake of others and fighting for the principles we
hold most dear
freedom and justice. Special thanks to the community
for being so welcoming and hosting the special event.
Senate Passes Moran-Authored Legislation to Improve Veterans Health Care
On Friday, the U.S. Senate put veterans first and unanimously passed
the Access to Community Care for Veterans Act (S.1463)
legislation I
authored to improve the Choice Act to give veterans access to community
health care when the nearest VA medical facility within 40 miles
driving distance from a veterans home is incapable of offering care
the veteran needs. The VA continues to use a narrow interpretation of
the 40-mile rule, choosing to take into account only the distance of a
VA medical facility from a veterans home and not whether the VA
facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs. The
legislation passed unanimously by the Senate today (S.1463) aims to
help thousands of veterans who are currently being forced to choose
between traveling hours to a VA medical facility, paying out of pocket,
or going without care altogether. S.1463 now moves to the U.S. House of
Representatives for consideration.Click here
to watch my call for a vote on the Senate
floor on this vital piece of legislation.
Senate Votes on Trade Promotion Authority Act
Trade impacts almost everyone and every industry in our state
farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small businesses, and workers. As the
United States continues to engage economically with other nations, it
is critical that Congress sets clear objectives and priorities for
potential trade agreements, requires transparency and accountability
during negotiations, and maintains full authority to approve or
disapprove any potential deal.
While Trade Promotion Authority gives our U.S. trade representatives
the latitude necessary to negotiate a potential deal, any trade
agreement must be voted on by Congress before it goes into effect. This
keeps the American people in the drivers seat to have final say on any
future trade deal through their elected representatives in Congress.
And as your elected official, I will only support a fair trade deal
that respects the rule of law.
Promoting Commonsense Regulation of Community Banks and Credit Union
On Thursday, the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee
held a legislative markup to consider legislation that would improve
the ability for hometown community lenders to help grow their
communities. This legislation contained a number of provisions I have
championed, which would reduce the cost of complying with burdensome
federal rules for rural lenders. A vast majority of this legislation
enjoys widespread bipartisan support. I voted to report this bill out
of committee so that the full Senate has an opportunity to debate this
important issue for Kansas households and businesses. Unfortunately,
this issue has become needlessly partisan. At the end of the committee
session, I addressed my colleagues on the importance of coming together
so that Kansans can access the credit necessary to buy a house, expand
or start a business, and have an opportunity to achieve the American
Dream. To view my comments, click here.
I will continue to
work with my colleagues to find areas of agreement so that we can get
our economy back on the right track.
Takata Airbag Recall
On Tuesday, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced an
agreement with Takata Corps to expand its recall to 34 million vehicles
in the United States equipped with defective airbags. Additionally, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a Consent
Order to Takata requiring the company to cooperate in all future
regulatory actions that NHTSA undertakes in its ongoing investigation
and oversight of the company. The recall of vehicles equipped with
Takata airbags is considered the largest recall of a consumer product.
Tuesdays announcement reinforces the urgency of the Takata airbag
recalls, and I appreciate the efforts of NHTSA to help us better
understand the facts behind what is causing these defects. As Chairman
of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee for Consumer Protection, Product
Safety, Insurance and Data Security, I look forward to working with my
colleagues to examine this important matter and ensure the safety of
American consumers.
Consumers can check their vehicles Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
at a new website,www.SaferCar.gov/RecallsSpotlight
, to see if it is covered by the expanded recall. The
website will also provide regular updates on the status of this and
other recalls and of NHTSAs investigation. Vehicles manufactured by
the following companies are impacted by the national recall: BMW,
Chrysler, Daimler Trucks, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda,
Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota.
Founding new NIH Caucus
I was proud to be a founding member of the new Senate NIH Caucus,
co-chaired by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dick Durbin
of Illinois, which supports the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
the focal point of our nations health research infrastructure this
week. NIH-supported research saves and improves lives, lowers overall
health care costs, and is an economic engine that strengthens American
global competitiveness. The NIH Caucus will offer an opportunity for
senators to highlight the importance of NIH and pursue strategies to
provide steady, predictable growth for U.S. biomedical research in the
future.
Meeting with Secretary of Defense Ash Carter
I was pleased to get acquainted with the Ash Carter, Secretary for the
Department of Defense, this week. We discussed important issues facing
our nation's military, as well as potential impacts that could result
from reduced defense spending. We shared perspectives on how to make
certain we have a ready and resilient force by increasing cyber
defenses and the unique qualities found only in Kansas among our Kansas
National Guard, the intellectual center of the Army at Fort
Leavenworth, air mobility at McConnell Air Force Base and Forbes Field,
as well as the capable Army infantry force at Fort Riley. I look
forward to working with Secretary Carter to prioritize our national
defense, which is critical to the security of the United States.
Meeting with Sprint CEO
This week, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure visited my office to discuss the
companys future goals. Mr. Claure described Sprints plan to densify
their network with additional cell sites to improve network capacity
and customer experience. He also explained that Sprint has been
actively attracting talent from across the globe to the Kansas City
area and expanding hiring at the Sprint campus in Overland Park. Mr.
Claure and I also discussed my work to encourage the State Department
and FCC to fulfill a 2012 agreement with Mexico that will allow Sprint
to fully utilize spectrum along the border and compete in those markets.
Meeting with Federal Communications Commissioner Mike ORielly
On Friday, I met with FCC Commissioner Mike ORielly who was
unanimously confirmed by the Senate in October 2013. Prior to serving
in this role, he spent nearly 20 years on Capitol Hill handling a
variety of issues related to technology, telecommunications and
commerce. Our discussion focused on ways to encourage broadband
deployment and adoption, especially in rural areas, and on policies the
Commerce Committee should pursue to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of the FCC. The FCC has not been reauthorized since 1990,
and just this week the House Telecommunications Subcommittee approved
seven bills to make improvements in the way the agency handles its
work. I look forward to working with Commissioner ORielly as we pursue
these important policy goals that impact Kansans.

The deadline for fall internship applications is quickly approaching,
and anyone interested should submit their application before Friday,
June 26. Application forms can be obtained and completed under the

Hello,
Welcome
to
&#147;Kansas
Common
Sense.&#148;
It
was
a
productive
week
on
Capitol
Hill.
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
This
Memorial
Day,
Courageous
Veterans
Fight
Silent
Battles
at
Home
Courage
is
often
talked
about
but
seldom
witnessed.
Each
May,
Americans
come
together
on
Memorial
Day
to
remember
those
courageous
souls
who
laid
down
their
lives
for
our
freedom.
These
service
men
and
women
did
not
answer
the
call
to
serve
in
the
name
of
Republicans
or
Democrats;
they
did
so
to
protect
liberty
and
the
American
Dream
for
their
children
and
grandchildren.
This
month
is
also
a
time
to
recognize
that
the
members
of
our
Armed
Forces
who
are
fortunate
to
return
from
combat
continue
to
fight
battles
at
home
&#150;
including
silent
battles
with
mental
health.
Since
1949,
May
has
been
observed
as
Mental
Health
Awareness
Month
&#150;
a
time
to
expand
awareness
of
the
struggle
of
mental
illness
and
help
eliminate
the
stigmas
that
prevent
many
from
seeking
the
treatment
they
need.
Members
of
our
military
are
uniquely
impacted
by
cognitive
conditions
like
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(PTSD),
major
depression
and
traumatic
brain
injury
(TBI).
These
invisible
wounds
of
war
plague
thousands
of
veterans
and
service
members
across
our
country,
and
healing
those
wounds
takes
tremendous
courage
from
both
the
individuals
suffering
and
their
families.
The
courage
of
our
service
men
and
women
has
protected
our
democracy
for
generations
and
allowed
us
to
live
in
the
strongest,
freest,
greatest
country
in
the
world.
It
is
our
responsibility
to
make
certain
no
veteran
feels
abandoned
by
the
country
they
served
once
they
summon
the
courage
to
tackle
a
mental
health
issue.

my
efforts

providing
our
nation&#146;s
veterans
with
the
timely,
high-quality
and

care
they
earned.
Spring
Hill
Memorial
Day
Ceremony
Yesterday,
I
joined
veterans
and
local
residents
at
the
Spring
Hill
Memorial
Ceremony.
Our
nation&#146;s
young
men
and
women
continue
to
risk
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
others
and
fighting
for
the
principles
we
hold
most
dear
&#150;
freedom
and
justice.
Special
thanks
to
the
community
for
being
so
welcoming
and
hosting
the
special
event.
Senate
Passes
Moran-Authored
Legislation
to
Improve
Veterans
Health
Care
On
Friday,
the
U.S.
Senate
put
veterans
first
and
unanimously
passed
the
Access
to
Community
Care
for
Veterans
Act
(S.1463)
&#150;
legislation
I
authored
to
improve
the
Choice
Act
to
give
veterans
access
to
community
health
care
when
the
nearest
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
driving
distance
from
a
veteran&#146;s
home
is
incapable
of
offering
care
the
veteran
needs.
The
VA
continues
to
use
a
narrow
interpretation
of
the
40-mile
rule,
choosing
to
take
into
account
only
the
distance
of
a
VA
medical
facility
from
a
veteran&#146;s
home
and
not
whether
the
VA
facility
can
actually
provide
the
services
the
veteran
needs.
The
legislation
passed
unanimously
by
the
Senate
today
(S.1463)
aims
to
help
thousands
of
veterans
who
are
currently
being
forced
to
choose
between
traveling
hours
to
a
VA
medical
facility,
paying
out
of

or
going
without
care
altogether.
S.1463
now
moves
to
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
for
consideration. Click

to
watch
my
call
for
a
vote
on
the
Senate
floor
on
this
vital
piece
of
legislation.
Senate
Votes
on
Trade
Promotion
Authority
Act
Trade
impacts
almost
everyone
and
every
industry
in
our
state
&#150;
farmers,
ranchers,
manufacturers,
small
businesses,
and
workers.
As
the
United
States
continues
to
engage
economically
with
other
nations,
it
is
critical
that
Congress
sets
clear
objectives
and
priorities
for
potential
trade
agreements,
requires
transparency
and
accountability
during
negotiations,
and
maintains
full
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
any
potential
deal.
While
Trade
Promotion
Authority
gives
our
U.S.
trade
representatives
the
latitude
necessary
to
negotiate
a
potential
deal,
any
trade
agreement
must
be
voted
on
by
Congress
before
it
goes
into
effect.
This
keeps
the
American
people
in
the
driver&#146;s
seat
to
have
final
say
on
any
future
trade
deal
through
their
elected
representatives
in
Congress.
And
as
your
elected
official,
I
will
only
support
a
fair
trade
deal
that
respects
the
rule
of
law.
Promoting
Commonsense
Regulation
of
Community
Banks
and
Credit
Union
On
Thursday,
the
Senate
Banking,
Housing
and
Urban
Affairs
Committee
held
a
legislative
markup
to
consider
legislation
that
would
improve
the
ability
for
hometown
community
lenders
to
help
grow
their
communities.
This
legislation
contained
a
number
of
provisions
I
have
championed,
which
would
reduce
the
cost
of
complying
with
burdensome
federal
rules
for
rural
lenders.
A
vast
majority
of
this
legislation
enjoys
widespread
bipartisan
support.
I
voted
to
report
this
bill
out
of
committee
so
that
the
full
Senate
has
an
opportunity
to
debate
this
important
issue
for
Kansas
households
and
businesses.
Unfortunately,
this
issue
has
become
needlessly
partisan.
At
the
end
of
the
committee
session,
I
addressed
my
colleagues
on
the
importance
of
coming
together
so
that
Kansans
can
access
the
credit
necessary
to
buy
a
house,
expand
or
start
a
business,
and
have
an
opportunity
to
achieve
the
American
Dream.

I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
colleagues
to
find
areas
of
agreement
so
that
we
can
get
our
economy
back
on
the
right
track.
Takata
Airbag
Recall
On
Tuesday,
the
Department
of
Transportation
(DOT)
announced
an
agreement
with
Takata
Corps
to
expand
its
recall
to
34
million
vehicles
in
the
United
States
equipped
with
defective
airbags.
Additionally,
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(NHTSA)
issued
a
Consent
Order
to
Takata
requiring
the
company
to
cooperate
in
all
future
regulatory
actions
that
NHTSA
undertakes
in
its
ongoing
investigation
and
oversight
of
the
company.
The
recall
of
vehicles
equipped
with
Takata
airbags
is
considered
the
largest
recall
of
a
consumer
product.
Tuesday&#146;s
announcement
reinforces
the
urgency
of
the
Takata
airbag
recalls,
and
I
appreciate
the
efforts
of
NHTSA
to
help
us
better
understand
the
facts
behind
what
is
causing
these
defects.
As
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
for
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security,
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
examine
this
important
matter
and
ensure
the
safety
of
American
consumers.
Consumers
can
check
their
vehicle&#146;s
Vehicle
Identification
Number
(VIN)
at
a
new
website, www.SaferCar.gov/RecallsSpotlight ,
to
see
if
it
is
covered
by
the
expanded
recall.
The
website
will
also
provide
regular
updates
on
the
status
of
this
and
other
recalls
and
of
NHTSA&#146;s
investigation.
Vehicles
manufactured
by
the
following
companies
are
impacted
by
the
national
recall:
BMW,
Chrysler,
Daimler
Trucks,
Ford,
General
Motors,
Honda,
Mazda,
Mitsubishi,
Nissan,
Subaru
and
Toyota.
Founding
new
NIH
Caucus
I
was
proud
to
be
a
founding
member
of
the
new
Senate
NIH
Caucus,
co-chaired
by
Senators
Lindsey
Graham
of
South
Carolina
and
Dick
Durbin
of
Illinois,
which
supports
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
&#151;
the
focal
point
of
our
nation&#146;s
health
research
infrastructure
this
week.
NIH-supported
research
saves
and
improves
lives,
lowers
overall
health
care
costs,
and
is
an
economic
engine
that
strengthens
American
global
competitiveness.
The
NIH
Caucus
will
offer
an
opportunity
for
senators
to
highlight
the
importance
of
NIH
and
pursue
strategies
to
provide
steady,
predictable
growth
for
U.S.
biomedical
research
in
the
future.
Meeting
with
Secretary
of
Defense
Ash
Carter
I
was
pleased
to
get
acquainted
with
the
Ash
Carter,
Secretary
for
the
Department
of
Defense,
this
week.
We
discussed
important
issues
facing
our
nation's
military,
as
well
as
potential
impacts
that
could
result
from
reduced
defense
spending.
We
shared
perspectives
on
how
to
make
certain
we
have
a
ready
and
resilient
force
by
increasing
cyber
defenses
and
the
unique
qualities
found
only
in
Kansas
among
our Kansas
National
Guard,
the
intellectual
center
of
the
Army
at Fort
Leavenworth,
air
mobility
at
McConnell
Air
Force
Base and Forbes
Field,
as
well
as
the
capable
Army
infantry
force
at Fort
Riley.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
Secretary
Carter
to
prioritize
our
national
defense,
which
is
critical
to
the
security
of
the
United
States.
Meeting
with
Sprint
CEO
This
week, Sprint CEO
Marcelo
Claure
visited
my
office
to
discuss
the
company&#146;s
future
goals.
Mr.
Claure
described
Sprint&#146;s
plan
to
densify
their
network
with
additional
cell
sites
to
improve
network
capacity
and
customer
experience.
He
also
explained
that
Sprint
has
been
actively
attracting
talent
from
across
the
globe
to
the
Kansas
City
area
and
expanding
hiring
at
the
Sprint
campus
in
Overland
Park.
Mr.
Claure
and
I
also
discussed
my
work
to
encourage
the
State
Department
and
FCC
to
fulfill
a
2012
agreement
with
Mexico
that
will
allow
Sprint
to
fully
utilize
spectrum
along
the
border
and
compete
in
those
markets.
Meeting
with
Federal
Communications
Commissioner
Mike
O&#146;Rielly
On
Friday,
I
met
with
FCC
Commissioner
Mike
O&#146;Rielly
who
was
unanimously
confirmed
by
the
Senate
in
October
2013.
Prior
to
serving
in
this
role,
he
spent
nearly
20
years
on
Capitol
Hill
handling
a
variety
of
issues
related
to
technology,
telecommunications
and
commerce.
Our
discussion
focused
on
ways
to
encourage
broadband
deployment
and
adoption,
especially
in
rural
areas,
and
on
policies
the
Commerce
Committee
should
pursue
to
improve
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
the
FCC.
The
FCC
has
not
been
reauthorized
since
1990,
and
just
this
week
the
House
Telecommunications
Subcommittee
approved
seven
bills
to
make
improvements
in
the
way
the
agency
handles
its
work.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
Commissioner
O&#146;Rielly
as
we
pursue
these
important
policy
goals
that
impact
Kansans.
