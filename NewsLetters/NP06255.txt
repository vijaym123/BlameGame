-- Boehner just dropped an additional $1.85 MILLION on Illinois T.V.
-- our opponent just launched a blatantly false attack ad against Cheri -- and we might fail to hit tonight&rsquo;s critical budget goal
This morning, Dick Durbin asked for your support. 219 of you stepped up, but we&rsquo;re still falling short.
We can close the gap -- but we&rsquo;re running out of time.
If you were planning to answer Senator Durbin&rsquo;s call-to-action -- and support Cheri&rsquo;s Democratic campaign -- we need you to do so immediately. Not tomorrow, not next week
-- today. $562 to go. Please David, are you in? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
No regrets,
