Dear David,
I&rsquo;d like to hear from you.
Please join me for a
telephone town hall tomorrow, Dec. 11, at 6 p.m. PST . I will be discussing my efforts to create jobs in Northwest Washington, the expansion of quality health care coverage for all Americans, and the urgent need for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. I will also be happy to answer your questions about other issues important to you.
To join the call, please dial 877-229-8493. When prompted enter the ID code 18502.
I look forward to talking with you.
Sincerely,
Rick Larsen
