Friends,
At 1:30 pm last week, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp revealed
his plan to
fix our countrys broken tax code, making it more
simple and fairer for everyone . Finally, this discussion
draft will get Congress talking about tax reform.
Our
tax code has not been updated since 1986, the same year the first laptop
was created, it cost $3.71 to see the blockbuster hit Top Gun, and
gas cost just $0.89.
Chairman Camps plan cuts tax
rates by closing special interest loopholes.
Based on calculations
using data provided by the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation,
the average middle-class family of four could have an extra
$1,300 per year in their pockets.
Here are some other
benefits of the
Tax Reform Act of
2014 :
Would create
almost 2,000,000 new
jobs
$3.4 trillion in economic growth , which
is equivalent to 20% of todays economy
Eliminates the
need to itemize and track receipts by allowing roughly
95% of
filers to get the lowest possible tax rate
by simply claiming
the standard deduction
Everyone agrees that our
current tax code too complicated and too costly.
I applaud Chairman
Camp for his leadership and diligent work on an issue that greatly
affects our countrys competitiveness. This is a conversation Congress
must have, and I look forward to being a part of it.

Safeguarding Your Taxdollars
Every person, household, and business should
operate on a budget, including Congress.
I am proud to announce that
my office will be returning more than $88,000 back to the Treasury.
This number would have been well over $100,000; however, I
represent South Carolinas newly formed Seventh Congressional District and
did not inherit equipment and other office infrastructure from a
previous member.
Through careful budgeting and fiscally responsible
decisions, I was able to create and staff three fully operating offices
to serve my constituents and return thousands of left over funds to
the Treasury.
Protecting Our Freedoms
Last week, I testified before the House Judiciary
Committee about the dangers of executive overreach.
President
Lincoln warned against actions such as these. America will never be
destroyed from the outside.
If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will
be because we destroyed ourselves, he said.
The legislation I
introduced would stop the executive branch from bypassing Congress and
eroding our freedoms. Click HERE or on the image below to view my
testimony.

Quail Hunt with My Sons &amp; SC Outdoors
Network
Last month, my sons and I had the privilege of joining the SC Outdoors
Network team for a quail hunt at the Allen Brothers Hunting Preserve.
Hunting is part of our states heritage and it was great to
have two of my sons with me as we discussed Second Amendment rights and
our familys tradition of hunting . My grandfather taught my
father how to hunt, my father taught me to hunt, and I have taught my
boys to hunt.
In Congress, I will ensure that your rights are
protected and this great sport is preserved for generations to come.
