Dear Friend:
Student borrowers must be
treated fairly.
Thats why I joined Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL),
Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Jack Reed (D-RI) today in introducing the
Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights, which would ensure that
students receive clear and honest information about their loan balances and
repayment options. To read more, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
