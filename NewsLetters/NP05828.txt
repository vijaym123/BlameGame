We just got some upsetting (ok, TERRIBLE) news&hellip;
Boehner&rsquo;s getting a HUGE boost from his billionaire backers. Roll Call just reported that Republican outside groups are spending $12 million MORE to attack our campaigns. That&rsquo;s on top of Boehner&rsquo;s $6 million ad blitz.
Here&rsquo;s the good (ok, AMAZING) news:
There&rsquo;s still some time left to fight back. After President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action, a group of Democratic supporters have agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
But the triple-match runs out in less than 4 hours.
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now before the critical FEC deadline at midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
The fundraising deadline is TONIGHT. The triple-match ends TONIGHT. And if we can&rsquo;t fight these new Republican attacks, our hopes of winning control of Congress will end TONIGHT.
Please -- stop what you&rsquo;re doing, answer President Obama&rsquo;s request, and help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
