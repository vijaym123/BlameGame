Friend
I w anted to share with you some good news this week. The Colorado Supreme Court
recently ruled
to uphold the Day of Prayer, rejecting a legal challenge to the Governors right to issue Day of Prayer proclamations.
Our country was founded on the freedom
of
religion, not freedom
from
religion. Little victories like this are how the battle is won.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
This year, my friend and Co-Chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, Rep Mike McIntyre, and I introduced
H.Res. 547 , a resolution affirming the National Day of Prayer and the role that prayer has played in our Nations history. Keep updated on more of our work,
