News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
December 2, 2013
What's Next
We had a late Thanksgiving this year, and that means less time to buy
Christmas presents.
It also means that we have a shorter time left to
finish our Congressional business for 2013.
Here's what to watch for
in the next few weeks:
Farm Bill
The Farm Bill Conference Committee is continuing to work on reconciling
the differences between the House and Senate bills.
We've ironed out a
lot of the details already in areas like rural development, research,
and trade programs.
What's left?
Commodity support and nutrition
assistance.
These have always been the toughest issues to agree on,
but we're making some progress.
Chairman Frank Lucas and Ranking
Member Colin Peterson of the House Agriculture Committee have been
meeting regularly with Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow and Ranking Member
Thad Cochran from the Senate side.
Our goal is to get the Senate to agree on reforms to nutrition
assistance that stop program abuse and ensure your taxpayer dollars are
going to families in need - not people who are gaming the system.
We
also want to make sure the commodity support in the bill works for
every region in the country, and not just a few select crops.
We'll
continue working on this, and my hope is that we'll have a long-term
Farm Bill in place before Christmas.
Budget Discussions
The other big issue to be sorted out before the end of 2013 is our
budget.
As you know, the Senate finally agreed to form a Conference
Committee with the House to come to a resolution on our budget.
The
aim is to produce a plan to fund the government for the rest of FY2014.
The Committee has set a goal of reaching an agreement by December 13.
If they don't meet that self-imposed deadline, there are no immediate
consequences. But on January 15, we come up against a hard deadline.
That's when the current continuing resolution expires.
I'm not on the Budget Conference Committee, but I've made my priorities
clear:
We need to address our growing debt instead of kicking the can
down the road - so that we can protect our economy and America's
legacy.
Our $17 trillion in debt isn't going to disappear on its own.
We need to start taking steps to reduce our spending and recommit
ourselves to responsible government.
That's why I've introduced a
Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, as well as a bill that
requires any increase in the debt limit to be considered as a
stand-alone bill and pass with a supermajority of two-thirds.
I'll
keep fighting on your behalf to reduce the burden of our national debt.
Supreme Court Takes Up HHS Mandate
On top of all of Obamacare's flaws, website glitches, insurance price
mark-ups, and cancelled coverage, it violates one of our most
fundamental rights: freedom of religion.
So I was happy to hear that
this spring the Supreme Court will consider whether Obamacare violates
the First Amendment.
Obamacare requires all businesses to offer insurance that covers
sterilization and contraception, including the morning-after and
week-after pill.
But this goes against a lot of Americans' beliefs in
the sanctity of life.
It forces pro-life business owners to choose
between paying crippling fines that could bankrupt their business, or
dropping health care for all their employees.
This federal mandate
threatens Americans' ability to worship as they choose, and it
threatens American jobs.
It makes it hard to run a charity, hospital,
university, or other business with a moral or religious base.
I've already signed onto the Health Care Conscience Rights Act
to
allow business owners to only provide coverage in tune with their
personal conviction.
The First Amendment is in place so that no
American ever has to choose between following their personal beliefs
and following the law.
And I think the First Amendment applies to all
people - including business owners.

News
from
Representative
Randy
Neugebauer December
2,
2013
What&#8217;s
Next
We
had
a
late
Thanksgiving
this
year,
and
that
means
less
time
to
buy
Christmas
presents.
It
also
means
that
we
have
a
shorter
time
left
to
finish
our
Congressional
business
for
2013.
Here&#8217;s
what
to
watch
for
in
the
next
few
weeks:
Farm
Bill
The
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
is
continuing
to
work
on
reconciling
the
differences
between
the
House
and
Senate
bills.
We&#8217;ve
ironed
out
a
lot
of
the
details
already
in
areas
like
rural
development,
research,
and
trade
programs.
What&#8217;s
left?
Commodity
support
and
nutrition
assistance.
These
have
always
been
the
toughest
issues
to
agree
on,
but
we&#8217;re
making
some
progress.
Chairman
Frank
Lucas
and
Ranking
Member
Colin
Peterson
of
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
have
been
meeting
regularly
with
Chairwoman
Debbie
Stabenow
and
Ranking
Member
Thad
Cochran
from
the
Senate
side .
Our
goal
is
to
get
the
Senate
to
agree
on
reforms
to
nutrition
assistance
that
stop
program
abuse
and
ensure
your
taxpayer
dollars
are
going
to
families
in
need
-
not
people
who
are
gaming
the
system.
We
also
want
to
make
sure
the
commodity
support
in
the
bill
works
for
every
region
in
the
country,
and
not
just
a
few
select
crops.
We&#8217;ll
continue
working
on
this,
and
my
hope
is
that
we&#8217;ll
have
a
long-term
Farm
Bill
in
place
before
Christmas.
Budget
Discussions
The
other
big
issue
to
be
sorted
out
before
the
end
of
2013
is
our
budget.
As
you
know,
the
Senate
finally
agreed
to
form
a
Conference
Committee
with
the
House
to
come
to
a
resolution
on
our
budget.
The
aim
is
to
produce
a
plan
to
fund
the
government
for
the
rest
of
FY2014 .
The
Committee
has
set
a
goal
of
reaching
an
agreement
by
December
13.
If
they
don&#8217;t
meet
that
self-imposed
deadline,
there
are
no
immediate
consequences. But
on
January
15,
we
come
up
against
a
hard
deadline.
That&#8217;s
when
the
current
continuing
resolution
expires.
I&#8217;m
not
on
the
Budget
Conference
Committee,
but
I&#8217;ve
made
my
priorities
clear:
We
need
to
address
our
growing
debt
instead
of
kicking
the
can
down
the
road
&#8211;
so
that
we
can
protect
our
economy
and
America&#8217;s
legacy.
Our
$17
trillion
in
debt
isn&#8217;t
going
to
disappear
on
its
own.
We
need
to
start
taking
steps
to
reduce
our
spending
and
recommit
ourselves
to
responsible
government.
That&#8217;s
why I&#8217;ve
introduced
a
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
the
Constitution,
as
well
as
a
bill
that
requires
any
increase
in
the
debt
limit
to
be
considered
as
a
stand-alone
bill
and
pass
with
a
supermajority
of
two-thirds.
I&#8217;ll
keep
fighting
on
your
behalf
to
reduce
the
burden
of
our
national
debt.
Supreme
Court
Takes
Up
HHS
Mandate
On
top
of
all
of
Obamacare&#8217;s
flaws,
website
glitches,
insurance
price
mark-ups,
and
cancelled
coverage,
it
violates
one
of
our
most
fundamental
rights :
freedom
of
religion .
So
I
was
happy
to
hear
that
this
spring
the
Supreme
Court
will
consider
whether
Obamacare
violates
the
First
Amendment.
Obamacare
requires
all
businesses
to
offer
insurance
that
covers
sterilization
and
contraception,
including
the
morning-after
and
week-after
pill.
But
this
goes
against
a
lot
of
Americans&#8217;
beliefs
in
the
sanctity
of
life.
It
forces
pro-life
business
owners
to
choose
between
paying
crippling
fines
that
could
bankrupt
their
business,
or
dropping
health
care
for
all
their
employees.
This
federal
mandate
threatens
Americans&#8217;
ability
to
worship
as
they
choose,
and
it
threatens
American
jobs.
It
makes
it
hard
to
run
a
charity,
hospital,
university,
or
other
business
with
a
moral
or
religious
base.
I&#8217;ve
already
signed
onto
the
Health
Care
Conscience
Rights
Act
to
allow
business
owners
to
only
provide
coverage
in
tune
with
their
personal
conviction.
The
First
Amendment
is
in
place
so
that
no
American
ever
has
to
choose
between
following
their
personal
beliefs
and
following
the
law.
And
I
think
the
First
Amendment
applies
to
all
people
&#8211;
including
business
owners.
