For Working Families,
Emergency Unemployment Assistance Can't Wait
Dear Friend,
Congress needs to act NOW to extend emergency unemployment benefits to
workers here in Minnesota and throughout our nation who are struggling
to find new jobs and support their families.
That's the message 49 of us freshman Members of Congress sent to
Speaker Boehner last week while some 65,000 Minnesotans, and 4.9
million workers across America (according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics), were learning that their emergency assistance - reserved
for those who have been out of work for more than 27 weeks - was coming
to an end.
Also last week, I became one of the first to co-sponsor the newly
introduced Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act (H.R. 3824) to help
long-term unemployed workers get through the winter with three
additional months of assistance.
As this debate continues, it's important to understand four things.
First, long-term unemployment is the product of a depressed economy - a
recession that began in 2007. Preventing future recessions, and
creating desperately-needed jobs, requires a multi-faceted strategy to
(1) rebuild and reinvest in America, and end wars of choice and
nation-building abroad; (2) reform tax policies that encourage
companies to send American jobs overseas, and trade policies that put
U.S. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage; and (3) provide
better education, training, and re-training for workers who need new
jobs to meet changing times.
Second, unemployment compensation is not welfare. It's an insurance
policy, paid for by employers, for workers who find themselves out of a
job through no fault of their own. You have to have been a worker to be
eligible for unemployment benefits. As a businessman of 32 years, I've
paid into the program to make sure those who worked for me would be
protected.
Third, studies show that the older you are and the longer you're
unemployed, the harder it is to find work. And despite a slowly falling
unemployment rate (6.7% nationally and 4.6% in Minnesota in December
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), there are still three
workers competing for every one available job.
And fourth, unemployment assistance not only helps working families
weather tough times - it's also good for Main Street, because that
money is almost always spent locally in places like the grocery store,
the hardware store, and the drug store, where those dollars help
generate new jobs and more business activity.
As of today, emergency assistance extension bills are stalled in both
the House and Senate - and we've got to get them moving. Families in
need can't wait, and continued delays by Congress are both cruel and
unnecessary.
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear
your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below, or

Sincerely,

In America's War on Poverty, Jobs, Education, & Nutrition
Have Always Been the Ultimate Weapons
Congressman Nolan listens on as Lynda Johnson Robb, daughter of

How well did President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty - wide-ranging
programs promoting jobs, education and nutrition - really work?
Historians and economists may disagree on details, but a new Columbia
University study points to one startling fact. When LBJ declared
"unconditional war on poverty in America" in his 1964 State of the
Union Address, 27% of Americans - about one in four - were living below
the poverty line. Today, that number has dropped to 16% - still
outrageously high, but improved nonetheless. Click to read more about
the War on Poverty.
Duluth Marks Sex Trafficking Awareness Month Across America, the City
of Duluth has a well-earned reputation for innovative and effective
community involvement in the ongoing war against sex trafficking. As
further evidence, Duluth Mayor Don Ness, the Duluth Sex Trafficking
Task Force, local non-profit agencies, and the St. Louis County
Attorney's Office have come together to officially recognize January as
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month in Duluth.
Meanwhile, on the national level, my Republican colleague (and former
Judge) Ted Poe of Texas and I, along with many others in the House and
Senate, are advancing two important bills - the End Sex Trafficking Act
and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act - that work together to
treat the victims of trafficking as true victims - not criminals - and
provide them with all legal protections and support services - and to
prosecute and punish the perpetrators of sex trafficking under the full
weight of the law.
The message to traffickers and would-be traffickers is clear: Our
daughters are not for sale.

Hello Little Falls!
Congressman Nolan live on the air with KLTF Radio of Little Falls last
Wednesday.
I really enjoy taking time out of my Washington schedule to call home
to local radio stations across the 8th District. Last week, I joined
hosts Corey Fink, Steve Van Sluten, and Perry Nouis on KLTF Radio in
Little Falls. With the community located on the Mississippi River,
surrounded by some of Minnesota's best sports fishing lakes and rivers,
attention quickly turned to my amendment to the Water Resources Reform
& Development Act to close the St. Anthony Lock & Dam in Minneapolis
and stop the voracious Asian Carp - that destroy native fish and their
habitat - from spreading north to threaten our sport-fishing and
multibillion-dollar Minnesota fishing and tourism industry. My dad used
to say, "Every day a person goes fishing doesn't count in their
lifespan, because it adds a day to their life."
We also talked about the provision I helped add to the House version of
the Farm Bill eliminating a wasteful and duplicative $170 million
(according to CBO estimates) USDA Catfish Inspection program. It would
clearly burden fish and seafood processors like Morey's and Trident in
Motley with ridiculous, expensive new regulations, without a single new
health benefit. The last thing we need is a USDA inspector sitting
around idly, waiting for a catfish that has already been inspected by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In that regard, I urged leaders of the House-Senate Farm Bill
Conference Committee to require a vote on the Catfish Inspection
Program by all 41 members of the committee - as opposed to a decision
made by senior Members of Congress behind closed doors. Senator John
McCain (R-AZ) did the same on the Senate side. You can read what I
wrote here
.
_____
Briefly
Last week, I:
.
Cosponsored legislation to immediately grant a 3-month
extension of emergency unemployment benefits to more than 1 million
Americans;
.
Joined the bipartisan Peace Corps Caucus to promote and
encourage volunteerism abroad;
.
Cosponsored the Native American Indian Education Act and the
North American Wetlands Conservation Act to fund approved wetlands
conservation projects in every corner of the U.S.;
.
Met with Josh Stull of the National Fisheries Institute
about our work to hopefully do away with the USDA catfish inspection
program (see the Farm Bill section above);
.
Welcomed former U.S. Senator of Colorado, Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, to my office. Senator Campbell is one of forty-four on the
Council of Chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe, and served as
a senator from 1987 to 1993. As well as discussing the Native American
Indian Education Act, of which I am now a cosponsor, Senator Campbell
and I discussed my bill - passed by the House last year and currently
awaiting passage in the Senate - to allow a long-awaited land-exchange
between the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe and Carlton County
in Minnesota to go forward.

Coming Up in Washington
.
A likely vote on a three (yes, three) -day spending bill, in
order to avoid another government shutdown after the January 15th
deadline. We hear a giant $1 trillion budget bill is in the works, but
in the meantime, to keep the government up and running, a three day
"stop-gap" is what we get.
.
A meeting of the Election Task Force, a group I was asked to
join by House Democratic Leadership focusing on government and election
finance reform, where we will discuss soon-to-be-introduced legislation
designed to get corporate interest money out of our politics and raise
civic engagement;
.
A full meeting of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure on surface transportation reauthorization.

Coming Up in Minnesota
.
Congress Comes to You - Each month, the intrepid members of
my district team travel the district and hold meetings for you to voice
your concerns or seek help with an issue you're having with a federal
agency (like Social Security, veterans benefits, or Medicare). We're
finalizing our January schedule now, so be sure to check the website
frequently for the most up-to-date
schedule.

The work I'm doing to eliminate this costly and wasteful catfish

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
For
Working
Families,
Emergency
Unemployment
Assistance
Can't
Wait
Dear
Friend,
Congress
needs
to
act
NOW
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
benefits
to
workers
here
in
Minnesota
and
throughout
our
nation
who
are
struggling
to
find
new
jobs
and
support
their
families.
That's
the
message
49
of
us
freshman
Members
of
Congress
sent
to
Speaker
Boehner
last
week
while
some
65,000
Minnesotans ,
and
4.9
million
workers
across
America
(according
to
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics) ,
were
learning
that
their
emergency
assistance
-
reserved
for
those
who
have
been
out
of
work
for
more
than
27
weeks
-
was
coming
to
an
end.
Also
last
week,
I
became
one
of
the
first
to
co-sponsor
the
newly
introduced
Emergency
Unemployment
Compensation
Act
(H.R.
3824)
to
help
long-term
unemployed
workers
get
through
the
winter
with
three
additional
months
of
assistance.
As
this
debate
continues,
it's
important
to
understand
four
things.
First,
long-term
unemployment
is
the
product
of
a
depressed
economy
-
a
recession
that
began
in
2007.
Preventing
future
recessions,
and
creating
desperately-needed
jobs,
requires
a
multi-faceted
strategy
to
(1)
rebuild
and
reinvest
in
America ,
and
end
wars
of
choice
and
nation-building
abroad;
(2)
reform
tax
policies
that
encourage
companies
to
send
American
jobs
overseas,
and
trade
policies
that
put
U.S.
manufacturers
at
a
competitive
disadvantage;
and
(3)
provide
better
education,
training,
and
re-training
for
workers
who
need
new
jobs
to
meet
changing
times.
Second,
unemployment
compensation
is
not
welfare .
It's
an
insurance
policy,
paid
for
by
employers, for
workers
who
find
themselves
out
of
a
job
through
no
fault
of
their
own .
You
have
to
have
been
a
worker
to
be
eligible
for
unemployment
benefits.
As
a
businessman
of
32
years,
I've
paid
into
the
program
to
make
sure
those
who
worked
for
me
would
be
protected.
Third,
studies
show
that
the
older
you
are
and
the longer
you're
unemployed,
the harder
it
is to
find
work .
And
despite
a
slowly
falling
unemployment
rate
(6.7%
nationally
and
4.6%
in
Minnesota
in
December
according
to
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics),
there
are
still
three
workers
competing
for
every
one
available
job.
And
fourth,
unemployment
assistance
not
only
helps
working
families
weather
tough
times
-
it's
also
good
for
Main
Street ,
because
that
money
is
almost
always
spent
locally
in
places
like
the
grocery
store,
the
hardware
store,
and
the
drug
store,
where
those
dollars
help
generate
new
jobs
and
more
business
activity.
As
of
today,
emergency
assistance
extension
bills
are
stalled
in
both
the
House
and
Senate
-
and
we've
got
to
get
them
moving.
Families
in
need
can't
wait ,
and
continued
delays
by
Congress
are
both
cruel
and
unnecessary.
We
will
keep
you
posted
as
events
proceed.
Meanwhile,
I
want
to
hear
your
thoughts.

Hello
Little
Falls!
Congressman
Nolan
live
on
the
air
with
KLTF
Radio
of
Little
Falls
last
Wednesday.
I
really
enjoy
taking
time
out
of
my
Washington
schedule
to
call
home
to
local
radio
stations
across
the
8th
District.
Last
week,
I
joined
hosts
Corey
Fink,
Steve
Van
Sluten,
and
Perry
Nouis
on
KLTF
Radio
in
Little
Falls .
With
the
community
located
on
the
Mississippi
River,
surrounded
by
some
of
Minnesota's
best
sports
fishing
lakes
and
rivers,
attention
quickly
turned
to
my
amendment
to
the
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
to
close
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
&amp;
Dam
in
Minneapolis
and
stop
the
voracious
Asian
Carp
-
that destroy
native
fish
and
their
habitat
- from
spreading
north
to
threaten
our
sport-fishing
and multibillion-dollar
Minnesota
fishing
and
tourism
industry.
My
dad
used
to
say,
"Every
day
a
person
goes
fishing
doesn't
count
in
their
lifespan,
because
it
adds
a
day
to
their
life."
We
also
talked
about
the
provision
I
helped
add
to
the
House
version
of
the
Farm
Bill
eliminating
a
wasteful
and
duplicative
$170
million
(according
to
CBO
estimates)
USDA
Catfish
Inspection
program . It
would
clearly burden
fish
and
seafood
processors
like
Morey's
and
Trident
in
Motley
with
ridiculous,
expensive
new
regulations,
without
a
single
new
health
benefit. The
last
thing
we
need
is
a
USDA
inspector
sitting
around
idly,
waiting
for
a
catfish
that
has
already
been
inspected
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA) .
In
that
regard,
I
urged
leaders
of
the
House-Senate
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
to
require
a
vote
on
the
Catfish
Inspection
Program
by
all
41
members
of
the
committee
-
as
opposed
to
a

made
by senior
Members
of Congress behind
