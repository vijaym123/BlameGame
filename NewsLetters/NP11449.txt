Dear Friends,
I hope this update finds you well.
Thanks for subscribing to my
e-newsletter so that I can share updates and news from Washington and
South Carolina with you.
If you would like for friends and family to
be in the loop, they can sign up for my updates here
.
Fairness in Healthcare
If Obamacare is too harmful to apply to the President's political
friends, it is too harmful for all Americans. This law of the land
should apply to everyone-or preferably to no one-equally, and I was
disappointed to see that President Obama has chosen to make special
exceptions for unions.
I joined twenty-four colleagues in condemning this inappropriate action
in a letter to the administration.
You can read it here
.
Taxpayer Right to Know Act
You have the right to know how federal agencies are using your money.
For too long, Congress has directed money from the pockets of
hardworking Americans into federal agencies, where its efficiency and
use are nearly impossible to track.
We cannot reasonably talk about cutting spending and reducing our debt
without addressing the $200 billion spent in waste and duplication in
our government each year.
I joined Senator Coburn this week in introducing a bill that would take
a commonsense step in requiring federal agencies to document their
programs, activities, and administrative costs.
Learn more about it
here
.
Supporting Choice for Kids
I am a strong believer of the value of school choice in creating
opportunity for our kids.
I recently introduced the CHOICE Act
to expand options for parents to choose in their kids'
education, and spoke about it at length at CPAC
.
This editorial
ran yesterday in the Post and Courier and
talks further about the possibilities that school choice can open up
for kids.
I will continue to work on my agenda of opportunity for all Americans,
and I appreciate the privilege of serving as your voice in the United
States Senate.
Your input is very valuable to me-please do not
hesitate to reach out with questions, suggestions, or if we can ever be
of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim
