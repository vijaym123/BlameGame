Dear
Friends,
In his address Thursday night from the White House, President Obama
conceded his failure as a leader on immigration. Instead of finding
common ground with Congress, he chose to bail out his bankrupt presidency
through an order he has already admitted he cannot legally take. He
violated his promise to champion reform in his first term, sabotaged
bipartisan House negotiations in his second and bred distrust by failing
to faithfully enforce the law throughout.
Now he wants to
save face by imposing unilaterally what he could not achieve
democratically. Congress must defend its constitutional role to make laws and
immediately block his illegal action through all available
avenues.
The presidents action not only undermines efforts to achieve
real reform
it is directly opposed to it. Real reform starts with
enforcing current laws, securing the border and modernizing the visa
system. Only a system that works
that drives immigrants into viable
avenues for legal entry
will end illegal immigration and protect the
rule of law. That is what I will continue to fight for
no matter who
occupies the White House.
Thank you ,
