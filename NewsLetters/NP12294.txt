Washington Spending
is Unsustainable
The rate at which Congress is borrowing
money in Washington is simply
unsustainable .
Last Tuesday, the House voted
221 to 201
to raise the
debt ceiling by an undetermined amount to keep borrowing and continuing
to spend at the current rate until the spring of 2015. This will take
our national debt to nearly $18 trillion. The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) estimates America will borrow another
$7.904
trillion during the next 10 years,
taking our national debt to more
than $25 trillion. When will the madness
stop?
Click here
to view a larger version of this chart - scroll
down to page 9. You can see from the above chart, the lower right
figure, the non-partisan CBO projects the U.S. total budget deficit will
add approximately
$7.9 trillion
to our national debt
by the year
2024.
While our leaders in Congress from both sides of the aisle continue to
push for more and more debt, there is never an adequate plan for paying
down the debt. This has been a bipartisan problem for Congress, which
has run deficits for 55 of the past 60 years. For this reason, I
voted " No " to extend the debt limit.
Fighting For Online Privacy Reforms
I spoke on the
House floor last week to highlight the need for our government to update
and reform our electronic communication and online privacy laws. I'm
the lead sponsor of
HR 1852 -
the Email Privacy
Act
- to guarantee
American's email receives the same privacy protections as postal mail and
documents in their homes. Many government agencies, including the IRS,
believe Americans "do not have an expectation of privacy" with their
online communications. I disagree.
The Email Privacy Act now has more than
170 bipartisan cosponsors , and
Members continue to request being added as
supporters.
Protecting Veterans' Earned Benefits
Early last
week, I joined many of my colleagues in the House and voted in a
bipartisan way to pass a bill ensuring military retirees receive the full
benefits they've earned through courageous service to their country. I
voted " Yes " and the legislation passed the House after
a bipartisan vote of
326-90 .
The Cost of
Living Adjustment passed the Senate on Wednesday as well. The bill now
awaits the president's signature.

Association &amp; Kansas Agribusiness Retailers
Association
Thank you to Tom Tunnell and the folks from the
Kansas Grain and Feed
Association
and
Kansas Agribusiness
Retailers Association
for stopping by my Washington, DC
office last week. We discussed the status of the Water Resources bill
currently in conference with the Senate, Farm bill implementation
issues, as well as the impact proposed EPA regulations are having on farmers
in Kansas.
As Vice Chair of the
Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Agriculture, I appreciated
speaking with them about these important issues and how they effect
Kansans.
National Alfalfa and
Forage Alliance
I also want to thank the
folks from the National Alfalfa &amp; Forage Alliance for stopping by my
office to discuss the importance of agriculture research and the impact
alfalfa and forage crops have on our
economy.
Kansas ranks
12th nationally
in
total value of all forage production.
2014
Congressional Art Competition Under Way
I'm once again
excited to announce we are accepting entries for the 2014 Congressional
Art Competition. The quality of art submitted last year was outstanding,
and I look forward to seeing the art submitted for the competition
this year. Each spring, the Congressional Institute sponsors a
nationwide high school visual art competition to recognize and encourage
artistic talent across the nation from each Congressional district. An
Arts Advisory Committee comprised of 3rd District artists will then
help to select a winning entry, which is
displayed for one year
in the U.S. Capitol in Washington,
DC.
Emily Churchwell won the 2013 3rd District
Congressional Art Competition with her entry
Catching
Dreams .
The Congressional Art Competition
began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for Members of Congress to
recognize the artistic talents of high school students in their
districts. Since then, more than 650,000 high school students have been
involved with the nationwide
competition.
All interested high school students should

Kansan Places 4th at Sochi Winter
Olympics
We can all be a little prouder during the Olympics
because a Kansan competed and placed 4th overall in her competition.
Katie Uhlaender
is on the U.S. Skeleton team and raced
twice for the United States in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Katie
just missed out on winning a medal - she was four one-hundredths of a
second from winning the bronze. Congratulations, Katie!
