No Labels Awards "Problem
Solver Seal of Approval"
to Rep. Lipinski
No Labels,
a national organization dedicated to a new politics of problem
solving, has awarded its Problem Solver Seal of Approval to Congressman Dan
Lipinski (IL-3) for his support of the groups year-long effort to
create a National Strategic Agenda, a roadmap for the country
based on goals shared by both parties.
No Labels is calling
for America's leaders to support a new governing process to build
a National Strategic Agenda centered on four goals.
These
goals
chosen with input from a nationwide survey that No Labels
conducted last fall
are:
Create 25 million new jobs
over the next 10 years;
Balance the federal budget by
2030;
Secure Medicare and Social Security for another
75 years; and
Make America energy secure by
2024
Disagreements
over specific policies or politics aren't the only causes of
perpetual gridlock in D.C., said No Labels co-founder Mark
McKinnon.
Our leaders havent defined a shared vision about what our
countrys goals are.
The National Strategic Agenda will
enable our leaders to decide together where we as a nation should be
going and how we will get there.
We commend Rep. Lipinski
for his support of this new governing process and his willingness to
challenge the status quo on Capitol
Hill.
Rep. Lipinski Celebrates the Opening of
Englewood Flyover; Project Reduces Delays for Metra Rock Island
Commuters
Recently, Congressman Lipinski joined
federal, state and local officials in celebrating the opening of the
long-awaited $142 million Englewood Flyover.
The flyover is a bridge
that carries Metras Rock Island line over the Norfolk Southern/Amtrak
tracks near 63rd Street and State Street in Chicago.
Rock
Island line passengers - including those boarding Metra trains in
Tinley Park, Beverly, and Morgan Park - will see fewer delays as a result
of this project.
The completion of the Englewood Flyover means
improvement in the quality of life for area residents, said Rep. Lipinski
(IL-3).
The benefits include fewer delays for Metra and Amtrak
users, fewer delays for area drivers, better air quality, a reduction in
noise from idling trains, and an overall improvement in
safety.

Historic Stone
Avenue Metra Station Renovated with Help from Grant Secured by Rep.
Lipinski
Earlier this month, Congressman
Lipinski joined with La Grange Village President Tom Livingston, Metra CEO
Don Orseno, state and city officials, and other interested business
leaders and community members to cut the ribbon on the villages newly
renovated Metra station at Stone and Burlington Avenues.
Village
President Livingston thanked Lipinski for his commitment to improving
the quality of life for residents in the district.
He said this
much needed update would not have been possible without Lipinski
securing a $700,000 earmark for the $1.15 million project back in
2009.
This is a great
day for the Village of La Grange as it continues to prosper while
maintaining strong ties to its historic past, said Rep. Lipinski.
Seeing this beautiful, historic local landmark finally restored, I am
very happy to have been able to bring the money home to make it
possible.
As a strong supporter of public transportation, it is great
to see this restoration combined with the addition of several
user-friendly modern enhancements that will benefit the over one thousand daily
commuters that make this one of the busiest stations on the
Burlington Northern line.

Rep. Lipinski Says Congress Should Reconvene
To Address
ISIL Conflict
Statement from Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3)
:
The United States has been
engaging ISIL in Iraq for about three months and has been conducting
airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq for the past few
weeks.
I agree that ISIL presents a serious threat to the
U.S. and its allies in the region, and that we must continue to confront
them and work to end their inhuman
conduct.
I voted to authorize the Administration to start training and
equipping Syrians to fight ISIL once they have been vetted and cleared
of terror connections; this initial authorization expires December
11th.
However, Congress has not voted on a measure to authorize
the ongoing airstrikes or other U.S. military involvement in Syria or
Iraq.
Rather, the President is relying on two congressional
resolutions, one passed in 2001 in response to the attacks of 9-11 and the
other passed in 2002 authoring the Iraq War.
Since it is
debatable whether these two resolutions are applicable to the current
situation, it would be best for Congress to reconvene as soon as possible to
consider a use of force resolution specific to this
conflict.
This would give Congress more time to seek answers concerning the
Administrations strategy in this conflict and how much progress
if
any
has been made so far, and to have a full debate about what our
nation's role should be not just in the short term but in the longer term
in the region.
We should not duck our responsibility in dealing
with this situation as well as other ongoing
threats.
Congressman Lipinski first called for
Congress to reconvene on October 7th. For more on this issue,
