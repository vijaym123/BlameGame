Dear Friend-
This week, newly disclosed emails
from
former IRS Exempt Organizations head Lois Lerner revealed that Lerner
and other IRS officials discussed with the Department of Justice the
possibility of using criminal prosecutions against conservative groups
targeted by Lerner and the IRS.
The idea to use criminal prosecutions to squelch dissent had been
proposed at a Senate hearing by Rhode Island U.S. Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse in April 2013. Prior to that hearing, the released emails
show that Lerner, alluding to conservative leaning tax-exempt groups,
sent an email to her IRS colleagues in which she informed them that the
hearing would focus on what she called "the latest push to shut these
down. One IRS prosecution would make an impact and they wouldn't feel
so comfortable doing the stuff." IRS officials met with DOJ officials
to discuss this possibility.
It is clear that the Department of Justice has a conflict of interest
in the IRS matter. The DOJ has been conducting an "investigation" under
the supervision of a major Obama donor since May 2013, yet no
prosecutions have been commenced and the department has leaked word to
media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal that no prosecutions will
occur. The appointment of a special prosecutor is clearly in order.
The full House will consider holding Lois Lerner in contempt of
Congress during the next legislative session.
I joined Gretchen Carlson on Fox News to discuss these revelations.
Watch my interview by clicking here
. On Sunday, I will be speaking with
Shannon Bream; please tune in to Fox News at 1 PM and share your
comments and reactions on Facebook
and Twitter
!
Last week, the House Judiciary Committee's internet subcommittee held a
hearing to examine the Obama administration's proposed handoff of the
internet domain registration system to the so-called international
community.
This proposal has alarmed a number of people ranging from
former President Bill Clinton to GOP members of the House of
Representatives.
The bottom line is that relinquishing control of the
ICANN system to the international community makes it more likely that
authoritarian regimes could exercise control over the internet.
The
representative from the Commerce Department acknowledged that the U.S.
can extend the contract for up to four years, which seems like the most
prudent course at this juncture.
I will continue to monitor this issue
of internet freedom closely and will provide updates as new
developments unfold.
April 15 is an annual date of frustration for millions of Americans.
The tax code is over 70,000 pages long and punishes hard work, savings
and investment.
I always get a kick out of those who think that higher
marginal tax rates somehow make wealthy people pay more; when a tax
code is this complicated, there are numerous ways in which those who
can afford high-priced accountants and attorneys can reduce their
taxes.
Taxpayers as well as the economy as a whole would benefit from
pro-growth tax reform that eliminated the thousands of pages of red
tape and replaced the current code with a fair, flat rate.
Lastly, an important update on the previously scheduled town hall with
local radio host Cindy Graves: due to unforeseen technical
difficulties, we have had to unfortunately postpone this event. Please
stay tuned to my Facebook page
for future event notices.
I wish a Happy Easter and a joyful Passover to our friends and
neighbors in Florida and throughout the country!

hesitate to contact my Washington, Port Orange, or St. Augustine office
should you need any assistance.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week,
newly
disclosed
emails
from
former
IRS
Exempt
Organizations
head
Lois
Lerner
revealed
that
Lerner
and
other
IRS
officials
discussed
with
the
Department
of
Justice
the
possibility
of
using
criminal
prosecutions
against
conservative
groups
targeted
by
Lerner
and
the
IRS.
The
idea
to
use
criminal
prosecutions
to
squelch
dissent
had
been
proposed
at
a
Senate
hearing
by
Rhode
Island
U.S.
Senator
Sheldon
Whitehouse
in
April
2013.
Prior
to
that
hearing,
the
released
emails
show
that
Lerner,
alluding
to
conservative
leaning
tax-exempt
groups,
sent
an
email
to
her
IRS
colleagues
in
which
she
informed
them
that
the
hearing
would
focus
on
what
she
called
&#8220;the
latest
push
to
shut
these
down.
One
IRS
prosecution
would
make
an
impact
and
they
wouldn&#8217;t
feel
so
comfortable
doing
the
stuff.&#8221;
IRS
officials
met
with
DOJ
officials
to
discuss
this
possibility.
It
is
clear
that
the
Department
of
Justice
has
a
conflict
of
interest
in
the
IRS
matter.
The
DOJ
has
been
conducting
an
&#8220;investigation&#8221;
under
the
supervision
of
a
major
Obama
donor
since
May
2013,
yet
no
prosecutions
have
been
commenced
and
the
department
has
leaked
word
to
media
outlets
such
as
the
Wall
Street
Journal
that
no
prosecutions
will
occur.
The
appointment
of
a
special
prosecutor
is
clearly
in
order.
The
full
House
will
consider
holding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
during
the
next
legislative
session.
I
joined
Gretchen
Carlson
on
Fox
News
to
discuss
these
revelations.
Watch
my
interview
by
clicking
here .
On
Sunday,
I
will
be
speaking
with
Shannon
Bream;
please
tune
in
to
Fox
News
at
1
PM
and
share
your
comments
and
reactions
on
Facebook
and
Twitter !
Last
week,
the
House
Judiciary
Committee&#8217;s
internet
subcommittee
held
a
hearing
to
examine
the
Obama
administration&#8217;s
proposed
handoff
of
the
internet
domain
registration
system
to
the
so-called
international
community.
This
proposal
has
alarmed
a
number
of
people
ranging
from
former
President
Bill
Clinton
to
GOP
members
of
the
House
of
Representatives.
The
bottom
line
is
that
relinquishing
control
of
the
ICANN
system
to
the
international
community
makes
it
more
likely
that
authoritarian
regimes
could
exercise
control
over
the
internet.
The
representative
from
the
Commerce
Department
acknowledged
that
the
U.S.
can
extend
the
contract
for
up
to
four
years,
which
seems
like
the
most
prudent
course
at
this
juncture.
I
will
continue
to
monitor
this
issue
of
internet
freedom
closely
and
will
provide
updates
as
new
developments
unfold.
April
15
is
an
annual
date
of
frustration
for
millions
of
Americans.
The
tax
code
is
over
70,000
pages
long
and
punishes
hard
work,
savings
and
investment.
I
always
get
a
kick
out
of
those
who
think
that
higher
marginal
tax
rates
somehow
make
wealthy
people
pay
more;
when
a
tax
code
is
this
complicated,
there
are
numerous
ways
in
which
those
who
can
afford
high-priced
accountants
and
attorneys
can
reduce
their
taxes.
Taxpayers
as
well
as
the
economy
as
a
whole
would
benefit
from
pro-growth
tax
reform
that
eliminated
the
thousands
of
pages
of
red
tape
and
replaced
the
current
code
with
a
fair,
flat
rate.
Lastly,
an
important
update
on
the
previously
scheduled
town
hall
with
local
radio
host
Cindy
Graves:
due
to
unforeseen
technical
difficulties,
we
have
had
to
unfortunately
postpone
this
event.
Please
stay
tuned
to
my
Facebook

for
future
event
notices.
I
wish
a
Happy
Easter
and
a
joyful
Passover
to
our
friends
and
neighbors
in
Florida
and
throughout
the
country!
