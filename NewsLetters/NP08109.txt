Dear David,
Im writing today to bring awareness to the
constituent services availanblk, and to urge you to
contact me
if you or someone you know is having
trouble with a federal agency. My office has seen a high level of success
in helping constituents cut through bureaucratic red tape, receive
benefits they have earned, or navigate a federal
agency.
To receive regular updates from
my office, click here to sign up for my
e-newsletter.
For example, my office was recently
successful in helping a Watervliet veteran receive a waiver from a benefits
reduction due to an error by the VA. Please
do
not hesitate to call me
if you believe I can be of
service to you or someone you know.
The
constituent services section
of my
website contains a full list of services available through my office.
Please take a moment to take a look and contact me if you think I can
help.
Thanks for reading.
