Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
March 20, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, Senate Democrats continued to obstruct advancement of the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, S. 178
, which would provide help for the oppressed
victims of modern slavery. It is time to put aside any differences we
may have on this legislation so that it can move forward and we can
return the debate to the prevention and ending of human trafficking and
the abuse of children.
I appealed to the members of the Senate last week on this issue
to find common ground and let this debate come
to the floor, and I did so again this week
. I argued the point to my colleagues that
when they lay their heads on the pillow tonight, instead of thinking
about a child that is being abused, they can think about an abuse that
we are working to prevent, because the U.S. Senate took action on
ending this terrible injustice.
Climate Change Accusations
I pushed back this week when a Senate Democrat criticized me and
Coca-Cola over climate change. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.,
wrote an op-ed in USA Today in which he said Republican senators such
as myself "ignore" the good efforts of Georgia companies such as
Coca-Cola when they address climate change.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. As if that wasn't bad enough, Sen. Whitehouse then went to the
Senate floor to criticize Coca-Cola for failing to brief me and other
members of Congress on their climate change efforts. This was another
false allegation, and I went to the Senate floor to set the record
straight.
VA Construction Costs Appalling
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I find it
appalling that the costs to replace the Denver Veterans' Affairs
Medical Center have ballooned to over $1 billion
. Along with Senator Richard Blumenthal,
D-Conn., who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate VA committee, I
asked Secretary McDonald to address the ongoing problems that have
plagued the replacement Denver Veterans' Affairs Medical Center
hospital, including mismanagement that has led to hundreds of millions
of dollars in cost overruns and further delays.
Our veterans in Denver and the surrounding area deserve the best
medical care available in the state-of-the-art facility that they were
promised years ago. Further, the American public, and particularly our
nation's veterans, deserve to know who is responsible and what will be
done to remedy these serious issues.
One of my top priorities as chair of the Senate VA Committee is to
bring oversight directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I
intend to make Denver one of the next in a series of site visits and
field hearings conducted by the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
Reining in Federal Labor Board Overreach
Yesterday, the U.S. House passed a resolution that I co-sponsored to
stop a federal labor board from allowing ambush elections.
That vote took place the same day that I
continued my fight against the National Labor Relations Board's ruling
that is allowing unions to target small numbers of employees within a
company in hopes of organizing them into small bargaining units, or
"micro unions," that fragment the workplace and make it nearly
impossible for employers to manage. Yesterday I introduced the
Representation Fairness Restoration Act
, which seeks to reinstate the 77-year-old
standard for determining which groups of employees should constitute an
appropriate bargaining unit.
AG Day 2015
I enjoyed celebrating Ag Day 2015 this week, and I am grateful to all
those who make agriculture Georgia's top industry.
I want to congratulate Mr. James Lyles of Ringgold, Ga., who was
recognized at the state capitol as 2015 Georgia Farmer of the Year by
the Georgia Department of Agriculture. Mr. Lyles will represent our
great state at the 26th Anniversary of the Swisher Sweets/Sunbelt Expo
Southeastern Farmer of the Year Awards in Moultrie, Ga., in October.
Visit from Georgia Students
It was great to see
students from the Georgia Tech Grand Challenge
Program this week. I enjoyed speaking with these bright and eager young
minds who are the future leaders of our country.
I also enjoyed meeting with Lauren McDonald from the University of
Georgia and
RED Denty from Georgia Southern University
yesterday. Lauren and RED are aspiring journalism students that were
selected by the National Newspapers Association to come to D.C. this
week.
Telephone Town Hall
On Monday evening, I enjoyed speaking with my fellow Georgians during
my live telephone town hall meeting
. I appreciate each question asked during
that hour because it allows me to discuss with you the issues that are
that are most important to you so that I can continue to best represent
you.
Learn more here about how to join the conversation or to listen to
previous telephone town halls.
What's on Tap
Next week, the Senate will begin its work on the Fiscal Year 2016
budget. I plan on offering my biennial budgeting legislation
that would reform Congress' broken budgeting
process and convert it to a two-year cycle as an amendment to the
budget. Additionally, the Senate is expected to consider legislation to
preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to physicians by preventing a
looming 21 percent pay cut.

Dear
Friends,
This

Senate
Democrats
continued
to
obstruct
advancement
of
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act,
S.
178 ,
which
would
provide
help
for
the
oppressed
victims
of
modern
slavery.
It
is
time
to
put
aside
any
differences
we
may
have
on
this
legislation
so
that
it
can
move
forward
and
we
can
return
the
debate
to
the
prevention
and
ending
of
human
trafficking
and
the
abuse
of
children.
I
appealed
to
the
members
of
the
Senate
last
week
on
this
issue
to
find
common
ground
and
let
this
debate
come
to
the
floor,
and
I
did
so
again
this
week .
I
argued
the
point
to
my
colleagues
that
when
they
lay
their
heads
on
the
pillow
tonight,
instead
of
thinking
about
a
child
that
is
being
abused,
they
can
think
about
an
abuse
that
we
are
working
to
prevent,
because
the
U.S.
Senate
took
action
on
ending
this
terrible
injustice.
Climate
Change
Accusations
I
pushed
back
this
week
when
a
Senate
Democrat
criticized
me
and
Coca-Cola
over
climate
change.
Senator
Sheldon
Whitehouse,
D-R.I.,
wrote
an
op-ed
in
USA
Today
in
which
he
said
Republican
senators
such
as
myself
"ignore"
the
good
efforts
of
Georgia
companies
such
as
Coca-Cola
when
they
address
climate
change.
Nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
As
if
that
wasn't
bad
enough,
Sen.
Whitehouse
then
went
to
the
Senate
floor
to
criticize
Coca-Cola
for
failing
to
brief
me
and
other
members
of
Congress
on
their
climate
change
efforts.
This
was
another
false
allegation,
and
I
went
to
the
Senate
floor
to
set
the
record
straight.
VA
Construction
Costs
Appalling
As
chairman
of
the
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs,
I
find
it
appalling
that
the
costs
to
replace
the
Denver
Veterans'
Affairs
Medical
Center
have
ballooned
to
over
$1
billion .
Along
with
Senator
Richard
Blumenthal,
D-Conn.,
who
is
the
ranking
Democrat
on
the
Senate
VA
committee,
I
asked
Secretary
McDonald
to
address
the
ongoing
problems
that
have
plagued
the
replacement
Denver
Veterans'
Affairs
Medical
Center
hospital,
including
mismanagement
that
has
led
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
cost
overruns
and
further
delays.
Our
veterans
in
Denver
and
the
surrounding
area
deserve
the
best
medical
care
available
in
the
state-of-the-art
facility
that
they
were
promised
years
ago.
Further,
the
American
public,
and
particularly
our
nation's
veterans,
deserve
to
know
who
is
responsible
and
what
will
be
done
to
remedy
these
serious
issues.
One
of
my
top
priorities
as
chair
of
the
Senate
VA
Committee
is
to
bring
oversight
directly
to
the
Department
of
Veterans

and
I
intend
to
make
Denver
one

of
site
visits
and
field
hearings
conducted
by
the
Senate
Veterans'

Committee.

Yesterday,
the
U.S.

passed
a

that
I
co-sponsored
to
stop
a
federal
labor

That
vote
took
place
the
same

that
I
continued
my
fight
against
the
National
Labor

Board's
ruling
that
is
allowing

to
target
small
numbers
of
employees
within
a
company
in
hopes
of
organizing
them
into
small
bargaining
units,
or
"micro
unions,"
that
fragment
the
workplace
and
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
employers
to
manage.
Yesterday
I
introduced
the
Representation
Fairness
Restoration
Act ,
which
seeks
to
reinstate
the
77-year-old
standard
for
determining
which
groups
of
employees
