Every election the cynics say the same thing&hellip;
-- Democrats won't vote
-- Democrats won't pitch in
-- Democrats won't win
Well, we're proving them wrong. We're on the brink of an unprecedented milestone -- 2 million donations to elect House Democrats in this election year. But if we&rsquo;re going to pull this off, we need your help, David. It doesn't look like you've had a chance to chip in this year.
Can I count on you right now? All Donations to this Email Triple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Barack Obama
