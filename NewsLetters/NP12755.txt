15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Below is a brief update from the past couple of weeks. As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross

Farm Bill
At a time when there is so much unpredictability, I am pleased to support this five-year Farm Bill that
streamlines the USDA ,
saves taxpayers $23 billion , and helps
provide certainty
for farmers, ranchers, and growers across the country. It also
maintains vital food assistance for families
who are in need and
provides important research funding to fight the deadly citrus greening disease
that is decimating citrus groves and hurting economies across Florida.

Congratulations, Maria Hernandez!
At my most recent town hall meeting, I had the privilege of presenting Maria Hernandez with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. Maria became a citizen this past year. She immigrated to the U.S. in 1992 when her parents came here as migrant workers. She earned a full four-year tuition from Polk Education Foundation and completed her Bachelor's degree in Accounting from USF in 2005. She is now a Business Analyst for Farm Credit of Central Florida. She is such an inspiration.

State of the Union Address
When it comes to creating an even better America,
we must bring people together and not pit our neighbors against one anothe r. As the leader of the free world, the president should unite, not divide.
We should be striving to raise the status quo, not lower those who are successful. The only way that is realistic is by addressing our problems with market-based solutions that are focused on individuals.
