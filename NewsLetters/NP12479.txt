Dear Friend,
I would like to keep you updated on the work I am doing in Congress for
you - whether I'm casting votes on legislation, meeting with
constituents visiting the Capitol, or working with stakeholders on
issues that affect San Antonio, my goal is to ensure your voice is
heard. It is a privilege to serve my hometown by representing you. Here
are some highlights from the past month.
Getting government back to work benefits San Antonio
One of the most basic roles of Congress is to keep the government
funded - the power of the purse. When political ideology and a
take-it-or-leave-it approach gets mixed into the conversation, it
stunts our nation's productivity. That is why it is so important that
Congress passed a working budget to fund government for the rest of the
fiscal year. This funding agreement finally puts some certainty back in
our economy and rolls back the harmful, across-the-board cuts known as
sequestration.
Just like you budget for the rest of the year for your family, Congress
must do the same for the nation. If you're a small business owner,
raising a new family, want to buy a home, or striving to make our
community better - it is key to have certainty for our year ahead.
That includes many staples and landmarks in our city that we know and
recognize on our way to work or in our neighborhood. Some projects of
which have been stalled for years are finally part of a process that is
moving, thanks to the budget agreement.
Here are a few examples of how San Antonio benefits:
*	It provides necessary funding for initiatives such as the
expansion of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park through
the National Parks Service's priority Federal Land Acquisition Projects.
*	The measure also included increased funding for the Federal
Buildings Fund; getting us one step closer to providing the funding
that is needed to begin construction on the San Antonio Courthouse.
*	Additionally, this bill authorizes a 1% pay increase for
civilian federal workers and U.S. Military personnel.
Representing San Antonio at the White House
I am proud to represent a city that is a trailblazer on ways to boost
our community out of an economic recession. I recently joined the
President at the White House as he announced San Antonio as one of the
first five Promise Zones in the nation because of our city's efforts to
partner and collaborate with businesses and non-profits alike to
revitalize whole neighborhoods in the areas of education, housing, job
training and business development. The Promise Zone designation will
assist in cutting through bureaucratic red-tape in order to access
grant opportunities to strengthen the city.
The City of San Antonio will use the additional resources available to
focus on:
*
Job creation and training;
*
Expanding access to high quality pre-K programs, STEM driven
curriculums, and higher education opportunities;
*
And improving public safety by revitalizing neighborhood
infrastructures.
Visiting with Constituents in DC
One of the most common problems in Congress is the disconnect between
Washington and the rest of the country. That is why it has been my
priority in my first year in Congress to continuously connect with San
Antonio in DC. This week alone I had the pleasure of welcoming more
than 100 business and civic leaders from San Antonio for the annual SA
to DC trip.
It was a great opportunity to meet with community leaders
and discuss key issues and priorities for our city like the west side
creeks restoration project, advances in our healthcare system, and
connecting students with employers in San Antonio. I am dedicated to
championing these important issues in order to strengthen the
Infrastructure of Opportunity that allows all San Antonians to reach
for their dreams.
I am encouraged to see things finally starting to move this year in
Congress. I am hopeful we will finally be able to tackle vitally
important issues such as immigration reform and focus on job creation
measures in the coming year. A big part of ensuring this is a year of
action for Congress is making sure that you continue to be engaged - my
door is always open.
Sincerely,
Joaquin Castro

Dear
Friend,
I
would
like
to
keep
you
updated
on
the
work
I

in
Congress
for
you
&#8211;
whether
I&#8217;m

or

with
stakeholders
on
issues
that
affect
San

my

your

It

One

Just
like
you
budget
for
the
rest
of
the
year
for
your
family,
Congress
must
do
the
same
for
the
nation.
If
you&#8217;re
a
small
business
owner,
raising
a
new
family,
want
to
buy
a
home,
or
striving
to
make

&#8211;
it
is
key
