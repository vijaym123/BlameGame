CALLING ALL
INTERNS!
My office is currently
seeking highly motivated college students to serve as interns in my
Washington, D.C. office, as well as my district offices in Rogers, Fort
Smith, and Harrison, for the following
sessions:
Summer Session I: May 25, 2015 - July 3, 2015
Summer Session II:
July 6, 2015 - August 7, 2015
A Congressional internship is a rewarding experience,
and both Washington, D.C. and district office interns will work
closely with my staff and constituents while learning the inner workings of
the United States Congress and about issues affecting Arkansans. I
encourage those interested in political science, government, public
policy, business, and social work to apply.
Internship requirements and application
materials are available
on my website . For more information, please call
(202) 225-4301.
WEEK IN
REVIEW
On Tuesday,
President Obama gave his annual State of the Union address to a joint session
of Congress. In it, the President delivered a laundry list of ideas.
However, many of his ideas have
already been
addressed by House Republicans . I was hopeful that
President Obama would recognize the will of the American people and
the message they sent in November, but in the State of the Union rerun,
he blatantly disregarded both. Furthermore, the growing economy,
shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production
President Obama talked about have not happened because of him, but in
spite of him and his repeated calls for higher taxes, more spending, and
bigger government
policies that have been squarely rejected by the
American people and stand in the way of what hardworking taxpayers need
more than anything: jobs. What part of jobs does he not
understand?
I recorded a video response to the SOTU
for my Facebook followers.
Watch it here!
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 161 , the Natural Gas
Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, by a vote of 253-169.
(See
Roll Call
#41 ) H.R. 1900 expedites the federal review process for applications
for natural gas pipeline certificates by imposing deadlines on involved
agencies. Specifically, the bill amends the Natural Gas Act to
require that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approve or deny
a pipeline certificate within twelve months of receiving the complete
application.
On Thursday
the forty-second anniversary of
Roe
v. Wade
the House bipartisanly passed
H.R. 7 , the No Taxpayer
Funding for Abortion Act, by a vote of 242-179. (See
Roll Call #45 ) H.R.
7 codifies policies enacted for more than thirty years on a case-by-case
basis in Appropriations legislation that bar the use of federal funds
for abortions. Additionally, the bill eliminates tax credits and
subsidies for Obamacare health plans that include elective abortion
coverage. Like all of the Arkansans in Washington who yesterday joined tens
of thousands from across the country to participate in the March for
Life, I was proud to do my part in protecting life and the most
vulnerable among us
the unborn. H.R. 7 advocates for life by ensuring that
those who morally object to abortion are not financing it with their
tax dollars. I believe making permanent this provision, which a majority
of Americans support, is well overdue, and I applaud its passage and
will continue to support policies that protect life and human
dignity.
Today, I had the
opportunity to attend both the Bentonville Chamber's Business
Matters Breakfast and the Springdale Chamber's Annual Meeting. Thanks for
all you do for our communities!
Next week, the House will consider a
number of suspensions aimed at combating human trafficking, the LNG
Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act (H.R. 351), and the Secure Our
Border First Act of 2015 (H.R. 399).
