Blaine's Bulletin
We have now been in Americas new Congress for over 100 days.
And over those 100 days, I am pleased to report the House of Representatives has kept its word to grow an opportunity economy instead of a Washington, D.C. economy. Things are different under House and Senate leadership and there is a lot of information to prove that.
Recently, a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center found that, The first three months of the 114 th
Congress showed a burst of energy, with Congressional committees reporting bills in higher numbers than during recent Congresses.
In the 114 th
Congress, the House of Representatives has passed 62 bills which is more than double the 25 passed in the first 100 days in the last Congress and is twice as many as the 31 passed in the 112 th
Congress. And what is even more telling is, of those bills, eight have been signed into law by the president.
The 62 bills that have been passed out of the House are priorities of Americans for a more prosperous America. For example, an overwhelming percent of Americans want to see implementation of the Keystone XL Pipeline so the first bill the House passed was to start construction
then, unfortunately, the president vetoed it.
The House has also listened to the voices on Main Street and one important piece of legislation that passed was the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This legislation was a compilation of 11 previously House-passed bills that would reduce the regulatory burdens facing emerging growth companies and small business investors. Among one of the 11 bills included was my legislation, the SBIC Advisers Relief Act, which would reduce duplicative registration and regulation on advisers to small business investment companies.
And to support our nations veterans, the House has passed several bills. One bill in particular was the Hire More Heroes Act, which would incentivize small businesses to hire veterans by exempting veterans who already receive health insurance through the Department of Veterans Affairs or reservists covered under TRICARE from being counted towards the number of employees required by the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, the House has voted to repeal the presidents health-care law, passed a budget for a stronger America, and has held the government accountable by unanimously supporting several pieces of legislation dealing with the IRS.
For information on all of the bills the House has passed over the last 100 days, please feel free to contact my office. Over the next 100 days, Americas Congress has no intention of slowing down and I will continue to keep my pledge to support legislation that empowers all Americans.
