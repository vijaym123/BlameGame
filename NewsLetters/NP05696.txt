Dear Fellow New Mexican,
When I travel to communities across New Mexico to discuss issues that impact people every day, what I hear again and again - from veterans, working moms, students, business owners, community leaders and others - is that the most important issues are jobs and the economy.
That's certainly my priority in the Senate.
New Mexicans believe that if you work hard and play by the rules you should be able to get ahead. Yet far too many New Mexicans are working full time at the minimum wage and still finding it hard--some would say impossible--to even get by.
Please take a moment to watch my video on raising the federal minimum wage.

and your thoughts on why raising the minimum wage is important to you and your community
#RaiseTheWage .
I am a proud cosponsor of the
Fair Minimum Wage Act , which would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years and index future increases to inflation. A higher minimum wage puts more money in the pockets of people who are likely to spend locally, helps businesses reduce worker turnover, and increases productivity. And when workers succeed, New Mexico families succeed.
Raising the minimum wage is not only a critical component to the economic stability of working parents, but also contributes enormously to improving the well-being of New Mexico children.
It's time to raise the federal minimum wage.
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
