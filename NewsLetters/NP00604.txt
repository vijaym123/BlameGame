For more than a
year, the House Energy and Commerce Committee (E&amp;C) has been
working with doctors, patients, drug manufacturers, government researchers
and regulators to investigate how we, as Congress, can help
advancements in American medical innovation and treatments.
This week,
these efforts passed E&amp;C unanimously, 51-0, to be brought before the
full House of Representatives.
The
21 st
Century Cures Act would take multiple approaches
to enhance the federal governments positive impact on medical
research and development and while breaking down regulations hindering
medical advancements.
The bill would facilitate public-private
partnerships to spur further innovation, establish a priority process for
the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) review of breakthrough medical
devices and treatments, and grant additional resources to federal
agencies such as FDA, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service.
This only
scratches the surface.
In the fields of medical research
and drug development, government should not be what holds America back
from reaching our full potential.
21 st
Century
Cures
is a strong step to make that a reality.
For
example, I am the lead sponsor of
H.R. 2452 , which is
included in
21 st
Century Cures
as section
2101.
It would allow drug manufacturers, which have the most in-depth
sophisticated information about their products, to share important data
with certain health care professionals.
This would arm medical
providers with scientifically-sound economic data needed to ensure the
most effective and efficient treatments for specific patients with
specific conditions.
Doctors would have better understanding of
which drugs work best for certain patients, opening informed competition
and driving innovation for better drugs and successful
treatments.
21 st
Century Cures
is groundbreaking
landmark legislation that would do wonders to streamline researchers and
scientists work to develop cures and treatments of modern day
diseases.
It would give doctors the tools they need to provide Americans
with high-quality, world class care.
It would implement real
reforms to the governing bureaucracy and improve the American medical
landscape.
As the father of a cancer patient, I know the great
impact every American individual and family would feel as a result of this
powerful bill.
