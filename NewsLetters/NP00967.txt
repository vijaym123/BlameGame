Put simply, an attack on free
speech is an attack on all Americans.
My thoughts and
prayers are with the Garland community and all who were affected by the
horrific attack there this week.
I'm incredibly grateful that law
enforcement and all agencies involved ensured a bad situation did not
become much worse.
This is a sad reminder that we live in
a dangerous world, and I promise to continue to strengthen our
national security and do everything possible to keep Texas safe as your
representative in Washington.
In the meantime, I've spoken with Mayor
Douglas Athas and Governor Greg Abbott and have requested an
intelligence briefing on the attack and continued threats.
Thank
you to all who keep us safe.
