Wisdom of the District: Ebola
On Wednesday, the first known Ebola patient in the United States died in a Texas hospital.
He was allowed to travel to the United States from Liberia and did not display signs of illness during his trip.
Do you support travel restrictions to and from the United States to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus in our country?
( )
Yes, strict travel restrictions such as canceling flights from known Ebola-affected regions should be implemented immediately.
( )
Yes, there should be some mandatory waiting period before coming to America.
Ebola is not detectable (or contagious) until the individual develops symptoms such as fever and vomiting.
( )
No, we should not impose travel restrictions but we should increase fever and health screening for the virus at major U.S. airports.
( )
I have another answer.
