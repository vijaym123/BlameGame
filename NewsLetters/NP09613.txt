Friend,
This week, we commemorate National Police Week to recognize the work of the men and women that selflessly protect our streets and our communities every day across Pennsylvania and our nation.
We honor and recognize the extraordinary sacrifice of those who have given their lives in the service of others.
On average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.
Since the first known line-of-duty death in 1791, more than 20,000 U.S. law enforcement officers have made this ultimate sacrifice.
As we mourn our heroes, let us take a moment to appreciate these ideal citizens to whom we owe an unpayable debt and our unyielding support.
As we go about our daily lives, I ask you to take a moment and give a Thank You to the thousands of police officers that defend our schools, businesses, and families at home and on the road.
It is essential that we ensure that our law enforcement officers and departments have the necessary resources to continue carrying out their honorable service. For that reason, I cosponsored H.R. 2889, the Local Jobs for America Act, which would provide additional funding for communities to hire and rehire additional law enforcement officers, in additions to a number of provisions that would put more emergency responders in firehouses and keep more teachers in the classrooms.
Please join me in publicly thanking each of these brave men and women who risk their lives on our behalf.
Sincerely,
