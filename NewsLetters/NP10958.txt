Stockman urges House to repeal military base gun
ban WASHINGTON
Congressman Steve Stockman (R-TX
36) Thursday urged his House colleagues to pray for and support the
victims and victims families of Wednesdays fatal shooting at Fort Hood,
and to support his bill, H.R. 3199, the Safe Military Bases Act,
which repeals the Clinton-era ban on military personnel carrying weapons
on base. This is the third mass shooting on a military base in
five years, and its because our trained soldiers arent allowed to
carry defensive weapons, said Stockman. Anti-gun activists have
turned our military bases into soft targets for killers. Only the
most out-of-touch radical would try to disarm soldiers.
Its
time to repeal this deadly anti-gun law before it creates another mass
killing, said Stockman.
This is another tragedy created by
anti-gun activists.
If members of Congress are protected by loaded
automatic weapons in the Capitol they have no right to deny that right
to trained soldiers on base. In 1991, just six miles from Fort
Hood, we suffered a mass shooting at a Lubys cafeteria of civilians
who by law had to leave their guns in their cars.
Texas
responded to this tragedy by passing a concealed carry bill allowing civilians
to defend themselves in public, said Stockman Its time for
Congress to allow soldiers to defend themselves on base before this happens
again. -30-
