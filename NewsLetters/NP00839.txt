Supporting the USA Freedom
Act
5/13/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted for H.R. 2048, the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective
Discipline Over Monitoring (USA FREEDOM) Act of 2015. H.R. 2048
includes reforms designed to strengthen privacy and civil liberty
protections that are a part of the nations intelligence-gathering programs
operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
"This bill will safeguard
the civil liberties of Americans by limiting bulk collection of data
and increasing legislative and judicial oversight of our intelligence
agencies while maintaining a workable and more transparent framework
for intelligence officials to protect our national security. I urge the
Senate to move expeditiously on this legislation so that we can work
to bring back the confidence of the American people in the way
intelligence is gathered and protect the privacy rights of all
Americans."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
