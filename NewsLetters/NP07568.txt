In
response to the ongoing crisis at the border, where more than 50,000
men, women and children have entered the United States illegally in
recent months, President Obama has sent Congress a proposal costing $3.7
billion. When I asked you two weeks ago if you supported this plan,
more than 83 percent of you said no.
Like many of you, I
have grave concerns about a plan with such a hefty price tag, and the
House is considering alternatives to the Presidents $3.7 billion
plan.
What Do You Think? Which of the following components would
you like Congress to include in a plan to address the border crisis?
Please select all that apply. Amend the 2008 law so that all unaccompanied minors are
detained and receive prompt hearings. Prohibit the Administration from blocking Border
Patrol access to federal lands along the border. Deploy the National Guard to the
border to assist Border Patrol. Provide funding (less than $1 billion, offset by
spending reductions) for additional judges to expedite hearings, for enhanced
border security, for the return of individuals to their home
countries, and for detention during the removal process. None of the above: Congress should
approve the $3.7 billion Presidents proposal. None of the above: Congress should not
pass new legislation addressing the border. Other: *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to
