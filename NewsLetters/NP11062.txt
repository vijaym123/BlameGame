Dear David,
It's officially the spring season! If you're anything like me, you're
certainly ready for some sunshine and warm weather. I wanted to take a
moment to give you a brief update on what I've been up to these past
few weeks. Between newsletters, don't forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook
page for daily updates! As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply
want to express your opinion. I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,

Assistance Programs (AASAP)
Committee Spotlight
This week, the House Financial Services Committee
began a series of hearings examining our
spending-driven debt crisis with a hearing entitled, "Why Debt Matters."
Debt matters because our country is on an unsustainable fiscal path
that leads to fiscal ruin - driven by irresponsible spending of money
we don't have. Our debt has grown dramatically over the last 6 years
and things are only getting worse. Today, I delivered the Financial
Services Committee Sunday Video Message
on this very topic.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee
continues to monitor the situation in Ukraine. This
week, the Committee held a mark-up of legislation reaffirming the
United States' support for Ukraine. I worked to include a provision in
the bill that extends sanctions to Russian individuals who provide
certain arms and technology to the Assad regime in Syria. The Committee
also held a hearing entitled "The Geopolitical Potential of the U.S.
Energy Boom." Click here
to watch an archived webcast of that hearing.
Fighting Back Against Obamacare: Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act of 2014
President Obama's signature achievement, Obamacare, has unnecessarily
raised the costs of health insurance, but this isn't the scariest
aspect of the law. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
the agency tasked with implementing Obamacare, failed to perform a full
assessment of security threats of the new Obamacare websites prior to
their launch. As a result, we are now seeing security breaches across
the system. Additionally, hackers who have accessed the system are
sharing their stories online, opening up the door to additional
attacks.
I was proud to vote for the Health Exchange Security and Transparency
Act of 2014 earlier this year. This legislation requires HHS to notify
you if your personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed
through an Obamacare exchange. Further, notifications must occur no
later than two business days after discovery by the government, the
same standard to which we currently hold the private sector
accountable. At the very least, you deserve to be notified when your
privacy has been violated and your personal information is at risk. I
will continue to work with my colleagues to push the Administration to
address data security and, when necessary, alert you to its failures.

Women's History Month
March is Women's History month, an opportunity to celebrate and honor
the achievements of women throughout history. In 1981, Congress passed
a joint resolution recognizing the first "Women's History Week." It was
expanded to a month-long celebration six years later.
This month, I am reminded of the important women in my life who have
done so much not only for me, but also their communities. In
particular, I want to recognize my mom, Avis, my sister, Sarah, and my
wife, Anna.
I am also reminded of several notable Arkansas women who have earned
their place in history. Former Arkansas Senator Hattie Caraway was the
first female United States Senator to serve a full term and the first
female chair of a Senate Committee. Daisy Gaston Bates was a Civil
Rights activist and mentored the Little Rock Nine during their
desegregation efforts. Hazel Walker, an inductee into the Women's
Basketball hall of fame, was trailblazer for women's athletics in the
20th century. Please join me in honoring these remarkable Arkansas
women and countless others, both past and present, as we celebrate
Women's History Month.

H.R. 2824:Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs
in America
The Obama Administration has spent 5 years rewriting an existing coal
mining regulation that had already undergone environmental review. An
investigation found that their "rewrite" has been grossly mismanaged,
politically influenced, and wasted nearly $10 million in taxpayer
dollars. Arkansas coal miners deserve certainty. This legislation would
require the Administration to halt the unnecessary rewrite immediately
and implement the original regulation. It would help put an end to the
Obama Administration's wasteful and disastrous rule making by
establishing a responsible process balancing coal mining and
environmental protection.
H.R. 1459: Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National
Monuments Act
Under an outdated law, the President can designate National Monuments
without any input from the public or those who would be impacted by a
proposed monument. Arkansans and Americans deserve a voice in the
designation of their National Monuments. This legislation ensures
public participation in the National Monument designation process while
protecting historic artifacts and sites of scientific value through
temporary designations.

Spotlight: Supporting the Three Rivers Study
This week, I joined my fellow members of the Arkansas Congressional
Delegation and our colleagues in the Oklahoma delegation in sending a
letter to Jo Ellen Darcy, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil
Works, voicing support for the Three Rivers Study. The Three Rivers
Study is a proposed reconnaissance study of McClellan-Kerr Arkansas
River Navigation System, which faces a breach between miles 3 and 9 on
the White Rivers. A breach would make navigation impossible for more
than 90 days and cost over $300 million, including the loss of
thousands of acres of wetlands. Full text of the letter and our joint
statement can be read here

Around Arkansas
Recently, I had the opportunity to address the Arkansas Vending
Council's Annual Convention in Hot Springs. I provided a brief

Fighting
Back
Against
Obamacare:
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
of
2014
President
Obama&#8217;s
signature
achievement,
Obamacare,
has
unnecessarily
raised
the
costs
of
health
insurance,
but
this
isn&#8217;t
the
scariest
aspect
of
the
law.
The
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS),
the
agency
tasked
with
implementing
Obamacare,
failed
to
perform
a
full
assessment
of
security
threats
of
the
new
Obamacare
websites
prior
to
their
launch.
As
a
result,
we
are
now
seeing
security
breaches
across
the
system.
Additionally,
hackers
who
have
accessed
the
system
are
sharing
their
stories
online,
opening
up
the
door
to
additional
attacks.
I
was
proud
to
vote
for
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
of
2014
earlier
this
year.
This
legislation
requires
HHS
to
notify
you
if
your
personal
information
has
been
stolen
or
unlawfully
accessed
through
an
Obamacare
exchange.
Further,
notifications
must
occur
no
later
than
two
business
days
after
discovery
by
the
government,
the
same
standard
to
which
we
currently
hold
the
private
sector
accountable.
At
the
very
least,
you
deserve
to
be
notified
when
your
privacy
has
been
violated
and
your
personal
information
is
at
risk.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
colleagues
to
push
the
Administration
to
address
data
security
and,
when
necessary,
alert
you
to
its
failures.
