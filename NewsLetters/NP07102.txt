Dear Friends,
We are coming to the end of
summer break for hundreds of thousands of students across South
Florida. It is a bittersweet time for some students as they prepare to start
a new school year and the next chapter of their educational careers,
yet lose their extra leisure time. Before our students set out on
their scholastic adventures, I encourage you to offer them a few words of
inspiration and support.
All the hours in class, all the
demanding work, and even the difficult exams will be worth it in the
end.
Education is a valuable tool that allows you to make wiser life
choices. Each day we all make choices, some big, others small, but
they add up to make us who we are and where we will go. Through
perseverance, compassion, right choices, and a great deal of hard work,
students can accomplish all of their dreams.
Also now is a great
time to remind parents of younger students that a new school year is the
perfect time to start thinking of their childs future education.
During my time in the Florida legislature, I helped create the
Florida Prepaid College Plan . The Florida Prepaid College
Plan allows parents to lock in the cost of college when they began
paying into the program. I fully understand the economic hardships that
parents endure in order to try to provide their children a quality
education. This is an excellent way for families to save so that their
children can receive a quality college education.
As a former
Florida certified teacher, I know the importance of making sure our
children receive quality educational opportunities to succeed in life. Part
of this success is ensuring that teachers have the tools necessary to
do their jobs. The Department of Education launched the
Federal Resources for Educational Excellence
website that
provides teachers with free educational resources in a variety of
academic topics.
Floridas Department of Education
is
also an excellent source of information for our teachers.
I am
hopeful that our South Floridian students will accomplish all their
educational goals this year and into the future. Best of luck to
all!

to start August 18 th .
