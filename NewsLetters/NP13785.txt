Dear
David,
On Friday,
December 13, 2013, the House Republican Leadership will close the doors
on the U.S. House of Representatives for the year, concluding the
least productive legislative session in modern history. Speaker John
Boehner
has said
that he will do this even if no
budget agreement is reached. Without such an agreement, the devastating
cuts of sequestration will continue and our government runs the risk of
another shutdown and default in the New Year.
I, for one, do
not want to be sent home before fulfilling one of our most basic
duties on behalf of the American people, which is why I introduced H.Res.
242 on November 20, 2013. This resolution would very simply prohibit
the House from adjourning until a budget agreement is reached. It is
time to stop governing crisisto-crisis and finally give the American
people and American businesses the certainty that comes with passing a
federal budget. My message to my fellow Members of Congress?
No budget, no vacation.
This
Republican House has redefined the term unproductive by
setting records for futility
with its glacial legislative
pace and then shutting down the government when they dont get their
way.Unfortunately, the House GOP is already sending signals that next
year might not be much better. A recent
story
reported that Republican leaders distributed a blank piece of
paper labeled Agenda 2014 in a meeting with Republican lawmakers. In a
recent press conference, Speaker Boehner also called for more votes
to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act in the New Year
as if
the first 46 repeal votes were not enough.
According to
a recent Gallup Poll , the 113th Congress has a
reached an all-time low with an approval rating of a mere nine percent.
This is a clear sign that Americans expect Congress to rise above the
politics of partisanship and obstruction and come together in good faith
to do the job for which we were elected. You can count on me to
continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pursue
responsible, bipartisan solutions to our countrys many pressing
issues.
Sincerely,
Tell A Friend
