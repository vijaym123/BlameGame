Friend,
We wanted to follow up with you about our exciting new project - our
Bera for Congress mobile app.
We&#39;ve been testing the app out around the office, and we&#39;re getting rave reviews from volunteers and staffers alike -
click here to watch two of our volunteers discuss how this app is helping their work.
- Our campaign manager Danny likes the fact that he can use it to sign up new volunteers - all supporters have to do is put their information into the app, and they&#39;re signed up to join our campaign efforts
- A volunteer, Aseem
(as seen in the video!)
likes the fact that he can quickly pull up information about where the Congressman stands on certain issues - he says it makes it easier for him to have productive discussions with voters at the door
- The finance team, shockingly enough, is really into the quick and easy donate button - we definitely need it to combat Doug Ose&#39;s self-funded campaign
Our app could really make the difference as we get closer to November. This election will come down to ground game vs ground game - and as you can see from the feedback above, this app will help us step up our grassroots efforts in a big way.
Now we need your help getting it off the ground - click here and give now.
Like it or not, we live in an age of convenience and instant gratification. Congressional campaigns don&#39;t usually run that way, but with the help of this app, we&#39;ll be much more convenient and instant than we would be without it.
Click now and give $5 or whatever you can to help us get this thing off the ground.
Thanks - we&#39;ll be in touch.
Best,
Team Bera
PS - Ami is a big fan of the app too - he&#39;s showing it off to everyone he knows. Donate $5, $10, or $15 now to keep it up and running.
