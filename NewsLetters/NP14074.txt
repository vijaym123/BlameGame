Reflecting 50 years later on the loss of a great American patriot
U.S. Representative Candice S. Miller
November 22, 1963, is often described as the day America lost its innocence.
Shattered by a bullet fired into a Texas
motorcade which took the life of our young and charismatic 35th president, John F. Kennedy.
And there is an element of truth in that description.
The Kennedy assassination and its aftermath produced a sense of collective shock and stunned disbelief which, in hindsight,
could be characterized as the dividing line between a shiny, optimistic era of post-war American ascension and the dark days of Vietnam and Watergate that followed.
Like virtually every American alive and old enough to recall it, I remember where I was at the moment I heard the news
- in a 4th grade classroom in St. Clair Shores where our teacher, Mrs. Spurlock, briefly left the room and returned in tears to say the president had been shot. We were too young to understand exactly what it meant, but knew how unusual it was for our teacher
to be crying, and that something deeply confusing and distressing had occurred.
Fifty years later, that sense remains.
But the passage of time also should allow us to reflect on the deeper lessons to
be learned from the life and death of JFK.
America was not innocent on November 22, 1963.
Since its founding, our nation had endured the near death experience of
a Civil War, a Great Depression and two bloody global conflicts.
President Kennedy knew as well as anyone that the price of freedom is always great, and never fully paid.
More importantly, Kennedy&#8217;s premature death reminds us of the truth of one of his most stirring declarations, from a speech
delivered nine months before his assassination: &#8220;A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.
Ideas have endurance without death.&#8221;
Some of John F. Kennedy&#8217;s most exalted ideas - civil rights for all, a national commitment to the exploration of space
and American determination to serve as a bulwark against the scourge of Soviet communism - didn&#8217;t bear fruit until well after he himself was gone.
And his assassin (a devoted communist) didn&#8217;t understand the lasting power of ideas.
I believe that by and
large Americans do.
We lost a great man and a great patriot in Dallas 50 years ago.
But we didn&#8217;t lose our innocence.
Nor did we lose our
belief in the future.
That wouldn&#8217;t have surprised John Kennedy.
In fact, he predicted it.
