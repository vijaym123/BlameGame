Duplicative government programs add layers of bulky bureaucracy
and cost American taxpayers
billions
every year.
Thats why Im cosponsoring
a resolution
to require Congress to justify to the American people why a new program is necessary and how it adds value,
before
the program or initiative is created.
Yours in service,
Randy
