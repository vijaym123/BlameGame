In order to enhance the service I provide to you, I now have a Pinterest account for information/convenience. Please follow the account by clicking on the Pinterest icon in the middle of this email or by clicking on the icon on the right-hand side of this email.
Click on the picture below to follow my Pinterest account.
In addition to Pinterest, I also have other social media accounts to offer you for your information. By clicking on the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest images on the right-hand side, you'll be able to follow me via social media, which will allow you to receive the most current information on activities in the 4th Congressional District and Washington, DC, while saving hard-earned tax dollars on postage and printing costs. Again, you can "like" my official Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube accounts by clicking on the icons to the right.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
