Laredo Airport Unveils New Fire Station
Rep. Cuellar joined City of Laredo officials for the unveiling of a new fire station at the Laredo International Airport on Tuesday.
I joined representatives from the City of Laredo on Tuesday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony unveiling the new $4.5 million, 15,400 square foot Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Station (RFFS) at the Laredo International Airport. The RFFS was 90 percent funded by a federal grant from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), while the City of Laredo funded the remaining 10 percent.
Due to the RFFSs key location and proximity to airport runways, the station is expected to greatly reduce emergency response time and enhance safety for passengers traveling through the airport.
Leaders take part in Promise Zones HUD workshop in Laredo
City, county, state and federal leaders attended the Promise Zones HUD workshop I hosted at Texas A&amp;M International University in Laredo on Wednesday.
I hosted a workshop this week with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at Texas A&amp;M International University to discuss a revitalization plan and hopes for a Promise Zone designation for Laredo. With this designation, the area could be eligible for millions of dollars in federal grant money.
