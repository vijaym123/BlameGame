Friends,
Our casework team had a
terrific year in constituent service and since it is our job to serve you,
I want to update you on how we have been
performing.
In 2014, our team processed over 1,500 constituent cases with a 98.7
open to close percentage.
To put that into context, this is a 50
percent increase from our first year in office.
Veterans
Affairs casework remains our top casework area, amounting to one-third of
all constituent cases opened with our team.
The Grand Strand
casework team handled 60 percent of our casework load and the Pee Dee team
handled 40 percent.
The charts below show the breakdown of cases
by issue area and county.
It is no secret that
the federal government is slow, expansive, and difficult to navigate.
While I am working hard to rein in the size of
government and modernize its policies, please let our caseworkers assist you
in your individual interactions with federal government agencies.
Our team, listed below, is extremely knowledgeable and has built
valuable relationships with agency staff.
You can reach the Grand
Strand Casework Team at 843-445-6459 and the Pee Dee Casework Team at
843-679-9781.

Stopping the
Presidents Unconstitutional Executive Actions
After
President Obama announced his immigration executive action, I sent
out an e-survey to get your thoughts on his decision to unilaterally
change the law and delay deportations. Here are the poll results:
A
resounding 78.86 percent of respondents said that they think President
Obama should not defer deportations for illegal immigrants.
Furthermore, the Constitution does not grant ANY President the authority to
unilaterally change our countrys immigration laws.
As such, I
supported legislation
last week that
prohibits funding for the Presidents unconstitutional immigration
actions, urges the federal government to put the interests of legal
immigrants ahead of illegal immigrants, and ensures that sex offenders and
domestic violence perpetrators are priorities for deportation.
We
are a nation of immigrants and welcome anyone willing to come here
legally, but breaking our laws and ignoring the Constitution will not be
tolerated.
Tuesday at 9PM
This
week President Obama will deliver his State of the Union Speech before a
joint session of Congress and the American people.
It is my
hope that the President included working with the Republican-led Congress
as one of his New Year Resolutions for 2015.
While our economy
continues to turn around and more Americans are going back to work,
middle class Americans have seen their paychecks shrink.
Families
have seen their budgets squeezed.
We need to focus on scaling
back the size of government, reining in regulations, and lowering tax
rates.
This will reduce the governments burden on families and
communities and make our country competitive.
I am
looking forward to having
Horry County Police Chief
Saundra Rhodes
attend the State of the Union with me on
Tuesday.
Prior to the event, I will join WPDE and WMBF to preview the
Presidents speech and discuss the issues facing our country.
I
will post more information about these interviews on my
Facebook page
next week, but you can watch the State of
the Union at 9:00 PM ET on Tuesday, January
20.
Equality For All
Tomorrow, our nation
celebrates the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Dr.
King changed the world and inspired a nation.
He had dreams,
ambitions, and goals that were bigger than him.
As he said, Our
lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
To this day, Dr. Kings messages of freedom and leadership
resonate around the world.
We will never let his legacy and the changes
he inspired subside.
It is an honor and privilege
to serve you.
Have a good
week,
