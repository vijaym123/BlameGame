Fully Funding DHS and
Enforcing All Federal Immigration Laws
I
believe we must fully fund the enforcement of all of the immigration
laws of our country.
Unfortunately, the President has taken a
different path and has shut down the government's ability to carry out the
immigration laws on the books. It's time for Congress to stand up for
the American people and the Constitution. No President is above the
law. I could not support either of the short-term funding resolutions
offered on Friday by House Leadership because neither of the proposals
ensured that our immigration laws will actually be
enforced.
FCC Votes to Approve Government Regulation of
Internet
Click here to watch a Youtube video of Congressman Yoder's
floor speech.
One of the FCC commissioners has
referred to it as a solution that wont work to a problem that doesnt
exist.
On Thursday, I spoke on the
House floor about the troubling vote by the FCC to approve its new
proposal to bring big government of the 1930's to control today's internet
by designating Internet Service Providers as regulated
utilities.
I know of no industry that has
become more vibrant, more free, and led to more innovation after a
government takeover. Allowing the FCC to designate the internet a regulated
utility will increase taxes and allow government to decide pricing,
cost, content or anything else.
Netanyahu to Address
Joint Session of Congress
Tomorrow, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to address a joint session of the
United States Congress. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister
Netanyahu to America and am interested in what has to say regarding the
state of US-Israel relations and how we can further aid one of our most
important allies as many of its neighbors threaten its security every
day.
The speech comes as the Obama Administration stands
poised to secure an agreement that would allow Iran to continue assert
the right to enrich uranium, spin thousands of centrifuges, and grow its
intercontinental ballistic missile program. Furthermore, the
agreement would give unprecedented sanctions relief that would allow Iran to
re-enter the international community as, what President Obama himself
has suggested, "a very succesful regional power." Even though it
professes that "no deal is better than a bad deal," the Administration is
set to accept a bad deal.
Rather than criticize and push
back against Prime Minister Netanyahu's efforts to shed light on how
profoundly misguided such an agreement would be, I would urge the
Administration to work with our closest ally in the Middle East to come up
with a better solution regarding Iran. Sanctions should not only be
allowed to continue, but also should be ramped up to ensure that Iran
does not have the resources to achieve their goal of nuclear
proliferation. No deal should be accepted that allows the Iranian regime to
continue to push forward with their nuclear program while they continue to
threaten Israel, and by proxy the United States, with such fiery
rhetoric.
House Passes Bill to Make College More
Affordable by Modernizing 529 Plans
Last week, the House
passed
HR 529
with my support. This bill, introduced by fellow Kansan, Congresswoman
Lynn Jenkins, takes important steps to expand, strengthen, and
modernize 529 college savings accounts. It empowers students to use their 529
savings to purchase computers, reflecting the modern reality that a
computer is necessary for todays college student. It also removes
unnecessary rules that increase paperwork and impose costs on plan
administrators.
If President Obama is serious about helping more Americans attend
higher education, he should support this bipartisan plan instead of his
failed idea to raise taxes on hardworking families already taking
advantage of these important savings tools.
Financial Services Subcommittee
Hearing
Click here to watch a Youtube video of
Congressman Yoder's line of questioning.
During last
week's Oversight Hearing on the Internal Revenue Service, I questioned
IRS officials on the overall toxic culture at the agency and suggested
that we need sweeping reforms, such as implementing the Fair Tax, to
eliminate the agency's influence in our daily lives.
Click

POLITICO' s coverage of continued sidetracking of
conservative groups' requests for tax exempted status by the
IRS.
I also asked about the IRS' assertion that Americans
do not have an expectation of privacy in their email communications. I
believe Americans disagree with this frankly astonishing assertion,
and that we do have an expectation of privacy in our digital
communications, which is why I've introduced
HR 699 - the Email Privacy Act.
Friend of Farm Bureau Award
I was honored to receive
the Kansas Farm Bureau's Friend of Farm Bureau Award for the 113th
Congress for my work as the Vice Chairman of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Agriculture. I look forward to continuing to work on
behalf of Kansas farmers and ranchers in the subcommittee again this
Congress.
Agriculture Subcommittee Hearing
At the FY
2016 Budget Hearing for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, I
questioned FSIS Administrator Al Almanza about initiatives his agency
has set up to protect Kansans and they food they eat. We also
discussed ways to save taxpayer funds by streamlining efforts to modernize
food safety procedures that protect our friends and families back at
home.
Johnson County Commissioners
Congressman Yoder with County Manager Hannes Zacharias and
Commissioner Steve Klika.
It was great to get a visit
in my Washington DC office from Johnson County Manager Zacharias and
Commissioner Klika. We discussed the county's legislative priorities for
the 114th Congress, such as the impact regulations and other unfunded
mandates have on residents of Johnson County.
Groundbreaking for New
Sanctuary at Church of the Resurrection
This was a special week for our community and the members of the United
Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood. Following services I
was honored to join Rev. Adam Hamilton in the groundbreaking ceremony
for a new permanent sanctuary at the main
campus.
As members of the congregation, my family and I look
forward to worshipping in the new hall upon its
completion.
Fact of the Week
A poll taken in January shows that 58% of Americans disapprove of
President Obama's actions on immigration.
