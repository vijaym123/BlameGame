A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions

This week marked the end of the first session of the 113th Congress.
However, official business will continue next week in North Texas as
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee holds a field
hearing in North Texas to investigate the ObamaCare navigator program.
I'm delighted that Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and
several of my Texas colleagues will attend the hearing and I hope that
you will be able to join us.

I look forward to joining Chairman Issa next week to help provide the
people of the 32nd Congressional District with the answers that they
deserve about the instances of fraud and abuse in Texas from the
ObamaCare navigator program. In particular, I hope to address our
concerns regarding the Administration's lack of oversight and federal
guidelines surrounding the program and to learn more about how
officials in Texas are responding.
This field hearing is open to the public. Please note that
participation is limited to the panel and witnesses during official
congressional hearings. In order to accommodate attendees, please RSVP
to let us know that you are coming.
House-Senate Budget Agreement
On Thursday, the House approved the budget agreement reached by House
Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray to set
budget levels for fiscal year 2014 and 2015. For over four years, the
House and Senate have failed to reach a bipartisan budget resolution
due to differing plans that are billions of dollars apart. This failure
to find common ground has forced our nation to operate on a short-term,
piece-meal basis that is not conducive to economic growth or job
creation.
The Ryan-Murray agreement
establishes a
long-term budget plan that will reduce the deficit by $23 billion,
provide much-needed certainty to the marketplace, and ensure our
ability to protect national security.
This compromise shifts the
deficit reduction achieved by short-term, arbitrary cuts in
discretionary spending to cuts in mandatory spending - the true driver
of our debt. Additionally, the measure voted on in the House today
includes a vital three month 'doc fix' to ensure that our nation's
seniors continue to have access to quality health care.
House Republicans recognize that this agreement is only a small step
and that there is far more work to be done to restore fiscal sanity in
Washington and get our economy back on track. In the weeks and months
ahead, I will continue to fight for common-sense reforms and
responsible spending cuts to move us toward a smaller government that
allows the free-enterprise system to thrive. For more information on
the budget plan, click here

Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

House-Senate
Budget
Agreement On
Thursday,
the
House
approved
the
budget
agreement
reached
by
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
and
Senator
Patty
Murray
to
set
budget
levels
for
fiscal
year
2014
and
2015.
For
over
four
years,
the
House
and
Senate
have
failed
to
reach
a
bipartisan
budget
resolution
due
to
differing
plans
that
are
billions
of
dollars
apart.
This
failure
to
find
common
ground
has
forced
our
nation
to
operate
on
a
short-term,
piece-meal
basis
that
is
not
conducive
to
economic
growth
or

The
Ryan-Murray
agreement
establishes
a
long-term
budget
plan
that
will
reduce
the
deficit
by
$23
billion,
provide
much-needed

This

shifts
the

&#8211;
the

Additionally,
the

in
the
House
today
includes
a

to
ensure
that
our
nation&#8217;s

House
Republicans

be
done
to
