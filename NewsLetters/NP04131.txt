Dear Friend,
I have a lot to be thankful for this year. My family, my wonderful friends, and our great country that we celebrate on Thanksgiving.
I&rsquo;m deeply grateful for your friendship and the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate -- and that couldn't have happened without your dedicated work and support.
It was you who helped me build a winning campaign. It was you who stood up for taking action on climate change, creating new jobs, protecting Medicare and Social Security and equal rights. I cannot thank you enough.
Together, we will work to improve the lives of every person, and to ensure a more peaceful future in this interdependent, interconnected world.
This Thanksgiving, let us give thanks to all those people in our communities who work to build a better, fairer, healthier, more prosperous America and world. Let us also take the time to provide a helping hand to those in need. And our special gratitude to the brave young men and women in uniform serving our country far from home this year.
Happy Thanksgiving from our table to yours. And my thanks for all of your incredible, inspiring support.
