100 days in...
Dear friend
This week marked the first 100 days of the new Congress, and already, weve had some significant wins for Floridians. Protecting seniors, eliminating wasteful government spending, fighting for our local environment, and advocating for the concerns of our community are just some of the important things Ive been hard at for work for the Palm Beaches and Treasure Coast.
By putting partisanship aside and focusing on the issues that matter, heres a snapshot of what we have been able to accomplish so far:
Earlier this year, Rep. Murphy spoke on a panel to discuss the importance of Medicare Advantage to the district
Protecting Seniors
Last month, I led over 200 members of Congress in an effort to protect seniors, urging the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to avoid harmful cuts to Medicare Advantage. This is a program that seniors throughout our district
and 1.5 million Floridians
rely upon for quality care and services, and any cuts would be devastating. I was proud to announce that our bipartisan coalition was successful in stopping the proposed Medicare Advantage cuts, a major win for Florida seniors.
Rooting out waste
This year, I worked across the aisle to reintroduce the SAVE Act, which will strategically eliminate $479 billion in government wasteful spending by eliminating fraud and improving efficiency. This is a common-sense approach to getting our fiscal house in order that all members of Congress can agree on.
Fighting for our environment
Rep. Murphy greeted the President to the district and thanked him for including funding for important projects to protect our waterways.
In February, I was proud to announce the inclusion of millions of dollars in funding I requested in the Presidents FY2016 budget for projects that will protect waterways along the Treasure Coast and across the state. Funding for Everglades restoration included in the budget
$124 million
has nearly doubled since last year, and many of these projects will have a direct impact on the ongoing crisis facing the St. Lucie River Estuary and Indian River Lagoon. This is a great step forward, and Ill continue to fight for our waterways as the budget moves through Congress.

Advocating for our communities
Here in Washington, Im continuing to make sure the constituent voices are heard over the proposed All Aboard Florida project that will cut through our communities. Thats why I organized a meeting between the Federal Railroad Administration and Florida NOT All Aboard to discuss the serious safety, economic, and livability issues that regarding the project.
As long as I serve in Congress, Ill continue to put the concerns of our district first and make sure theyre heard here in Washington.
Still, there is a lot of work to do. By continuing to work together and focusing on the important issues facing the district, we can continue to find solutions that will benefit our communities throughout Florida.
Sincerely,
Patrick Murphy
U.S. Congress
