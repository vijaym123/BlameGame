Carper's Connection
December 23, 2014
Dear Friends,
Each holiday season, I am reminded of just how special this time of
year is. Not only do I have the opportunity to spend time with loved
ones and friends, but I have time to take a moment to reflect. As I
think about my year and reflect on how I've done in fulfilling the
commitment I've made to myself, my family, my fellow Delawareans and my
country, I want to share a message with you.
This year I would also like to share a proverb I've borrowed from the
Hindu faith: "In the joy of others lies our own." As we welcome a New
Year, I hope that we can come together, on behalf of Delawareans and
folks across the country, and spread joy this holiday season.
Happy Holidays,
