Dear Friend,
Hi. I know you know what&rsquo;s up -- our FEC Pre-General election deadline at midnight and all that -- so I&rsquo;ll get right to the point. We&rsquo;re short.
$1,837 short, to be exact. And we&rsquo;ve got 5 hours left to make this happen. Get us $5 closer to our $8O,OOO goal before the FEC deadline at midnight TONIGHT.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Ed&rsquo;s been telling you about our ground game here in Massachusetts, and about the chances for Democrats nationally. It&rsquo;s all going to come down to turnout this year.
Our Get Out the Vote efforts are in full swing in Massachusetts. Same goes for Democrats all across the country. But friend --
that could all come to a screeching halt if we don&rsquo;t have the financial support to keep them running. Chip in $5, $10, even $20 if you can swing it and help us hit $8O,OOO.
Thank you!
Colleen
