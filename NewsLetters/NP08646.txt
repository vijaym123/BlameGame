A Message from Congressman Paul Broun
Broun Works to Ensure Quality Care for Veterans
Last week, Congressman Broun took a stand for veterans and voted in support of bipartisan legislation which works to restore care and hold the VA accountable.
H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act,
would give veterans the ability to receive non-VA care at the departments expense to any veteran who cannot get an appointment within VA wait time goals, or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility. Additionally, this bill would suspend bonuses for all VA employees for the next two years. Dr. Broun proudly supported this bills passage, and urges the Senate to act on this bipartisan bill immediately.

While the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki was a step in the right direction, it did not solve the obviously systemic problems negatively affecting Americas veterans and their families. This is just the first step in fixing the VA. Our work is not done.
The VA scandal is far worse than a scandal
it is a moral outrage. Americans who served our nation in the armed forces were denied treatment; forced to endure additional pain and suffering; and, in some cases, ultimately died because of lack of care.
