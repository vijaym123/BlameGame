When federal agencies propose new regulations, I believe the process should be transparent. The agencies should be required to provide timely, detailed information about how much the proposed rule will cost and what impact it will have on businesses, families, and communities. This helps minimize the risk of unintended consequences.
That is why I am cosponsoring the ALERT Act ( H.R. 1759 ) to make that happen, and prevent new regulations from taking place if federal agencies fail to provide timely information in a transparent fashion.
Specifically, the ALERT Act
does three things; it:
1.
Forces federal agencies to give more detailed annual disclosures about planned regulations and their expected costs, final rules, and cumulative regulatory costs;
2.
Requires monthly, online updates on planned regulations and their expected costs, so that those who will be affected know in real-time how they can better plan for the impacts on their budgets, operations, and hiring; and
3.
Prevents new regulations from taking effect unless the required disclosures are made during the 6 months preceding the regulations issuance.
Yours in service,
Randy
