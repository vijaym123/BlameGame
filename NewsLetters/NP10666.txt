In this week's edition of Martha's Mailbag, I answer questions
about the F-35, energy bills, executive overreach, and the conflict in
Venezuela. You can watch above or by clicking here
.
Friends,
I've continued to call out the questionable connection between the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and labor unions.
I went on Fox News
this
week to talk with Greta Van Susteren about the cooperation between the
two groups. Be sure to watch it and share it with your friends.
Also check out this story from National Review
highlighting our efforts to get to the bottom of this. Our work is
certainly not done, and I will continue to fight efforts by the Obama
administration to use federal agencies to advance a political agenda,
in this case, targeting right-to-work states and non-unionized
industries through OSHA.
Supporting Our Veterans
It is our collective duty as a nation to look out for the wellbeing of
our veterans, and I am pleased to see funding for veterans care
prioritized in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
appropriations bill
that was approved out of committee this week. As a
member of the subcommittee charged with this bill, I was closely
involved with ensuring that the bill provides appropriate funding to
reduce the backlog of VA claims while also ensuring fiscal
responsibility.
I'm particularly pleased the Committee Report includes language I
requested to document the success and efficiency of Patient-Centered
Community Care (PCCC). The PCCC program allows veterans to access
special health care services not offered by their local VA medical
centers. Under PCCC, VA medical centers can contract with local, non-VA
health care providers for special services such as mental health care,
some emergency care, physical therapy and newborn care for veteran
mothers. It just makes sense to connect veteran-patients with local
health care providers when there are gaps in services offered by the VA.
The bill's report language also calls on the Department of Defense to
prioritize construction projects for air traffic control towers that
have structural, mechanical, or electrical deficient components. I've
personally climbed up the tower at Maxwell Air Force Base on a few
occasions and can personally attest to how badly it needs replacing.
Budgets are certainly tight and changes might not be possible
overnight, but it is our responsibility to highlight these needs in the
appropriations process.

Passing a Balanced Budget
On Thursday, the House passed a budget resolution
that would reduce federal spending by $5.1 trillion
over the next ten years, strengthen Medicare, simplify the tax code,
repair welfare programs, and repeal ObamaCare to clear the way for
patient-centered health care reforms. I believe the reforms included in
the House-passed budget would restore fiscal sanity in Washington.
I appreciate Chairman Paul Ryan for once again putting forward a
serious budget proposal that addresses the true driver of our national
debt: mandatory spending. Unlike the budget put forward by President
Obama, the House-passed budget actually balances in ten years without
raising taxes. While this budget is just a framework, it is a clear
indication that we remain serious about getting spending under control
and bringing responsible budgeting back to Washington.
Of particular concern to me and the Second Congressional District, the
bill would restore proper funding for the military
. I have repeatedly warned that the growth in mandatory
spending threatens funding for other priorities, especially national
defense. The world is still very dangerous, and the continued erosion
of military funding sends the wrong message internationally. The budget
we passed today helps correct that problem by making lasting reforms to
mandatory spending programs to ensure we can afford to properly fund
the military going forward.
The Week Ahead
I will be back on the road in Alabama this week for another District
Work Week. We have stops planned in Andalusia, Montgomery, Millbrook,
Deatsville, and Greenville. From visiting career and technical
education programs at a local high school to meeting civic clubs in
Millbrook and Andalusia, I look forward to hearing directly from those
I represent.
You can follow all of my travel on Facebook (Representative Martha Roby
) and Twitter (@RepMarthaRoby
). Also, feel free to reach out to my office
if we can ever do anything for you. My staff and I are
here to help.

Supporting

It

of

and

The
PCCC

Passing
a
Balanced
Budget
On
Thursday,
the
House
passed
a
budget
resolution
that
would
reduce
federal
spending
by
$5.1
trillion
over
the
next
ten
years,
strengthen
Medicare,
simplify
the
tax
code,
repair
welfare
programs,
and
repeal
ObamaCare
to
clear
the
way
for
patient-centered
health
care
reforms.
I
believe
the
reforms
included
in
the
House-passed
budget
would
restore
fiscal
sanity
in
Washington.
I
appreciate
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
for
once
again
putting
forward
a
serious
budget
proposal
that
addresses
the
true
driver
of
our
national
debt:
mandatory
spending.
Unlike
the
budget
put
forward
by
President
Obama,
the
House-passed
budget
actually
balances
in
ten
years
without
raising
taxes.
While
this
budget
is
just
a
framework,
it
is
a
clear
indication
that
we
remain
serious
about
getting
spending
under
control
and
bringing
responsible
budgeting
back
to
Washington.
Of
particular
concern
to
me
and
the
Second
Congressional
District,
the
bill
would
restore
proper
funding
for
the
military .
I
have
repeatedly
warned
that
the
growth
in
mandatory
spending
threatens
funding
for
other
priorities,
especially
national
defense.
The
world
is
still
very
dangerous,
and
the
continued
erosion
of
military
funding
sends
the
wrong
message
internationally.
The
budget
we
passed
today
helps
correct
that
problem
by
making
lasting
reforms
to
mandatory
spending
programs
to
ensure
we
can
afford
to
properly
fund
the
military
going
forward.
The
Week

I
will
be
