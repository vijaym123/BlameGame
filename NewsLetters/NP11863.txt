Dear Friend,
I thought you might be
interested in
this profile
that ran in The Hill , a newspaper that covers what's going on
in Congress.
I was asked about whether the House will pass any
other pieces of "major" legislation this year.
I want you
to
see my answer
because as for me, I make an effort to see where every piece of
legislation is major to someone. Whether we're talking about
my sue and settle bill that passed the
House this week
or our efforts to keep the mountain hatcheries
in business, what's happening in Washington these days effects
someone, somewhere.
That's the person I'm thinking about when I
vote.
As always, the best way for me to know what's important to
you is for you to
let me
know !
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
In Case You
Missed It: A Great Day in White County
I managed to make it to 10 of the 9th
District's 20 counties last week, and the White County News covered a
stop in White County where I spent part of the morning with high school
students.
Here's a good write-up on that
visit!
COLLINS REGULATIONS BILL PASSES HOUSE
Thursday the House
of Representatives passed the ALERRT Act, which included Congressman
Collins' bill to put an end to abusive sue-and-settle practices that
result in more regulatory costs for Americans who are just trying to get
ahead.
