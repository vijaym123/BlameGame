Dear
Friend,
As you may know, a bill to fund the federal government has been
stalled in the House. Its being called the CRomnibus.
The most
egregious provisions of this bill strike at the very soul of our
democracy and would cement the place of power donors in our political
process. This tenet is central to our democracy: each person has equal power
to influence their government by their voice and their vote. As
currently written, this spending bill will hasten the toxic
influx of money and further corrupt and unbalance our democracy, which is
why I am urging my colleagues to vote against it.
Click

or on the
video above to watch me speak on the House floor against this
outrageous bill and stay tuned.
Best,
Louise
