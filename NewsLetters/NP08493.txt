Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to share some things I've been working on
over the last couple of weeks.
The Affordable Care Act at Work
Infographic: How Will State Decisions to Expand Medicaid Affect U.S.
Cities?
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) released a report showing that among those signing up through the
federal marketplace, nearly 90% received tax credits to help them
afford coverage. These tax credits cut premiums by more than 75%. As a
result, nearly 7 in 10 enrollees are paying $100 or less per month and
nearly half are paying $50 or less per month. The average premium after
tax credits is $82 per month and the average for those selecting Silver
plans - the most popular plan type - is $69 per month.
Soon after the release of the HHS report, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and Urban Institute released a study showing us that in many
major U.S. cities, the uninsured population is expected to decline
drastically over the next two years. In Los Angeles alone, plans
offered through Covered California will help lead to a 56% reduction in
our uninsured population by 2016.
This is great news for all Americans.

full HHS report. And click here

Institute report.
Caring for Our Veterans
After months of disturbing allegations at specific U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, the VA's Office of Inspector General
(OIG) issued a scathing preliminary report that confirmed many of these
claims of excessive wait times and negligent scheduling practices. In
response, the OIG has expanded its probe to 69 VA medical facilities
and the Department of Justice is investigating possible criminal
activity.
VA Secretary Eric Shinseki took personal responsibility for the VA's
failures and announced his resignation on May 30. Prior to stepping
down, Secretary Shinseki announced a new "face-to-face" audit of all
150 VA medical centers and 820 community outpatient clinics across the
country and placed the leadership at the VA facility in Phoenix, AZ on
leave. New Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson has built on these efforts by
instituting random site visits and continuing the process to replace
the VA's medical appointment scheduling system.
The brave men and women who serve our country deserve to have the best
possible care and we owe it to them to foot out the VA's systemic
problems. I joined with fourteen of my California
colleagues to
request additional details about the face-to-face audit of the West Los
Angeles VA facility.

It's Time for Congress to Wake Up & Act on Climate Change
Video from the Wake Up on Climate Change Action Rally
On May 21, I joined nearly 40 Representatives and Senators at a climate
change action rally in Washington, D.C.
We came together to call on
our Republican colleagues in Congress to "wake up" and work with us to
pass meaningful climate change legislation.
Scientists tell us that
climate change is unequivocal, and that unless we begin to take actions
now we may reach a point where it's too late. We are at a crossroads.
We can protect our environment by investing in the clean energy economy
of the future, or we can deny the science and watch our coastlines
erode, our forests burn, and our crops wither.
Climate change is an
environmental issue. It is an economic issue. But it is also
fundamentally a moral issue -- we must act now.

Examining the Derogatory "Washington Redskins" NFL Team Name
Video provided by ChangeTheMascot.org
On May 9, in the wake of NBA owner Don Sterling's ban for life for
racist comments, I wrote House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
Fred Upton urging him to hold a hearing to examine another instance of
racial insensitivity in professional sports: the use of the derogatory
term "Redskins" as the name of the Washington football team.
The term "Redskins" is a racist slur that offends Native Americans and
its continued use in professional football is unconscionable.
Fifty years ago, the Washington football team was the last segregated
franchise in the NFL.
It took public pressure by the federal
government to convince team owner George Marshall to integrate the
team.
As the Committee with primary jurisdiction over professional
sports, the Committee on Energy and Commerce could play a constructive
role in challenging racism by asking the owner of Washington's football
team, Dan Snyder and the Commissioner of the National Football League
Roger Goodell, to explain in a public hearing how their actions are
consistent with the public interest.
As you may know, earlier this week the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
cancelled six trademarks that belong to the Washington team because
they are offensive to Native Americans.
The team has appealed this
ruling.
I will continue to monitor developments closely.

letter to Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Upton.
LA Metro Purple Line Extension

Recently, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced a Full
Funding Grant Agreement for the Purple Line extension.
This project
will turn years of planning into a reality that, when finished, will
connect Westwood to Union Station in just 25 minutes. I applaud the
work so many have put into this effort.

Purple Line extension project.
The Cost of Higher Education
Earlier this month, President Obama announced a series of executive
actions that will reduce the burden of student loan debt and make
college more affordable for all Americans. Higher education is one of
the most important investments we can make in our future and I applaud
the President's efforts. I am also a cosponsor of the Bank on Students
Emergency Refinancing Act, which would allow millions of borrowers to
refinance their existing student loans at lower interest rates, similar
to those currently available to new borrowers today. It is time for
America to bank on its students.
