This week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that a woman will be featured on U.S. paper currency by 2020. I had the honor of attending U.S. Treasury Secretary Lews announcement that the new ten dollar bill will feature a woman, the next paper currency note scheduled for redesign. Since the adoption of our modern paper currency system in 1877, no woman has been featured on a widely circulated paper bill.
Beatty celebrates "TheNew10" announcement with Rosie Rios, U.S. Treasurer,
Barbara Ortiz Howard, Founder of Women on 20s, Susan Ades Stone, Executive Director and Strategist of Women on 20s, and a group of female students on June 18, 2015 in Washington, D.C.
Believing that it was past time our nation recognized women on our currency, I introduced the
Woman on the Twenty Act , H.R. 2147, on April 30, 2015,
legislation which would have established a process to recommend a woman to be placed on twenty dollar bill. Earlier this week, I spoke on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives about my legislation ( VIDEO ).
My efforts in Congress coincided with the grassroots efforts of the nonprofit group Women on 20s. The twenty dollar bill was chosen to have the face of a woman because 2020 marks the 100 th
anniversary of the passage of the 19 th
Amendment, which granted women the right to vote and we believe we should celebrate this milestone by featuring a woman on U.S. paper currency.
I am proud to have been part of this important effort. Whether it is a twenty or a ten, I am glad that the Administration and Congress are working to bring gender equality to all areas of American life.
How can you participate and provide your ideas about the new $10?
The U.S. Treasury Department will be accepting comments for the redesign based on the theme democracy at
thenew10.treasury.gov
as well as comments posted on social media using TheNew10 hashtag, or #TheNew10.
Treasury staff will review the input received and provide information to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lew over the course of the redesign process.
This is a historic moment for our nation, and this announcement is an acknowledgment that gender equality is advancing within our society and on our money.
Sincerely,
Joyce Beatty
