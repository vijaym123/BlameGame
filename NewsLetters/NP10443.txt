Dear Friend,
Knowing of your interest in aging research, I wanted to take a moment
to update you on actions I have recently taken to fight Alzheimer's
disease.
Currently, over 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's
disease.
Every single day more than 10,000 baby boomers turn 65.
As
this great generation ages, one in eight will develop Alzheimer's.
According to a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Alzheimer's disease is now the costliest disease in America, outpacing
cancer and heart disease, and set to increase like no other.
My family has personally experienced the difficulties of Alzheimer's
disease and I know so many others in our district whose lives have been
impacted by the challenges of this heartbreaking condition.
That is
one of the reasons I am committed to fighting this awful disease.
Another reason is the cost to the U.S. taxpayer.
Over the next 40
years, caring for Americans with Alzheimer's disease will cost $20
trillion, with an estimated $15 trillion coming from Medicare and
Medicaid.
The New York Times reported that the cost of Alzheimer's
disease is "skyrocketing at a rate that rarely occurs with a chronic
disease."
As our population ages, the number of seniors affected will
continue to grow, and its effects will weigh heavily on them and their
caretakers, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research Care and Services has
called for an increase of funding for Alzheimer's research to at least
$2 billion annually in order to adequately fund the research needed to
find real solutions and preventions for this disease.
Compared to the
massive cost this disease is projected to place on our nation over the
next four decades, this investment in seeking prevention and a cure
would be well spent.
However, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
allocated only $503 million on Alzheimer's research last year;
representing merely one-fourth of the recommended level of spending.
This is unacceptable and more must be done to find real solutions. That
is why I sent a letter to the NIH requesting additional funding for
Alzheimer's research.
I also requested an explanation as to why
additional resources are not being directed to combat the growing
Alzheimer's crisis facing seniors.
We must do all we can to find a cure for today's families and tomorrow's
seniors.
I welcome your ideas and thoughts on this issue. Please know
that I will continue to fight to make Alzheimer's research funding a
national priority.
It is a privilege to represent you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Knowing
of
your
interest
in
aging
research,
I
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
update
you
on
actions
I
have
recently
taken
to
fight
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease.
Currently,
over
5
million
Americans
suffer
from
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease.
Every
single
day
more
than
10,000
baby
boomers
turn
65.
As
this
great
generation
ages,
one
in
eight
will
develop
Alzheimer&#8217;s.
According
to
a
recent
study
in
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine ,
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease
is
now
the
costliest
disease
in
America,
outpacing
cancer
and
heart
disease,
and
set
to
increase
like
no
other.
My
family
has
personally
experienced
the
difficulties
of
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease
and
I
know
so
many
others
in
our
district
whose
lives
have
been
impacted
by
the
challenges
of
this
heartbreaking
condition.
That
is
one
of
the
reasons
I
am
committed
to
fighting
this
awful
disease.
Another
reason
is
the
cost
to
the
U.S.
taxpayer.
Over
the
next
40
years,
caring
for
Americans
with
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease
will
cost
$20
trillion,
with
an
estimated
$15
trillion
coming
from
Medicare
and
Medicaid.
The
New
York
Times
reported
that
the
cost
of
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease
is
&#8220;skyrocketing
at
a
rate
that
rarely
occurs
with
a
chronic
disease.&#8221;
As
our
population
ages,
the
number
of
seniors
affected
will
continue
to
grow,
and
its
effects
will
weigh
heavily
on
them
and
their
caretakers,
as
well
as
the
Medicare
and
Medicaid
programs.
The
Advisory
Council
on
Alzheimer&#8217;s
Research
Care
and
Services
has
called
for
an
increase
of
funding
for
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research
to
at
least
$2
billion
annually
in
order
to
adequately
fund
the
research
needed
to
find
real
solutions
and
preventions
for
this
disease.
Compared
to
the
massive
cost
this
disease
is
projected
to
place
on
our
nation
over
the
next
four
decades,
this
investment
in
seeking
prevention
and
a
cure
would
be
well
spent.
However,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
allocated
only
$503
million
on
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research
last
year;
representing
merely
one-fourth
of
the
recommended
level
of
spending.
This
is
unacceptable
and
more
must
be
done
to
find
real
solutions.
That
is
why
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
NIH
requesting
additional
funding
for
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research.
I
also
requested
an
explanation
as
to
why
additional
resources
are
not
being
directed
to
combat
the
growing
Alzheimer&#8217;s
crisis
facing
seniors.
We
must
do
all
we
can
to
find
a
cure
for
today&#8217;s
families
and
tomorrow&#8217;s
seniors.
I
welcome
your
ideas
and
thoughts
on
this
issue.
Please
know
that
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
make
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research
funding
a
national
priority.
It
is
a
privilege
to
represent
you
in
Congress.
