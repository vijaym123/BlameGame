A MESSAGE FROM
CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
On Thursday,
Im looking forward to joining Googles
Maryland Get Your Business
Online
seminar at the Prince Georges County Economic Development
Corporation in Largo, Maryland, and Id like to invite small business
owners in the Fifth District to attend.
With 97 percent of
internet users looking for local goods and services online, its
critical that small businesses have an online presence. Unfortunately, 53
percent of Maryland businesses do not have a website and are missing
out on this important opportunity to reach customers. Thats why its so
important that Maryland businesses attend this free seminar where
Google experts will show Maryland businesses how to establish afree
website and learn about best practices and tools to grow their business
online.
If you own a small business, please register for the
event
here . I also encourage you to share this
event with others in our community.
As always, thank you for
allowing me to share this update, and please contact my office with
any questions regarding the Google seminar.
With warmest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
Steny H.
Hoyer
