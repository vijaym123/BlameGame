Dear Friends,
With Secretary Shinseki's resignation this week, it is my sincere hope
that the Department of Veterans Affairs will move forward under new
leadership by correcting the egregious mistakes it has made, holding
the responsible parties accountable for their actions, and once again
focusing on caring for our nation's veterans.
This week, the president announced his plans to keep 9,800 troops in
Afghanistan in 2015 but withdraw them in 2016 regardless of conditions
on the ground. While I am pleased the president will keep a
counterterrorism presence in Afghanistan in the short term, his
decision to pull out based on arbitrary timetables, as opposed to
building on the progress and sacrifices of both our Armed Forces and
the Afghan people is misguided and, I believe, the wrong choice
.
Conversely, he has chosen to engage in Syria too late. While there were
options for helping the once mostly moderate opposition forces,
extremist rebels have taken control of the front lines in many places.
The president's decision to wait to address the crisis will affect our
national and homeland security for years to come. This president must
acknowledge that Islamist extremist and al-Qaeda linked groups are
spreading, becoming more powerful, and still intend to do us harm.
America's leadership, not its withdrawal, is now more crucial than ever.
The House Appropriations Committee approved language I proposed that
would ensure a Government Accountability Office review of Expanded
Access ("Compassionate Use") for terminally ill patients seeking
experimental treatments that hold lifesaving potential when traditional
treatment options have been exhausted. This review, which will look
into ways the FDA is working to accelerate the approval of innovative
medicines, is a significant first step in finding ways to make
treatments more widely available.
With the increase in compassionate use requests, Congress is
acknowledging we must have more information to help us identify
barriers for both the patients that need the life saving drugs and the
companies developing them. I look forward to continuing to work with my
colleagues in Congress and with stakeholders on all sides of this issue
on ways to improve expanded access. NBC Austin ran a segment about my
efforts to reform compassionate use which you can watch below.
Legislative Update
The House of Representatives also passed the Commerce, Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2015
. This act reduces overall government spending while providing
funding for law enforcement activities and NASA. It also prevents the
Obama Administration from transferring the U.S. oversight of key
functions of the Internet to the international community and prohibits
funding for the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty.

Dear
Friends,
With
Secretary
Shinseki&#8217;s
resignation
this
week,
it
is
my
sincere
hope
that
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
will
move

under
new

by

the
egregious

it
has
