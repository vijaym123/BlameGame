Ft. Carson Engineering Company Deploys
to Fight Ebola
9/30/14
Today, the Secretary of
Defense announced that approximately 160 engineers from Fort Carson
will be deploying in late October to Africa in support of U.S. efforts to
help contain the Ebola virus.
The engineer companys primary
mission will consist of constructing Ebola treatment units that will
house patients and healthcare providers as they combat this serious
global threat that can only be contained through a combined international
effort.
"All of us in Colorado Springs are proud of these men
and women in uniform who will be helping those in need in Africa. As
these servicemembers step forward once again to answer our nations call,
please keep them in your thoughts and prayers for a safe
return."
