December 25, 2014
Each year Christmas brings together family, friends and community to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Its a time for us to look past our differences to the things that unite us.
The Christmas Season fills our hearts with a reminder of our many blessings. With those blessings comes a responsibility to reach out to others. Many of our fellow Americans still suffer from the effects of illness or poverty. Christmas reminds us that we have a duty to love our neighbor and do our best to pay it forward whenever and however we can.
On behalf of my family, please accept my very best wishes for a very safe, healthy and Merry Christmas.
