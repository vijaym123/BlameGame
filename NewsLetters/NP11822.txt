Van Hollen: It's Time to #RaiseTheWage
Congressman Van Hollen has signed a petition to require a vote on the
Fair Minimum Wage Act, which would increase the minimum wage to $10.10
per hour and index future increases to inflation. This important
legislation would help lift between 1 million and 4.5 million
hardworking Americans out of poverty. It would also generate about $22
billion in increased economic activity.
Montgomery County Office of Consumer Protection Warns Consumers to Be
Cautious When Returning Missed Calls
Consumers should hesitate before calling an unknown number on their
cell phones. Scammers are luring local cell phone users to return their
call by hanging up before a consumer answers the call. Cell phone users
return the call, only to be slammed with exorbitant international fees.
To prevent these charges, consumers should:
*	Only return calls to known telephone numbers.
*	Do an Internet search on the telephone number before returning
a call to an unknown number.
*	Contact their wireless providers and ask about blocking calls
to their numbers.
*	Remember that legitimate callers will call back if they are
unable to reach you!
