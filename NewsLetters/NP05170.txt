We just got word:
A right-wing casino mogul just wrote a
$5,OOO,OOO.OO
check to Boehner&rsquo;s SuperPAC. Now get ready for Boehner to start blasting TVs across the country with more Obama-bashing ads.
This comes as a MAJOR blow to our Democratic campaigns who were already getting ambushed by Republican attacks. Frankly, we weren&rsquo;t prepared for this.
Our budget deadline is in just a few hours. And we&rsquo;re coming up $183,OOO short. If we can&rsquo;t get to our goal now, we can just throw in the towel. Go home. Give up. UPDATE: A dedicated group of Democratic supporters are TRIPLE-MATCHING 1O,OOO donations today.
TRIPLE-MATCH DONATIONS REMAINING:
We&rsquo;re serious. If we can&rsquo;t get there, we&rsquo;re going to have to give up in races we were competing in. David -- if you&rsquo;re planning to chip in again soon, we could really use your support right now.
Next 1O,OOO Donations Triple-Matched!
