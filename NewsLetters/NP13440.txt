Larry Kudlow: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan is a big winner
tonight. The Senate late this afternoon passing the Ryan-Murray
compromise budget framework, sending it to the White House. But despite
passage, there are still concerns about how the bill will affect
veterans, especially disabled veterans, and that has some calling for a
fix. This afternoon I had a chance to speak with Chairman Ryan and I
asked him if he agreed with these comments from his Senate counterpart
Patty Murray.
Patty Murray: In a provision included in this deal that mistakenly
included disabled retirees and survivors for changes in the pension
growth will be addressed in short order following passage of this bill.
Paul Ryan: Yes, I do. That will be solved with the technical correction
that will pass when Congress comes back into session. We wanted to make
sure that we kept military pension retirement better than their
civilian counterparts. Civilians who retired before 62 get no cost of
living update at all. These military retirees will still get a cost of
living update then they get the benefits recalculated when they turn
62, to make sure that they got back what they had lost. In effect,
build back the base of their pension. Look Larry, we owe so much to
these men and women who fight for us. We wanted to make sure that they
always have a better pension system than anybody else in government. We
maintain that, and we have very modest reforms to help the Pentagon
with their very big budget problems. The Pentagon has some budget
problems. We stopped the bleeding, we stopped the cuts, we gave them
some mild reforms and we have two years before this actual provision
kicks in place to give Congress enough time to adjust it in another way
if they want to.
Larry Kudlow: Let me just be clear on this. So in other words, you
agree that disabled military vets will not be take the 1% call for
reduction. You agree with that, and that was an oversight?
Paul Ryan: That's correct.
Larry Kudlow: And another big event today, I'm sure you're aware of
this. The Federal Reserve released its minutes and they're having a
small taper. They are taking $10 billion off an $85 billion-a-month
bond purchase and I wanted to get your sense of that. The stock market
is rallying big time. What do you think?
Paul Ryan: Well, I thought they should have started tapering a lot time
ago. You and I have similar views on sound money. I was not a fan of
these later rounds of quantitative easing. I thought it was necessary
in the beginning of the crisis. Subsequent rounds of QE, I think did
more harm than good. In the long run, we'll know the answer to that for
sure. High time they started. This is basically symbolic, because it's
really not that big in the scheme of things.
Larry Kudlow: Periodically as Budget Chair you've held hearings on the
Fed. Let me ask you now, with the changing of the guard, does Janet
Yellen have your confidence?
Paul Ryan: I think we went to a more dovish Fed Chair with Janet
Yellen. Ben ended up becoming a dove from my perspective - less of a
sound money guy, more of a deflation fighter instead of an inflation
hawk. More dovish. She's clearly in the dove category. She's a
Keynesian. So, I don't expect much difference from her from where we
are right now.
Larry Kudlow: Let's go directly to the spending. You've raised the
spending caps from sequestration in 2014-2015, I think the number sums
to $65 billion. What do you say to people, particularly conservatives,
and you've heard this. Conservatives who are saying budget caps,
spending caps, sequestration, which was a signature Republican
achievement, is dead? Is that true? Are the caps dead? Is the spending
discipline dead?
Paul Ryan: No, not at all, actually. The Democrats came into these
negotiations wanting to get rid of the caps all together - 100% of the
caps. Well, we just got them to agree, in the next year and a half, to
70% of the caps. 70% of the sequester is still in place for the next
year and a half. The 30% sequester relief we gave, $63 billion of
spending, is paid for with $85 billion of permanent entitlement
changes, permanent savings that results in deficit reduction, so that
exceeds the Budget Control Act requirement of a one for one
replacement, so we actually go farther than the law requires. More to
the point, Larry, 92% of the sequester is left intact over the lifetime
of the sequester with this agreement. So, what we like from a fiscal
conservative standpoint, is we do give relief to the sequester now,
particularly because the defense hawks in our conference would not
support where this was going to go. We did not have the votes to stick
to that $967 number, so we got excess savings to make us have more
deficit reduction, and we prevent two government shutdowns from
happening in the next year, which we think is a good thing for lots of
reasons - for the country, for certainty, for economic growth. We want
to focus on Obamacare and Obamacare oversight. We want to focus on tax
reform. We want to focus on a pro-growth agenda. We don't want to have
two government shutdown scenarios, and we think this is that step in
the right direction.
Larry Kudlow: Another one, the feud with the tea party, Speaker Boehner
took a few whacks at the Tea Party. I've had many of them on The Kudlow
Report. They wanted the full sequester, it's not an unreasonable
request. How is your relationship to the Tea Party? What do you have to
say to the Tea Party, which is kind of up in arms now because it seems
like a lot of Republicans are attacking them?
Paul Ryan: Well, look, I have nothing but good things to say about the
Tea Party. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Tea Party. Look,
when I started my budgets back in 2008, I had eight other members of
Congress who were willing to co-sponsor and put their name on it.
Eight. And because of the Tea Party, because of those grassroots
conservatives out in America, I was able to pass it in 2011 with I
think 233 votes. I was able to pass three budgets now because of these
grassroots conservatives, these fiscal conservatives, which balances
the budget and pays off the debt. There's no way I could have passed
these kinds of budgets if it weren't for them that's why I credit them
with this great success. Now, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of
the good. In divided government, you have to look at the situation as
it is, and not as you wish it would be, and keep moving the ball in the
right direction even if it's incrementally. I would prefer that these
so-called feuds are in the family and not out in the public.
Larry Kudlow: You report to the Wall Street Journal that you want to be
the Ways and Means Committee Chairman in 2015. Why? What's your agenda?
Paul Ryan: Look, you know me, Larry. There's nothing new here than what
I've always said. This has been my career trajectory in the House.
People ask me if I want to be Speaker. I don't. And this is the next
logical step, but what I'm really focused on right now to be honest
with you Larry, is helping Dave Camp with the Ways and Means Committee.
He's our quarterback, he's our chairman. My dream for 2014 is that the
Camp-Baucus Tax Reform Act of 2014, which reduces tax rates across the
board in a pro-growth way to grow the economy, becomes law. I want to
help Dave do that. Then after this election, after 2015, this is really
no secret, this is not a newsworthy item, that is the natural
progression of how I saw things. That's the way I've always planned it.
And there's nothing really new here.
Larry Kudlow: Are you leaving the Presidential door open for 2016? You
just had a big poll in Iowa. You had the best numbers of all the
Republican candidates. A lot of people are saying, 'you know, look how
he negotiated this budget. He can cut across party lines and get things
done.' You stopped the shutdown. Some people are saying you saved the
Republican Party from itself because you stopped the shutdown. So is
the door open for a 2016 Presidential run, I ask you, Paul Ryan?
Paul Ryan: Well, I'll answer you, Larry Kudlow, that I'm going to make
my mind up on that issue later on. I'm just trying to do my job right
now. The people here in Wisconsin elected me to represent them. My
colleagues asked me to chair the Budget committee, so I'm doing that
job the best I can. I'm not going to let future ambition or career
moves cloud my judgment today, and what I decided, my wife and I
decided, is let's get through this session and then I'll make my mind
up down the road. I haven't foreclosed any opportunity, I haven't made
a decision one way or the other. Right now, I'm just sincerely focused
on doing my job.
Larry Kudlow: All right. We've known each other a long time and if I
may so, happy holy Merry Christmas and New Year's and thanks for coming
on.
Paul Ryan: Awesome. Merry Christmas, Larry. Good to see you.

Larry
Kudlow:
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul Ryan is
a
big
winner
tonight.
The
Senate
late
this
afternoon
passing
the Ryan-Murray
compromise
budget
framework,
sending
it
to
the
White
House.
But
despite
passage,
there
are
still
concerns
about
how
the
bill
will
affect
veterans,
especially
disabled
veterans,
and
that
has
some
calling
for
a
fix.
This
afternoon
I
had
a
chance
to
speak
with
Chairman Ryan
and
I
asked
him
if
he
agreed
with
these
comments
from
his
Senate
counterpart
Patty
Murray.
Patty
Murray:
In
a
provision
included
in
this
deal
that
mistakenly
included
disabled
retirees
and
survivors
for
changes
in
the
pension
growth
will
be
addressed
in
short
order
following
passage
of
this
bill.
Paul
Ryan:
Yes,
I
do.
That
will
be
solved
with
the
technical
correction
that
will
pass
when
Congress
comes
back
into
session.
We
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
kept
military
pension
retirement
better
than
their
civilian
counterparts.
Civilians
who
retired
before
62
get
no
cost
of
living
update
at
all.
These
military
retirees
will
still
get
a
cost
of
living
update
then
they
get
the
benefits
recalculated
when
they
turn
62,
to
make
sure
that
they
got
back
what
they
had
lost.
In
effect,
build
back
the
base
of
their
pension.
Look
Larry,
we
owe
so
much
to
these
men
and
women
who
fight
for
us.
We
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
always
have
a
better
pension
system
than
anybody
else
in
government.
We
maintain
that,
and
we
have
very
modest
reforms
to
help
the
Pentagon
with
their
very
big
budget
problems.
The
Pentagon
has
some
budget
problems.
We
stopped
the
bleeding,
we
stopped
the
cuts,
we
gave
them
some
mild
reforms
and
we
have
two
years
before
this
actual
provision
kicks
in
place
to
give
Congress
enough
time
to
adjust
it
in
another
way
if
they
want
to.
Larry
Kudlow:
Let
me
just
be
clear
on
this.
So
in
other
words,
you
agree
that
disabled
military
vets
will
not
be
take
the
1%
call
for
reduction.
You
agree
with
that,
and
that
was
an
oversight?
Paul
Ryan:
That's
correct.
Larry
Kudlow:
And
another
big
event
today,
I&#8217;m
sure
you're
aware
of
this.
The
Federal
Reserve
released
its
minutes
and
they&#8217;re
having
a
small
taper.
They
are
taking
$10
billion
off
an
$85
billion-a-month
bond
purchase
and
I
wanted
to
get
your
sense
of
that.
The
stock
market
is
rallying
big
time.
What
do
you
think?
Paul
Ryan:
Well,
I
thought
they
should
have
started
tapering
a
lot
time
ago.
You
and
I
have
similar
views
on
sound
money.
I
was
not
a
fan
of
these
later
rounds
of
quantitative
easing.
I
thought
it
was
necessary
in
the
beginning
of
the
crisis.
Subsequent
rounds
of
QE,
I
think
did
more
harm
than
good.
In
the
long
run,
we'll
know
the
answer
to
that
for
sure.
High
time
they
started.
This
is
basically
symbolic,
because
it's
really
not
that
big
in
the
scheme
of
things.
Larry
Kudlow:
Periodically
as
Budget
Chair
you've
held
hearings
on
the
Fed.
Let
me
ask
you
now,
with
the
changing
of
the
guard,
does
Janet
Yellen
have
your
confidence?
Paul
Ryan:
I
think
we
went
to
a
more
dovish
Fed
Chair
with
Janet
Yellen.
Ben
ended
up
becoming
a
dove
from
my
perspective
&#8211;
less
of
a
sound
money
guy,
more
of
a
deflation
fighter
instead
of
an
inflation
hawk.
More
dovish.
She&#8217;s
clearly
in
the
dove
category.
She&#8217;s
a
Keynesian.
So,
I
don't
expect
much
difference
from
her
from
where
we
are
right
now.
Larry
Kudlow:
Let&#8217;s
go
directly
to
the
spending.
You've
raised
the
spending
caps
from
sequestration
in
2014-2015,
I
think
the
number
sums
to
$65
billion.
What
do
you
say
to
people,
particularly
conservatives,
and
you&#8217;ve
heard
this.
Conservatives
who
are
saying
budget
caps,
spending
caps,
sequestration,
which
was
a
signature
Republican
achievement,
is
dead?
Is
that
true?
Are
the
caps
dead?
Is
the
spending
discipline
dead?
Paul
Ryan:
No,
not
at
all,
actually.
The
Democrats
came
into
these
negotiations
wanting
to
get
rid
of
the
caps
all
together
&#8211;
100%
of
the
caps.
Well,
we
just
got
them
to
agree,
in
the
next
year
and
a
half,
to
70%
of
the
caps.
70%
of
the
sequester
is
still
in
place
for
the
next
year
and
a
half.
The
30%
sequester
relief
we
gave,
$63
billion
of
spending,
is
paid
for
with
$85
billion
of
permanent
entitlement
changes,
permanent
savings
that
results
in
deficit
reduction,
so
that
exceeds
the
Budget
Control
Act
requirement
of
a
one
for
one
replacement,
so
we
actually
go
farther
than
the
law
requires.
More
to
the
point,
Larry,
92%
of
the
sequester
is
left
intact
over
the
lifetime
of
the
sequester
with
this
agreement.
So,
what
we
like
from
a
fiscal
conservative
standpoint,
is
we
do
give
relief
to
the
sequester
now,
particularly
because
the
defense
hawks
in
our
conference
would
not
support
where
this
was
going
to
go.
We
did
not
have
the
votes
to
stick
to
that
$967
number,
so
we
got
excess
savings
to
make
us
have
more
deficit
reduction,
and
we
prevent
two
government
shutdowns
from
happening
in
the
next
year,
which
we
think
is
a
good
thing
for
lots
of
reasons
-
for
the
country,
for
certainty,
for
economic
growth.
We
want
to
focus
on
Obamacare
and
Obamacare
oversight.
We
want
to
focus
on
tax
reform.
We
want
to
focus
on
a
pro-growth
agenda.
We
don&#8217;t
want
to
have
two
government
shutdown
scenarios,
and
we
think
this
is
that
step
in
the
right
direction.
Larry
Kudlow:
Another
one,
the
feud
with
the
tea
party,
Speaker
Boehner
took
a
few
whacks
at
the
Tea
Party.
I&#8217;ve
had
many
of
them
on
The
Kudlow
Report .
They
wanted
the
full
sequester,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
request.
How
is
your
relationship
to
the
Tea
Party?
What
do
you
have
to
say
to
the
Tea
Party,
which
is
kind
of
up
in
arms
now
because
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
Republicans
are
attacking
them?
Paul
Ryan:
Well,
look,
I
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
the
Tea
Party.
We
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
weren&#8217;t
for
the
Tea
Party.
Look,
when
I
started
my
budgets
back
in
2008,
I
had
eight
other
members
of
Congress
who
were
willing
to
co-sponsor
and
put
their
name
on
it.
Eight.
And
because
of
the
Tea
Party,
because
of
those
grassroots
conservatives
out
in
America,
I
was
able
to
pass
it
in
2011
with
I
think
233
votes.
I
was
able
to
pass
three
budgets
now
because
of
these
grassroots
conservatives,
these
fiscal
conservatives,
which
balances
the
budget
and
pays
off
the
debt.
There&#8217;s
no
way
I
could
have
passed
these
kinds
of
budgets
if
it
weren't
for
them
that&#8217;s
why
I
credit
them
with
this
great
success.
Now,
you
can't
let
the
perfect
be
the
enemy
of
the
good.
In
divided
government,
you
have
to
look
at
the
situation
as
it
is,
and
not
as
you
wish
it
would
be,
and
keep
moving
the
ball
in
the
right
direction
even
if
it&#8217;s
incrementally.
I
would
prefer
that
these
so-called
feuds
are
in
the
family
and
not
out
in
the
public.
Larry
Kudlow:
You
report
to
the
Wall
Street
Journal
that
you
want
to
be
the
Ways
and
Means
Committee
Chairman
in
2015.
Why?
What&#8217;s
your
agenda?
Paul
Ryan:
Look,
you
know
me,
Larry.
There&#8217;s
nothing
new
here
than
what
I&#8217;ve
always
said.
This
has
been
my
career
trajectory
in
the
House.
People
ask
me
if
I
want
to
be
Speaker.
I
don't.
And
this
is
the
next
logical
step,
but
what
I&#8217;m
really
focused
on
right
now
to
be
honest
with
you
Larry,
is
helping
Dave
Camp
with
the
Ways
and
Means
Committee.
He&#8217;s
our
quarterback,
he&#8217;s
our
chairman.
My
dream
for
2014
is
that
the
Camp-Baucus
Tax
Reform
Act
of
2014,
which
reduces
tax
rates
across
the
board
in
a
pro-growth
way
to
grow
the
economy,
becomes
law.
I
want
to
help
Dave
do
that.
Then
after
this
election,
after
2015,
this
is
really
no
secret,
this
is
not
a
newsworthy
item,
that
is
the
natural
progression
of
how
I
saw
things.
That&#8217;s
the
way
I&#8217;ve
always
planned
it.
And
there's
nothing
really
new
here.
Larry
Kudlow:
Are
you
leaving
the
Presidential
door
open
for
2016?
You
just
had
a
big
poll
in
Iowa.
You
had
the
best
numbers
of
all
the
Republican
candidates.
A
lot
of
people
are
saying,
&#8216;you
know,
look
how
he
negotiated
this
budget.
He
can
cut
across
party
lines
and
get
things
done.&#8217;
You
stopped
the
shutdown.
Some
people
are
saying
you
saved
the
Republican
Party
from
itself
because
you
stopped
the
shutdown.
So
is
the
door
open
for
a
2016
Presidential
run,
I
ask
you, Paul Ryan?
Paul
Ryan:
Well,
I'll
answer
you,
Larry
Kudlow,
that
I&#8217;m
going
to
make
my
mind
up
on
that
issue
later
on.
I&#8217;m
just
trying
to
do
my
job
right
now.
The
people
here
in
Wisconsin
elected
me
to
represent
them.
My
colleagues
asked
me
to
chair
the
Budget
committee,
so
I&#8217;m
doing
that
job
the
best
I
can.
I&#8217;m
not
going
to
let
future
ambition
or
career
moves
cloud
my
judgment
today,
and
what
I
decided,
my
wife
and
I
decided,
is
let's
get
through
this
session
and
then
I&#8217;ll
make
my
mind
up
down
the
road.
I
haven't
foreclosed
any
opportunity,
I
haven't
made
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
Right
now,
I&#8217;m
just
sincerely
focused
on
doing
my
job.
Larry
Kudlow:
All
right.
We've
known
each
other
a
long
time
and
if
I
may
so,
happy
holy
Merry
Christmas
and
New
Year's
and
thanks
for
coming
on.
Paul
Ryan:
Awesome.
Merry
Christmas,
Larry.
Good
to
see
you.
