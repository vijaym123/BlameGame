The American People Deserve
Answers
Dear Friend,
Nearly two years ago, the United States
embassy in Benghazi, Libya was attacked and
today we continue to search for answers.
Like many living in Ohios 16th
District, I am deeply saddened and outraged
by the events that transpired on September
11, 2012 that led to the murder of
Ambassador Ted Stevens and three Americans
in Benghazi. We in the House of
Representatives have demanded information
from the administration, but sadly the
White House has stonewalled our
investigation every step of the way. The
American people and the victims
families deserve answers, and I am
determined to see that they receive
them.
Initially, the White House maintained
the attacks were the result of spontaneous
demonstrations in reaction to an anti-Islam
YouTube video created by an American.
However, it quickly became evident that the
series of attacks were well-planned and
coordinated by terrorists.
Now, it is clear that the administration
has been withholding emails that reveal the
White House had greater involvement in
misleading the American public. These
emails surfaced after they were obtained by
an outside party, yet they were not handed
over to Congress despite a Congressional
subpoena. Specifically, the emails provide
additional evidence that senior
administration officials knew full-well
that the attack was not a spontaneous
reaction to a YouTube video. This
represents a clear violation of the
publics trust and forces us to ask
the question
what else is the White
House hiding?
House committees have investigated this
attack for the past two years, using their
subpoena power, holding multiple hearings,
and conducting hundreds of interviews in
their search for information. Thanks to
their outstanding work, we now know much
more about the disturbing events than we
did during the initial months following the
attack. However, questions still
remain.
This past week, House Speaker John
Boehner announced that the House of
Representatives will vote to establish a
Select Committee on Benghazi. I applaud
Speaker Boehner for his decision as it is
Congress responsibility to provide
oversight, and the White House has
disregarded its authority throughout our
fact-finding mission. The Select Committee
will allow the Houses investigation
to be more narrowly focused and will
undoubtedly lead to greater transparency
and accountability.
It is my hope that the Select
Committees investigation into these
attacks will not only lead to a change in
State Department security protocols for its
embassies and consulates abroad, but also
that it will bring to light the truth about
the administrations obstruction of
the facts and what truly transpired in
Libya on the night of September 11, 2012.
Ultimately, we must determine what went
wrong so that we can prevent similar
unnecessary losses of life from occurring
again. We owe that much to the
victims families and the American
people.
Good talking with employees at the
Coca-Cola distribution facility in
Akron.
Earlier this week, I toured
MetroHealth's new facility in Middleburg
Heights to learn more about the services
its wonderful staff provides for
Northeast Ohio families.
