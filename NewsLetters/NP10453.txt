Dear Friend,
I have an important update for you about
Medicare . I&rsquo;ve been listening to you, and I&rsquo;ve been fighting the administration&rsquo;s proposed cuts to Medicare. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m thrilled to share the news that
the Medicare cuts have been prevented!
I opposed these cuts because
Medicare Advantage
helps seniors access high-quality healthcare &ndash; especially folks who suffer from chronic disease.
I joined colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to ensure that seniors have stability in their benefits, access and options for Medicare Advantage. I often say that bipartisanship is the way to get results. And that&rsquo;s what happened when it came to protecting Medicare.
I know how important this program is to folks in our district &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why
I pledge to oppose and fight against any cuts to Medicare . As always, feel free to share this eNewsletter with friends and family who live in District One.
Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One

Around the district
Every corner of our massive district has its own unique identity, strengths and challenges. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m constantly on the road, because it&rsquo;s important for me to meet in person with our veterans, seniors, job creators and local leaders to hear what matters to them. Below are a few highlights from my recent visits to
Pima ,
Pinal ,
Graham and
Maricopa counties :
Public meeting with Graham &amp; Greenlee County veterans
