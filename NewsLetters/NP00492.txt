The House this week continued work on
appropriations bills and passed
H.R. 2578, the Commerce,
Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of
2016 .
Aside from this moving us closer to achieving all 12 appropriations
bills this summer, this touches a significant issue in the Ozarks
domestic violence.
More than 7,600 domestic violence
incidents were reported in the Seventh Congressional District in 2012 - the
last year with available complied data.
Thats an average of 20
reported cases per day with many more going unreported.
Local law
enforcement officials in the Ozarks have
seen
year-over-year increases since then with domestic violence shelters
unable to meet the need .
In May, I
sat down for a roundtable discussion with groups from across the Ozarks
concerned with this ugly trend in southwest Missouri.
The
conversation we had during the meeting shed light on how I can advocate on
the federal level for programs granting law enforcement, medical and
counseling groups the resources needed to confront this
issue.
To follow through on discussions during the conversation, I voted
in favor of H.R. 2576 and applaud the bipartisanship in its
passage.
This appropriations bill would give an 11.5 percent funding boost
for a number of domestic violence programs.
$479 million would
be put toward grant programs that could reduce the number of domestic
violence situations in the Ozarks, such
as:
$42.5 million for victim legal
assistance.
$33 million for rural domestic violence and child abuse
enforcement assistance
grants.
$35 million for sexual assault victim
assistance.
Up to $16
million to support families in the justice
system.
$4.5 million for
enhanced training and service to end violence against and abuse of
women.
$500,000 for the National Resource Center on Workplace Responses to help
domestic violence victims.
I am glad to help further efforts
to curb domestic violence in the Ozarks and will continue working
toward ending this senseless, dark problem impacting our
community.
