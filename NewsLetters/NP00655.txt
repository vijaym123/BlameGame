Carper's Connection
May 22, 2015
Dear Friends,
Most mornings I get up early, drive to the YMCA for a workout and then
drive to the train station in Wilmington to catch a train to
Washington. An efficient transportation system is an essential
ingredient in my day. Millions of Americans and thousands of American
businesses are similarly dependent on our railways, roads, and bridges.
For decades our transportation system was the envy of the world, and
helped us to become the worlds economic leader. However, much of it
was built more than 50 years ago and roads, highways, bridges and
transit systems across the country are in desperate need of repair.
Some 60,000 bridges in America have been labeled structurally
deficient. In Delaware, nearly 15 percent of our roads and 20 percent
of our bridges require major rehabilitation, repairs or replacement.
Congress used to pass multi-year bills to plan and fund our roads,
highways, bridges and transit systems, as many of these projects take
years to plan, contract, permit and build. Ideally, we would pass a
six-year bill, but in the past six years we have relied on dozens of
short-term extensions and borrowing nearly $65 billion from the General
Fund (which isn't exactly overflowing with surplus cash) to keep our
transportation fund afloat. This pattern of avoiding tough decisions
and simply kicking the can down the road is a wildly inefficient
approach to governing. It robs governors, mayors, and business leaders
of the federal funding certainty they need to plan for long-term
investments in our transportation system.

Earlier this week in Delaware, Senator Coons
and I joined representatives from labor, business, transit, cyclists
and more to discuss the critical need to fund projects that move people
and goods across the First State and the country.
This diverse group of transportation
stakeholders was united in its call for certainty and we heard them
loud and clear.
I will continue to push my colleagues in Congress to find a
common-sense way to fully fund a long-term transportation bill this
summer. If we work together, I know we can build the 21st century
American transportation system we need in order to continue our
economic recovery and compete in the global marketplace.

Dear
Friends,
Most
mornings
I
get
up
early,
drive
to
the
YMCA
for
a
workout
and
then
drive
to
the
train
station
in
Wilmington
to
catch
a
train
to
Washington.
An
efficient
transportation
system
is
an
essential
ingredient
in
my
day.
Millions
of
Americans
and
thousands
of
American
businesses
are
similarly
dependent
on
our
railways,
roads,
and
bridges.
For
decades
our
transportation
system
was
the
envy
of
the
world,
and
helped
us
to
become
the
world&#146;s
economic
leader.
However,
much
of
it
was
built
more
than
50
years
ago
and
roads,
highways,
bridges
and
transit
systems
across
the
country
are
in
desperate
need
of
repair.
Some
60,000
bridges
in
America
have
been
labeled
&#147;structurally
deficient.&#148;
In
Delaware,
nearly
15
percent
of
our
roads
and
20
percent
of
our
bridges
require
major
rehabilitation,
repairs
or
replacement.
Congress
used
to
pass
multi-year
bills
to
plan
and

our
roads,
highways,
bridges
and
transit
systems,
as
many
of
these
projects

Ideally,
we
would

but
in
the
past
six

we
have
relied
on
dozens
of
short-term

and
borrowing
nearly
$65
billion
from
the
General

(which
isn't
exactly
overflowing
with
surplus
cash)
to
keep
our
transportation
fund
afloat.
This
pattern
of
avoiding
tough
decisions
and
simply
kicking
the
can
down
the
road
is
a
wildly
inefficient
approach
to
governing.
It
robs
governors,
mayors,
and
business
leaders
of
the
federal
funding
certainty
they
need
to
plan

in
