Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code is important for small businesses because it helps them, and our economy, grow. It allows small businesses to expense up to $25,000 of the total cost of qualifying new and used equipment they buy or lease
serving as an effective way to encourage businesses to buy equipment and invest in their own growth.
Last week, the House voted to expand the maximum expensing threshold and make this much needed tax relief for small businesses permanent. I whole-heartedly support this move
when government acts as a barrier to economic growth, were shooting ourselves in the foot. Stepping out of the way and allowing job creators to grow their companies and invest in the future simply makes sense.
Yours in service,
Randy
