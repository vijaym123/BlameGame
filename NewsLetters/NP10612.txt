Budgeting
for the Future
This week, the
Path to Prosperity
budget passed the House of Representatives with my support. This budget provides a much-needed path
to balance and eliminates funding for Obamacare.
As I have done in the past, I also cast my vote for the tightest, most fiscally responsible budget
brought before the House. Unlike the President&rsquo;s budget, which would never balance, the Republican Study Committee&rsquo;s budget alternative
would balance in just four years. This budget also encouraged the House to approve my legislation, the
Tax Code Termination Act
( H.R. 352 ), as part of a pro-growth tax reform solution. This bill
would abolish the current tax code and require Congress to enact a simpler, fairer federal tax system. Unfortunately, this budget alternative did not
pass. We know the status quo does not work anymore. As
the national debt ticks upward each day, it is a visible reminder that if more lawmakers were willing to make the tough decisions, we could put our
fiscal house back in order much sooner. Addressing the serious challenges faced by our nation demands bold proposals, and I would encourage the House
and Senate to work together to get spending under control now to ensure a better future for generations to come. Instead of more of the same,
it&rsquo;s time to change the course towards more opportunities for economic growth. Read more on the budget. Click
