Dear Friend,
As your representative, I want to make sure that I am providing you with the latest news in and around our community and from Washington. Due to congressional regulations, I am unable to contact you unless you have previously signed up to receive my updates - through
my website
or via this email.
Keeping you in the loop as well through
email ,
Facebook , and
Twitter
is very important to me. Whether it be local issues in our district or legislative updates on our work in Washington, e-newsletters serve as the most convenient and cost effective tool of communication during this blackout period. I encourage you not only to
subscribe to these updates
but also to
share any comments and suggestions
so that we can continue to improve our community.
