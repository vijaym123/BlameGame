President Obama set a BIG goal for tonight's fundraising deadline.
And this morning, it looked like his goal was TOO big&hellip;
It looked like there was NO WAY we could hit 100,000 online donations to fight Republicans&rsquo; ad blitz.
But a few hours ago, donations started flooding in from across the country! That's an
ASTRONOMICAL
turnaround!
So many supporters have stepped up that we might have some AMAZING news for President Obama tomorrow!
If we can bring in 173 more donations before tonight&rsquo;s fundraising deadline, we can reach President Obama&rsquo;s goal just in the nick of time.
Less than 2 hours to go. It&rsquo;s going to be close! David -- can you chip in right now? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED!
