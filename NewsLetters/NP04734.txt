Hey david I really need to talk with you.
This morning, Senator Durbin- an old friend -- asked you to support my campaign.
Since then, 357 of you have responded to his call-to-action! Thank you! But as of 7pm, we&rsquo;re still coming up $534 short ahead of tonight&rsquo;s critical Get Out The Vote budget deadline.
David, with only one day left, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss this goal- not if we&rsquo;re going to keep Illinois blue. So I&rsquo;m asking: Will you chip in $5 or more to our campaign by midnight? http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
Thanks for your continued support,
Cheri
