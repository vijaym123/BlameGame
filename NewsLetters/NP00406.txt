David,
I&rsquo;m sorry to email you on a Saturday, but our HUGE spring fundraising deadline is in 24 hours. Alex told me we were close to hitting 10,000 Founding Members -- but we&rsquo;re not there yet. Hitting this goal would be a MAJOR boost of momentum -- so falling short isn&rsquo;t an option.
Proud Democrats across the country are taking action and chipping in whatever they can to our grassroots campaign. I need you on our team.

Thank you for everything,
