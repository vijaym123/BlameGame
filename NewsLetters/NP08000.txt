Dear Friend,
A lot of people wonder why it takes so long to get things done
in Washington.
Sometimes, I do too.
This video
illustrates that
point.
One of the many issues directly related to the needs
of Northeast Georgia I'm working on is this: I want to make sure that
my constituents over in Hart, Elbert, Stephens, and Franklin counties
get the choices they deserve when it comes to television. The fact
they can't get programming or news local to Northeast Georgia from
Atlanta leaves them isolated from weather alerts and breaking local
developments.
In rural areas, TV is the crucial medium for
communications. My constituents have made their wishes very clear, and that's
why I've been working to give them options.
This week in a
House Judiciary markup of a bill on a related issue, I announced my
intention to
introduce
a legislative solution to this problem. As a conservative, it's
my hope that we wouldn't need a federal law to do wthat good business
should be doing on its own. Unwillingness to reach an agreement from
folks in the industry, however, mean we're going to need a legislative
fix. Here's
what I had to
say :
If you live in one of the
affected areas, I hope this gives you confidence that I'm still working
very hard on this issue for you.
If you don't live in an "orphan
county," I hope you see this as an example of how your local issues
really do impact what happens in the committee rooms of Capitol
Hill.
I'm here to work for you.
If there's an issue you have
a problem with, please
let
me know .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
