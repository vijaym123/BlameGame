CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
March 23, 2015
Americans have unfortunately become all too familiar with the constant
threat to their personal information from hackers.
As the recent
attacks on Target, Anthem Blue Cross and Sony illustrate,
cybersecurity threats come from both here and abroad, and Americans' most
sensitive data is the target. Last
week, I introduced a
bipartisan bill aimed at addressing this threat:
the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act
(S.754).
The bill, which is coauthored with Senator
Dianne Feinstein, would create additional incentives to increase sharing
of threat information while making sure individual privacy is
protected. The
Cybersecurity Information Sharing
Act
was approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee on a 14-1
vote.
Im proud of the
Committees work and the quality of this bill. Our goal is to minimize a growing
threat to the United States and also ensure that our citizens'
personal data remains private and secure.
You can read more
about the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act
here
and the full legislative text is

Last week I joined Tim Boyum on Capital Tonight to discuss
everything from the letter to Iran and to my new cybersecurity
legislation. Watch by clicking below.

Have you seen my
redesigned Senate website?
It
is now fully integrated with social media, features online form
submission and is an efficient platform for constituents to engage with my
offices both in Washington and across North Carolina. It has information
about pending legislation, issue areas critical to North Carolinians,
and important press updates in a modern, easier to use format. It
also includes information on how constituents can receive help from my
office. Check it out yourself!
