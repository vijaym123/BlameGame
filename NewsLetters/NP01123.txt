BREAKING: GOP candidates announce plans to decimate Social Security.
Pitch in to fight back &gt;&gt;
David -- This is urgent. Please read this email all the way through:
The right-wing money machine is ramping up to put someone like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio in the White House and Senate. Seriously, the Kochs are AUDITIONING candidates!
And as President Obama explained last week:
If Democrats don&rsquo;t invest EARLY in key states, there will be no stopping the GOP from winning everything and destroying all of our progress.
Case in point:
THREE Republican presidential frontrunners -- Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush -- have already announced support for cutting Social Security and Medicare!
If they take the White House and Congress, it WILL happen!
We need $253,000 in the next 48 hours to launch our Protect Social Security Project. Will you pitch in and be one of the founding supporters?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
As President Obama said, &ldquo;Just like in 2008, the presidency, control of the Senate -- and the future of everything we&rsquo;ve fought for -- will depend on the EARLY investments we make in critical states.&rdquo;
Will you stand with the president, help Democrats win, and fight to stop Republican attacks on Social Security?
Thanks for your support,
