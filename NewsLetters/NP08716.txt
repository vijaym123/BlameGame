Blaine's Bulletin
There has been a lot of interest from people at home about a couple of issues Congress has been working on involving our Second Amendment rights. Clearly, a majority of Missourians, such as myself, support these rights and that is precisely why I have often been on the front lines in Congress when it comes to protecting your rights.
For example, I was able to successfully pass an amendment recently to the Fiscal Year 2015 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill which would prevent federal funds from being used as part of government efforts to target companies involved in the lawful commerce in firearms. This effort stems from Operation Choke Point, an effort by the government to use its regulatory powers to try and shut down entire industry sectors from having access to the financial services they need to conduct business.
My efforts to fight this has resulted in some national exposure to the issue and has led to an investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a panel on which I formally served that has focused on probing other White House scandals including the Fast and Furious gun running scandal, the IRS various violations of individual liberty and perhaps, most importantly, the Benghazi tragedy in which four brave Americans were killed.
As a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I realize that firearm owners have a responsibility to be safe and competent when it comes to the use of their firearms. As a hunter myself, I remember my earliest lessons from family and friends about how much responsibility comes with owning a firearm. They are lessons I have never forgotten and as many Missouri firearms owners know, these lessons are handed down from generation to generation.
With that in mind, I recently supported passage of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriation Act which included a number of provisions to halt President Obamas gun control agenda. The bill prohibits funds from being used to enforce the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty and also prohibits funding for an unauthorized ATF registration requirement for the sale of multiple rifles to the same person in Southwest border states.
Growing up, and living my life, in rural St. Elizabeth, Missouri, the population just over 300, I have a unique understanding of the importance of our right to bear arms. I will continue to consistently vote in favor of Second Amendment legislation, vote against government attempts to infringe on those rights, and ensure that we keep firearms out of the hands of those who are dangerous to themselves or others. With freedom comes responsibility and I can think of no other issue that best reflects that then the very American right to bear arms.
