Yesterday, Jan Schakowsky asked you to step up for Brad.
That&rsquo;s because Republican outside groups have been BASHING Brad&rsquo;s record on Chicagoland T.V.
Now, we&rsquo;re running out of time to respond. If we can hit 1,000 contributions by midnight, ALL GIFTS WILL BE MATCHED up to $5,200.
If we don&rsquo;t, a fantastic opportunity to pull ahead will slip through our fingers.
295 to go -- Are you in?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Please don&rsquo;t wait.
