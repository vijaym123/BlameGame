Subject: Join my team
Friend --
Since we kicked off, I've been on the road in Iowa and New Hampshire, having honest conversations with people about their hopes for the future of our country.
I've talked with mothers and fathers, nurses and teachers -- people who are looking for solutions to the challenges they face every day.
In each of these conversations, I'm reminded why I am running for president: Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
This campaign won't be easy. I'll work hard to earn every vote.
I want you by my side along the way. Add your name now to join this team: https://www.hillaryclinton.com/join
Thank you for being a part of this,
Hillary
