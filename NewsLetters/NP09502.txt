Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
A Solution in Search of a Problem
For hundreds of years, breweries and cattlemen have enjoyed a
harmonious
relationship
where the breweries donate spent grain from their barley and hops to cattle farmers who feed their herds with it.
Unfortunately, recent guidance from the FDA would require breweries to dry and package their grain before donating it to farmers.
This process, which is both cumbersome and expensive, would lead many breweries to cease donating the grain and instead send it to a landfill with the rest of their trash.
In light of this misguided rule proposal, I joined with my colleagues in the House Small Brewers Caucus in sending a
letter
to the FDA Commissioner asking that this rule be withdrawn.
I also authored an op-ed for the
Asheville Citizen-Times
on the rule which can be read by clicking the image below:
Talking with WWNC in Asheville

Visiting UNC Charlotte's Big Data Initiative
The 10th District has become a national leader for big data.
Apple, AT&amp;T, Facebook, and Disney are among the companies that have found a home for their data centers in Western North Carolina.
UNC Charlotte, the top 4-year college destination for students in four of the 10th District's seven counties, has embraced the region's reputation as a home for big data by launching a university initiative on big data.
Recently I toured the campus and viewed a demonstration of the business analytics program that is part of the initiative.
The programs, which included one to prevent credit card and bank fraud, can be used in a wide variety of fields including healthcare, energy, and financial services.
You can read more about my visit in UNC Charlotte's recent
