Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s humbling to see thousands upon thousands of people&rsquo;s signatures, all supporting your candidacy for public office. Humbling, and a reminder of what I&rsquo;m doing this for.
I fight to protect Medicare, Social Security, and the social safety net programs that lift up American families. I fight to get guns off our streets and for equal pay for equal work. I fight to create good jobs for folks in Massachusetts and across the country, and to keep those jobs right here at home.
And I fight for you, Friend.
And that makes me a huge target for the Koch brothers and special interest big shots like them.
With fewer than 200 days until the election, we&rsquo;re off and running, thanks to people like you.
Contribute $5, $10, or whatever works for you right now to help us keep the momentum going straight through November.
Thank you so much for all the work you&rsquo;ve done and the support you&rsquo;ve shown. I can&rsquo;t do this without you.
Sincerely,
Ed
