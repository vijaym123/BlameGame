JOIN ME ON
November 28, 2013
Today, like millions of other families across America, Christy
and I and our family will gather to share a Thanksgiving meal with
family and friends. We're truly thankful for the past generations that
worked to make America the greatest nation the world has ever known.
We'll also pay tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces,
especially those far from home and who may face imminent danger.
Christy and I also send our warmest wishes to all who are
celebrating Hanukkah today. Hanukkah isn't only a time to celebrate the
faith and customs of the Jewish people, but for people of all faiths to
celebrate the common aspirations we share.
To every resident of the 4th District, know that I'm truly
grateful for and humbled by the privilege of serving you.
And from the
Perry family to yours, please have a safe, happy, and blessed
Thanksgiving and Hanukkah.
