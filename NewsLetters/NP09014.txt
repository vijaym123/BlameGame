Celebrates Memorial Day and the Sacrifice of Fallen Heroes From the Virgin Islands
Congresswoman Christensen participated in the parades, speeches and ceremonial wreath laying in honor of Virgin Islands military who have given their lives for their country at Memorial Day Ceremonies earlier in the week. Of the honored Virgin Islands fallen she said: They may be small in number among all of the hundreds of thousands, who have given their lives from the Revolutionary War to the present, but for us they are too many and the pain of their loss remains large in our hearts. I thank them for the supreme sacrifice that they have made on behalf of our Country, and all of us, their fellow Virgin Islanders. Ours is a debt to all who lost loved ones in every war and conflict that can never ever be fully repaid.
