Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your

Russia's Aggression In Ukraine Not A Surprise In Light Of History
The movement of its troops into Ukraine's Crimea region should stand as
a wakeup call to those who have forgotten Russia's history of
aggression against its neighbors. I concurred wholeheartedly with the
statement by Speaker John Boehner (R, Ohio-8) following House passage
of H.Res. 499
, a
resolution condemning Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. The
Speaker said:
"Russia's hostile acts of aggression against Ukraine are an affront to
everything we stand for: liberty, democracy, and freedom from fear and
intimidation.
Vladimir Putin has proven himself a menace and a threat
to stability in the region, and he must be held accountable. The House
has passed a measure backing loan guarantees for Ukraine, and will
continue working to strengthen the president's hand on behalf of our
allies. I also continue to believe that the president should utilize
the resources at his disposal - including leveraging all sources of
American-made energy - to help undercut Russia's energy stranglehold on
its neighbors, and keep Putin in check."
Time To Rein In Imperial Presidency's Disregard For Rule Of Law
President Obama has admittedly sought to bypass the legislative branch,
ignoring the system of checks and balances enshrined in the
Constitution. He has taken the use of executive orders to extraordinary
levels and even sent his attorney general out to announce that
enforcing the law is optional. If he doesn't like what the law says. he
can ignore it.
It is time to halt the growing executive overreach of the Obama
Administration. That is I supported House passage of H.R. 4138, the
ENFORCE the Law Act
, and H.R.
3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act
.
H.R. 4138 permits the House or the Senate to authorize a lawsuit on
behalf of the American people against the executive branch for failure
to faithfully execute the laws. The bill provides for an expedited
review process.
Federal officials are required to report to Congress any time they stop
enforcement of a particular law, whether it's being done for
constitutional or policy reasons, under H.R. 3973.
Rare Unanimous Vote For Legislation Protecting Volunteer Firefighters
On Tuesday, the House unanimously passed H.R. 3979, the Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act
,
which I cosponsored. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code
to provide that a bona fide volunteer providing firefighting and
prevention services, emergency medical services, or ambulance services
to a state or local government or a tax-exempt organization shall not
be counted in determining the number of full-time employees of an
employer for purposes of the employer mandate to provide health care
coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Also Tuesday, the House approved by voice vote H.R. 311, the Farmers
Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship (FUELS) Act
. It
allows self-certification with the Environmental Protection Agency's
Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule for farms with an
individual tank that has an above-ground storage capacity greater than
10,000 gallons but less than 42,000 gallons and no history of spills.
It also exempts from the rule any farm with an aggregate above-ground
storage capacity of 10,000 gallons or less and no history of spills.
Subcommittee Delves Into Proposed Chemicals In Commerce Act
Over the past year, I have participated in five hearings digging into
the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, learning the issues section
by section, and thinking about how we could make this law work better.
In recent weeks, members of my Subcommittee on Environment and the
Economy have had several conversations, and our staffs have sat down on
a bipartisan basis for many hours to discuss language in the proposed
Chemicals in Commerce Act
.
On Wednesday, it was time to give a wide variety of stakeholders the
chance to weigh in. We heard from big and small chemical makers and
from those who use chemicals to make consumer products. We heard from
chemical distributors, labor unions, and other interest groups.
It is my hope that the diverse input will help us work through the
provisions to find consensus.
2,000 Days And Counting
It has now been more than 2,000 days - 5
years - since backers of the
Keystone XL pipeline first submitted an application to the U.S. State
Department on September 19, 2008. The department has conducted five
reviews, encompassing more than 22,000 pages, which show the pipeline
is in the best interest for our economy and the environment. Why has
the President continued to stall this jobs project?

Time

Rule
Of

President
Obama
has
admittedly
sought to
bypass
the
legislative
branch,

the system

enshrined
in

He

If

what
the
law
says. he
can
ignore
it.
It
is
time
to
halt
the growing
executive
overreach
of
the

Administration.
That
is
I
supported
House

4138,
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act ,
and
H.R.
3973,
the
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act .
H.R.
4138 permits
the
House
or
the
Senate
to
authorize
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
the
American
people
against
the
executive
branch
for
failure
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws. The
bill
provides
for
an
expedited
review
process.
Federal
officials
are
required
to
report
to
Congress
any
time
they
stop
enforcement
of
a
particular
law,
whether
it&#8217;s
being
done
for
constitutional
or
policy
reasons,
under
H.R.
3973.
