Ohioans deserve results, and that's exactly what we're about. In these
past few weeks, I've had a number of bipartisan accomplishments,
including enacting laws that protect the most vulnerable among us, make
our environment cleaner and our industries more efficient, and help
level the playing field for Ohio workers in the global economy. Check
out some of the highlights:
Combatting Human Trafficking
Last week, after years of Washington gridlock, we were able to
pass three of my bills to combat human trafficking and sex trafficking
in Ohio and around the country. My bipartisan legislation passed both
houses of Congress as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking
Act and are now on their way to being signed by the President. This
marks an important step in the fight to end this modern-day form of
slavery and is the most the significant legislation of its kind in more
than a decade.
One key bill included is my Bringing Missing Children Home Act
, which I coauthored with
Senator Schumer (D-NY), and improves how the cases of missing children
are handled and strengthens the information needed for law enforcement
officials to find missing kids. Because of this legislation, it will be
required to add a photograph to a missing child's file if it's
available. All too often children are reported missing, but we don't
have enough information or a picture to help find them. As an example,
since January 1, 2014 there have been more than 170 children reported
missing in Ohio and yet we only have pictures of about 50 of them. This
bill is an important part of reversing that and helping find the
vulnerable young people before a trafficker does.
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act also takes important steps
to protect and improve treatment of victims. It does so by adopting my
legislation to replace the term "child prostitution" with "child sex
trafficking" to make sure we treat children who have been sex
trafficked as victims and not criminals, so they can receive the
support they need. Also included is my Ensuring a Better Response for
Victims of Child Sex Trafficking
, a bill I authored to
require that kids who are victims of sex trafficking are treated as
victims of child abuse. This will allow more victims access to the
services of the child welfare system while they recover.
While it is important to find and treat victims, it is also vital that
we crack down on the perpetrators of these crimes. The Combat Human
Trafficking Act
, which I coauthored with
Senator Feinstein, (D-CA) will meet that objective, and major
provisions of it are now set to be signed into law. This legislation
makes it easier for law enforcement agencies to investigate and
prosecute those involved in sex trafficking by targeting the buyers and
not just sellers. Strengthening our laws to target buyers will reduce
demand for child victims and send a clear message to those who
victimize children that they will be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law.

Achieving a Cleaner Environment and Economic Growth
Earlier this month, President Obama signed into law
a bill I authored promoting energy
efficiency in federal buildings, commercial space, and with appliances.
It is part of a larger initiative I've been working on over the past
four years to help improve the environment and make America more energy
secure without sacrificing jobs. The broader Energy Savings and
Industrial Competitiveness Act is estimated to create 190,000
good-paying new jobs by incentivizing new energy efficiency
technologies for commercial, industrial and residential sectors of our
economy. It also lowers utility bills for working families, saving
consumers an estimated $16 billion a year.

.
Today, too many middle-class families in Ohio are being squeezed by a
combination of flat wages and higher health care, energy, education,
food and other costs. The energy efficiency legislation helps relieve
that middle class squeeze by lowering energy bills and allowing workers
to keep more of their hard earned paychecks. It also helps the
environment by reducing carbon emissions equivalent to taking 22
million cars off the road by 2030.
Leveling the Playing Field on Trade
Over the past several weeks, I have been fighting for more
exports which means more jobs and fighting against countries who break
the rules, so our workers can get a fair shake. Trade promotion is
important because expanding exports and having the 95 percent of people
who live outside of America buy more products stamped 'Made in America'
is good for jobs in Ohio. You cannot be for good-paying, middle class
jobs if you don't support exports. But while we open up markets for
products made and grown in Ohio, we must also be sure that we are
protecting our workers and farmers from unfair trade practices by
global competitors. The right thing for Ohio workers and Ohio farmers
is to promote a balanced approach that expands exports while leveling
the playing field.
I am pleased that my Level the Playing Field amendment with Senator
Sherrod Brown which supports Ohio manufacturers and steelworkers has
passed the Senate and is in the House version of the Customs bill. Our
measure ensures that American workers can remain globally competitive
by holding foreign countries and foreign companies accountable when
they skirt the rules by illegally underselling or subsidizing imports.
This is great news for Ohio workers, particularly steelworkers, and
Senator Brown and I are working hard to ensure this important provision
is signed into law.
I am also pleased that I was able to include some of my other
provisions to give Ohio workers and farmers a fair shake in the global
market. The trade bill includes an extension of Trade Adjustment
Assistance (TAA) that provides important protections for American
workers and families looking to get back on their feet. TAA also
includes an extension of the Health Coverage Tax Credit which is vital
for USW retirees and Delphi salaried retirees especially in the
Youngstown, Dayton, and Sandusky areas.
I authored the bipartisan bill
to extend the HCTC, and am delighted that this legislation has passed
the Senate and is expected to pass the House.
My team and I will continue to put Ohio first, as we reach out and work
with anyone -- Republican or Democrat -- who will help us get good
things done for Ohio.

Combatting
Human

Last
week,
after
years
of
Washington
gridlock,
we
were
able
to
pass
three
of
my
bills
to
combat
human
trafficking
and
sex
trafficking
in
Ohio
and
around
the
country.
My
bipartisan
legislation
passed
both
houses
of
Congress
as
part
of
the
Justice

Victims

and
are
now
on
their

to
being

by
the

This
marks
an

in
the

this
modern-day

is
the

is
my
Bringing

Act ,
which
I
coauthored
with
Senator

(D-NY),
and
improves
how
the
cases
of
missing
children
are
handled
and
strengthens
the
information
needed
for
law
enforcement
officials
to
find
missing
kids.
Because
of
this
legislation,
it
will
be
required
to
add
a
photograph
to
a
missing
child&#8217;s
file
if
it&#8217;s
available.
All
too
often
children
are
reported
missing,
but
we
don&#8217;t
have
enough
information
or
a
picture
to
help
find
them.
As
an
example,
since
January
1,
2014
there
have
been
more
than
170
children
reported
missing
in
Ohio
and
yet
we
only
have
pictures
of
about
50
of
them.
This
bill
is
an
important
part
of
reversing
that
and
helping
find
the
vulnerable
young
people
before
a
trafficker
does.
The
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
also
takes
important
steps
to
protect
and
improve
treatment
of
victims.
It
does
so
by
adopting
my
legislation
to
replace
the
term
&#8220;child
prostitution&#8221;
with
&#8220;child
sex
trafficking&#8221;
to
make
sure
we
treat
children
who
have
been
sex
trafficked
as
victims
and
not criminals,
so
they
can
receive
the
support
they
need.
Also
included
is
my
Ensuring
a
Better
Response
for
Victims
of
Child
Sex
Trafficking ,
a
bill
I
authored
to
require
that
kids
who
are
victims
of
sex
trafficking
are
treated
as
victims
of
child
abuse.
This
will
allow
more
victims
access
to
the
services
of
the
child
welfare
system
while
they
recover.
While
it
is
important
to
find
and
treat
victims,
it
is
also
vital
that
we
crack
down
on
the
perpetrators
of
these
crimes.
The
Combat
Human
Trafficking
Act ,
which
I
coauthored
with
Senator
Feinstein,
(D-CA)
will
meet
that
objective,
and
major
provisions
of
it
are
now
set
to
be
signed
into
law.
This
legislation
makes
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
agencies
to
investigate
and
prosecute
those
involved
in
sex
trafficking
by
targeting
the
buyers
and
not
just
sellers.
Strengthening
our
laws
to
target
buyers
will
reduce
demand
for
child
victims
and
send
a
clear
message
to
those
who
victimize
children
that
they
will
be
prosecuted
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law.

Today,
too
many
middle-class
families
in
Ohio
are
being
squeezed
by
a
combination
of
flat
wages
and
higher
health
care,
energy,
education,
food
and
other
costs.
The
energy
efficiency
legislation
helps
relieve
that
middle
class
squeeze
by
lowering
energy
bills
and
allowing
workers
to
keep
more
of
their
hard
earned
paychecks.
It
also
helps
the
environment
by
reducing
carbon
emissions
equivalent
to
taking
22
million
cars
off

road
by
2030.
Leveling
the
Playing
Field
on
Trade
Over
the
past
several
weeks, I
have
been fighting
for
more
exports
which
means
more
jobs
and
fighting
against
countries
who
break
the
rules,
so
our
workers
can
get
a
fair
shake.
Trade
promotion
is
important
because
expanding
exports
and
having
the
95
percent
of
people
who
live
outside
of
America
buy
more
products
stamped
&#8216;Made
in
America&#8217;
is
good
for
jobs
in
Ohio.
You
cannot
be
for
good-paying,
middle
class
jobs
if
you
don&#8217;t
support
exports.
But
while
we
open
up
markets
for
products
made
and
grown
in
Ohio,
we
must
also
be
sure
that
we
are
protecting
our
workers
and
farmers
from
unfair
trade
practices
by
global
competitors.
The
right
thing
for
Ohio
workers
and
Ohio
farmers
is
to
promote
a
balanced
approach
that
expands
exports
while
leveling
the
playing
field.
I am
pleased
that
my
Level
the
Playing
Field
amendment
with
Senator
Sherrod
Brown which
supports
Ohio
manufacturers
and
steelworkers has
passed
the
Senate
and
is in
the
House
version
of
the
Customs
bill.
Our
measure
ensures
that
American
workers
can
remain
globally
competitive
by
holding
foreign
countries
and
foreign
companies
accountable
when
they
skirt
the
rules
by
illegally
underselling
or
subsidizing
imports.
This
is
great
news
for
Ohio
workers,
particularly
steelworkers,
and
Senator
Brown
and
I
are
working
hard
to
ensure
this
important
provision
is
signed
into
law.
I
am
also
pleased
that
I
was
able
to
include
some
of
my
other
provisions
to
give
Ohio
workers
and
farmers
a
fair
shake
in
the
global
market. The
trade
bill
includes
an
extension
of
Trade
Adjustment
Assistance
(TAA)
that
provides
important
protections
for
American
workers
and
families
looking
to
get
back
on
their
feet.
TAA
also
includes
an
extension
of
the
Health
Coverage
Tax
Credit
which
is
vital
for
USW
retirees
and
Delphi
salaried
retirees
especially
in
the
Youngstown,
Dayton,
and
Sandusky
areas.
I
authored
the
bipartisan
bill
to
extend
the
HCTC,
and
am
delighted
that
this
legislation
has
passed
the
Senate
and
is
expected
to
pass
the
House.
My
team
and
I
will
continue
to
put
Ohio
first,
as
we
reach
out
and
work
with
anyone
--
Republican
or
Democrat
--
who
will
help
us
get
good
things
done
for
Ohio.
