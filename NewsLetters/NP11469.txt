Dear
Friends,
I would like to
remind everyone that the
deadline
to enroll in the
Affordable Care Act health insurance program is
March 31,
2014.
Over the past few months, my congressional offices in the 15th
district of Texas having been working in conjunction with many
organizations to offer assistance and guidance on how to enroll and find the
best health care coverage for you and your family. In my office, we are
working diligently for the constituency to be ready for the
deadline.
Many enrollment fairs have already taken place and hundreds of
families who did not have health insurance, are now covered. My office
has also partnered up with a federally certified nonprofit
organization, known as navigators, in order to facilitate the
process.
Our final two enrollment fairs, before the March 31st deadline,
will take place on Thursday
March 20th and Friday March 21st
at the McAllen Convention Center, 700 Convention Center Blvd. in
McAllen, Texas.
If you cannot attend or would rather go online to
enroll please visit
www.healthcare.gov
for more
information on eligibility and on how to enroll.
Individuals
of all income levels are welcomed to enroll. The new online
marketplace provides different plans and rates. Each individual plan is there
to meet the needs of every lifestyle, budget and almost any income
level. There is no denial for pre-existing conditions, no lifetime limits
on coverage, and no higher rates for women compared to
men.
Please know that some who do not enroll by the March 31 deadline
could be penalized monetarily which will be reflected on their 2015 income
tax. This penalization could be as much as $95 per adult. The next
time to enroll will be in November, but this will be too late to avoid
the 2015 penalization.
Uninsured consumers sometimes might
find it difficult to determine their eligibility. Individuals who fall
under the "coverage gap", people who make too much money to be
eligible for Medicaid, but not enough to
qualify for subsidized loans,
need to know if they are able to qualify for the hardship waiver. The
hardship waiver exempts these individuals from paying an income tax
penalty.
Again, I want to remind everyone that our final two
enrollment fairs, before the March 31st deadline, will take place on
Thursday March 20th and Friday March 21st at the McAllen
Convention Center, 700 Convention Center Blvd. in McAllen, Texas.
If you cannot attend or would rather go online to enroll please visit
www.healthcare.gov
for more information on
eligibility and on how to enroll.
Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
Member of Congress
