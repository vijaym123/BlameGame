Friend, this is the third time I&#39;ve been in this position:
a race that&#39;s neck and neck, with an astronomical amount being spent against me.
In 2010, we ran a rock-solid campaign. Unfortunately, our team didn&rsquo;t have the resources we needed to get the facts out to Sacramento County voters.
We won in 2012, and I&rsquo;ve had the honor of representing Sacramento County for the past two years.
But now, with just 48 hours left, Republicans are spending more against me than anyone in the country, hoping that history will repeat itself.
Listen, not if I can help it.
I refuse to let outside money buy this election -- not when there&rsquo;s so much at stake for Sacramento County families.
So please, if you&rsquo;re with me, I need to hear from you tonight. Can I count on your support for my first reelection campaign?
