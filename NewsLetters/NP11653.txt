Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
With everything going on

School Choice and the American Dream
I firmly believe that when a parent gets a choice in education, a kid
has a much better chance of success.
I believe that education is a
crucial step out of poverty. I believe that a bigger and more intrusive
government isn't the answer to fixing all our problems, and that the
American Dream is still very much alive and well in towns in South
Carolina and across our nation.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to share my support for school choice
and the American Dream at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action
Conference.
You can watch my speech here.

Defending our National Guard
Our armed forces are the best in the world, and the courageous men and
women who choose to be a part of the Army National Guard stand at the
ready to defend our nation. I have very serious concerns with the
Department of the Army's recent proposal to cut the Army National Guard
combat aviation assets and force structure. Aviation cuts could result
in the loss of 150 jobs and a $100 million in economic impact just in
South Carolina. More importantly, they could negatively effect the
readiness of the Army National Guard.
I am committed to ensuring that this important force is fully equipped
and funded, and have joined colleagues in writing a letter
to Secretary Hagel
to express our deep concern with this unwise move.
I am working hard to serve the people of South Carolina, and I
appreciate the privilege of serving as your voice in the United States
Congress.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with
suggestions, concerns, or if we can ever be helpful to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
