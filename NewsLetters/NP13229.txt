A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
January 12, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week the House passed a bill that would require the Department of
Health and Human Services to quickly notify individuals if their
personal information is at risk due to a security breach of the
Obamacare exchange system. To minimize the amount of information that
could be at risk, I introduced H.R. 3835, The BROWSE Act. This bill
would alter the healthcare.gov website to work in the same manner as
most other websites.
When the President was selling the American people on healthcare.gov,
he said it was going to work like Amazon and Kayak. Websites where
consumers are able to go and shop for products, and if they find a
product that they like, then and only then do they have to put in their
personal information. But healthcare.gov doesn't work that way.
Before Americans can shop for products on healthcare.gov, they have to
put in all of their information, such as their address, date of birth
and social security into a website that is not secure.
The BROWSE Act will make sure that Americans have an opportunity to
search the website, look at products, and only enter their personal
information once they have found a product that they like.
I talked about my bill on the Floor of the House. Click on the image to
watch.
I also posted a video for my Facebook
and Twitter
followers where I discussed the bill and restated my
opposition to Obamacare, "I don't agree with this law. I am working to
reform it, repeal it and replace it. But until that time comes, I want
to make sure [the website] works well for the American people."

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
January 12, 2014
Dear
Friend,
This
week
the
House
passed
a
bill
that
would
require
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
quickly
notify
individuals
if
their
persona l
informatio n
is
at
risk
due
to
a
security
breach
of
the
Obamacare
exchange
system.
To
minimize
the
amount
of
information
that
could
be
at
risk,
I
introduced
H.R.
3835,
The
BROWSE
Act.
This
bill
would
alter
the
healthcare.gov
website
to
work
in
the
same
manner
as
most
other
websites.
When
the
President
was
selling
the
American
people
on
healthcare.gov,
he
said
it
was
going
to
work
like
Amazon
and
Kayak.
Websites
where
consumers
are
able
to
go
and
shop
for
products,
and
if
they
find
a
product
that
they
like,
then
and
only
then
do
they
have
to
put
in
their
personal
information.
But
healthcare.gov
doesn&#8217;t
work
that
way.
Before
Americans
can
shop
for
products
on
healthcare.gov,
they
have
to
put
in
all
of
their
information,
such
as
their
address,
date
of
birth
and
social
security
into
a
website
that
is
not
secure.
The
BROWSE
Act
will
make
sure
that
Americans
have
an
opportunity
to
search
the
website,
look
at
products,
and
only
enter
their
personal
information
once
they
have
found
a
product
that
they
like.
I
talked

my
bill

this
law.
I
am
working
to
reform
it,
repeal
it
and
replace
it.
But
until
that
time
comes,
I
want
to
make
sure
[the
website]
works
well
for
the
American
people.&#8221;
