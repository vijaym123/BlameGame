David --
We&rsquo;re in a tough race -- one of the toughest in the country. Just look what&rsquo;s happened this Summer:
-- first, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s operatives authorized a
$2,224,OOO
offensive against Illinois Democrats
-- then, Boehner
himself
came to our district to host a lavish fundraiser for my opponent
-- and now, Boehner&rsquo;s predicting the Illinois GOP will have their best year in
two decades Look, we&rsquo;ve got to go on offense -- before Boehner's attacks take hold with voters.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching our very first ad this morning talking about my efforts to honor our men and women in uniform by pushing the federal government to only purchase American flags made in the USA.
David, take a look for yourself (I hope you like it!).
