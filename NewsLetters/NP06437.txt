Dear David,
Today marks 13 years
since the horrific terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. We'll never
forget those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we're forever grateful to
our men and women in uniform, intelligence professionals, and the
nation's first responder community for working tirelessly to keep us
safe.
There's no doubt that our nation still faces a real
threat from terrorist groups and enemies who wish us harm. We were reminded
of this just two years ago, when four Americans were killed during a
terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. And the threat
to our nation from terrorist groups like ISIL is still very real. In
fact, because of a new base in Syria and Iraq, that threat is
potentially even more dangerous today.
Like the rest of the nation,
I will be watching closely for what actions the president ultimately
takes to stop ISIL. If left unchecked, the danger posed by ISIL could
easily produce a significant threat to the United States. This group
is not a 'manageable problem' as the president described it last week.
But instead, it matches his description last night of a group that
must be defeated.
I hope the president's plan and his
resolve can meet the goal of defeating this enemy.
On this
day and every day, we will never forget the innocent victims, first
responders, and their families who lost so much on 9/11. As a member of
the defense authorizing and appropriations committees, I will continue
working to ensure our military, intelligence, and first responders have
the resources they need to protect America.
Sincere
regards,
