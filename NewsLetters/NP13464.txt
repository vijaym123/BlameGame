Dear Friend,
As we near the end of the year, I want to take the opportunity to
report back to you and show just how critical your insights and ideas
have been to my work to address the needs of families and small
businesses throughout our communities.
That's why I hope you will to take a moment to review my office's
End-of-the-Year Report
for 2013, which is also posted on my website, www.esty.house.gov
.
This report outlines how your input has helped guide my legislative
work this year to help boost jobs in our state, invest in workforce
training, support our veterans, and address the many priorities
critical to central and northwest Connecticut.
My report also outlines some of the ways in which I've been able to
help constituents like you -recovering military decorations, assisting
families with visas and immigration, and helping secure a total of more
than $1,013,939 in benefits and refunds from federal and state
government agencies and financial institutions.
With 12 Congress on Your Corner events, 15 visits to different local
manufacturers, 12 roundtable discussions, various town halls, tele-town
halls, and other events, and with tens of thousands of emails, phone
calls, and in-person visits, I've enjoyed many opportunities to meet
and hear from many of you in my first year in office.
And thank you to all who filled out the brief survey I emailed to you a
few weeks ago. If you haven't already completed the survey, click here
. I want to
know what you think I should focus on to best serve our district. I've
posted the top three priorities on my Facebook page
.
I look forward to continuing to hear from you, serving you, and working
with you in the new year. It is an honor to serve you and to bring your
voice to Washington.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact
me with your concerns or questions, or if I or my office
can help you in any way.
Happy Holidays to you and your family and a very Happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth H. Esty
Member of Congress
