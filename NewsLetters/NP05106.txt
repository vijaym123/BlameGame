MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: WE NEED YOUR HELP OR WE&rsquo;LL BE FORCED TO START CUTTING STATES!
WE&rsquo;LL TRIPLE MATCH YOUR GIFT! &gt;&gt;
Friend --
MSNBC
just reported, &ldquo;With less than two weeks before Election Day, it&rsquo;s crunch time&hellip;
the battle for the Senate is still very much up in the air.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s SO CLOSE: 12 races are deadlocked. And
National Journal
reports, &ldquo;[Democrats&rsquo;] get-out-the-vote programs can boost them just enough to eke out the victories they need to maintain their majority.&rdquo;
But here&#39;s the alarming thing: we&#39;re short on cash. Tonight our leadership team will have to make an EXCRUCIATING decision: Will we be able to fund GOTV efforts in every state and win, or will we be forced to cut some battlegrounds loose?
Will you pitch in to our massive GOTV effort so we can hand the GOP a devastating loss? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift before midnight!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Here&rsquo;s the choice: Sit this one out and risk a Mitch McConnell-led Senate, or contribute tonight, help us FIGHT FOR EVERY STATE, and send McConnell PACKING.
We just can&rsquo;t stomach the thought of our victory being ripped away at the last minute.
So please, will you give before midnight and have your gift triple-matched?
Thank you for standing with Democrats in our hour of need.
Now, let&rsquo;s win this!
Democratic Victory
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
