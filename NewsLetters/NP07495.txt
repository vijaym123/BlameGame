Dear Friend,
Im writing to invite you to a forum that
Ill be hosting Monday, August 4 th
at 7
pm to help constituents combat identity theft.
This event will be
hosted at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens Witherbee
Auditorium.
Identity theft is one of the most common threats faced
by consumers, especially seniors. It takes place when someone steals
your personal information and uses it without your permission.
This crime can wreak havoc with personal finances, credit history and
reputation
and can take significant amounts of time, money and patience
to resolved.
Thats why Im hosting this forum with
representatives from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Social
Security Administration and US Postal Inspection Service to discuss
concrete ways you can protect your identity, and combat identity
theft.
With big data breaches, scams involving posing as federal
agencies, and even pickpocketing or dumpster-diving, there are more
threats facing our personal information than ever before. This forum
will help you learn how to avoid being the target or victim of
identity theft, and teach you what you need to do to protect yourself,
your finances and future.
Only by being vigilant and learning the
tools to protect oneself, can we combat this very widespread and
destructive crime.
If you want to attend, RSVP to
CongressmanSchiff.RSVP@mail.house.gov , or call my district
office at (818)
450-2900
or
(323) 315-5555 . Entrance and parking are free for the
event.
Remember, thats
Monday, August
4 th
at 7 pm at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical
Gardens Witherbee Auditorium.
Hope to see you
there!
Sincerely,
Congressman Adam Schiff
