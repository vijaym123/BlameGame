Dear Friend,
How can we best support our service members and veterans?
It's a question on the minds of many Americans after learning of
allegations of misconduct at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
And with 22 veterans taking their own lives every day, caring for the
mental health of our service members and veterans has never been more
pressing.
I've already called for a criminal investigation to get to the root of
the problem at the VA. But I am also working to improve the available
resources for our veterans and military members by creating innovative
public-private partnerships.
That's why last year I sponsored an amendment to the Department of
Defense funding bill with my Republican colleague Rep. Peter King that
added $10 million for critical mental health services. Not only did
this increase access to mental health care for our troops, but it also
established a partnership between the Department of Defense (DoD) and
the private sector for research, treatment and education on military
mental health issues at teaching hospitals.
There is a growing need and we know we need all hands on deck. This
amendment showed that innovative public-private alliances can help
provide the level of service that our service members deserve.
Smart policy choices can be equally effective at improving the VA. In
addition to wait times for receiving care, one of the most pressing
issues the VA faces is the claims backlog-currently, New York veterans
wait an average of 297 days to receive disability compensation and
benefits, a time table that is simply unacceptable.
Legislation I co-authored, the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act, would
give provisional benefits to veterans filing for disability if a claim
hasn't been processed within 125 days. Put simply, this bill would
ensure no veteran filing a claim has to wait more than 125 days for the
benefits they've earned.
I'm proud of my work to ensure every veteran and service member
receives gold standard health care. Part of this work is cutting
through the red tape at the VA to recover owed benefits-to date my
office has successfully recovered more than $7.4 million in back pay.
If you, or a veteran you know, needs help with a VA benefits claim,
please make my office your first resource.
Thank you,
Steve Israel

Dear
Friend,
How
can
we
best
support
our
service
members
and
veterans?
It&#8217;s
a
question
on
the
minds
of
many
Americans
after
learning
of
allegations
of
misconduct
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
And
with
22
veterans
taking
their
own
lives
every
day,
caring
for
the
mental
health
of
our
service
members
and
veterans
has
never
been
more
pressing.
I&#8217;ve
already
called
for
a
criminal
investigation
to
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem
at
the
VA.
But
I
am
also
working
to
improve
the
available
resources
for
our
veterans
and
military
members
by
creating
innovative
public-private
partnerships.
That&#8217;s
why
last
year
I
sponsored
an
amendment to
the
Department
of
Defense
funding
bill
with
my
Republican
colleague
Rep. Peter
King
that
added
$10
million
for
critical
mental
health
services.
Not
only
did
this
increase
access
to
mental
health
care
for
our
troops,
but
it
also
established
a
partnership
between
the
Department
of
Defense
(DoD)
and
the
private
sector
for
research,
treatment
and
education
on
military
mental
health
issues
at
teaching
hospitals.
There
is
a
growing
need
and
we
know
we
need
all
hands
on
deck.
This
amendment
showed
that
innovative
public-private
alliances
can
help
provide
the
level
of
service
that
our
service
members
deserve.
Smart
policy
choices
can
be
equally
effective
at
improving
the
VA.
In
addition
to
wait
times
for
receiving
care,
one
of
the
most
pressing
issues
the
VA
faces
is
the
claims
backlog&#8212;currently,
New
York
veterans
wait
an
average
of
297
days
to
receive
disability
compensation
and
benefits,
a
time
table
that
is
simply
unacceptable.
Legislation
I
co-authored,
the
Veterans
Backlog
Reduction
Act ,
would
give
provisional
benefits
to
veterans
filing
for
disability
if
a
claim
hasn&#8217;t
been
processed
within
125
days.
Put
simply,
this
bill
would
ensure
no
veteran
filing
a
claim
has
to
wait
more
than
125
days
for
the
benefits
they&#8217;ve
earned.
I&#8217;m
proud
of
my
work
to
ensure
every
veteran
and
service
member
receives
gold
standard
health
care.
Part
of
this
work
is
cutting
through
the
red

at
the
VA
to
recover
owed
benefits&#8212;to
date
my
office
has
successfully
recovered
more
than
$7.4
million
in
back
pay.
If
you,
or
a
veteran
you
know,
needs
help
with
a
VA
benefits
claim,
please
make
my
office
your
first
