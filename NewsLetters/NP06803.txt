I believe that Congress has an obligation to address our nation's fiscal challenges in a responsible fashion that does not harm seniors or future generations of Americans.
I introduced legislation ( H.R.3161 ) to ensure that money allocated to both the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds can only be used for the purpose for which they were intended.
Medicare and Social Security need to be dependable and consistent for the seniors who rely on them.
We must fulfill the commitments weve made to our seniors
that after a lifetime of work and service to our communities, Social Security and Medicare will be there for them when they need it.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I will continue working to eliminate
fraud
in Medicare, oppose access to benefits for those here
illegally , provide access to local
pharmacies , ensure that
healthcare decisions
are made between patients and their doctors, instead of bureaucrats in Washington, and prioritize
medical research
to find cures for diseases like cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers.
