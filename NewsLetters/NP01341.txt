Fellow Illinoisans,
Sometimes heavy media coverage of partisan
bickering in Congress overshadows the
important compromises that are made without
much fanfare.
Recently, the House and Senate came
together in bipartisan fashion and agreed to
make important improvements to
Americas health care system through
the
Medicare
Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of
2015
. Last week, President Obama signed
that compromise into law. While the main
purpose of this law is to strengthen Medicare
and extend the Childrens Health
Insurance Program, Id like to tell you
about a
small
provision
Im proud to finally see
signed into law .
Its been nearly a decade since I
first introduced the Social Security Number
Protection Act in 2006. What the bill said
was simple: Social Security numbers should
not be printed on Medicare cards. Why?
Because these numbers open up many elements
of ones personal life and are the
combination to the safe for an identity
thief.
Identity theft is one of the fastest
growing crimes in America. It was estimated
that
16.6
million Americans were victims of identity
theft in 2012
and the misuse of Social Security
numbers is one of the primary drivers of
this. Ive been a victim once, like so
many others. But I was lucky to get the issue
resolved quickly, unlike some seniors who
have thousands of dollars taken from their
bank accounts right under their nose.
Seniors have become victims of fraud and
identity theft partly because of the way
Medicare identifies beneficiaries. Over 49
million beneficiaries carry their Medicare
cards with them in their purses and in their
wallets. These cards display a Medicare
identification number, which consists of
their Social Security number with a one or
two-digit code at the end, leaving
beneficiaries particularly vulnerable to
identity theft should a card be lost, stolen,
or left in plain sight.
For years, I urged the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) to remove
Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.
I wrote letters, introduced bill after bill,
even offered
amendments
to other bills with the hopes of
one day eliminating this liability the
government was creating for Americas
senior citizens.
Im
glad Congress could finally say enough is
enough .
With identity theft on the rise, we can't
make it this easy for thieves. This
provisions inclusion in the Medicare
Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015
recommits the governments fight
against identity theft. In an ever more
mobile, inter-connected world, the federal
government cannot skimp on its responsibility
to protect the most vulnerable from identity
thieves.
Sincerely,
Dick Durbin
United States Senator
