President Obama famously
promised that, under the Affordable Care Act , If you like your
health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan,
period.
He made that promise at least 29 times.
And yet, here
we are, in the early stages of the Obamacare rollout, and what are the
results so far?
According to the Associated Press, 4.2
million Americans have lost their health insurance because of
Obamacare.
Meanwhile, only 106,185 have signed up for the exchanges.
That means, for every American who bought a plan on the exchanges, nearly
40 had to lose their plan.
Who are these 4.2 million
Americans who lost their insurance?
Theyre friends, neighbors, family
members, good people who lost their insurance through no fault of
their own.
I have received many letters from Idahoans who lost
their insurance.
Here are four stories I wanted to
share:
Carol
Harrison, ID
Carol is 62 years
old and has 10 grandchildren.
She received a letter from her
health carrier, saying her plan no longer qualified under the
Affordable Care Act.
She will be dropped from her coverage on
February 1st.
Jason
Nampa, ID
Jason is a
Deputy Sheriff employed by Canyon County.
He is a former member
of the Coast Guard and the Army National Guard.
Obamacare made
his health plan too expensive, forcing him to drop his family from his
plan.
He is still looking at other options for his
family.
David
Clark Ford, ID
David is 65,
retired, and received his coverage through Mutual of Omaha.
His
health plan is being dropped.
His son, who is currently
self-employed, also lost his insurance and had to go on a group
plan.
Jan
Boise, ID
Jan was notified by her health
carrier that her coverage will end on February 1 st .
The carrier offered to replace her plan with another one, but it has
higher premiums. Jan is currently looking at other
options.
These are just a few of the silent victims of the Presidents
broken promises.
There are many more out there.
And there will
likely be even more before this is over.
The President would
like to apologize for his broken promises and move on.
But
thats not good enough.
The time has come to take action
to truly
solve this problem once and for all.
And at this point, it
should be clear that the only action worth taking
the only solution that
will
truly
work - is FULL repeal of
Obamacare.
