Happy October friends!!
I have had a refreshing and
busy few weeks at home in District 31 visting with constituents,
friends and family. Please take a look at what I've been up to
below.
It was a big month for the Carter family. We welcomed three new
little additions. My daughter and her husband welcomed two baby
girls, Scarlett and Teagen. Three days later, my son and his wife welcomed
a little boy, Rhett. My wife and I are truly blessed with our now SIX
grandchildren! After getting to spend some quality time with them, I
am refreshed and ready to get back to D.C. to tackle some big issues
coming up in the Lame Duck and early next year. Thank you for your
support and prayers. -Judge
Teagan

Rhett, 7 lbs, 5 oz.
I was
honored to present Army veteran Sergeant Andrew P. Idol with 11 medals,
including the Purple Heart.
Please read
about Andrew
and the sacrifices he made on our behalf.
I am so happy that two sections of the new and
improved State Highway 195 are open to traffic. I have been working with Bell
and Williamson County officials for many years to make Highway 195
safer. We have lost too many lives on that dangerous highway. I am
looking forward to its total completion in 2016. Until then, drive safe and
enjoy the new sections!
Two dear
friends of mine are retiring after many years of service to
Williamson County. Vivian Wood has been the Williamson County treasurer for 20
years. Billy Ray Stubblefield has been an attorney and District Judge
in Williamson County form ore than 20 years. Happy retirement you
two!
I was truly
honored to attend a citizenship ceremony in Killeen. We welcomed 122
new Americans from 44 different countries!
Meet Jessica Huber, a Leander teen, who has fought for
her life since she was in a horrible accident as a baby. She inspired me
to declare Nov. 19 as
Survivors Victory Day
in
Congressional District 31.
I had a
great time at the Round Rock High School pep rally on Oct. 30. My son
coaches there and all four of my children graduated from RRHS. Go
Dragons!
Congratulations to the
Ambulatory Surgery Center in Killeen on its grand opening!
The groundbreaking for a new Safe
Routes to School hike and bike path for students at Mitchell Elementary

which received the U.S. Economic Development Administration

I'm very proud of Round
Rock teacher Holly Griffin, an English teacher at Cedar Ridge High
School, for receiving the Humanities Texas Award for Outstanding Early-
Career Teaching.
It was great
meeting the great men and women at the Interagency Support Council of
East Williamson County's monthly luncheon.
Thank you to the Cedar
Park Surgery Center and Arise Healthcare for the tour of their facility
