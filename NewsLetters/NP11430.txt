Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
I enjoyed the opportunity to share my personal testimony in the Capitol
with pastors from across the country.
Executive Overreach
This week the House passed two measures that respond to the President's
continual acts of executive overreach.
H.R. 4138, the Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect
Congressional Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act of 2014
passed the House by a vote of 233-181. Through H.R. 4138, the House or
Senate can authorize a lawsuit against the President when there is a
failure to enforce policy that has been passed by Congress and signed
into law.
Following suit, the House then approved H.R. 3973, the Faithful
Execution of the Law Act of 2014 by a vote of 244-171. H.R. 3973
provides for transparency and accountability when federal laws are not
enforced by requiring federal officials, who established a policy of
non-enforcement, to notify Congress of the reasons they chose not to
enforce.
The act of a President overstepping the boundaries of his authority is
unfortunately not new to the United States, but under our current
Administration the abuse of executive power has quickly escalated. Both
pieces of legislation are not driven by party politics, but simply
reinforce the balance of powers and bring the President back to
reality.
We have seen that if the President doesn't like a law, he changes it or
ignores it altogether. Yet, the powers of the President of the United
States do not include lawmaking. In our Constitution that task is given
to Congress, the voice of the electorate. The very same document that
gives the President his authority, also limits his authority. It is not
a Democrat or Republican issue-it's just the law of the land.
Two current examples of overreach by the Obama Administration include
the Affordable Care Act and our nation's immigration system. The
President has continually and arbitrarily delayed parts of Obamacare,
outside of Congressional consent, and consistently failed to enforce
the immigration laws of our nation.
I held another telephone town hall this week from Washington, D.C.,
discussing our national security and the crisis in Ukraine.
Telephone Town Hall
Tuesday night I held a telephone town hall with Congressman Lankford
and over 7,500 citizens from across the Second District of Oklahoma.
Calls were fielded from various towns including Chelsea, Muskogee,
Panama, Broken Bow, Muldrow, Morris, Durant and Shady Point.
Congressman Lankford and I discussed national defense issues and the
current crisis in Ukraine, as well as frustrations with our current
Administration.
One caller from Durant said they don't think Putin has any respect for
Obama, and that they are resentful the President wants to cut the
military. Leadership from the White House has been specifically lacking
in the Ukraine situation, and the President has clearly shown he's more
interested in campaigning than in being an effective leader.
A caller from Kingston asked about executive orders where the President
changes laws passed by Congress. What we have seen by this President is
he uses his executive orders to go around Congress. If the President
doesn't agree with the representatives, he just goes around them. We
can see the effects of this at the gas pumps and in our energy bills
and the economy. We can see that this President is a very good
politician and a very bad leader.
A Broken Bow caller expressed frustration with the Obama proposed
budget cuts to the U.S. military. Congressman Lankford agreed with the
caller saying the Administration is trying to find the "simplest way"
to balance the budget instead of going after wasteful spending.
Tuesday's telephone town hall is the second such forum I've held this
year and my eighth since taking office. These town halls are an
important tool for us to stay in touch with the district and to remain
accountable to the people we represent. I want to thank each and every
one of you that participated.
Late last week I participated in a veterans roundtable in Muskogee to
discuss many issues facing our local vets. Our veterans have sacrificed
so much, and our nation should ensure we fulfill our promises to them.
Water Rights Protection Act
In the House of Representatives, we passed H.R. 3189--the Water Rights
Protection Act--which included my amendment that ensures protections
for the water rights of American Indian Tribes. The legislation passed
the House by a vote of 238-174.
H.R. 3189 provides comprehensive water rights protections for all water
users, and ensures certainty to the water supply and jobs that are
dependent on these rights. Under the act, entities are protected from
having to relinquish their privately-held water rights in order to
receive a federal permit, lease or other land use agreement.
My amendment also ensures that the Department of the Interior and the
Department of Agriculture can't use one sided permits, license,
approvals, and other land management tools to take water from Indian
tribes without just compensation. Many tribes rely on reserved water
rights and water rights guaranteed by treaties to provide critical
water supplies for their people. This amendment makes clear that these
water rights are fully protected.
This is the Federal Register (April 2011-Present), printed daily by the
GPO, that contains rules and notices from Federal agencies, as well as
executive orders--just a snapshot of the excessive government
regulation that kills job growth, raises prices, and is an overall drag
on our economy. This amount of regulation is completely unnecessary.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
share
my
personal
testimony in
the
Capitol
with
pastors
from
across
the
country.
Executive
Overreach
This
week
the
House
passed two
measures
that
respond
to
the
President&#8217;s
continual
acts
of
executive
overreach.
H.R.
4138,
the
Executive
Needs
to
Faithfully
Observe
and
Respect
Congressional
Enactments
of
the
Law
(ENFORCE
the
Law)
Act
of
2014
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
233-181.
Through
H.R.
4138,
the
House
or
Senate
can
authorize
a
lawsuit
against
the
President
when
there
is
a
failure
to
enforce
policy
that
has
been
passed
by
Congress
and
signed
into
law.
Following
suit,
the
House
then
approved
H.R.
3973,
the
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act
of
2014
by
a
vote
of
244-171.
H.R.
3973
provides
for
transparency
and
accountability
when
federal
laws
are
not
enforced
by
requiring
federal
officials,
who
established
a
policy
of
non-enforcement,
to
notify
Congress
of
the
reasons
they
chose
not
to
enforce.
The
act
of
a
President
overstepping
the
boundaries
of
his
authority
is
unfortunately
not
new
to
the
United
States,
but
under
our
current
Administration
the
abuse
of
executive
power
has
quickly
escalated.
Both
pieces
of
legislation
are
not
driven
by
party
politics,
but
simply
reinforce
the
balance
of
powers
and
bring
the
President
back
to
reality.
We
have
seen
that
if
the
President
doesn&#8217;t
like
a
law,
he
changes
it
or
ignores
it
altogether.
Yet,
the
powers
of
the
President
of
the
United
States
do
not
include
lawmaking.
In
our
Constitution
that
task
is
given
to
Congress,
the
voice
of
the
electorate.
The
very
same
document
that
gives
the
President
his
authority,
also
limits
his
authority.
It
is
not
a
Democrat
or
Republican
issue&#8212;it&#8217;s
just
the
law
of
the
land.
Two
current
examples
of
overreach
by
the
Obama
Administration
include
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
our
nation&#8217;s
immigration
system.
The
President
has
continually
and
arbitrarily
delayed
parts
of
Obamacare,
outside
of
Congressional
consent,
and
consistently
failed
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
of
our
nation.
I
held
another
telephone
town
hall
this
week
from
Washington,
D.C.,
discussing
our
national
security
and
the
crisis
in
Ukraine.
Telephone
Town
Ha ll
Tuesday
night
I
held
a
telephone
town
hall
with
Congressman
Lankford
and over
7,500
citizens
from
across
the
Second
District
of
Oklahoma. Calls
were
fielded
from
various
towns
including
Chelsea,
Muskogee,
Panama,
Broken
Bow,
Muldrow,
Morris,
Durant
and
Shady
Point.
Congressman
Lankford
and
I
discussed
national
defense
issues
and
the
current
crisis
in
Ukraine,
as
well
as
frustrations
with
our
current
Administration .
One
caller
from
Durant
said
they
don&#8217;t
think
Putin
has
any
respect
for
Obama,
and that
they
are
resentful
the
President wants
to
cut
the
military.
Leadership
from
the
White
House
has
been
specifically
lacking
in
the
Ukraine
situation,
and
t he
President
has
clearly
shown
he's
more
interested
in
campaigning
than
in
being
an
effective
leader.
A
caller
from
Kingston
asked
about
executive
orders
where
the
President
changes
laws
passed
by
Congress.
What
we
have
seen
by
this
President
is
he
uses
his
executive
orders
to
go
around
Congress.
If
the
President
doesn&#8217;t
agree
with
the
representatives,
he
just
goes
around
them.
We
can
see
the
effects
of
this
at
the
gas
pumps
and
in
our
energy
bills
and
the
economy.
We
can
see
that
this
President
is
a
very
good
politician
and
a
very
bad
leader.
A
Broken
Bow
caller
expressed
frustration
with
the
Obama
proposed
budget
cuts
to
the
U.S.
military.
Congressman
Lankford
agreed
with
the
caller
saying
the
Administration
is
trying
to
find
the
&#8220;simplest
way&#8221;
to
balance
the
budget
instead
of
going
after
wasteful
spending.
Tuesday&#8217;s
telephone
town
hall
is
the
second
such
forum
I've
held
this
year
and
my
eighth
since
taking
office.
These
town
halls
are
an
important
tool
for
us
to
stay
in
touch
with
the
district
and
to
remain
accountable
to
the
people
we
represent.
I
want
to
thank
each
and
every
one
of
you
that
participat ed .
Late
last
week
I
participated
in
a
veterans
roundtable
in
Muskogee
to
discuss
many
issues
facing
our
local
vets.
Our
veterans
have
sacrificed
so
much,
and
our
nation
should
ensure
we
fulfill
our
promises
to
them.
Water
Rights
Protecti on
Act
In
the
House
of
Representatives,
we passed
H.R.
3189--the
Water
Rights
Protection
Act--which
included
my
amendment
that
ensures
protections
for
the
water
rights
of
American
Indian
Tribes.
The
legislation
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
238-174.
H.R.
3189
provides
comprehensive
water
rights
protections
for
all
water
users,
and
ensures
certainty
to
the
water
supply
and
jobs
that
are
dependent
on
these
rights.
Under
the
act,
entities
are
protected
from
having
to
relinquish
their
privately-held
water
rights
in
order
to
receive
a
federal
permit,
lease
or
other
land
use
agreement.
My
amendment
also
ensures
that
the
Department
of
the
Interior
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
can&#8217;t
use
one
sided
permits,
license,
approvals,
and
other
land
management
tools
to
take
water
from
Indian
tribes
without
just compensation.
Many
tribes
rely
on
reserved
water
r igh ts
and
water
rights
guaranteed
by
treaties
to
provide
critical
water
supplies
for
their
people.
This
amendment
makes
clear
that
these
water
rights
are
fully
protected.
This
is
the
Federal
Register
(April
2011-Present),
printed
daily
by
the
GPO,
that
contains
rules
and
notices
from
Federal
agencies,
as
well
as
executive
orders-- just
a
snapshot
of
the
e xcessive
government
regulation
that kills
job
growth,
raises
prices,
and
is
an
overall
drag
on
our
economy.
This
amount
of
regulation
is
completely
unnecessary.
