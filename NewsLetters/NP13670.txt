ICYMI: Heller Voices Frustration with
the VA Backlog in Nevada
(Washington, D.C.)
Yesterday, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV)
spoke at the Committee on Veterans
Affairs hearing entitled VA Claims
System: Review of VA's Transformational
Progress.
Currently, 4,000 veterans in Reno, Las
Vegas, and across Nevada have waited on
average 433 days to have their VA claim
completed. This is the longest wait time in
the nation and is well over the VAs
targeted deadline of 125 days.

Remarks as prepared:
Thank you Chairman Sanders and Ranking
Member Burr for holding this hearing on the
claims process.
It is no secret that the veterans claims
backlog is the most critical mission facing
the Veterans Benefits Administration. Every
person is this room knows the seriousness
of this problem, but I specifically want to
underscore how this is affecting veterans
in Nevada.
4,000 veterans in Reno, Las Vegas, and
across Nevada have waited more than the
VAs target deadline of 125 days for
their claim to be completed. On
average, Nevada veterans waited 433 days to
have their claims completedthis is
the longest wait in the nation and it is
simply unacceptable.
Under Secretary Hickey, I know you are
committed to fixing this issue and
appreciate you recognizing the gravity of
this problem, but its important to
me and my constituents that I bring this
story to your attention.
A Las Vegas Veteran wrote to me
recently: I am just one more
Disabled Veteran still fighting the appeals
process with the VA. I understand now
that no one is going to expedite my appeal
and I will probably die before I get any
successful resolution, but there are huge
numbers of vets just like me and some in
worse shape. None of us deserve to be put
on hold forever.
FrustrationThat is what this
veteran and veterans across the nation are
feeling.
I, as well as my colleagues, want this
to be fixed for the good of our veterans,
theres no doubt about that. I
am proud to have teamed up with some of my
colleagues to thoroughly examine the claims
process front to back and from every
perspective.
The reality isVA has a 1945
process. This outdated process no longer
makes sense both for the VA and for the
Veteran.
Looking back at two decades of VA
backlog, I found that VA has always fixed
the problem with short-term solutions
rather than asking the difficult question
of whether the entire process needs to be
updated.
VA needs a 21st Century benefits
delivery system for our nations
Veterans. But there is not going to
be one silver bullet that solves this
problem.
It is going to take multiple proposals
that address multiple aspects of the claims
process for us to really reach a
resolution.
But that means its time that all
stakeholders open up about what needs to be
fixed and how to fix it.
The VA has a role to play. Veteran
Service Organizations and Congress have a
role to play. Even the Veterans
themselves have a part to play in resolving
this. And it no longer makes sense to
point fingers and place blame.
Instead, Congress needs to give the VA
and Regional Offices the tools and
resources they need to bring the backlog
down. But this cannot be done without
an open and frank discussion about
whats working and whats
not.
Congress needs to work together with the
VA and VSOs to solve this problem and solve
it permanently so that this Committee
isnt back here in a few years having
the same discussion.
I know that the Chairman and Ranking
Member are committed to that, and I will be
reaching out to them about solutions that
Ive identified.
Our nation owes it to Veterans to
resolve this problem together and keep our
promise to care for them when they return
home from war.
Thank you again, Under Secretary Hickey
for being here to testify. I look
forward to hearing about what progress VA
has made and working with you, VSOs, and
Veterans to end this backlog.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
