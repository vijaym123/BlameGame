WOTUS Rule
This week the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the final
rule on the waters of the United States (WOTUS).
After reviewing the
rule, I am extremely disappointed that President Obama and the EPA have
once again chosen to overregulate and ignore the concerns of
communities and families across the nation.
Multiple local organizations and small business groups, including many
in South Carolina, asked for the rule to be withdrawn, only to be
ignored by the EPA. Instead of trying to regulate private ponds and
ditches, maybe the administration should focus on jobs and economic
growth.
I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to stop this
EPA land grab and to ensure this Administration follows the true intent
of the Clean Water Act.
IRS Taxpayer Data Breach
We also found out that a data breach at the IRS exposed the personal
information of more than 100,000 taxpayers. While we are still in the
process of determining who perpetrated this data breach at the IRS and
what exact information they have stolen, what we do know is that it is
absolutely unacceptable that this vulnerability exists.
The amount of personal data the IRS has on hand, including social
security numbers, means that the agency must do everything possible to
ensure their systems are protected. This is especially egregious given
the numerous warnings the IRS has received from federal watchdogs that
its security systems are not capable of defending against online
thieves.
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance
Committee to address these matters, and ensure that taxpayers know
their personal information is safe.

WOTUS
Rule
This
week
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
released
the
final
rule
on
the
&#147;waters
of
the
United
States&#148;
(WOTUS).
After
reviewing
the
rule,
I
am
extremely
disappointed
that
President
Obama
and
the
EPA
have
once
again
chosen
to
overregulate
and
ignore
the
concerns
of
communities
and
families
across
the
nation.
Multiple
local
organizations
and
small
business
groups,
including
many
in
South
Carolina,
asked
for
the
rule
to
be
withdrawn,
only
to
be
ignored
by
the
EPA.
Instead
of
trying
to
regulate
private
ponds
and
ditches,
maybe
the
administration
should
focus
on
jobs
and
economic
growth.
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
stop
this
EPA
land
grab
and
to
ensure
this
Administration
follows
the
true
intent
of
the
Clean
Water
Act.
IRS
Taxpayer
Data
Breach
We
also
found
out
that
a
data
breach
at
the
IRS
exposed
the
personal

of
more
than
100,000
taxpayers.
While
we
are
still
in
the
process
of
determining
who
perpetrated
this
data
breach
at
the
IRS
and
what
exact
information
they
have
stolen,
what
we
do
know
is
that
it
is
absolutely
unacceptable
that
this
vulnerability
exists.
The
amount
of
personal
data
the
IRS
has
on

including
social
security
numbers,
means
that
the
agency
must
do
everything

This
is
especially

given
the
