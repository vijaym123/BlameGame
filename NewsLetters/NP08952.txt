Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. It is an honor
to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you this update on
our activities in the Second District and Washington, D.C.
Remembering D-Day
70 years ago Allied troops fearlessly stormed the beaches at Normandy,
setting forth on a mission to end tyranny and oppression in Europe.
Today we honor the soldiers who came together under that common goal.
To the heroes we lost and those still with us today-thank you.
President Reagan's Legacy
This week, on the 10th anniversary of President Reagan's passing, we
took time to remember his incredible leadership. His words continue to
serve as inspiration for many in this country, including myself.
"I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will
eventually triumph. And that there's purpose and worth to each and
every life." -- Pres. Ronald Reagan
District Work Week
This week, I was happy to be back home in Oklahoma's Second District
meeting with constituents and visiting with groups and organizations.
There's a lot of work to be done in Washington, but when traveling
around Oklahoma, I'm always humbly reminded of who I'm fighting for.
Here are pictures from just a few of my district visits and events.
On Wednesday, I spoke at the Muskogee Lions Club lunch.
We held a Community Banking Roundtable in Muskogee to share updates and
answer questions.
At the end of the week, I was at the Port of Catoosa with director Bob
Portiss discussing the key elements and impact of the Water Resources
Reform & Development Act on Oklahoma's economy.
Week Ahead
I'll be back in Washington next week for votes and other legislative
business.
There are many issues on the minds of Americans right now,
especially with recent developments regarding veterans care.
I'm
honored to represent fellow Oklahomans in the halls of Congress, and I
remain dedicated to ensuring our voices are heard as we address the
challenges facing our nation.
