Dear Friends,
Small
businesses have always been the engine of South Floridas economy.
Recently, I had the privilege of visiting several new and exciting business
accelerators and incubators that will help make our community even
more competitive in this globalized economy. Tucked away in Wynwood and
Downtown Miami, these unique places are changing the way we think
about innovation and ways to attract investment to our
community.
One location in Wynwood is an active place filled with over 160
members, is helping create a united culture of innovation in a space
where young (or young at heart) minds are working to shape their
industries. From upstart radio stations to tech-focused law firms and
everything in between, it is an international destination attracting talent to
South Florida and featuring members from Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico,
the United Kingdom, and other countries. Finally, its more than 212
learning experiences set an example by working to further the collective
knowledge of its members so that our community can benefit from the
sparks of innovation coming from this group.
Another
business accelerator in our community teams with businesses looking to
take the necessary next step for growth in South Florida. Its diverse
offerings, including housing 31 companies from 18 countries, serve as
a business accelerator for those with an established business,
training for college students who need to learn how to implement their ideas,
and for high school students who are just being introduced to what it
means to innovate and think critically. Its partnership with
Miami-Dade County Public Schools, where high school students spend some of
their day learning there as part of their education, is a particular
source of pride and will surely pay dividends in years to
come.
South Florida is lucky to have places that work to create and
innovate. We should continue to encourage those who wish to diversify our
economy and make our community a better place to live. Our community
should be second to none in any sector and with the necessary leadership,
South Florida will be a serious name in technological innovation soon
enough.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
