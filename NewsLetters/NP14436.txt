Today, on Veterans Day, we pay
tribute to those brave men and women who have served our nation in uniform.
We also honor the enduring service of our soldiers, sailors, airmen,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen.
Whether during peacetime or war,
at home or abroad, their service has been characterized by selflessness
and a sense of greater purpose.
Every year, just before
Veterans Day, the city of Kuna holds a Veterans Assembly in which the
entire community comes together to honor their local veterans.
This year, I had the privilege of attending this wonderful event, in
which over 1,500 people showed up.
The entire high school was there,
as were many residents of the Boise Veterans Home.
It was humbling to meet true American heroes whose courage and
compassion was clear for all to see.
It was inspiring to watch young
patriots wave flags and read poems to the veterans, thanking them for
their service.
The veterans, in turn, seemed energized by the
young leaders of tomorrow.
They could tell that the future of our
country is in good hands.
Very rarely do the
generations blend together in such a powerful way.
Thats what made the
Kuna event special.
It was the very definition of what a Veterans
Day event should be.
In my keynote speech, I noted that
America is the Land of the Free because we truly are the Home of the
Brave.
We are the home of brave service men and women who, over
the course of centuries, have answered the call of duty with dignity
and honor.
On so many battlefields, over so many
generations, they have showed the true measure of American character.
Whether they fought on the beaches of Normandy, or the skies over Midway,
or through the mountains of Afghanistan
they have protected our
nation and advanced the cause of freedom.
That is something we must
never take for granted.
President Reagan once said,
Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We
didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for,
protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will
spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children
what it was once like in the United States where men were
free.
Those who served our nation in uniform understand those words
instinctively.
They didnt need to read it in some
textbook.
They didnt need some politician to tell them.
They felt it in
their bones.
And what they did with that feeling was
turn it into action.
For them, it became a way of life.
A
life they chose to live.
And for making that choice, we are
eternally grateful.
We must also recognize that when a service
member joins the military, its not just a job; its a family
commitment to our country.
For each deployed service member, there is
often a wife or a husband left behind.
These silent patriots
kiss their loved ones goodbye, and send them far from home, often in
harms way.
They run their households.
And they raise
their children.
And they do it without knowing if their loving
partner will ever return.
Whatever accolades we bestow upon our
service members and veterans, we must also bestow upon their families.
America owes them so much.
In the nineteenth century, the
French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville traveled all across America
to research his book,
Democracy in America.
And in that
book, Tocqueville declared, America is great because she is
good.
And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be
great.
I saw greatness in Kuna on Friday.
And thats
because I also saw goodness.
I am so proud of our military
men and women in Idaho.
And I am humbled by the opportunity they
have given me
and all Americans: The opportunity to live peacefully
in the greatest country in the world.
And the greatest country
that will ever be.
May we remember our veterans
and all
that theyve given us not just on Veterans Day, but
every
day.
May God bless them, and may God
continue
to
bless America.
