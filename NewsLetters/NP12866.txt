Rubio Goes On Official Visit To
Asia
Marco spent
Monday
and
Tuesday
in Japan, where he met with U.S.
officials and foreign leaders in the region
to discuss critical economic and security
issues. He also appeared on
CNBC Asia
to discuss the relationship between
Americas foreign policy and
Asias economy.
On Wednesday, Marco began his trip to
the Philippines by visiting
Tacloban
, a city recently devastated by Typhoon
Haiyan. While there, he reviewed ongoing
recovery efforts and was briefed by
government officials and non-governmental
organizations on the ground.
It was painful to see the
devastation in Tacloban and hear the
tragic stories of people there. But I
also saw encouraging evidence of
Filipinos who are determined to rebuild
their lives and country,
said Rubio . The United
States has an indispensable role to play
in these recovery efforts by providing
humanitarian and military assistance,
including several of our men and women in
uniform who I was honored to meet
today.
Our friends in the Philippines
are resilient and strong, but they need
our continued support,
Rubio added . The United
States must remain strongly engaged in
helping the Filipino get back on their
feet.
Marco returned to
Manila
where he met with government
officials, including President Benigno
Aquino III, Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Albert del Rosario and Congressman Manny
Pacquiao, to discuss economic and security
issues.
He spent
Thursday
in South Korea meeting with U.S.
troops and senior government officials.
Marco also visited the
Korean
De-militarized Zone
(DMZ), a strip of land dividing South
Korea and the threatening North Korea,
where he was briefed on security
issues.
There are few places in the
world where the stark differences between
two neighboring countries is as evident
as the line that divides the Korean
peninsula,
said Rubio . As one soldier
patrolling the DMZ told us, it is the
edge of freedom.
I believe some day in my
lifetime that edge will no longer exist
and North Koreas people will live
freely,
Rubio added . Coming face to
face with agents of a repressive and
paranoid communist regime was a reminder
to me of how important it is that we not
only stand with our South Korean allies
but also remember the innocents in North
Korea whose lives are being
destroyed.
On Friday, he delivered a
foreign policy
speech
that addressed the importance of a
constructive and lasting partnership
between the U.S. and South Korea, while
articulating the value of free trade and
democracy throughout the region. Marco
talked about the emotional experience of
visiting the DMZ in his
closing
remarks
.
During the week, Marco met with
human rights
activists
, including Shin Dong-hyuk, the only
known person to have been born in a North
Korean prison camp, spent his entire life
imprisoned, escaped and lived to tell the
story. On Marcos final day in Asia,
he met with South Korean
President Park
Geun-hye
, among other governmental officials,
to discuss economic and security concerns
in the region.

Constituent Casework Corner
Karl, a veteran and federal retiree
residing in South Florida contacted Senator
Rubio for assistance. He reached out to the
Defense Finance and Accounting Service
(DFAS) to suspend his military retiree pay
so he could receive a greater monthly
benefit through the payment of his civil
service annuity from the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM). However, DFAS
did not suspend payment in a timely manner
and Karl was overpaid $11,539.08.
When notified, Karl repaid DFAS the entire
amount but in the interim, DFAS initiated a
request to garnish his benefits from OPM. A
caseworker contacted DFAS and OPM to
resolve the issue. After several
communications, the accounts were adjusted
and Karl was repaid the $2,000 that DFAS
erroneously garnished.
