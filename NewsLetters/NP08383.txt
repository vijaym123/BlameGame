EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW
Dear Friend,
Voting is an essential and fundamental right of every American and this
week marks two important dates in voting rights history. It was fifty
years ago, in the summer of 1964, that the landmark Civil Rights Act
was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, outlawing
discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
In addition, this past Wednesday marked one year since the Supreme
Court's Shelby County v. Holder decision, which struck down Section 4
of the Voting Rights Act. This section required certain states to
obtain prior federal approval to change voting laws because of their
history of racial discrimination.
This decision was a tremendous step backwards in our nation's
continuing efforts to protect the ability of every American to exercise
their right to vote. This is why I am proud to have cosponsored the
bipartisan Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014
to establish a new formula to determine whether
any state or locality, not just those with a history of racial
discrimination, should be required to get federal approval before
making changes to voting rules and practices.
This past Tuesday, I attended a ceremony in the Capitol rotunda with my
colleagues to both celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights
Act and to posthumously honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his wife,
Coretta, with the Congressional Gold Medal
. Their
tireless efforts, and the efforts of so many Americans, built a more
just America, though we must do more to ensure equality for all.
InCongress, I have consistently supported efforts to advance workplace
and social equality and will continue to fight for the civil rights of
all Americans. As always, it is an honor to represent you in Congress.

Gold Medal Ceremony in the US Capitol

EQUAL
JUSTICE
UNDER
LAW
Dear
Friend,
Voting
is
an
essential
and
fundamental
right
of
every
American
and
this
week
marks
two
important
dates
in
voting
rights
history.
It
was
fifty
years
ago,
in
the
summer
of
1964,
that
the
landmark
Civil
Rights
Act
was
signed
into
law
by
President
Lyndon
B.
Johnson,
outlawing
discrimination
based
on
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
In
addition,
this
past
Wednesday
marked
one
year
since
the
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
Shelby
County
v.
Holder
decision,
which
struck
down
Section
4
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act .
This
section
required
certain
states
to
obtain
prior
federal
approval
to
change
voting
laws
because
of
their
history
of
racial
discrimination.
This
decision
was
a
tremendous
step
backwards
in
our
nation&#8217;s
continuing
efforts
to
protect
the
ability
of
every
American
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote.
This
is
why
I
am
proud
to
have
cosponsored
the
bipartisan
Voting
Rights
Amendment
Act
of
2014
to
establish
a
new
formula
to
determine
whether
any
state
or
locality,
not
just
those
with
a
history
of
racial
discrimination,
should
be
required
to
get
federal
approval
before
making
changes
to
voting
rules
and
practices.
This
past
Tuesday,
I
attended
a
ceremony
in
the
Capitol
rotunda
with
my
colleagues
to
both
celebrate
the
50th
Anniversary
of
the
Civil
Rights
Act
and
to
posthumously
honor
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
and
his
wife,
Coretta,
with
the
Congressional
Gold
Medal .
Their
tireless
efforts,
and
the
efforts
of
so
many
Americans,
built
a
more
just
America,
though
we
must
do
more
to
ensure
equality
for
all.
InCongress,
I
have
consistently
supported
efforts
to
advance
workplace
and
social
equality
and
will
continue
to
fight
for
the
civil
rights
of
all
Americans.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
Congress.
