Dear Friends,
For many Delawareans, Memorial Day kicks off the start of the summer
season with sun-filled, fun festivities. Whether youre enjoying the
First States pristine beaches or celebrating with a barbeque in the
backyard, I want to wish you and your family a safe and special
Memorial Day. However, I also want to share this message with you, in
hopes that you take a moment or two to remember the true meaning of
this day.
Every year, Memorial Day is an important opportunity for Americans to
reflect and show our deepest appreciation for the men and women who
made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. On this day
and
every day
we should think of them. We should also continue to honor
the veterans who served and continue to serve today. Our brave veterans
are living testaments to the sacrifices our servicemen and women have
made for generations and continue to make for us each and every day.
This Memorial Day, please join me in saying Thank you to both our
fallen warriors and to our veterans still with us today.
Have a great Memorial Day,

Dear
Friends,
For
many
Delawareans,
Memorial
Day
kicks
off
the
start
of
the
summer
season
with
sun-filled,
fun
festivities.
Whether
you&#146;re
enjoying
the
First
State&#146;s
pristine
beaches
or
celebrating
with
a
barbeque
in
the
backyard,
I
want
to
wish
you
and
your
family
a
safe
and
special
Memorial
Day.
However,
I
also
want
to
share
this
message
with
you,
in
hopes
that
you
take
a
moment
or
two
to
remember
the
true
meaning
of
this
day.
Every
year,
Memorial
Day
is
an
important
opportunity
for
Americans
to
reflect
and
show
our
deepest
appreciation
for
the
men
and
women
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
in
defense
of
our
nation.
On
this
day
&#150;
and
every
day
&#150;
we
should
think
of
them.
We
should
also
continue
to
honor
the
veterans
who
served
and
continue
to
serve
today.
Our
brave
veterans
are
living
testaments
to
the
