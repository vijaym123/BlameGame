Yes! This IS a fundraising email.
I&rsquo;m emailing you again (and again and again and again) because our race is a TOSSUP.
There&rsquo;s only 44 days left and a new report says Republican outside groups have spent more money against me than any other House race in the Midwest. Lucky me! So my request to you is simple:
pitch in a few dollars help us break the tie.
Thanks,
Brad
