Congress on Your Corner - Saturday, May 9, 2015
Dear Friends,
As your Congressman, I welcome every possibility to connect with constituents. Congress on Your Corner events offer the opportunity for 33 rd
District residents to share your concerns with me and to discuss how I can best serve you in our nations capital.
Join me next Saturday, May 9 at 11 am at the Eastside YMCA for my May Congress on your Corner event. The Eastside YMCA is located at 1500 Sandy Ln, Fort Worth, TX 76112.
I look forward to discussing what is important to DFW Metroplex residents.
In the meantime, I hope that you will stay connected with me through my official website, Facebook page, and Twitter account. To learn more about Congress on your Corner and other events I will host in the DFW Metroplex, sign up to receive my e-mails.
