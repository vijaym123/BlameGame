Friends,
As your Representative, its a priority of
mine to build relationships across the aisle and find pragmatic
solutions to the problems facing our nation.
Now - more than ever
our families, our students, our workers and our veterans need real
solutions. You deserve solutions to help create jobs, build a healthy
economy, provide more opportunity and ensure access to quality health
care. Ive had a busy week in Congress, and we have made good progress
to pass bipartisan solutions that you and your neighbors desperately
need.
Im proud to announce that two of my bills
the
Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial
Counseling
(H.R. 4984)
and the
Gerardo Hernandez
Airport Security Act of 2014
(H.R. 4802)
- passed the U.S.
House of
Representatives.
Its not often you see Congress and
the President work together, but this week the President finally signed
a bill to invest in our workforce and take steps to solve the jobs
crisis in our country. The
Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act
(H.R. 803)
was signed into law to
consolidate and streamline workforce development programs, protect taxpayer
dollars and ensure that workers have the skills they need to get the jobs
that are out there. As a cosponsor of the House-passed version, the
Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills
(SKILLS)
Act, I was invited by the White House to attend the bill signing
ceremony. While theres still work to be done, Im pleased to see these
commonsense reforms finally cross the finish line, and
I will
continue working with my colleagues to help North Carolinians get back to
work.
A good education is the key to opportunity and jobs in our
country.
As the son of a teacher, I know the importance of
education, and I remain committed to making higher education more
accessible to our students.
Right now, the skyrocketing cost of
tuition is a major problem in our country that prohibits many students
from pursuing higher education and forces others to rely on borrowing
money to achieve their dreams.
Combined with the bleak job
prospects recent college graduates face, many of these students do not
realize the financial commitment they are undertaking and its impact on
their future . This week, the House passed a bipartisan bill I
offered with Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie and Democrat Rep. Suzanne
Bonamicithe
Empowering Students through Enhanced
Financial Counseling Act to help ensure that student borrowers
and parents receive interactive counseling each year to empower them
to make smart decisions about their financial
future.
Counseling is
already required before students can receive their first federal loan, but a
survey of current students and recent graduates with a high level of
student loan debt found that more than 40 percent could not recall
having received financial counseling. This is unacceptable, and our
current policies are failing to equip our students with the tools needed to
make wise financial decisions.
As a result, many of our
students graduate unable to manage their loans, leading to significant
hardships for borrowers and a bigger risk for taxpayers.
With the
national unemployment rate for young Americans at 13.2%, it is
imperative that we help our students make sound financial decisions that
will greatly impact their
future.
I ran for Congress because I was fed up
with Washingtons inability to get things done. Every day, you hear about
another politician who refuses to work with someone because of what
side of the aisle they stand on. As your Representative,
I will
never compromise my conservative principles, but I will continue to
reach across the aisle to work with my colleagues on areas where we can
find common ground and put you, your family and your priorities
first.
Until next
week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
Rep. Hudson Honors our
Veterans
I spoke from the House floor in support of
The Honor Flight Act
(H.R. 4812), a bill to improve airport screening processes for
veterans traveling to visit their war
memorials.

I had an informative tour of the
Fayetteville VA Medical Center this week. It was truly an honor to
meet a Vietnam war hero and thank him for his service. Our patriots
upheld their commitment to serve our country and we owe it to them
to uphold our commitment to care for them
during and after their
service.
