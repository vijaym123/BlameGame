$32.5 million NMI SNAP pilot program is now U.S. law - President Obama signed the Agricultural Act of 2014
this afternoon, providing $32.5 m. for the Northern Mariana Islands food stamp program. $2 million will be used to study whether the Commonwealth can administer the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. Then, beginning in October 2015, $30.5 m. will be available to raise benefits for families in need in our islands - whether we are part of SNAP or not. I am most grateful to everyone in Congress who helped me reach this important milestone in my effort to fight hunger in the Northern Marianas.
In addition, the Agricultural Act reauthorizes programs that support rural communities like ours, paying for new DPS police cars, helping farmers with the cost of seed and fertilizer, and supporting local businesses moving to solar power. I look forward to working with both the private and public sector to get everything we can from these programs and particularly with Northern Marianas College, which is a center for farm and food policy in our islands.

Students from the Saipan Southern High School National Honor Society came to their congressional office this week, after attending the 2014 Leadership Experience and Development (LEAD) conference in Washington. Conferees learned skills they will need to lead our community in the future. We provided the group with tours of the U.S. Capitol and the White House.

Congratulations! NMC show-cause lifted, accreditation reaffirmed - The Northern Marianas College announced on Friday that it has been removed from show-cause status and its accreditation has been reaffirmed. College President Sharon Hart received word from the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges and immediately shared the good news with the community. Congratulations to everyone who worked over the years to make this success possible, including the President and members of the Board of Regents, faculty, and staff, and-above all-the students of NMC. It took hard work and an unshakeable belief in the importance of education in the Northern Marianas to get the College back on track with full accreditation restored. Community colleges throughout America are a vital link between people of all ages and jobs. I look forward to continuing to work in Congress to support community colleges and their students and to ensure that NMC and its students have the same opportunities that are available anywhere else in America.
Equity sought for those on Medicare Part D drug plan - Low-income seniors who are enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan receive extra help from the federal government to pay their premium - unless they live in a U.S. territory. To address this disparity Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi has authored the Territories Medicare Prescription Drug Equity Act, H.R. 3966 , and I have signed on as an original co-sponsor. There are 518 Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the Northern Mariana Islands at present. It is not known how many of those people would have incomes low enough to qualify for a federal subsidy on their drug plan. But, even if the change in the law only helps a few, people in the Northern Marianas and the U.S. territories should receive the same benefits as other Americans. That is the aim of H.R. 3966.

How much time is needed to rebuild stocks after overfishing was a hot topic, as the Natural Resources Committee considered reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act on Tuesday. Several witnesses argued that Magnuson is too rigid when it comes to rebuilding times. But I pointed out that current programs have timelines that range from 4 to 100 years to allow for differences in fish biology or environmental conditions. Sam Rauch, Deputy Assistant Administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service, agreed with me that there is considerable flexibility already built into Magnuson's requirements and added that the law also allows NOAA to revise rebuilding plans as new scientific information becomes available.
Natural Resource Democrats press for additional hearing on fisheries management - Invoking House Rule XI , which guarantees minority members of a committee the right to call witnesses, 11 of my Natural Resources Committee colleagues and I have written to Chairman Doc Hastings requesting further hearings on reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. In November the Hawai'i/Pacific insular areas representatives asked that the Committee take testimony
from witnesses specifically on the Western and Central Pacific Ocean fisheries, but of 38 witnesses heard so far on reauthorization of Magnuson none has represented the interests of our oceans and fisheries. Given the unique relationship that we island people have with the sea and given the importance of fishing to our traditional way of life and present-day subsistence, we cannot allow the Republican majority to overlook us. The Magnuson Stevens Act established the Western Pacific and seven other regional councils to regulate fishing and make sure that the resource is maintained for our children and those who come after.
CUC data shows more toxic chemicals released in the NMI - Previously unavailable data from the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation increased the total of toxic chemicals released in the Northern Mariana Islands in 2012 to 79,469 pounds. That is the third lowest in the nation, but much higher than the 3,224 pounds reported in 2011. The Environmental Protection Agency released the 2012 Toxic Release Inventory for the NMI this week. The utility and other producers of toxic chemicals linked to cancer or other human health effects, such as sulfuric acid and ethylbenzene, submit annual reports to the EPA and the CNMI Division of Environmental Quality. EPA compiles and publishes the data to support emergency planning and to keep the public informed. Release data alone are not sufficient to determine exposure or to calculate potential risks to human health and the environment. Nationwide, the release of toxic chemicals decreased 12 percent from 2011 to 2012. For more details, see the NMI fact sheet at www.epa.gov/region9/tri/12/tri-2012-cnmi-report.pdf .
$17,500 grant awarded for DPH Sexual Violence Prevention Education Grant Program - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has awarded $17,500 to the CNMI Sexual Violence Prevention Education Grant Program. Funds will be used to develop and evaluate new methods, existing methods, and techniques used in injury surveillance by public health agencies; and to develop, expand, or improve injury control programs. Congratulations to the Department of Public Health.
