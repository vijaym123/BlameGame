Update from Senator Bob Corker

It
Will Be "Unprecedented" if NLRB Overturns Decision of Volkswagen
Workers

Appearing on Fox News
Channels Fox &amp; Friends
to discuss Volkswagen Chattanooga
workers recent vote against representation by the United Auto Workers
(UAW) union, Senator Corker said it would be unprecedented if the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturns the decision of employees
at the plant due to comments by elected officials.
The
workers realized that there was just nothing the UAW had to offer. They
were there because of money. They were there because of dues. [The
employees] already made more than what UAW workers in other plants with
the same length of service were making, said Corker. Now the UAW is
appealing saying we interfered somehow by sharing concerns with our
community. It will be unprecedented if the National Labor Relations Board
overrules for that reason.
The senator went on to discuss
the double standard he and other Republican elected officials are
being held to, noting that President Obama weighed in on behalf of the
UAW during the three-day voting period.
The president
weighed in during the election process also, said Corker. For me to
express concerns about what it would mean to our community and our state
over time is something that I think people elect me to do. This is an
interesting case. Hopefully
even though this is [President] Obamas
NLRB, these are his appointees
hopefully they will do the right thing
here and not try to muzzle people who are elected by people in their
state.
On Tuesday, Corker penned an
op-ed
in The Wall Street Journal warning of the high stakes of the
upcoming NLRB ruling on an appeal filed by the UAW. The National Labor
Relations Board soon will have to decide whether to follow years of
precedent and let the vote of the workers standor whether it will try to
muzzle elected officials and prevent them from weighing in on issues of
critical importance to the communities they represent, possibly
because the members of the NLRB did not like the outcome of a vote by
workers. The nation will be watching this ruling closely, wrote Corker.

President Obamas Budget Not
Serious
Senator Corker released the following
statement regarding the presidents Fiscal Year 2015 budget proposal,
which was released on Tuesday:
I think everyone understands
that this budget proposal is not a serious document and will have no
effect on policy. Unfortunately, the administration continues to be
unwilling to deal with the critical issue of putting our fiscal house in
order, said Corker.
The presidents budget proposal
includes $56 billion in new spending this year and $791 billion in spending
increases over the next decade, paid for with tax hikes on Americans.
Last year, Corker and Senator Lamar Alexander introduced the Fiscal
Sustainability Act, S. 11, to reduce the growth of entitlement spending
(Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) by nearly $1 trillion in the
next decade in order to improve the programs solvency. The bill
incorporates many of the recommendations made by President Obamas Debt
Commission (Simpson-Bowles) as well as by former Republican Senator Pete
Domenici and Alice Rivlin, budget director for former President
Clinton.

At a
hearing
on Thursday that included testimony from Obama administration
officials on the U.S. response to the crisis in Ukraine, Senator
Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the
U.S. needs a unified and very strong reaction to Russias military
intervention in Crimea over a long time. Corker continues to work
with Chairman Robert Menendez on bipartisan legislation that will
support Ukraines political and economic transition and impose consequences
for threats to Ukraines sovereignty and territory.
I
dont know that we could say that Russia would not have done what it did
in Ukraine with a different approach, but I think that theres a
permissive environment that we have created through this reset
thinking
that someone like Putin reacts to warmth and charm and reach out when
what he really reacts to is weakness, and I think he has seen that in
our foreign policy efforts over the course of this last year, said
Corker during the committee hearing.
Im thankful today
thatthere are some steps that are being taken, added Corker. We stand
ready to enable the administration to act even more forcefully. I could
not be more disappointed that we are where we are. I think our
credibility very muchis on the line, and I do think that us having a unified
and very strong reaction and approach over a long timeis very
important relative to Russia right now.
