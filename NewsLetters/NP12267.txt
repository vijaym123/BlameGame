Greetings,
In January, President Obama delivered the State of the Union (SOTU)
Address to the country. He put forward a renewed call for economic
growth, job creation, and greater opportunity for all Americans, which
I welcomed.
Unfortunately, his record over the past five years offers
every indication the President remains unwilling to work across the
aisle to achieve these ends.
Despite his appeal for new spending restraints, the President has
fought against House-led efforts to balance the budget. Despite his
call for more jobs, the President has fought House-led efforts to take
action on job-creating initiatives such as completion of the Keystone
XL Pipeline project.
Despite assurances from the President that he is
working to repair the damage being done to the economy by his health
care law, his Administration has fought against House-led efforts to
replace the law with reforms that actually lower costs and expand
access for American families.
While Washington can seem broken at times, I remain committed to
working on your behalf to advancing solutions to the challenges we face
as a country. The purpose of this newsletter is to offer you an update
on this work and a snapshot of legislative and constituent service
accomplishments over the past year.
We've made some good progress in the halls of Congress and across the
5th District, working on behalf of individuals, families, businesses,
seniors, veterans, and those with disabilities. Until we cross paths
again, I hope you find this update helpful and informative.
Sincerely,
Congressman Glenn 'GT' Thompson
Constituent Service...

Constituent Casework: The most rewarding part of serving the people of
the 5th District is being able to help individuals and families. From
accessing a federal agency like the Social Security Administration to
navigating the often complicated process of applying for grant funding,
my office prides itself on offering the best possible constituent
services. During 2013, our office managed 968 cases throughout the year.
*	Casework County-by-County: The following is a breakdown of the
work handled by our office county-by-county:
Cameron- 12; Centre -
176; Clearfield- 84; Clinton - 72; Clarion - 32; Crawford - 30; Elk -
34; Erie - 75; Forest - 14; Huntingdon - 36; Jefferson- 78; McKean -
41; Potter - 28; Tioga - 3; Venango - 48; Warren - 61.
Picture above: Thompson working on constituent casework.
Casework Issue-by-Issue:
*	Active Duty Personnel: Our office helped 105 constituents with
Defense related issues. Success stories include working with the
Defense Finance and Accounting Services agency to help active duty
personnel resolve payment errors, obtain wage statements, and expedite
discharge resolutions.
*	Veterans Affairs: Our office helped 208 constituents with
Veterans Affairs issues. Success stories include working with the
National Personnel Records Center to help Veterans, widows and family
of veterans obtain certified copies of military records so that
individuals and families may apply for veterans benefits.
*	Social Security: Our office helped 247 constituents with Social
Security related issues. Notable success stories include our office
working with the Social Security Administration to help a constituent
who was critically ill with End Stage Renal Disease receive disability
benefits that were wrongfully terminated.
Constituent Correspondence: Our office places a top priority on
answering constituents' questions and concerns about pending federal
legislation, thoughts on current issues, or my work in particular
policy areas.
*	Correspondence County-by-County: During 2013, our office
responded to 72,189 constituent letters and emails. The following is a
breakdown county-by-county:
Cameron-546; Centre-19,706; Clarion-2,683;
Clearfield-6,077; Clinton- 2,468; Crawford-916; Elk-2,554; Erie-7,887;
Forest-617; Huntingdon-2,290; Jefferson-4,133; McKean-4,101;
Potter-1,841; Tioga-1,528; Venango-4,795; Warren-3,383.
Constituent Outreach: As you may know, the 5th District spans 16
counties and over 10,711 square miles, and covers 23.3 percent of
Pennsylvania's total land mass. To put this in perspective, the 5th is
larger than the land mass of nine states. For this reason, travel is
absolutely critical for me and the office staff as part of outreach to
communities.
*	Outreach By The Numbers: During 2013, I traveled 33,432 miles
to towns and municipalities across the 5th District. While not in
Washington, I spent 109 days traveling on 287 trips to all 16 counties.
Our office staff traveled on 1,030 trips to all 16 counties in 2013. We
held over 100 constituent office hours in locations across the 5th
District.
Legislative Work...
_____
Ending Washington's Habit of Spending Beyond Our Means: Passing a
budget is something Washington has been incapable of achieving for too
long, which is one reason why our national debt is 18 trillion dollars
and growing.
*	First Bipartisan Budget in 27 Years: In December of 2013, the
House and Senate passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (H.J.Res.59),
which represents the first bipartisan budget produced by a divided
Congress in 27 years. The bill prevented the Senate's push for new tax
and spending increases and continued my commitment to deficit
reduction. This is a notable shift, especially given the Senate has
failed to even consider its own budget for the past 4 years.
I'm proud
to say the House has considered and passed a budget for the last 4
consecutive years.
Leading on Job Creation, Economic Growth: Agriculture is a bright spot
for Pennsylvania's economy. The industry supports close to 100,000
farmers and hundreds of thousands of job in the Commonwealth, and over
16 million jobs nationally. For the past two terms, the House
Agriculture Committee has been working to reauthorize the Farm Bill,
which governs our nation's agriculture programs.
*	Most Significant Reforms To Agriculture Programs in Decades: On
February 7, 2014, the President signed into law a new Farm Bill, which
represents the most significant reforms to agriculture programs in
decades.
As a Subcommittee Chairman on the House Agriculture
Committee, I am proud of the hard work put forward by members from both
parties. This bill is proof that when Congress works hard to build
consensus, we can find ways to improve the economy, but at the same
time, reform government and reduce spending.
*	Farm Bill Support Job Growth, Deficit Reduction: This bill
supports job growth while reducing our deficits and improving key
programs that support our family farms, foresters, agribusinesses, and
the host of industries that are related to Pennsylvania's number one
industry, agriculture. The farm bill also includes the Forest Products
Fairness Act, which I introduced. This measure will open new market
opportunities for forestry producers and help to promote healthy, well
managed forests. Overall, the Farm Bill reduces deficits by $16.6
billion over 10 years.
Leading on Education: Working to ensure access to high quality and
affordable education for more students, including those in our rural
communities, has been a fundamental priority of mine in Congress.
During the past year, I continued this fight.
*	Named National Education Policymaker of the Year:
On March 6,
2013, I had the honor of being named the National Policymaker of the
Year by the National Association for Career and Technical Education
(ACTE). The award is presented annually to a federal lawmaker who has
made a significant impact on policy related to career and technical
education programs. For the past two terms, I have served as the
Co-Chairman of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education (CTE)
Caucus. My fellow Co-Chairman, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-RI), was the other
policymaker to receive this award for 2013.
*	Education Reforms Advance: On July 19, 2013, the House passed
H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, which would reform and reauthorize the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child
Left Behind (NCLB). The bill included language based on a bill I
introduced, "The Education for Tomorrow's Jobs Act," which would
provide new flexibility for school districts to integrate academic and
technical instruction, and encourage the creation of educational
partnerships among school districts, institutes of higher education,
local industry, and other stakeholders.
Picture above: Thompson meets with students from Penn State University.
Legislative Work Continued...
Supporting Our Men And Women in Uniform: Our military must remain
strong and adequately equipped, in order to enforce the peace. My
promise is to serve and advocate for those who serve this country in
uniform - both during and following service.
*
Military Transition Support Amendment Signed into Law: On
December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law the 2014 National
Defense Authorization Act. The bill included an amendment I introduced
that will expand and improve the Transitional Assistance Management
Program (TAMP).
TAMP offers health care coverage for service members
transitioning into civilian life. The amendment extends TAMP by an
additional 180 days for all services rendered through telemedicine, to
ensure that coverage is available for those with Post Traumatic Stress,
the symptoms of which often do not appear until 8 to 10 months
following deployment. The amendment builds on the 2011 STEP Act, a bill
I sponsored, now Public Law 112-81, Section 713, which expanded service
member health care services and the use of telemedicine at the
Department of Defense. (Click here
).
*
Military Community Praises Thompson STEP Law: From the Stars &
Stripes Military Newspaper: "The Defense Department is in the process
of implementing the Service member Telemedicine eHealth Portability Act
(STEP), which will make it easier for service members to get more
virtual medical care, particularly mental health counseling. The act
cuts through legal red tape and allows DOD-contracted healthcare
providers to treat patients in other states and countries.Rep. Glenn
Thompson, R-Pa., father of an Army staff sergeant deployed in
Afghanistan, sponsored the bill.The STEP Act will increase the number
of doctors and counselors available to active-duty service members,
when the military's dense medical manual is changed to reflect the new
law." (Stars & Stripes Newspaper
4/26/2013)
The President's Health Care Law: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is
weighing heavy on the minds of Americans, including so many across the
5th District.
The law's estimated $1.5 trillion in new spending is
unsustainable and its burdensome new regulatory regime of mandates and
taxes is harming families and small businesses. I have voted to fully
repeal the ACA and have advocated for reforms that actually lower cost
and expand access. In the meantime, we have a responsibility to prevent
even more economic harm from being imposed upon hard working Americans.
*
Protecting Americans from the ACA: Although the Healthcare.gov
website launch was a severe disappointment, an even greater concern has
been expressed regarding the website's security vulnerabilities -
including the security of personal and medical information.
Unfortunately, it has become very clear that the rushed implementation
of the launch has affected the site's ability to perform on both
accounts. For this reason, in early January, the House passed H.R.
3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, to ensure that
individuals are notified if their personal information has been
compromised through the website. Despite the Obama administration's
vocal opposition to the effort to boost transparency and consumer
protections, a veto-proof majority of Republicans and Democrats voted,
291-122, to pass H.R. 3811.
*
Protecting our Volunteer Firefighters: Under the ACA's employer
mandate, volunteer organizations with 50 or more employees could be
forced to provide health insurance or pay penalties, which could
potentially devastate these organizations. On December 11, 2013, I
joined with fellow House colleagues in introducing the Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act
(H.R. 3685), which will ensure
that emergency services volunteers are not counted as full-time
employees under the ACA's employer mandate. As a result of these
efforts, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently announced they
will not treat volunteer firefighters as employees under the ACA, which
is a huge win for these local volunteer organizations and the
populations they protect.
Energy Security:
Since the early seventies our country has been
spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on energy imports to
fulfill our energy needs - money that could otherwise be used to invest
in our kids and pay down the debt. It's time for us to get serious
about ending our reliance on foreign sources of energy, which begins by
developing more energy here at home. Over the past year, I've advanced
these principles.
*	Expanding Domestic Energy Resources: The Republican-led House
has kept its focus on promoting energy policies that lower energy
costs, grow jobs, and increase our energy security. Most recently, in
November, the House acted on a package of bills that will expand
domestic energy production, improve energy transport, and ultimately
increase energy affordability for consumers and American families
across the country (Click here
to learn more).
American Competitiveness: The recent economic downturn is a reminder of
how critically important education and job training opportunities are
to students and workers in an increasingly competitive global economy.
That's why I have worked to strengthen and expand our skilled
workforce, in order to preserve our nation's technical job base and
remain globally competitive.
*	Supporting Our Skilled Workforce: The President in his 2012
SOTU Address called for an overhaul of the nation's workforce and
investment programs. During the past year, the U.S. House passed
legislation
known as the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in
Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act, which would to reauthorize the Workforce
Investment Act (WIA). The Senate has failed to act on this critical
bill that supports job training and a strong American workforce. As a
member of the House Education Committee and Co-Chairman of the CTE
Caucus, I will continue my push to strengthen our workforce training
programs.

Constituent Outreach :
As
you
may
know,
the
5th
District
spans
16
counties
and
over
10,711
square
miles,
and
covers
23.3
percent
of
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
total
land
mass.
To
put
this
in
perspective,
the
5th
is
larger
than
the
land
mass
of
nine
states.
For
this
reason,
travel
is
absolutely
critical
for
me
and
the
office
staff
as
part
of
outreach
to
communities.
Outreach By
The
Numbers:
During
2013,
I
traveled
33,432
miles
to
towns
and
municipalities
across
the
5th
District.
While
not
in
Washington,
I
spent
109
days
traveling
on
287
trips
to
all
16
counties.
Our
o ffice
staff
traveled
on
1,030
trips
to
all
16
counties
in
2013.
We
held
over
100
constituent
office hours
in
locations
across
the
5th
District.
Legislative
Work...
Ending
Washington's
Habit
of
Spending
Beyond
Our
Means :
Passing
a
budget
is
something
Washington
has
been
incapable
of
achieving
for
too
long,
which
is
one
reason
why
our
national
debt
is
18
trillion
dollars
and
growing.
First
Bipartisan
Budget
in
27
Years:
In
December
of
2013,
the
House
and
Senate
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013
(H.J.Res.59),
which
represents
the
first
bipartisan
budget
produced
by
a
divided
Congress
in
27
years.
The
bill
prevented
the
Senate&#8217;s
push
for
new
tax
and
spending
increases
and
continued
my
commitment
to
deficit
reduction.
This
is
a notable
shift,
especially
given
the
Senate
has
failed
to
even
consider
its
own
budget
for
the
past
4
years.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
say
the
House
has
considered
and
passed
a
budget
for
the
last
4
consecutive
years.
Leading
on
Job
Creation,
Economic
Growth :
Agriculture
is
a
bright
spot
for
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
economy.
The
industry
supports
close
to
100,000
farmers
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
job
in
the
Commonwealth,
and
over
16
million
jobs
nationally.
For
the
past
two
terms,
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
has
been
working
to
reauthorize
the
Farm
Bill,
which
governs
our
nation&#8217;s
agriculture
programs.
Most
Significant
Reforms
To
Agriculture
Programs
in
Decades:
On
February
7,
2014,
the
President
signed
into
law
a
new
Farm
Bill,
which
represents
the
most
significant
reforms
to
agriculture
programs
in
decades.
As
a
Subcommittee
Chairman
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee,
I
am
proud
of
the
hard
work
put
forward
by
members
from
both
parties. This
bill
is
proof
that
when Congress
works
hard
to
build
consensus,
we
can
find
ways
to
improve
the
economy,
but
at
the
same
time,
reform
government
and
reduce
spending. Farm
Bill
Support
Job
Growth,
Deficit
Reduction:
This
bill
supports
job
growth
while
reducing
our
deficits
and
improving
key
programs
that
support
our
family
farms,
foresters,
agribusinesses,
and
the
host
of
industries
that
are
related
to
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
number
one
industry,
agriculture.
The
farm
bill
also
includes
the
Forest
Products
Fairness
Act,
which
I
introduced.
This
measure
will
open
new
market
opportunities
for
forestry
producers
and
help
to
promote
healthy,
well
managed
forests.
Overall, the Farm
Bill
reduces
deficits
by
$16.6
billion
over
10
years.
Leading
on
Education :
Working
to
ensure
access
to
high
quality
and
affordable
education
for
more
students,
including
those
in
our
rural
communities,
has
been
a
fundamental
priority
of
mine
in
Congress.
During
the
past
year,
I
continued
this
fight.
Named
National
Education
Policymaker
of
the
Year:
On
March
6,
2013,
I
had
the
honor
of
being
named
the
National
Policymaker
of
the
Year by
the
National
Association
for
Career
and
Technical
Education
(ACTE). The
award
is
presented
annually
to
a
federal
lawmaker
who
has
made
a
significant
impact
on
policy
related
to
career
and
technical
education
programs.
For
the
past
two
terms,
I
have
served
as
the
Co-Chairman
of
the
bipartisan
Career
and
Technical
Education
(CTE) Caucus.
My
fellow
Co-Chairman,
Rep.
Jim
Langevin
(D-RI),
was
the
other
policymaker
to
receive
this
award
for
2013.
Education
Reforms
Advance :
On
July
19,
2013,
the
House
passed
H.R.
5,
the
Student
Success
Act,
which
would
reform
and
reauthorize
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act
(ESEA),
also
known
as
No
Child
Left
Behind
(NCLB).
The
bill
included
language
based

Supporting
Our
Men
And
Women
in
Uniform :
Our
military
must
remain
strong
and
adequately
equipped,
in
order
to
enforce
the
peace. My
promise
is
to
serve
and
advocate
for
those
who
serve
this
country in

both
during
and

service. Military

Support
Amendment
Signed
into
Law:
On
December
26,
2013,
President
Obama
signed
into
law
the
2014
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
The
bill
included
an
amendment
I
introduced
that
will
expand
and
improve
the
Transitional
Assistance
Management
Program
(TAMP).
TAMP
offers
health
care
coverage
for
service
members
transitioning
into
civilian
life.
The
amendment
extends
TAMP
by
an
additional
180
days
for
all
services
rendered
through
telemedicine,
to
ensure
that
coverage
is
available
for
those
with
Post
Traumatic
Stress,
the
symptoms
of
which
often
do
not
appear
until
8
to
10
months
following
deployment.
The
amendment
builds
on
the
2011
STEP
Act,
a
bill
I
sponsored,
now
Public
Law
112-81,
Section
713,
which
expanded
service
member
health
care
services
and
the
use
of
telemedicine
at
the
Department
of
Defense.

( Stars

The
President's
Health
Care
Law :
The
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
is
weighing
heavy
on
the
minds
of
Americans,
including
so
many
across
the
5th
District.
The
law&#8217;s
estimated
$1.5
trillion
in
new
spending
is
unsustainable
and
its
burdensome
new
regulatory
regime
of
mandates
and
taxes is
harming
families
and
small
businesses.
I
have
voted
to
fully
repeal
the
ACA
and
have
advocated
for
reforms
that
actually
lower
cost
and
expand
access.
In
the
meantime,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
prevent
even
more
economic
harm
from
being
imposed
upon
hard
working
Americans. Protecting
Americans
from
the
ACA:
Although
the
Healthcare.gov
website
launch
was
a
severe
disappointment,
an
even
greater
concern
has
been
expressed
regarding
the
website&#8217;s
security
vulnerabilities
-
including
the
security
of
personal
and
medical
information.
Unfortunately,
it
has
become
very
clear
that
the
rushed
implementation
of
the
launch
has
affected
the
site&#8217;s
ability
to
perform
on
both
accounts.
For
this
reason,
in
early
January,
the
House
passed
H.R.
3811,
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act,
to
ensure
that
individuals
are
notified
if
their
personal
information
has
been compromised
through the
website.
Despite
the
Obama
administration&#8217;s
vocal
opposition
to
the
effort
to
boost
transparency
and
consumer
protections,
a
veto-proof
majority
of
Republicans
and
Democrats
voted,
291-122,
to
pass
H.R.
3811.
Protecting
our
Volunteer
Firefighters:
Under
the
ACA&#8217;s
employer
mandate,
volunteer
organizations
with
50
or
more
employees
could
be
forced
to
provide
health
insurance
or
pay
penalties,
which
could
potentially
devastate
these
organizations.
On
December
11,
2013,
I
joined
with
fellow
House
colleagues
in
introducing
the
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act
(H.R.
3685),
which
will
ensure
that
emergency
services
volunteers
are
not
counted
as
full-time
employees
under
the
ACA&#8217;s
employer
mandate.
As
a
result
of
these
efforts,
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
recently
announced
they
will
not
treat
volunteer
firefighters
as
employees
under
the
ACA,
which
is
a
huge
win
for
these
local
volunteer
organizations
and
the
populations
they
protect.
Energy
Security :
Since
the
early
seventies
our
country
has
been
spending
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
a
year
on
energy
imports
to
fulfill
our
energy
needs
&#8211;
money
that
could
otherwise
be
used
to
invest
in
our
kids
and
pay
down
the
debt.
It&#8217;s
time
for
us
to
get
serious
about
ending
our
reliance
on
foreign
sources
of
energy,
which
begins
by
developing
more
energy
here
at
home.
Over
the
past
year,
I&#8217;ve
advanced
these
principles.
Expanding
Domestic
Energy
Resources:
The
Republican-led
House
has
kept
its
focus
on
promoting
energy
policies
that
lower
energy
costs,
grow
jobs,
and
increase
our
energy
security.
Most
recently,
in
November,
the
House
acted
on
a
package
of
bills
that
will
expand
domestic
energy
production,
improve
energy
transport,
and
ultimately
increase
energy
affordability
for
consumers
and
American
families
across
the
country
(Click

American
Competitiveness :
The
recent
economic
downturn
is
a
reminder
of
how
critically
important
education
and
job
training
opportunities
are
to
students
and
workers
in
an
increasingly
competitive
global
economy.
That's
why
I
have
worked
to strengthen
and
expand
our
skilled
workforce,
in
order
to preserve
our
nation&#8217;s
technical
job
base
and
remain
globally
competitive.
Supporting
Our
Skilled
Workforce:
The
President
in
his
2012
SOTU
Address
called
for
an
overhaul
of
the
nation&#8217;s
workforce
and
investment
programs.
During
the
past
year,
the
U.S.
House
passed
legislation
known
as
the
Supporting
Knowledge
and
Investing
in
Lifelong
Skills
(SKILLS)
Act,
which
would
to
reauthorize
the
Workforce
Investment
Act
(WIA).
The
Senate
has
failed
to
act
on
this
critical
bill
that
supports
job
training
and
a
strong
American
workforce.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Education
Committee
and
Co-Chairman
of
the
CTE
Caucus,
I
will
continue
my
push
to
strengthen
our
workforce
training
programs.
