Dear Friend,
I am
pleased that Eric Shinseki has made the right decision and resigned as VA
Secretary. However, we must remember that there is still a lot of work
to do to get to the bottom of the horrendous behavior that has been
uncovered at VA facilities across the country. While accountability
starts at the top, anyone at any level who knew of these waiting lists
must be fired immediately. Our job is not over
we must fix the VA
system. Today, I joined colleagues in Colorado and Wyoming in introducing
legislation to make sure that bonuses are not paid out to senior VA
leadership until wait time backlogs have been eliminated. These and
other like-minded efforts must continue if we are going to
once-and-for-all fix our veterans health care system and provide a service that
honors their sacrifice.
VA Bureaucrats being
sworn in for testimony during the 5/28 evening hearing (view from the
dais by Congressman
Lamborn)
Last week in Washington, I took part in an
extraordinary evening hearing of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. We
grilled VA officials as we attempt to get to the bottom of the recent
scandals rocking the VA. In my questioning, I was able to point toward a
short-term, "disaster relief" solution for our veterans involving an
increase in fee-basis care. This short-term solution would be designed
to get veterans care as soon as possible and remove backlogs. I got
the VA bureaucrats to admit, under oath, that additional money and
resources are not the problem. This process should immediately move forward
for our veterans.
I also organized another conference call with local Veterans
Service Organizations updating them on the latest developments and staying
in touch with the situation on the ground here in Colorado. I
appreciate the time everyone took to participate in the call and I will do my
best to stay in touch with these organizations and continue to field
their questions, concerns, and
suggestions.
I will remain dedicated to solving these issues and
working to restore the broken trust between veterans and the
VA.
If you are experiencing
ANY problems with the local VA system, please call my Colorado
Springs office at (719) 520-0055. My staff will do everything they can to
assist you.
It is an
honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's
Happening in Washington

ADDRESSING THE VA
SCANDAL
From my position as the second-ranking Republican
on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I remain focused on the VA
Scandal.
During a heated, prime time hearing of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, I questioned VA bureaucrats on the VA wait list
scandal and on the interim Inspector General's report showing systemic
failures across the VA system. These hearings are important tools for
Members of Congress to get the information they need and provide a
platform for the public to see the firsthand the challenges the come from
dealing with an evasive and defensive
bureaucracy.

RECAPPING RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
Two Weeks
Ago
I
spoke with leadership at Denver VA Hospital and Colorado Springs VA Clinic
because it was important to check-in on the situation in
Colorado.
Both the Denver VAMC
and the Colorado Springs Clinic were given a surprise
audit.
Facility directors both said
the results were positive.
Nave to trust without verifying, which is why weve asked for
local veteran feedback and scheduled these calls with
you.
The House
passed the VA Accountability Act, something I am an original supporter
of.
I led a
letter from four Colorado Congressmen asking Secretary Shinseki to
provide details about wait times and any waitlists in
Colorado.
The Veterans Affairs
Committee (where Im the second ranking Republican) approved subpoenas
on senior VA officials in order to compel their testimony on the recent
events in Phoenix and around the
country.
Last
Week
The interim OIG report was released
Wednesday morning.
Allegations of manipulating scheduling data and wait times were
confirmed.
1700 veterans were
waiting for care but werent on the Electronic Waiting List
(EWL).
Although Phoenix was
reporting an average wait time of 24 days for a first-time primary care
appointment, the investigation revealed that it was really 115
days.
The investigation also
revealed reports of inappropriate hiring decisions, sexual harassment,
and bullying by mid and senior level
managers.
The manipulation of data is not just confined
to Phoenix, but is systemic throughout the
VA.
The OIG has increased the number of
facilities under investigation for data manipulation to
42.
The report
outlined the VAs approach to investigating along with questions yet to
be answered:
Did the
facilitys electronic wait list (EWL) purposely omit the names of
veterans waiting for care and, if so, at whose
direction?
Were the deaths of any of these veterans related to
delays in
care?
The report made it evident that Shinseki failed to provide the
leadership needed to rid the VA of a culture of corruption and new
leadership was required.
Wednesday
night the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing with the
senior VA officials we
subpoenaed.
At that hearing I formally requested that Sec. Shinseki
resign.
He has failed to provide the
leadership required to rid the VA of its culture of
corruption.
His response to the interim report
was grossly inadequate.
Veterans shouldnt be triaged, they
should be seen
immediately.
Solutions going forward
Although it is a step in the right direction, it will take more than just
new leadership at the VA to remove the culture of corruption.
We must incorporate real solutions to ensure that these atrocities are
stopped.
I authored a
bipartisan letter to Acting Secretary Gibson co-signed by 23 other members
directing two things:
First, the VA must
utilize fee-based care in the private sector to get folks seen now and
clear the backlog.
Secondly, the VA must
remove the incentives that are in place that led to the manipulation
of data, unacceptable backlogs, and preventable deaths by no longer
making leaders choose between funding for their facilities and getting
veterans timely
care.
All incentives must be structured in a way that promotes a
culture of integrity and positive patient
outcomes.
There must be a criminal investigation launched
into the VAs widespread corruption.
Those responsible must be
held accountable.
Continue
to seek feedback from the local VA community about what they are seeing
in the Pikes Peak region.
I know that wait times are frustrating and that veterans hate
being treated like they are part of an
assembly
line .
Even though we have a new VA
Clinic opening in the next couple of months, we will still have
capacity issues.
Thats why
I inserted language in the NDAA calling for a study of a Joint DOD-VA
Clinic ( featuring an emergency room ) in Northern El Paso
County.

What Say
You?
One of the most important things I can
do is listen to my constituents. My staff and I get thousands of phone
calls, emails, letters, and social media postings every week. Here is
a sampling of what you are saying.
On
my
Facebook
this week constituents continued to share their thoughts
on the VA Scandal and the resignation of VA Secretary Eric
Shinseki:
Jim
Bennett
-
The
resignation of Shinseki is a start, but is only the first step.
John
Childers
-
The problem is the corruption in the whole system, not just
the VA. It starts at the top and includes the President as well. It has
been an ongoing problem for years.
Brian
Commander
-
The
only way to fix the VA is to allow vets like myself to see private
doctors. Also, remind the people that if Obamacare is not overturned,
this will be happening to the rest of the populace!
Cathy
Gardino
-
Time to hire people that will get the job done. Instead of all
the hires at the IRS to enforce Obamacare mandate, perhaps those
people should be working at the VA doing follow up and
scheduling?
Jaylene
Allen
-
Hopefully Shinseki will not be
receiving any benefits for his resignation.
