&ldquo;Democrats are in serious danger of losing control [of the Senate] to a Republican Party determined to roll back much of the social progress of the last six years.&rdquo; --
New York Times , 9/14/2014
Dear Friend, The
New York Times ,
FiveThirtyEight , and others are forecasting a dire year for Democrats.
We need to spend every moment between now and Election Day building up our grassroots defense. To do that, we need to reach our $145,000 goal before the FEC deadline at the end of the month. You can help by making a $5 contribution.

piece I quoted above goes a little further. It looks back to 2010, the last midterm election, when Democrats stayed home and Republicans picked up hundreds of seats in Congress and in state legislatures across the country.
Democrats are combatting that trend with a serious investment in our turnout operation. We&rsquo;re doing that here in Massachusetts, too, bringing voter targeting and GOTV together in ways that will help us win in November. But all of those efforts require resources, and we look to you to help us raise those resources. Can you pitch in with a $5 contribution?
The
Times
is talking about &ldquo;serious danger,&rdquo; and their fears aren&rsquo;t overblown. The GOP has shown its support for ending Medicare as we know it, for allowing inflation to continue to undercut the value of the minimum wage, for refusing to recognize the reality of climate change.
It&rsquo;s going to come down to all of us to make a real difference this November.
Thanks,
Ed
