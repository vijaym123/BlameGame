Strengthening our Border
Last week, the House of Representatives passed legislation to
fully fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of
Fiscal Year 2015, while taking commonsense steps to block President
Obamas unlawful actions on immigration. Our plan does exactly what we
said we would do
address our homeland security needs while
simultaneously taking action to restore and protect the integrity of the rule of
law.
We are providing the brave men and women who protect our homeland with
the resources they need to do their job. At the same time, we are
holding the president accountable for his reckless and irresponsible
actions. Congress will remain focused on forging ahead with common sense,
positive solutions that uphold the rule of law and improve and
strengthen our nation's
security.
Honoring Dr. King
Today,
individuals and families from all across the country and from all
walks of life will honor and celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. We will remember his compassion and his strength in the face of
adversity. The legacy of Dr. King is a lesson for every generation to
learn and cherish for it inspires us to aim ever higher to achieve
ever greater opportunities for all our citizens. As we measure the
magnitude of the challenges we face today as a nation and as a people, we
can find reassurance in knowing that when communities can muster our
courage and faith, we can overcome any obstacle in advancing the cause of
freedom.
