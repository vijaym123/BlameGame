In honor of National Nurses Week this week, I wanted to share with you a short story that a friend passed along to me. It perfectly encapsulates the faithfulness, diligence, and selflessness that nurses demonstrate every day. Their job is more than a career, it is a calling. They spend long hours and late nights caring for others, giving of themselves, serving faithfully. And when they get out of bed the next morning, they do it all over again.
How Much A Nurse Makes | Author Unknown
Somebody asked: "You're a nurse? That's cool, I wanted to do that when I was a kid. How much do you
make?"
The nurse replied: "How much do I make?...
I can make holding your hand seem like the most important thing in the world when you're scared...
I can make your child breathe when they stop...
I can help your father survive a heart attack...
I can make myself get up at 5AM to make sure your mother has the medicine she needs to live...
I work all day to save the lives of strangers...
I make my family wait for dinner until I know your family member is taken care of...
I make myself skip lunch so that I can make sure that everything I did for your wife today is charted...
I make myself work weekends and holidays because people don't just get sick Monday - Friday. Today, I might save your life.
How much do I make? All I know is, I make a difference."
Thank you to all the 4 th
District nurses and those across the country who make a difference in so many peoples lives. We are grateful.
Yours in service,
Randy
