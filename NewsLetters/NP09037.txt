News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
June 2, 2014
Protecting your Identity Security
In light of recent NSA and IRS scandals, it's clear that concerns by
Americans about overreaching data collection by the federal government,
violations of privacy, and discrimination are justified.
Now it's time
to add the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to that list.
The CFPB already maintains financial data about more than 10 million
Americans - but now it aims to collect even more personal and financial
details, all without our consent.
I've voiced concerns about their
lack of accountability
to the taxpayers and the lack of congressional oversight.
Now I'm
also worried about the security of this data, and how we can fix it
when Congress has almost no management authority over the CFPB.
In January, I asked CFPB Director Cordray about data security.
At that
time, he responded that they weren't collecting any personal data that
could identify individuals, so there wasn't real risk to data security.
However, now the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which partnered
with CFPB to maintain the National Mortgage Database, has announced it
will collect personal details
like religion, credit card info,
phone numbers, and email addresses.
We can't allow a government agency like the CFPB to continue to operate
without oversight.
That's why I've introduced a bill to hold the CFPB
accountable
to taxpayers.
It removes the CFPB from
under the wings of the Federal Reserve and makes it an independent
agency reporting to Congress.
The bill also saves your tax dollars by
requiring the CFPB to follow the regular budget process just like all
other federal agencies and departments.
My colleagues and I on the Financial Services Committee are watching
the CFPB, and I'll keep you updated on my efforts to keep your data
secure.
Responding to VA Misconduct
Over the past month, we've heard too many reports about misconduct and
neglect in the VA healthcare system.
Last Wednesday, our worst fears
were confirmed.
The VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released
a preliminary report
substantiating
claims that VA executives have been cooking the books to conceal actual
wait times for veterans' care at the Phoenix VA.
At least 1700
veterans seeking care at that facility alone did not get an appointment
on the schedule or were omitted from the wait list altogether.
On
Friday, the Administration released a report that showed more than 60%
of VA healthcare facilities manipulated wait times for appointments.
This is shocking and unacceptable.
Because of these findings, they're
now investigating 42 more VA healthcare facilities - including the
three locations in Texas I pushed the VA to investigate earlier this
month.
In response, VA Secretary Shinseki resigned
last Friday after apologizing and taking
responsibility for the misconduct under his leadership.
I respect this
decision, and I hope the VA will move quickly to bring in new
leadership and change its culture and operations.
I'm also encouraged
that the Administration is seriously considering House-passed reforms
to the VA, like making it easier for executives to be fired
or demoted based on poor performance, and prohibiting
performance bonuses for executives until 2019.
I'm committed to honoring our veterans with the best care, but also
with our utmost gratitude. They deserve nothing less. I had the
privilege of participating in a Memorial Day service at Plainview
Cemetery to honor those who sacrificed for our country, and look
forward to joining the South Plains Honor Flight
reunion in Lubbock this weekend.
Celebrating Cancer Survivors
I want to take a brief moment to recognize that yesterday was National
Cancer Survivors Day
.
As a cancer survivor myself, I know how much the support from
family, friends, and medical professionals means.
I want to
congratulate all of the many survivors out there, and offer my prayers
and support for those battling cancer right now.

Randy
Neugebauer June

Protecting
your
Identity
Security
In
light
of
recent
NSA
and
IRS
scandals,
it&#8217;s
clear
that
concerns
by
Americans
about
overreaching
data
collection
by
the
federal
government,
violations
of
privacy,
and
discrimination
are
justified.
Now
it&#8217;s
time
to
add
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB)
to
that
list.
The
CFPB
already
maintains
financial
data
about
more
than
10
million
Americans
&#8211;
but
now
it
aims
to
collect
even
more
personal
and
financial
details,
all
without
our
consent.
I&#8217;ve
voiced
concerns
about
their
lack
of
accountability
to
the
taxpayers
and
the
lack
of
congressional
oversight.
Now
I&#8217;m
also
worried
about
the
security
of
this
data,
and
how
we
can
fix
it
when
Congress
has
almost
no
management
authority
over
the
CFPB.
In
January,
I
asked
CFPB
Director
Cordray
about
data
security.
At
that
time,
he
responded
that
they
weren&#8217;t
collecting
any
personal
data
that
could
identify
individuals,
so
there
wasn&#8217;t
real
risk
to
data
security.
However,
now
the
Federal
Housing
Finance
Agency
(FHFA),
which
partnered
with
CFPB
to
maintain
the
National
Mortgage
Database,
has
announced
it
will
collect
personal
details
like
religion,
credit
card
info,
phone
numbers,
and
email
addresses.
We
can&#8217;t
allow
a
government
agency
like
the
CFPB
to
continue
to
operate
without
oversight.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
introduced
a
bill
to
hold
the
CFPB
accountable
to
taxpayers.
It
removes
the
CFPB
from
under
the
wings
of
the
Federal
Reserve
and
makes
it
an
independent
agency
reporting
to
Congress.
The
bill
also
saves
your
tax
dollars
by
requiring
the
CFPB
to
follow
the
regular
budget
process
just
like
all
other
federal
agencies
and
departments.
My
colleagues
and
I
on
the
Financial
Services
Committee
are
watching
the
CFPB,
and
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
updated
on
my
efforts
to
keep
your
data
secure.
