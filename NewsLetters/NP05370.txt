Dear Friend, Since we kicked off the special election campaign last year, 69,544 of you have donated to our campaign.
That&rsquo;s a truly impressive number. But I think we can do better. I think we can find the 456 new donors we need to get to 7O,OOO. Make your first contribution to our campaign and help us reach 7O,OOO donors.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Today marks the start of our Donor Weekend of Action, and it&rsquo;s a chance for grassroots supporters like you to stand up and be counted before election day. I wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it weren&rsquo;t for your support -- and this weekend, we&rsquo;re hoping you can go the extra mile.
For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been peppering your inboxes with doom-and-gloom predictions about Republicans taking over the Senate. I wish that weren&rsquo;t the case -- but this is the electoral reality right now. Doing &ldquo;pretty well&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t going to be good enough. To win, we need to be at our absolute best. Democrats will lose in November if grassroots supporters like you stay on the sidelines. I need you in the game -- give $5 and help us get to 7O,OOO donors.
Thanks,
Ed
