Wreaths Across America:
A Proud Maine Tradition
Over the last 23 years, Wreaths Across America has grown into one of
the greatest honors paid to our nation's veterans coast to coast. In
recognition of this wonderful work, Senator Susan Collins and I
sponsored a resolution in the U.S. Senate designating December 13th,
2014 as "Wreaths Across America Day
." The day provides an opportunity to
reflect on the history of this country and the relationship that we
have with our veterans.
Senator Collins and me at a wreath laying ceremony held on the steps of
the U.S. Capitol in recognition of our country's veterans,
servicemembers and their families.
Scenes from Maine
I was honored to receive the Weston L. Bonney Award during the Educate
Maine
symposium and education leadership luncheon
earlier this month. Here I am with Wes Bonney (to my right) and Duke
Albanese, Educate Maine board member and former Maine Commissioner of
Education.
On December 19th, I joined with Pine Tree Legal Assistance
to announce an exciting new technology initiative that
will help Maine veterans access civil legal aid.
Policy Update
*
On Tuesday, December 9th, the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence released the so-called "torture report" on the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program. I voted to approve
declassification of the study because I believe our nation's reputation
as a beacon of openness, democratic values, human rights, and adherence
to the rule of law is at stake. You can read my additional views on the
report HERE
.
*
On Saturday, December 13th, the Senate passed the 2015 Omnibus
Federal Appropriations bill
, which funds the government through September 30th, 2015. Though
the bill is far from perfect, I voted for it because it contains some
important provisions - particularly for Maine - and it instills the
type of economic certainty our country needs.
*
With my support, Congress also passed the 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act, which authorizes defense spending for the next
fiscal year. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I've worked
hard to make sure this bill reflects our priorities as a state and as a
nation. To read more about the NDAA's impact on the Maine economy,

More good news for Maine: white potatoes
will now be included in the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and Maine
fishermen and small boat owners
won't have to go through an unnecessary permitting process for
incidental water discharge.
Scenes from Washington
Getting by with a little bipartisan help from my friends Joe Manchin
(D-W.V.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.). Thanks to Tom Williams for capturing
the moment for Roll Call.
Scenes from my Instagram account
Don't tell my staff, but I have my own Instagram account! Follow me
HERE
to see pictures that I take and share right from

The sun has set on this session of Congress, and though I'm frustrated
that we weren't able to get more done, I remain hopeful that we can
find more ways to work together in the New Year.
