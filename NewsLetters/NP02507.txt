Dear Friends,
This week, an estimated 22 percent of Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees and an additional 30,000 workers who are critical to our country&rsquo;s national security could be furloughed if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is forced to shut down on Friday.
February 28, is the deadline for Congress to pass a funding bill that would keep the Department of Homeland Security open, providing certainty and stability to the frontline DHS personnel who protect our nation.
Last week, I called on Congressional leaders to end the threat of a Department of Homeland Security shutdown by urging support for a clean DHS funding bill that was introduced earlier this month. This bill would avert a shutdown and provide long-term funding to the Department of Homeland Security.

to read the letter I along with other House Democrats sent to Speaker Boehner urging him to move forward with a vote that would provide funding and certainty to DHS.
