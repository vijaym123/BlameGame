Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I recently read
by Roger Pilon titled, "Graduates, Your Ambition is the Problem.
"
I
was reminded of this article as I listened to the President's State of
the Union address Tuesday night.
In his column, Pilon critiqued a commencement speech by the President
at Ohio State University.
During his speech, the President mentioned
the idea of citizenship and distorted, or at the very least
misunderstood, the vision of our Founding Fathers.
Tuesday's speech was similar.
The President is pursuing an agenda that
is far different than the vision our Founders charted for us in our
founding documents.
Pilon rightly challenges the graduates that day at
Ohio State, as well as our whole country, to embrace the limited
constitutional government of our founding.
The story of America is
inspiring and it is one we cannot let this or future generations
forget.

Reforming Spending - Agriculture Bill Locks In Gains
This week, the House passed the House-Senate Conference Committee
Agricultural Act, better knows as the Farm Bill.
The bill makes over
$23 billion in mandatory spending reforms and passed the House 251-166
with bipartisan support.
Mandatory spending continues to drive the debt that threatens our
country.
This Farm Bill makes significant reforms to mandatory
spending programs, like food stamps, while maintaining assistance for
families critically in need and providing certainty to Hoosier farmers.
The reforms in welfare and agriculture spending, while not perfect, are
certainly gains to lock in, and we will immediately start working to
build off those gains to lock in the next reforms.
This is the first time the Farm Bill has been authorized by Congress
since 2008 and includes a multitude of reforms.
For a fact sheet on
the legislation, please visit the House Agriculture Committee website

State of the Union Reaction - Fighting So Americans Can Build Better
Lives for Ourselves
On Tuesday evening, the President delivered his State of the Union
address to Congress.
Rokita Responds to State of the Union 1-28-14
With Americans worse off by every objective measure than when he took
office, I hoped that the President would have at least acknowledged
during the speech that many of his policies have failed, and
demonstrate leadership by changing course.
Instead, we heard more
divisive class warfare, and more promises to continue the tax, spend
and regulate agenda that is killing jobs and disproportionately hurting
Americans at the lower end of the economic ladder.
Most troubling, we
heard the President promise to bypass Constitutional checks and
balances entirely and govern by executive decree.
I am fighting for all Hoosiers so that they can build better lives for
themselves and their families.
The President says he wants to help
people, but our ideas are the best and proven way of doing the most
good for the most Americans.
Over 40 House-passed jobs bills sit
untouched on Harry Reid's desk.
Innovative education reform like the
Student Success Act awaits action by a do-nothing Senate, and real
health care reform, like the American Health Care Act continues to gain
support in the House.
Jobs, spending reform, education, and health care will continue to be
my policy priorities and I will continue to do everything I can to hold
the President accountable for his troubling efforts to bypass our
Constitution and the rule of law.
