News from Congressman Scott Peters
May 21, 2014
Dear Friend,
Last week, San Diego experienced the first wildfires of the season.
First and foremost, my thoughts and prayers are with the families and
communities that were directly hit. My gratitude goes out to our first
responders and firefighters who worked tirelessly to contain the fires
and keep residents safe. The coordinated efforts of local, county,
state, and military agencies were crucial to mitigating damage to homes
and saving lives. Recently, I successfully fought against an attempt to
put state firefighting aircraft under the control of the Department of
Defense. Keeping these assets in state hands allows for a faster
response to emergencies in our region.
We had a dry winter and, given this early start to fire season, expect
a long and difficult road ahead battling wildfires. San Diegans must be
vigilant and prepared - to sign up for emergency updates from the
County of San Diego visit here

When Women Succeed, San Diego Succeeds
There is no doubt that there is still work to be done to foster
economic opportunities for women and girls across the country. Last
Tuesday, I hosted a discussion with Congresswoman Linda Snchez,
Co-chair of Labor and Working Families Caucus in the House, and several
local businesswomen to hear about their experiences in business and
government, and how we make progress toward equity. I was excited that
so many USD students and local businesswomen were on hand to join in
the discussion. I look forward to continuing this dialogue in coming
months with local community members, educators, business leaders, and
my colleagues in Congress to make sure we're moving the ball forward.
Honoring Local High School Artists
Thank you to the 37 local High School students who submitted their work
to the 52nd District's 2014 Congressional Art Competition. I recently
hosted a reception for participants and their families at The New
Children's Museum downtown. The winning entry, as judged by a panel of
local art experts, was from Maya Lin Bronner. Her work will be
displayed in the United States Capitol Building for the next year. The
fan favorite, as determined by the most 'Likes' of the image on my
Facebook page was from Brittney Butler, whose piece will be displayed
at my District Office in University City.
Showcasing Innovation for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
San Diego is a hot bed for technology, scientific innovation,
start-ups, and university-based research - the economic engines that
will keep our region and nation globally competitive. I was proud to
bring the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to town for a forum with local
business leaders to showcase our innovation economy and the fields
where San Diego is leading the way and creating jobs.

Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
San
Diego
experienced
the
first
wildfires
of
the
season.
First
and
foremost,
my
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
families
and
communities
that
were
directly
hit.
My
gratitude
goes
out
to
our
first
responders
and
firefighters
who
worked
tirelessly
to
contain
the
fires
and
keep
residents
safe.
The
coordinated
efforts
of
local,
county,
state,
and
military
agencies
were
crucial
to
mitigating
damage
to
homes
and
saving
lives.
Recently,
I
successfully
fought
against
an
attempt
to
put
state
firefighting
aircraft
under
the
control
of
the
Department
of
Defense.
Keeping
these
assets
in
state
hands
allows
for
a
faster
response
to
emergencies
in
our
region.
We
had
a
dry
winter
and,
given
this
early
start
to
fire
season,
expect
a
long
and
difficult
road
ahead
battling
wildfires.
San
Diegans
must
be
vigilant
and
prepared
&#8211;
to
sign
up
for
emergency
updates
from
the
County
of
San
Diego
visit
here .
When
Women
Succeed,
San

Succeeds
There
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
to
foster
economic
opportunities
for
women
and
girls
across
the
country.
Last
Tuesday,
I
hosted
a
discussion
with
Congresswoman
Linda
S&#225;nchez,
Co-chair

in

and
how
we
make
progress
toward
equity.
I
was
excited
that
so
many
USD
students
and
local
businesswomen
were
on
hand
to
join
in
the
discussion.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
this
dialogue
in
coming

with

Her
