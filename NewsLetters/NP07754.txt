Dear Fellow New Mexican,
Earlier this week I delivered a speech on the Central American refugee crisis our country is facing, and the need to pass immigration reform. What is driving children from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to our borders are unimaginable violence, corruption, extreme poverty, and instability in their home countries.
This crisis is of great concern for all of us.
I hope you'll take a moment to watch my speech and share your thoughts with me.
As a nation, we value the twin promises of freedom and opportunity. Those ideals are important no matter where you were born. But our immigration system is broken.
There are ways to address the Central American refugee crisis that are pragmatic, bipartisan, and uphold our American values. It's time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all.
Our short-term solution is to stop playing politics with a very real problem, and approve the president's emergency supplemental request. This situation is an emergency and we need emergency funding. Our long-term solution is for House Republicans to vote on the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate more than a year ago.
Our nation will be better for it.
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
