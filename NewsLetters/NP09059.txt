$2 billion.
That is the anticipated cost to American taxpayers for unaccompanied minors illegally crossing our borders in 2015,
reports Reuters . The article says that an estimated 60,000 such children will pour into the United States this year, according to the Administration, up from about 6,000 in 2011. Once they are detained, funding will be required for the food, housing, and transportation of these illegal immigrants who are under the age of 18.
This is an example of the consequences of talking about amnesty and failing to prioritize border security. And it is unacceptable. I will continue to prioritize the enforcement of our current immigration laws and the strengthening of border security. Citizenship is not a right, but a privilege.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
My position can be summed up in three simple words: No Amnesty. Period. Read more about where I stand,
