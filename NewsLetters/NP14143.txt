Dear Friend,
This week, President Obama announced a plan to help Americans keep their
health insurance even if their insurance companies have cancelled their
plans or pushed them into more expensive plans, an extremely
intelligent, hard-working and dedicated Memphian who I recommended to
the President moved one step closer to being confirmed as a federal
judge, and I introduced a bill in the House that would help prevent
unscrupulous for-profit colleges from taking advantage of veterans and
taxpayers. Keep reading to learn more.

Helping Memphians Keep Their Plans and Get Covered
Yesterday, President Barack Obama announced a plan to help Americans who
had received cancellation notices from their health insurance companies
keep those plans. This will give those people who had their policies
cancelled by their insurers or whose insurers had tried to push them
into more expensive plans the opportunity to maintain their coverage.
While this is a positive step to help those who are concerned about
their coverage, the truth is that many of the plans were cancelled
because they were inferior, insufficient plans. Some of them didn't even
cover hospitalization, something most of us would consider an essential
part of health insurance. The President's new plan would also require
insurance companies to let their customers know that their coverage
wouldn't protect them in these kinds of situations, and it would require
them to inform their customers that better, more affordable coverage is
available to them in the Affordable Care Act's Marketplace.
Tomorrow morning just after 7:00AM, I will be on MSNBC's Up with Steve
Kornacki and I will also be on MSNBC Live again tomorrow afternoon at
2:00PM to discuss the President's plan and how we can help Americans
maintain their current coverage or get better coverage. I hope you will
tune in.
All Memphians should have quality health coverage and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not had
access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to afford
quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's
Health Insurance Marketplace
. If you do not have health insurance coverage, you may be eligible
to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year, you're already covered and won't need to
enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't sure
whether or not you will need to use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option
for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health
insurance, you can sign up
for coverage today that will take effect January 1, 2014.
Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open until March 31, 2014, but
you can go online to www.healthcare.gov
today to check out your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare
paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription medications as
we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health insurance companies
can no longer discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions
and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance
plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit Seedco Mid-South for
in-person help. Seedco is located at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900),
and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341. If you have any other
questions, you should also feel free to call my office at 901-544-4131.
Sheryl Lipman Moves a Step Closer to the Federal Bench
On Wednesday, President Obama's nominee to fill a vacancy on the
District Court for the Western District of Tennesseee, Ms. Sheryl
Lipman, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is tasked
with reviewing nominations to the federal bench. I recommended her to
the President after convening a diverse and bipartisan screening
committee to conduct interviews of nine potential candidates for the
position.
Sheryl Lipman has proven herself a stellar attorney and I am confident
that she will be a superb judge. Her breadth of experience, strong work
ethic, and unimpeachable integrity easily made her the overwhelming
first choice of the screening committee of local attorneys.
I am glad the President took my recommendation into consideration and
nominated such a skilled Memphis attorney to the federal bench, and I am
glad that the Senate Judiciary Committee took a step towards her
confirmation. When confirmed, she will serve the Western District of
Tennessee with distinction and the people of Memphis well.
Honoring Our Veterans
On Monday, I hosted my 5th annual Veterans Day luncheon in Memphis, and
was glad to see more than 300 veterans from our great city in
attendance. They and their families have sacrificed a great deal for
each of us, and I appreciated the opportunity to say thank you to them
and give them the respect they deserve.
Protecting Our Students, Veterans, and Taxpayers
For-profit colleges can receive overwhelming majorities of their revenue
-up to 90%-from federal sources such as student loans. But too often,
these schools fail in their duty to adequately prepare graduates for
jobs that will allow them to repay those loans, leaving taxpayers to
foot the bill. Even worse, a loophole in current law allows unscrupulous
colleges to receive even more federal funds by enrolling veterans and
servicemembers. This loophole encourages bad behavior that weighs down
our nation's veterans with mountains of debt and few career prospects
while lining the pockets of wealthy for-profit investors with taxpayer
money. Simply put, this is unacceptable. We are entrusted with spending
our monies efficiently and wisely, but too many for-profit colleges do
not meet that test. This week, I introduced the Protecting our Students
and Taxpayers (POST) Act in the House to eliminate the loophole and help
prevent for-profit colleges from taking advantage of veterans and
taxpayers. Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois and Tom Harkin of Iowa have
also introduced the legislation in the Senate, and I am glad to be
working with these two distinguished Senators to close this loophole,
encourage for-profit colleges to provide better educations, and protect
American taxpayers.
U of M Distinguished Alumnus Award
Last weekend, I was honored to be awarded the 2013 Distinguished Alumnus
award by the U of M Alumni Association. The University of Memphis Cecil
C. Humphreys School of Law helped prepare me for a long and successful
career in public service, and I will always be grateful for the
education I received there. Being named the 2013 Distinguished Alumnus
is a great honor, and I thank the U of M Alumni Association for this
award. All of my life, I have supported and loved the University as I
know so many Memphians do.
Fighting for Consumers' and Victims' Rights
Yesterday, House Republicans delivered a harsh blow to victims of
asbestos and mesothelioma. In an attempt to find non-existent fraud, my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle designed legislation that
prevents victims from receiving the benefits that they deserve.
Furthermore, not a single victim's advocacy group was allowed to testify
during the hearings on this legislation.
By silencing victims, transparency in the hearing process was
irreparably damaged. I introduced an amendment that would have helped
fix their bill, but unfortunately it did not pass because nearly all
House Republicans voted against it.
Promoting Competition Among Airlines
At a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing this morning, I spoke with a
Justice Department official about how the recently-approved merger of
American Airlines and U.S. Airways will impact competition in the air
travel industry and if it will help consumers. In Memphis, we have seen
first-hand how poor oversight and enforcement can have harmful effects
on competition, flight availability, and consumer prices with the merger
of Delta and Northwest. I hope that the Department of Justice does
everything it can to ensure that the American/US Airways merger promotes
innovation in the industry and offers consumers-especially those in
Memphis-more choices and better prices instead of reducing the
incentives to be competitive.
Reducing Infant Mortality
This week, I urged my colleagues in the House to support the PREEMIE Act
, which was introduced in the Senate by Tennessee's senior Senator
Lamar Alexander and would help reduce the rate of infant mortality in
our country. Until recently, our local infant mortality rate in Memphis
rivaled that of some third world countries. The United States still has
a long way to go in fighting infant mortality-our current rate is 6.1
deaths per thousand while Portugal's is 2.5 and Japan's is 2.3 per
thousand. The PREEMIE Act will help achieve our goal of bettering the
health of our nation's future and I was proud to vote in favor of it
when it passed the House.
Medicare Open Enrollment
Medicare Part D enrollment for 2014 is now open and will run until
December 7th. The Aging Commission of the Mid-South will be sponsoring
several enrollment workshops in the 9th District to assist seniors in
enrolling in next year's plans. Those attending should bring their
Medicare card and prescriptions. Be sure not to miss out on this great
opportunity to lower your monthly pharmacy costs. For dates, times, and
locations of the workshops please click here
.
White House Internships
The White House Internship Program is currently accepting applications
from young people who are interested in government and devoted to public
service. If you-or anyone you know- would like to spend some time
working at the White House, gaining valuable professional experience and
building leadership skills, I would like to take this opportunity to
urge you to apply. The application deadline is January 5th, 2014. Click
here
for more information.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

Helping
Memphians
Keep
Their
Plans
and
Get
Covered
Yesterday,
President
Barack
Obama
announced
a
plan
to
help
Americans
who
had
received
cancellation
notices
from
their
health
insurance
companies
keep
those
plans.
This
will
give
those
people
who
had
their
policies
cancelled
by
their
insurers
or
whose
insurers
had
tried
to
push
them
into
more
expensive
plans
the
opportunity
to
maintain
their
coverage.
While
this
is
a
positive
step
to
help
those
who
are
concerned
about
their
coverage,
the
truth
is
that
many
of
the
plans
were
cancelled
because
they
were
inferior,
insufficient
plans.
Some
of
them
didn&#8217;t
even
cover
hospitalization,
something
most
of
us
would
consider
an
essential
part
of
health
insurance.
The
President&#8217;s
new
plan
would
also
require
insurance
companies
to
let
their
customers
know
that
their
coverage
wouldn&#8217;t
protect
them
in
these
kinds
of
situations,
and
it
would
require
them
to
inform
their
customers
that
better,
more
affordable
coverage
is
available
to
them
in
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
Marketplace.
Tomorrow
morning
just
after
7:00AM,
I
will
be
on
MSNBC&#8217;s
Up
with
Steve
Kornacki
and
I
will
also
be
on
MSNBC
Live
again
tomorrow
afternoon
at
2:00PM
to
discuss
the
President&#8217;s
plan
and
how
we
can
help
Americans
maintain
their
current
coverage
or
get
better
coverage.
I
hope
you
will
tune
in.
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
coverage
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable

to
afford
quality

in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to

do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to

the

or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
today
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014.
Enrollment
in

until
March
31,
2014,
but
you

Act
is
already

the
Ninth

the
recent

that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that

$3.1
million

Sheryl
Lipman
Moves
a
Step
Closer
to
the
Federal
Bench
On
Wednesday,
President
Obama&#8217;s
nominee
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
District
Court
for
the
Western
District
of
Tennesseee,
Ms.
Sheryl
Lipman,
appeared
before
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee,
which
is
tasked
with
reviewing
nominations
to
the
federal
bench.
I
recommended
her
to
the
President
after
convening
a
diverse
and
bipartisan
screening
committee
to
conduct
interviews
of
nine
potential
candidates
for
the
position.
Sheryl
Lipman
has
proven
herself
a
stellar
attorney
and
I
am
confident
that
she
will
be
a
superb
judge.
Her
breadth
of
experience,
strong
work
ethic,
and
unimpeachable
integrity
easily
made
her
the
overwhelming
first
choice
of
the
screening
committee
of
local
attorneys.
I
am
glad
the
President
took
my
recommendation
into
consideration
and
nominated
such
a
skilled
Memphis
attorney
to
the
federal
bench,
and
I
am
glad
that
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
took
a
step
towards
her
confirmation.
When
confirmed,
she
will
serve
the
Western
District
of
Tennessee
with
distinction
and
the
people
of
Memphis
well.
Honoring
Our
Veterans
On
Monday,
I
hosted
my
5th
annual
Veterans
Day
luncheon
in
Memphis,
and
was
glad
to
see
more
than
300
veterans
from
our
great
city
in
attendance.
They
and
their
families
have
sacrificed
a
great
deal
for
each
of
us,
and
I
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
say
thank
you
to
them
and
give
them
the
respect
they
deserve.
Protecting
Our
Students,
Veterans,
and
Taxpayers
For-profit
colleges
can
receive
overwhelming
majorities
of
their
revenue
&#8212;up
to
90%&#8212;from
federal
sources
such
as
student
loans.
But
too
often,
these
schools
fail
in
their
duty
to
adequately
prepare
graduates
for
jobs
that
will
allow
them
to
repay
those
loans,
leaving
taxpayers
to
foot
the
bill.
Even
worse,
a
loophole
in
current
law
allows
unscrupulous
colleges
to
receive
even
more
federal
funds
by
enrolling
veterans
and
servicemembers.
This
loophole
encourages
bad
behavior
that
weighs
down
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
with
mountains
of
debt
and
few
career
prospects
while
lining
the
pockets
of
wealthy
for-profit
investors
with
taxpayer
money.
Simply
put,
this
is
unacceptable.
We
are
entrusted
with
spending
our
monies
efficiently
and
wisely,
but
too
many
for-profit
colleges
do
not
meet
that
test.
This
week,
I
introduced
the
Protecting
our
Students
and
Taxpayers
(POST)
Act
in
the
House
to
eliminate
the
loophole
and
help
prevent
for-profit
colleges
from
taking
advantage
of
veterans
and
taxpayers.
Senators
Dick
Durbin
of
Illinois
and
Tom
Harkin
of
Iowa
have
also
introduced
the
legislation
in
the
Senate,
and
I
am
glad
to
be
working
with
these
two
distinguished
Senators
to
close
this
loophole,
encourage
for-profit
colleges
to
provide
better
educations,
and
protect
American
taxpayers.
U
of
M
Distinguished
Alumnus
Award
Last
weekend,
I
was
honored
to
be
awarded
the
2013
Distinguished
Alumnus
award
by
the
U
of
M
Alumni
Association.
The
University
of
Memphis
Cecil
C.
Humphreys
School
of
Law
helped
prepare
me
for
a
long
and
successful
career
in
public
service,
and
I
will
always
be
grateful
for
the
education
I
received
there.
Being
named
the
2013
Distinguished
Alumnus
is
a
great
honor,
and
I
thank
the
U
of
M
Alumni
Association
for
this
award.
All
of
my
life,
I
have
supported
and
loved
the
University
as
I
know
so
many
Memphians
do.
Fighting
for
Consumers&#8217;
and
Victims&#8217;
Rights
Yesterday,
House
Republicans
delivered
a
harsh
blow
to
victims
of
asbestos
and
mesothelioma.
In
an
attempt
to
find
non-existent
fraud,
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
designed
legislation
that
prevents
victims
from
receiving
the
benefits
that
they
deserve.
Furthermore,
not
a
single
victim&#8217;s
advocacy
group
was
allowed
to
testify
during
the
hearings
on
this
legislation.
By
silencing
victims,
transparency
in
the
hearing
process
was
irreparably
damaged.
I
introduced
an
amendment
that
would
have
helped
fix
their
bill,
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
pass
because
nearly
all
House
Republicans
voted
against
it.
Promoting
Competition
Among
Airlines
At
a
House
Judiciary
Subcommittee
hearing
this
morning,
I
spoke
with
a
Justice
Department
official
about
how
the
recently-approved
merger
of
American
Airlines
and
U.S.
Airways
will
impact
competition
in
the
air
travel
industry
and
if
it
will
help
consumers.
In
Memphis,
we
have
seen
first-hand
how
poor
oversight
and
enforcement
can
have
harmful
effects
on
competition,
flight
availability,
and
consumer
prices
with
the
merger
of
Delta
and
Northwest.
I
hope
that
the
Department
of
Justice
does
everything
it
can
to
ensure
that
the
American/US
Airways
merger
promotes
innovation
in
the
industry
and
offers
consumers&#8212;especially
those
in
Memphis&#8212;more
choices
and
better
prices
instead
of
reducing
the
incentives
to
be
competitive.
Reducing
Infant
Mortality
This
week,
I
urged
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
support
the
PREEMIE
Act ,
which
was
introduced
in
the
Senate
by
Tennessee&#8217;s
senior
Senator
Lamar
Alexander
and
would
help
reduce
the
rate
of
infant
mortality
in
our
country.
Until
recently,
our
local
infant
mortality
rate
in
Memphis
rivaled
that
of
some
third
world
countries.
The
United
States
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
in
fighting
infant
mortality&#8212;our
current
rate
is
6.1
deaths
per
thousand
while
Portugal&#8217;s
is
2.5
and
Japan&#8217;s
is
2.3
per
thousand.
The
PREEMIE
Act
will
help
achieve
our
goal
of
bettering
the
health
of
our
nation&#8217;s
future
and
I
was
proud
to
vote
in
favor
of
it
when
it
passed
the
House.
