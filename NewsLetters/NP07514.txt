If my past week could be
summed up in one word it would be the word border. Ive had meetings
every single day this week in regards to the crisis on our southern
border and I plan to continue working hard to reach a solution. With the
magnitude of the crisis I am hopeful that a bill will be voted on by
the end of next week.
On Thursday, the
members of the Texas Republican Delegation and I signed a
letter
to President Obama asking him to enforce current
immigration law and take action within his current authority to address the
crisis on the southern border.
Rep. Kay
Granger and the house working group this week in released a number of
common sense solutions to stop the flow of illegal immigrants crossing
our border. Some of the
recommendations
include
sending the National Guard to the border, tweaking the 2008 law that
is the root of the current crisis, and deploying additional judges to
the southern border to quickly determine whether the unaccompanied
minors seeking asylum have a credible claim or should be returned
home.
Last Thursday I introduced a piece of
legislation to solve the border crisis, the
Protection of
Children Act
of 2014 (PCA). The PCA would amend the 2008
trafficking law to allow unaccompanied alien children without credible claims
from any country to be deported quickly, not just children from Mexico
or Canada. The PCA would also require the collection of information
from the sponsors who receive the children and require law enforcement
to follow up if they are in the country
illegally.
President Obama found time to attend fundraisers this week
instead of addressing the tragic death of 295 passengers aboard
Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. Instead of pressuring Russian President
Vladimir Putin to cease the violence in Ukraine, Obama was fundraising in
California on Wednesday.
In addition to my
work on the border, the House addressed a number of education bills
this week. On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R.
3136 , the Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act
of 2014, by a vote of 414
0 (See Roll Call
#441 ).
H.R. 3136 promotes innovation in higher education by
directing the secretary of education to implement competency-based education
demonstration projects. On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 4984 , the Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial
Counseling Act, by a vote of 405
11 (See Roll Call
#446 ).
H.R. 4984 will arm students with the best information
available about the cost of their education in a format that is easy
to understand, information that includes key facts such as an
institutions costs, completion rates, and student loan debt. The House also
passed
H.R. 3393 , the Student and Family Tax
Simplification Act, by a vote of 227
187 (See Roll Call
#449 ).
H.R. 3393 consolidates four higher education tax
benefits
the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC); the Hope
Scholarship Credit; the Lifetime Learning Credit; and the tuition deduction
into one permanent, reformed
AOTC.
Finally, on Friday, July 25, 2014, the House passed
H.R. 4935 , the Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014, by a vote
of 237 - 173 (See Roll Call
#451 ). H.R. 4935
ends the marriage penalty for the child tax credit and indexes the
credit and the limitations to inflation to help parents keep more of their
hard earned money to use for taking care of their children and
family.
I am looking forward to getting back to Texas for the weekend. I
will be back in Washington on the 28 th
for another busy
week. Share on Digg Share on Facebook Share on
