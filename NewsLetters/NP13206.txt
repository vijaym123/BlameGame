The Year
Ahead
The second session of the 113 th
Congress officially convened this past week.
And while it may be
a new year, I intend to continue finding commonsense solutions to the
problems facing our nation using Missouri values as my guiding
principles.
That starts with our nations debt and
unemployment.
Weve begun to make progress on the debt and deficit.
Since becoming the majority in the House, we have cut $165 billion
in spending.
Still, we need further meaningful and serious
changes to the spending status quo.
Washington must start asking the
question: is this program important enough to continue borrowing $17
trillion from China and other nations and loading that debt on future
generations?
Thats why I have introduced the
IMAGE Act
to save taxpayer dollars by
eliminating dozens of programs across the Federal government that are
duplicative or overlapping.
Additionally, on
Friday we learned that job creation for December was the lowest in nearly
three years
74,000 jobs added, instead of the 200,000 economists
expected.
While we always want to see positive job growth, the
average monthly job gains in 2013 were nearly identical to those of
2012.
In other words, we still need a game changer.
The House passed the
SKILLS Act
ten
months ago to reform our expansive workforce development programs and
help the nearly 20 million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed
find a job.
The Senate should join us.
I will
continue to work with my colleagues to right our economic ship and get the
millions of Americans seeking jobs back to work.

Sincerely,
Sam Graves
