Agriculture is Virginias
number one
industry, and the Fourth District is part of the reason why.
Our region is steeped in a rich agricultural heritage and is home to multi-generation farmers who care for acres of cotton, soybeans, peanuts, wheat, corn, and other crops.
Our farmers provide important agricultural resources to the nation and the world.
I will
continue
to stand up for our nations farmers and remain committed to supporting our nations agricultural producers and this rich history.
Yours in service,
Randy
