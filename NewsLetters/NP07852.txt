Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Coloradans agree that no one should have to ask their boss for a permission slip to access critical health services &mdash; birth control or otherwise. But just over two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 decision, turned back the clock on decades of progress toward gender equality by deciding to allow the vast majority of employers to refuse to cover contraception as part of employees&rsquo; health insurance policies.
The Hobby Lobby decision was wrong and misguided. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve written legislation to keep corporations out of our private health care decisions, and I&rsquo;m proud that the U.S. Senate will vote on my bill as early as tomorrow.
Congress must pass my Not My Boss&rsquo;s Business Act and ensure that women continue to have access to affordable birth control.
Last week in Colorado,
I stood shoulder-to-shoulder with women&rsquo;s health experts , including an OB-GYN in Denver, who told me that physicians now might have to consider an employer&rsquo;s religious beliefs before making medical recommendations that ought to be based solely on their patients&rsquo; well-being. That is unacceptable.
More and more Coloradans are speaking out about how this decision may hurt them and their families. But I&rsquo;ve also heard some misconceptions that do not capture the scope of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision. I&rsquo;m pushing back, and I need you to join me.
Here are six important things to know about the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Hobby Lobby decision that underscore why Congress must pass the Not My Boss&rsquo;s Business Act ASAP:
This unprecedented Supreme Court decision affects millions of Americans nationwide &mdash; women and men.
Women pay for their contraception through their labor &mdash; it&rsquo;s not free.
Affordable birth control is essential to women&rsquo;s economic success.
The Court's decision impacts ALL types of birth control &hellip; and this isn&rsquo;t just about contraceptives.
The Court's decision allows many bosses to impose their own personal religious beliefs on employees.
The Supreme Court unfairly singled out women and women&rsquo;s health.
Please share the facts and help me build support for restoring our right to private health care decisions.
I&rsquo;ve long fought for Coloradans&rsquo; freedom to live our lives on our own terms. Personal decisions about accessing birth control and deciding when to start a family are too important to cede to corporate interests. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m standing with you to show once and for all that women&rsquo;s health care is not a boss&rsquo;s business.
Warm regards,
Offices
