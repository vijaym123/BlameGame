Dear Friend,
I am happy to return home to the East Bay for the holidays knowing that
there will be more certainty regarding federal spending for the next
two years.
The Ryan/Murray budget, which passed with bipartisan
support, partially repeals reckless spending cuts while still reducing
our long-term deficit.
I was proud to lead a statement expressing support
for the recent budget compromise from members of the United
Solutions Caucus, a group of bipartisan, first-term Representatives.
This budget agreement provides families and businesses with more
confidence and puts us on the right track to grow our local economy and
create more jobs - my top priorities in Congress.
Now that Congress has agreed on a budget, I want to know what you think
our priority should be in 2014:
What should be the number one priority for Congress in the new year?
Reducing Unemployment
Protecting Social Security and Medicare
Immigration Reform
Tax Reform
Other
