Dear Friends,
As summer comes to an end,
the month of September
National Preparedness
Month
is an
important reminder for
Delawareans to be disaster
aware and prepare for the
unexpected. We Delawareans
are no stranger to the wrath
of severe weather, and as a
coastal state it's critical
that we take hurricane season
seriously. Although natural
and manmade disasters can
happen unexpectedly, being
prepared can help protect
lives and property.
Last week, I joined
officials from Federal
Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Delaware Department
of Safety and Homeland
Security, DelDOT, Delaware
Natural Resources and
Environmental Control (DNREC)
and the American Red Cross at
the Sussex County Emergency
Operations Center in
Georgetown to remind
Delawareans about the
importance of being prepared.
After hearing from federal
and state officials, I had
the opportunity to tour the
state-of-the-art operations
facility and meet with some
of our heroic First State
first responders.
Here are some tips from
FEMA and the American Red
Cross to help your family
prepare and be ready for the
unexpected when disaster
strikes:
Be
Informed. Knowing
what to do before, during and
after an emergency is a
critical part of being
prepared and may make all the
difference when seconds
count.
Make a
Plan. Your
family may not be together
when a disaster strikes so it
is important to plan in
advance: how you will get to
a safe place; how you will
contact one another; how you
will get back together; and
what you will do in different
situations.
Build a
Kit. Try to
assemble your kit well in
advance of an emergency. You
may have to evacuate at a
moments notice and
take essentials with you. You
will probably not have time
to search for the supplies
you need or shop for
them.
Get
Involved. There
are many ways to get involved
especially before a disaster
occurs. The whole
community can participate in
programs and activities to
make their families, homes
and communities safer from
risks and threats.
Sincerely,
Stay Connected with
