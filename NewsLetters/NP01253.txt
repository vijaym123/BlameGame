Common Sense on Energy
Efficiency
Early this week, the House approved an energy
efficiency plan proposed by Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) and me. Our
bipartisan bill encourages owners and tenants to voluntarily improve energy
efficiency by using incentives not punishments. It also includes new
proposals for federal buildings and hot water heaters to make them
more efficient and save taxpayer dollars.
As someone who has
worked in the construction industry for over 50 years, I know how we
can improve efficiency and save money and energy. This bill shows how
when Democrats and Republicans come together we can get common sense
improvements passed.
The Inconvenient Truth About
Coal Power Plants
According to the United
Nations, shutting down all of Americas coal-fired power plants would
reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by only two-tenths of 1% - a
fraction of a fraction.
Why is this important? President Obamas
EPA is implementing regulations that threaten to shut down a number of
coal power plants because they claim the carbon dioxide is harming our
environment. This radical environmentalist agenda will drive energy
prices up, move manufacturers overseas, and make our electric grid
unreliable.

discuss
the Presidents dangerous push for an
Iran deal. Wednesday, I was with Howard Monroe on Wheelings WVLY to
discuss my
debate with delusional EPA
bureaucrats . And on Thursday,
Mike Queen
and I talked tax
reform, especially repealing the death tax.
