Dear Friend,
Last year&rsquo;s Tea Party shutdown almost led to a meltdown of our economy. As a result of Republicans&rsquo; inability to come to their senses, our economy took a $24 billion hit -- and this year,
they&rsquo;re threatening to do it again.
The government shutdown was always intended as an act of political theater aimed at the Tea Party base. That it happened at all is proof positive that the Republican Party cares less about middle class families than about their own political career. We can&rsquo;t afford another shutdown. I&rsquo;m joining with more than two dozen of my colleagues to demand that Republicans take a shutdown off the table -- add your name to mine.
The last government shutdown put the earned benefits of hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts seniors at risk. Eighteen historic sites around the Commonwealth were closed, and families and businesses across the country watched as the shutdown took money out of their pockets.
Shutdown politics means careening from crisis to crisis. The American people deserve better than this -- they deserve not to be threatened with another Republican-led shutdown. No more shutdowns -- that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re demanding, and that&rsquo;s a message Washington needs to hear. Sign our petition if you agree.
Thank you.
