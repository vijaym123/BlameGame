WKZO: Upton grills Takata Executives on
defective air bags
WASHINGTON D.C. (WKZO) -- West Michigan Congressman Fred Upton had some
hard questions
Wednesday for Takata Executives who were testifying before his Commerce Committee because they make airbags that take sometimes rather than save lives.
Takata executive Hiroshi Shimizu defended the company, claiming they have not been able to pinpoint the reason why some of their airbags have thrown out shrapnel when triggered, causing deaths and injuries.
He says they make their products to save lives and avoid injuries and that is exactly what they have done hundreds of thousands of times.
Upton says Takata knew about this problem ten years ago and has been dragging its feet ever since.
He says they continue to try to avoid a nationwide recall, and Upton says they have never been able to determine if the company is installing improved airbags or the same ones that have proven to be defective in come cases.
Honda says it will expand its recall nationwide, instead of in just a few southern states. U.S. Regulators want Takata to do the same.
