White House Leadership: Measured!
This
editorial
from yesterdays
Wall Street
Journal
clearly and
succinctly shows what happens when there is an absence of strong and
resolute American leadership from the White House.
Its well worth a
read.
Containing Russia:
Washington
Post
This
editorial
from the
Washington Post ,
which asserts that
Russias behavior since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down, has been
a lesson in barbarity and morally contemptible statecraft, explains
why condemnations of Russia
no matter how tough
are not enough to
change Russias behavior.
Israel Has the Right to
Defend Itself
Rarely do
Washington
Post
columnists
Richard
Cohen
and
Charles Krauthammer
agree on anything, so
when they do, it is worth taking notice.
Over the past several
days ,
they have each defined why Israel has the absolute
right to take the action it has in Gaza to defend itself from Hamas
both
as a moral right and as a matter of survival.
I fully
support Israels effort to destroy Hamas ability to wage war against
Israel and the Israeli people. Every nation has the right to defend itself
from attack.
Israel, which has been under almost continued
assault throughout its entire existence, is no different. Israels right
to exist is absolute.
I stand with
Israel.
The Yemen Model Wont Work in Iraq,
Syria
Katherine Zimmerman, a research fellow and the al-Qaeda team leader for
the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project,
penned
an interesting analysis of President Obamas
anti-terrorism partnership with Yemen.
In this piece, she not only
concludes that the policy is not working in Yemen, but also that efforts
to replicate the policy in Iraq and Syria would also prove
unsuccessful.
Its an article well worth reading.
Fixing
VA Health Care
Positive Steps Forward!
In
recent weeks, the House of Representatives passed, with strong bipartisan
support, three important bills that address the many problems the
Department of Veterans Affairs has had in delivering health care to our
nations veterans.
These bills will address the lengthy waits
for treatment by allowing treatment at non-VA hospitals in certain
situations and will also require management accountability at the
Department of Veterans Affairs. Performance awards and bonuses for VA
employees are also eliminated.
Shamefully, Senate Democrats
yesterday boycotted the House-Senate Conference Committee meeting that had
been called to reconcile the differences between the bills passed by
the House and Senate-passed legislation.
I hope the Senate
leadership rethinks its indefensible posture and returns to the conference
table to get these bills done!
House Acts to Simplify
Higher Ed Tax Benefits
With tuition bills for the
coming Fall Semester arriving in the mailboxes of families with
students in college, the House of Representatives yesterday passed, with my
enthusiastic support, HR 3393, the Student and Family Tax
Simplification Act.
This bill will make it easier for families to take
advantage of various higher education tax benefits by consolidating
four current programs into one.
These programs
the American
Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC); the Hope Scholarship Credit (HSC); the
Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC); and the tuition deduction will now be
part of one permanent, reformed AOTC.
The new,
permanent AOTC will a 100-percent tax credit for the first $2,000 of certain
higher education expenses and a 25-percent tax credit for the next
$2,000 of such expenses (for a maximum credit up to $2,500).
Eligible expenses include tuition, fees, and course materials.
The
credit is available for the first four years of higher education, and the
first $1,500 of the credit is refundable.

information about this bill, click

Obamacare Costing Medicare Advantage Seniors
Thousands of Dollars
When the President was trying to sell
his health care reform bill in 2009, he claimed that, Nobody is
talking about reducing Medicare benefits. Unfortunately, like so many
other promises made about Obamacare, his assurances about Medicare turns
out to be untrue.
The Medicare Advantage program
which
one out of every three seniors relies on for health care
has been
slashed by more than $150 billion under Obamacare. These cuts have cost
the average Medicare Advantage senior in the 11 th
Congressional District $2,045.16 so far.

these cuts and their effect on seniors across the nation, click

Salute:
100 th
Anniversary of Rutgers Cooperative
Extension
One-hundred years ago, Congress passed and President
Wilson signed into law the Smith-Lever Act, creating the cooperative
extension partnership. This landmark legislation created educational
opportunities for youths and adults concerning issues of agriculture. In
the years since, a state-by-state network of extension educators brings
to the people science-based knowledge and research in areas such as
agriculture, sustainability, environment, health, and nutrition.
New Jersey is home to the Rutgers Agricultural Experiment Station
Cooperative Extension, one of the finest programs of its kind in the
nation.
The Cooperative Extension provides several programs for
both young people and adults in areas such as healthy lifestyles, food
safety and nutrition, environment and natural resources, and economic
growth and agricultural sustainability in Essex, Morris, Passaic,
Sussex and other counties in New Jersey.
The Rutgers Cooperative
Extension has been especially active in promoting 4-H Youth Development
programs.
Among the 4-H programs are 4-H clubs, overnight
camping trips, and afterschool child care education
programs.
More information about this great program can be found at
here .
Salute: Abigail Rose
Beutler and Dr. Jessica Bienstock
Last year my
colleague Representative Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of the State of Washington
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Abigail Rose.
Unfortunately, Abigail was born with Potters Syndrome, an almost always fatal
condition.
Fortunately, the doctor who delivered Abigail, Dr.
Jessica Bienstock, was pioneering an unconventional treatment for
Potters.
This treatment saved Abigails life.
Earlier this
week Dr. Bienstock was a special guest in the House chamber, where she
was
recognized
by Speaker Boehner, who said, I
think our House owes a debt of gratitude to her and to all of our
doctors, nurses and medical professionals.
I couldnt
agree with the Speaker more.
Salute: For Former State
Assemblyman Albert Merck
I was very sorry to
learn that former State Assemblyman Albert Merck died on Tuesday at the
age of 93.
I knew Al and Kate, his wife, for more than five
decades.
He preceded me in the State Assembly, and I always found him
to be a valued source of wisdom and guidance during my tenure in
Trenton and then in Washington.
Als entire life was devoted to
serving others
as a public official, a philanthropist, and
teacher.
Al lived out the Biblical injunction, It is more blessed to
give than to receive.
He truly gave much during the course of his
long and productive life.
His wonderful sense of humor, keen
intellect, rock solid integrity, and generosity of spirit made him both
widely respected and admired.
Kate, his
beloved
wife of 68 years, and the rest of his family have my
deepest sympathy on his passing.
