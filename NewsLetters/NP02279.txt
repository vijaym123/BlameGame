Friend,
Our elections should reflect the voice of the people rather than being auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Just recently, the Koch brothers announced they plan on spending an unprecedented
$889 million dollars in the 2016 election--and Ami is already a top target nationwide.
One group-- whether funded by the Koch brothers or other corporate special interests-- shouldn&#39;t be able to flood our elections with dark money.
That&#39;s why we are emailing you today-- if we are serious about changing how campaigns are funded, we need to make our voices heard.
Click here to sign your name in support of campaign finance reform.
We need to take a stand, and your voice is always our most powerful tool--
add your name to our petition today.
Thanks again,
Team Bera
P.S. The Koch brothers plan on spending
nearly $1 billion dollars
in the 2016 election and it&#39;s only going to get worse--
j oin us today in demanding campaign finance reform.
