Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I enjoyed another busy week in Washington, but as the summer heats up
in our Nation's Capital I was happy to get back to the Bluegrass this
weekend!
Obamacare Costs Hurting Kentucky Families
As I travel across Kentucky's Sixth District I hear over and over how
Obamacare has negatively impacted many Kentucky families, causing their
premiums to go up and increasing their financial burden.
A recent study by Forbes
showed health care premiums have increased an average of 70 percent for
men and 40 percent for women living in the Sixth District.
In an effort to help improve health care outcomes and control costs, I
have introduced the Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act
with Dr. Ami Bera of California.
This bipartisan bill would improve patient care and lower health care
costs by implementing best practice guidelines and discouraging
frivolous lawsuits to help to protect the jobs, health and pocketbooks
of hardworking Kentucky families.
Holding Washington Bureaucrats Accountable
This week's revelations at the IRS are yet another example of the Obama
Administration's incompetence and lack of accountability or
transparency - from the failed Obamacare website to the release of an
architect of 9-11 from Guantanamo to the "disappearance" of key emails
related to the targeting of taxpayers by the IRS. I will continue
fighting for accountability and for action on the many bills the House
has already passed that would make energy more affordable, reduce the
high cost Kentuckians face while caring for their families, and most
importantly, create a better environment for job creation. It is
unacceptable that these bills are still collecting dust on anti-coal
Senator Harry Reid's desk.
Supporting Our Men and Women in Uniform
This week, I was pleased to support H.R. 4870, the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act of 2015, which funds the Department of
Defense. This legislation will help to provide the necessary funding
our men and women in uniform need to help defend our freedom and help
protect our allies and our national interest around the globe; ensure
we have the tools we need to investigate known terror suspects abroad;
prevent the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo; and increase funding
to help prevent military sexual assault from occurring, while providing
the necessary services to victims when it does occur.
I was also very pleased that this legislation included my requests to
support the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond by adequately funding the
Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternative (ACWA) program that supports
operations at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Plant
(BGCAPP), as well as fully funding the Chemical Stockpile Emergency
Preparedness Program (CSEPP), which will provide needed funds to state
and local governments to enhance emergency response management in the
event of an accident or fire at the Depot.
Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the
Original "GI Bill"
Today marks the 70th Anniversary of the Original "GI Bill," and is a
perfect time to celebrate the investment in the education and economic
prosperity of America's Service members and Veterans. The Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, or the "GI Bill," was enacted on June 22,
1944.
Kentucky veterans have sacrificed so much in service to our nation, and
we must work to support them during and after their transition back
into civilian life, both by providing the care that our veterans have
been promised, and continuing to invest in their education and their
futures.
Kentuckians in the Capitol
On Tuesday I enjoyed catching up with Dr. Mark Lyons and Brian Lawless
of Alltech. We had an informative conversation regarding Alltech's
Eastern Kentucky development efforts.
The Taylor family stopped by my Washington, D.C. office for a tour.
Harrison even took his turn in the Chairman's seat at the Financial
Services Committee!
Two students visited my office this week as part of National History
Day. I was delighted to meet the Sterrett family from Nicholasville.
Hannah was selected to represent Kentucky at the National History Day
event in Washington.
Emma Roach-Barrette from Menifee County also visited my office as part
of National History Day. Emma enjoys making documentaries and competed
in National History Day with a documentary of her own.
Congratulations to both Hannah and Emma!
On Thursday morning I greeted students and parents from the School for
the Creative and Performing Arts (SCAPA) in Lexington on the Capitol
steps.
On Friday morning Dr. Tyler Mark visited my office. I enjoyed learning
about the exciting research Dr. Mark is doing at the University of
Kentucky College of Agriculture.
I also had the opportunity to visit with two families from the district
on Friday morning. The Sponcil and McGraw families both stopped by my
office and visited before their Capitol tour.
Around the District
On Saturday, I was honored to speak to the Frankfort Chapter of the
Christian Motorcycle Association at their Inaugural Prayer Ride through
Franklin County. I hope this will become an annual event, giving riders
throughout the region an opportunity to come together for Christian
fellowship. Special thanks to Allen Richards and Mike Walden for
inviting me to attend!
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
Sincerely,
Andy Barr

Casework Corner:
Recently, a medical equipment company contacted our office for
assistance regarding issues with Medicare. Due to excessive red tape,
the business was not receiving timely payment for equipment it had
already purchased and delivered to patients.
This lack of reimbursement caused a severe financial strain on this
small business. We placed an inquiry with Medicare to resolve most of
their issues in less than a month. If you are currently experiencing
issues with Medicare, either with a Medicare beneficiary or business,
please contact my district office for assistance. We are here to help!

Celebrating

Today
marks
the

a

Kentucky
