Dear Friend,
Every March, we celebrate Women's History Month to recognize the women
whose leadership, vision and courage have strengthened our nation and
expanded rights and opportunities for all Americans. As the only woman
representing Pennsylvania in Congress, I have worked to address the
issues that affect women and families in the Commonwealth and
nationwide. This includes fighting to ensure equal pay for equal work,
promoting work and family balance, and providing access to quality,
affordable health care.
Our nation has made important progress towards equality, justice and
fairness for women - and for all of our citizens. But inequality and
discrimination still exist in our society and economy. That is why I am
proud to cosponsor the Equal Rights Amendment (H.J. Res 56) to ensure
constitutional protection for women, and the Paycheck Fairness Act
(H.R. 377) to help close the wage gap between men and women. Earlier
this month, I helped introduce the Women's Economic Bill of Rights
(H.Res. 507), which calls for pay equity, fair treatment in the
workplace, access to paid family and medical leave, and economic
security in retirement.
In Pennsylvania, women are paid just 77 cents on average for every
dollar paid to men, according to the National Partnership for Women and
Families. The wage gap is even worse African American and Hispanic
women. African American women make 64 cents and Latino women earn 55
cents for every dollar paid to a white, non-Hispanic man, according to
the National Partnership.
As a mother and a grandmother, I am committed to closing the
unacceptable wage gap, ending workplace discrimination and
strengthening protections against domestic violence. And I will
continue fighting to protect women's right to make their own health
care decisions, expand education opportunities, and raise the minimum
wage, which will help the women who represent two-thirds of minimum
wage workers.
As we mark Women's History Month, I am grateful to the women who have
struggled and sacrificed to strengthen our nation and ensure that our
daughters and granddaughters have every opportunity they deserve.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Every
March,
we
celebrate
Women&#8217;s
History
Month
to
recognize
the
women
whose
leadership,
vision
and
courage
have
strengthened
our
nation
and
expanded
rights
and
opportunities
for
all
Americans.
As
the
only
woman
representing
Pennsylvania
in
Congress,
I
have
worked
to
address
the
issues
that
affect
women
and
families
in
the
Commonwealth
and
nationwide.
This
includes
fighting
to
ensure
equal
pay
for
equal
work,
promoting
work
and
family
balance,
and
providing
access
to
quality,
affordable
health
care.
Our
nation
has
made
important
progress
towards
equality,
justice
and
fairness
for
women
-
and
for
all
of
our
citizens.
But
inequality
and
discrimination
still
exist
in
our
society
and
economy.
That
is
why
I
am
proud
to
cosponsor
the
Equal
Rights
Amendment
(H.J.
Res
56)
to
ensure
constitutional
protection
for
women,
and
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
(H.R.
377)
to
help
close
the
wage
gap
between
men
and
women.
Earlier
this
month,
I
helped
introduce
the
Women's
Economic
Bill
of
Rights
(H.Res.
507),
which
calls
for
pay
equity,
fair
treatment
in
the
workplace,
access
to
paid
family
and
medical
leave,
and
economic
security
in
retirement.
In
Pennsylvania,
women
are
paid
just
77
cents
on
average
for
every
dollar
paid
to
men,
according
to
the
National
Partnership
for
Women
and
Families.
The
wage
gap
is
even
worse
African
American
and
Hispanic
women.
African
American
women
make
64
cents
and
Latino
women
earn
55
cents
for
every
dollar
paid
to
a
white,
non-Hispanic
man,
according
to
the
National
Partnership.
As
a
mother
and
a
grandmother,
I
am
committed
to
closing
the
unacceptable
wage
gap,
ending
workplace
discrimination
and
strengthening
protections
against
domestic
violence.
And
I
will
continue
fighting
to
protect
women&#8217;s
right
to
make
their
own
health
care
decisions,
expand
education
opportunities,
and
raise
the
minimum
wage,
which
will
help
the
women
who
represent
two-thirds
of
minimum

As

I

to
the

have

and

to
strengthen
our
nation

our
