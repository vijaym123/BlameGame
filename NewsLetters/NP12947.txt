Update from Senator Bob Corker
January 19,
2014
Disappointed in Higher Spending Levels
On
Thursday, Senator Corker voted against final passage of a $1.012 trillion
discretionary spending bill.
I cannot support a funding
bill that violates the only real progress we have made in getting our
fiscal house in order over the past several years. Instead of building
on the gains we made in 2011, limiting discretionary spending, Im very
disappointed the Executive Branch and Congress continue to push for
higher spending levels, like those contained in this bill, without
enacting meaningful changes to mandatory programs that our country so
desperately needs, said Corker.
NSA Surveillance Programs
Senator
Corker, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, made the
following statement in response to President Obamas speech Friday about
NSA surveillance programs.
The continued leaks of
classified information threaten our security, undermining the gathering of
intelligence information necessary to keep us safe. Having received
detailed briefings in recent months, including at the NSA, about these
programs, I believe our intelligence professionals are committed to
following the law and protecting the civil liberties of innocent Americans.
At the same time, Im willing to consider appropriate changes that
would strengthen existing oversight and restore public confidence but not
at the expense of essential intelligence gathering. While we will
need much more detail on the presidents new policies before passing
final judgment, I am concerned that some of his proposals go too far,
limiting our ability to protect the nation with little benefit to civil
liberties of Americans, said Corker.
Honoring Martin Luther King,
Jr.
Senator Corker made the following statement today in honor of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. The federal holiday honoring King is
tomorrow, Monday, January 20.
Dr. King had a tremendous vision of
what our country could be, and he also had the courage to stand up and
pursue it, said Corker. As we honor his legacy, his example reminds
all of us to pursue public service in a way that ensures we leave
behind a better country for future generations.
