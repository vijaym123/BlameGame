Dear Friend,
Democrats are seeing some positive movement in some of the closest races in the country.
We&rsquo;re also seeing positive movement on our last monthly goal of the cycle -- but we&rsquo;re still $5,183 shy of our $16O,OOO goal.
Can you get us $5 closer to our goal before the deadline at midnight tonight?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Every day, I get to go to work with some of the most dedicated and passionate grassroots supporters in America. Ed&rsquo;s team is committed to getting out the vote here in the Commonwealth.
The more support we give our organizers, the better the results will be when the polls close on Tuesday. Give $5. Give $10. If you can spare $15, that helps too -- every last cent gets us that much closer to our critical $16O,OOO goal.
Only 9 hours left to hit this goal. We&rsquo;re moving in the right direction -- now, we just need to finish what we&rsquo;ve started.
Thanks for your continued support.
Colleen
