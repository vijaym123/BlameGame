Remembering the Fallen
On Memorial Day, we remember the men and women who have fallen in the line of duty and pay tribute to their
service to the United States of America.
This weekend, I urge you to pause from your celebrations of summer and take a moment to reflect upon the sacrifices of
generations of Americans who have given their lives in defense of freedom. We also remember the families who have lost loved ones in service to our
nation and lift them up in our prayers.
Thank you to all who serve, and have served, our great nation. Protecting our freedoms is not an easy job, and we are
truly grateful for your service.
I wish you and your family a safe Memorial Day weekend, and may God continue to bless the United States of
America.

House Passes USA FREEDOM Act
Throughout America&rsquo;s history, our country has been engaged in a profound debate on the limits of government. In the
Federalist Papers, the Founders argued passionately for a federal government that would protect the American people from foreign threats. At the same
time, they struggled to create a structure to contain and control that government in order to protect the God-given rights of the American people. In
drafting the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they maintained a careful balance between preserving civil liberties and protecting our citizens
from enemy threats. However, last year&rsquo;s unauthorized disclosure of the National Security Agency&rsquo;s data collection programs revealed
federal actions conflicting with these principles.
Just days ago, the House of Representatives approved historic legislation to rein in the NSA&rsquo;s sweeping intelligence-gathering programs
and end the bulk collection of Americans&rsquo; records by the federal government once and for all. The
USA FREEDOM Act
protects
Americans&rsquo; civil liberties by making clear that the government cannot acquire Americans&rsquo; records in bulk and puts real, effective limits
on what information the government can gather. The limitations created by the
USA FREEDOM Act
prevent overreach by protecting records of all
types, including medical records, email records, telephone records, and firearm purchase records. Under the legislation, the government must get
permission from the court to get records on a case-by-case basis. At the same time, the bill ensures that the federal government continues to have the
tools it needs to identify and intercept attacks as a part of counterterrorism efforts.
Nearly 225 years after the U.S. Constitution was drafted, the principles in this founding
document continue to guide us. I pray that the United States of America will remain a beacon of freedom to the world and a place where the principles
of the Founders, including the commitment to individual liberties, will continue to live, protected and nourished for future generations.
