Bond Agencies Cite Permanent Anti-Shutdown Provision Among Reasons for Upgraded Bond Rating
I was pleased to find that my provision to exempt the District of Columbia government from a shutdown in fiscal year 2015 was among the reasons for D.C.s recently upgraded bond rating .
The reference to my D.C. anti-shutdown provision will be potent ammunition as I try to move from the one year respite from D.C. shutdowns I achieved in response to my permanent bill.
The First Independent Investigation of the Secret Service after Breaches
Last week, after a House hearing in which I participated, the Department of Homeland Security said that a third-party investigation into the Secret Service, which I strongly advocated for , will be intitiated by December 15.
I do not believe that such an investigation has ever taken place, unusual for federal agencies which often are subjected to full Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigations and reports.
The President and his family deserve protection from a first- rate Secret Service that also knows how to protect public access to the White House perimeter.
DOL Ruling Brings Minimum Wage Increase to Federal Contract Workers
When federal contract workers organized, I joined them in their rallies for a wage increase , and the President acted.
Other American workers should be encouraged by the Department of Labor ruling last year that implemented the Presidents Executive Order raising the minimum wage for workers of federal contractor workers to $10.10.
The nations workers should take the example of public activism of these low-wage workers to heart and contact Congress to get the national wage increase that all workers deserve.
