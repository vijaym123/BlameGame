Dear Friend,
Last fall, millions of Americans and families right here in Missouri had their health insurance plans cancelled despite repeated promises from President Obama that if you liked your health plan, you would be able to keep it. Now, millions more with employer&#45;sponsored coverage are also facing plan cancellations because their plans do not meet ObamaCare&#146;s requirements.
In response to this problem, this week the House passed H.R. 3522, the
Employee Health Care Protection Act . This bill would help American workers keep their current health insurance plans and fulfill President Obama&#146;s broken promise. It would also give Americans in the group insurance market the opportunity to keep their current health insurance policies. Additionally, the bill we passed would give small businesses the option to choose non&#45;ObamaCare health plans. Our legislation would make health insurance more affordable and better able to meet individual needs.
I supported this legislation because individuals are better equipped to pick their own health insurance than the bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare decisions should be made by families sitting down at the kitchen table and discussing their individual needs instead of a one size fits all approach from ObamaCare.
Experts have estimated that as many as 50 million American workers with fully&#45;insured coverage are facing plan cancellations or disruptions because of ObamaCare&#146;s requirements and intrusive regulations. Last year Forbes magazine wrote, &#147;Starting in October 2014, many employees of small businesses will start getting the same notices that are now being mailed to individuals, informing them that their existing health plans are also being cancelled.&#148; The action we took in the House this week would ensure that this would not happen.
Without a doubt our nation&#146;s healthcare system needs reform. Healthcare needs to be affordable and accessible. Patients should be empowered and not burdened with rules and financial penalties from Washington. While the
Employee Health Care Protection Act
would fix one problem with ObamaCare, I remain committed to replacing the entire law with meaningful healthcare reform.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
This week I met with Tim Wolfe, the President of the University of Missouri. Go Tigers!
On Monday I had the opportunity to meet with the Little River Drainage District. For over one hundred years, the Little River Drainage District has been responsible for over 900 miles of ditches and 305 miles of levees. Their work keeps the Bootheel of Missouri, once a swamp filled with water that flooded from the Mississippi River, one of the most productive farming regions in the country.
I enjoyed meeting the VanGennip family from Cape Girardeau who was touring Washington this week. Our staff is always happy to welcome guests and facilitate visits to the Capitol! If you are planning a trip to Washington and would like to visit the Capitol, please contact my office at (202) 225-4404.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
