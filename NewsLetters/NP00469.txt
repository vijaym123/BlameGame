Dear Friend,
On May 17th, the same-sex couples that made Massachusetts the first-in-the-nation to allow marriage equality celebrated their 11th wedding anniversaries.
I want every loving, committed couple across the country to have the same opportunity for happiness. I want every couple to be treated the same under the law, and have the same rights and protections that come with marriage.
Those are just some of the reasons I support marriage equality.
What are yours?
The Supreme Court is deliberating the future of marriage rights in America. Vocalizing our support, and what this issue means to us, is perhaps more important now than ever before. A few of my colleagues and I are banding together to voice our reasons to support marriage equality -- and we&rsquo;d like to hear yours, too. Tell us why you support equality, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to share some stories on social media.
This fight isn&rsquo;t about politics -- it&rsquo;s about basic freedoms for our friends and families. It&rsquo;s about acknowledging the right of everyone to pursue happiness with whomever they choose.
The Supreme Court has the chance to extend the right to marry to every American and end the era of discrimination against the LGBT community.
And you have the opportunity to show them the reasons they should. Submit your reason for supporting marriage equality.
I am proud to stand with all Massachusetts families in support of marriage equality.
Thank you for joining us.
