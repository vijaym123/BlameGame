Today I'm writing to you in celebration of
the men and women who protect our country
overseas!
With Veterans Day fast approaching, we wanted to find a way to help our
heroes overseas. Here in our District Office, we serve as a drop off
location for a local non-profit called Packages From Home (PFH). PFH
collects and packages wish-list items for our soldiers based abroad.
With your help, we can fill our bin and make a trip to PFH before
Veterans Day.
Go here to learn more
about the items our soldiers like to receive and consider donating an item
to our office collection for Packages From
Home!
Last day to donate: Monday, November
10th, 2014.
Our Office: 10603 N. Hayden Road, Suite
108, Scottsdale, AZ 85260
