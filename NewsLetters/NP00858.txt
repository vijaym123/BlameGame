This week, a total of 113 Members of Congress filed an
amicus brief
with the 5 th
Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a continued injunction against the Administrations executive actions on immigration in the case of
Texas v. United States . The amicus brief states that the Presidents deferred action programs for unlawful immigrants are unconstitutional and contrary to Congressional intent. Signers of the brief include Congressman Randy Forbes, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and Senator Ted Cruz, among others.
In December, numerous states, led by Texas, filed a
lawsuit
in federal court challenging the Administrations executive actions on immigration. On February 17, 2015 a federal judge temporarily blocked the unilateral immigration actions. Since then, political appointees at the Justice Department have filed an appeal to lift the injunction. Oral arguments were heard by the 5 th
Circuit Court of Appeals on April 17, 2015.
