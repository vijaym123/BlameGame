Friend,
Over the last few months, we&#39;ve emailed you to share the importance of building our campaign early.
This is why: yesterday, we received news that John Boehner&#39;s political arm, the NRCC, is already funding live phone calls into our district against Ami.
That&#39;s right-- it&#39;s April, and our opponents are already trying to slander his record and mislead voters.
We won&#39;t be intimidated by these early attacks.
Let&#39;s show them that we stand behind Ami-- will you be one of 50 supporters to chip in this week? Help us send a message about the strength of our grassroots support.

These are the earliest attacks we&#39;ve seen yet , and it shows the NRCC&#39;s commitment to once again dump money into Sacramento County to unseat Ami in 2016.
We can&#39;t let them get ahead.
Last year, we saw that grassroots support can prevail over these national special interest dollars, but we must be prepared.
With your help this week, we can show John Boehner and the NRCC that their special interests have no place in Sacramento County.
We&#39;re grateful we can count on you.
Thanks,
Team Bera
P.S.
The NRCC is paying for live phone calls-- that means paid people are calling voters in our district to distort the truth about Ami.
That&#39;s why we&#39;ve kicked off the campaign early this year-- and we need 50 more people to stand with us this week.
Will you help us send a message by chipping in $5 or more now?
