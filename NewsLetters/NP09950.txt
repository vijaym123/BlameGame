Dear Friend,
One of my most important responsibilities in Congress is to ensure we
serve our veterans as well as they have served us. I wanted to share
with you the remarkable story of Hayward resident and Vietnam veteran,
Specialist Leslie Smith.
Specialist Smith was born in Switzerland but lived his adult life
thinking he was a U.S. citizen because he was promised citizenship in
return for his service in the U.S. Army. He was even provided a Social
Security Number. However, he was thrown for a loop earlier this year
when he was denied Social Security benefits, learning he was not, in
fact, a citizen.
Specialist Smith contacted my office and we worked with federal
officials to fix this injustice and secure expedited citizenship
processing. On April 16, Specialist Smith took his citizenship oath in
my Hayward office and I presented him with the Certificate of
Citizenship.
Click to watch the proud moment as Vietnam veteran Leslie Smith finally
becomes a U.S. citizen.
As always, it is an honor to serve you. If my office can help you or
someone you know with immigration services, the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) or another federal agency, please contact my East Bay
offices at 510-370-3322 or 925-460-5100. To stay connected, please
