The Scalise Capitol
Report
June 23, 2014
Humbled to serve
I am honored
and humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust and confidence
in me to serve as the next Republican Majority Whip of the United
States House of Representatives.
I will work relentlessly each and
every day on behalf of every member of the House Republican Conference
to bring a fresh voice and new ideas to the leadership table.
Now
is the time for us to join together so we can solve our countrys
problems facing hard-working Americans by advancing the conservative
principles that unite us and move America forward.
Click on the
photo below to watch me explain how we are going to continue to move
forward in the House as a more united team:
This is a proud moment for the
great state of Louisiana.
I was particularly inspired by all of the
prayers and encouragement from people back home.
I will never
forget where I came from.
It is a privilege to represent the
great people of southeast Louisiana, and I look forward to
bringing your voices, concerns, and values to the House leadership
table.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress.

Sincerely,
Steve Scalise
Member of
Congress
