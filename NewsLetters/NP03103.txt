Subcommittee Assignments

This week, Congressman
Doug Lamborn has been named to serve on the Strategic Forces and
Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittees of the House Armed Services
Committee.
I am
honored to be named to two extremely important Subcommittees that
protect our nation and are closely linked to our local military missions. In
Strategic Forces, I will continue to be a leader at the cutting edge
of our missile defense, military space, and energy related national
security programs. In ETC, I will be intimately involved in the
oversight of our efforts against terrorism and other unconventional dangers.
These Subcommittee positions are extremely important and I will
continue to be a strong advocate for a robust national defense
posture."
