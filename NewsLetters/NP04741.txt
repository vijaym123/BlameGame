All Donations 4X-Matched Tonight: https://secure.dccc.org/4X-MATCH-MY-GIFT
David -- everyone counted us out. Everyone.
But you know what? We kept fighting.
And now -- just 1 day out from the election -- we&rsquo;re seeing all of our hard work pay-off:
FOX NEWS
and
USA TODAY
are both out with new polls showing Democrats surging to a 1-point lead.
This shocking turnaround is only possible because you fought with us against impossible odds. It&rsquo;s because we still believe that simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
YES. WE. CAN.
Now, it&rsquo;s time to go out and shock the world.
Our final Get Out The Vote deadline is tonight at midnight. We still need 9 people from the 60659 zip code to make a quadruple matched donation. David -- will you fight with us one last time?
