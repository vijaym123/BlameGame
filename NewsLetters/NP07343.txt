Dear
Friends,
In President
Lincolns second
inaugural address he sought
to bring a divided country
together in describing a need
to heal the wounds of our
nation and our soldiers. He
declared it our imperative
to care for him who
shall have borne the
battle.
Nearly 100 years later,
the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) made those words
its motto and its mission to
serve and honor the men and
women who are Americas
veterans.
The VA has served our
veterans admirably for many
years, but it faces big
challenges. Too many veterans
are unemployed, too many
arent getting the most
out of their G.I. Bill
benefits, too many are
homeless, and too many
arent getting the
health care they need after
returning from the
battlefield.
This week I was proud to
support a bill Congress sent
to the president that will
help the VA meet its
responsibilities to our
veterans. The legislation
improves veterans
access to health care
services for those who are
waiting too long for care
they need. The bill increases
accountability for VA
employees, while also
providing the VA the
resources it needs to hire
more doctors, nurses, and
clinical staff to reduce wait
times and maintain
high-quality care at VA
medical facilities across the
country.
Earlier this week, the
Senate also unanimously
confirmed Bob McDonald as the
new VA Secretary. I met now
Secretary McDonald just
before he was confirmed and I
have the highest confidence
that hes the right man
to lead the VA out of this
difficult period. Congress
and the president must now
continue to work together
with Secretary McDonald and
the leadership of the VA to
improve veterans
access to health care and to
restore both veterans
and taxpayers trust in
the agency. Passing a bill
this week was a good first
step.
I will continue to do all
I can to honor and care for
our veterans as President
Lincoln would have
envisioned.
Sincerely,
Stay Connected with
Senator Carper
