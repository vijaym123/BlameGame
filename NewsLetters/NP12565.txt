Dear Friend,
As Congress begins the second session of the 113th Congress, I remain
100% focused on finally getting our nation's financial house in order.
My number one priority this session is to sponsor and pass bills that
cut government spending, reduce our massive deficit, and stop federal
borrowing at an unsustainable rate of $23,000 per second.
According to Forbes, Arizona is the number two state for projected 2014
job growth and I believe our federal government can take a lesson from
our state in business-friendly laws that promote growth and reduce
burdensome regulations.
This also includes reforming our federal entitlement programs before
they go broke. It is the duty of our government officials to make the
tough choices now in order to preserve these programs for current and
future generations.
I had the opportunity to attend the State of the Union address and my
thoughts are these: Americans don't care about "pens and phones"; they
care about jobs and paychecks. This requires a President who will work
with Congress to pass bills that grow the economy, not the size of the
government.
Separate from the speech, it was great to see Gilbert native, Sergeant
First Class Cory Remsburg, honored for his sacrifice. Last year, I was
privileged to have an opportunity to give him a U.S. flag that was
flown over the Capitol in his honor.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
service and be sure to sign up for my newsletter here.
I hope you are enjoying a happy new year.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
2014 State of the Union Address
I firmly believe that job creation and higher wages are a product of
economic growth, not mandates from Washington. Americans have a strong
spirit of ingenuity and will. We can and should support policies that
foster these values, not hinder them. Americans don't care about pens
and phones; they care about jobs and paychecks. Read my full statement

policy in the speech. Click here

My New School Choice Bill Gives Parents Flexibility
In honor of School Choice Week, I introduced legislation that will
offer parents the ability to use 529 tax savings accounts for qualified
K-12 expenses as well as college expenses. By offering this flexibility
to parents, they can save and invest in their students' whole education
from kindergarten through college. This will provide parents more
choices of schools, supplemental education opportunities, and necessary
equipment for their children regardless of where they are on their
educational path. When parents are given greater flexibility in school
choice, children win. Read my full statement here

Hearing to Evaluate Free Trade Agreement
As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I
convened a hearing to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) twenty years after its
implementation. We looked at intellectual property issues, trade
benefits and challenges, and how to streamline border commerce more
efficiently, without neglecting legitimate security concerns.
28th Amendment: Congress Should Live under the Same Rules it Passes
Over the years, Americans have become more incensed about Congress
exempting themselves from certain laws we end up passing on to the
citizens. How can the American people trust Congress to fix a broken
Washington when they don't even live under the same rules? Read
about my ongoing efforts with my colleague, Rep.
Ron DeSantis, to fix this very issue.

Dear
Friend,
As
Congress
begins
the
second
session
of
the
113th
Congress,
I
remain
100%
focused
on
finally
getting
our
nation&#8217;s
financial
house
in
order.
My
number
one
priority
this
session
is
to
sponsor
and
pass
bills
that
cut
government
spending,
reduce
our
massive
deficit,
and
stop
federal
borrowing
at
an
unsustainable
rate
of
$23,000
per
second.
According
to
Forbes,
Arizona
is
the
number
two
state
for
projected
2014
job
growth
and
I
believe
our
federal
government
can
take
a
lesson
from
our
state
in
business-friendly
laws
that
promote
growth
and
reduce
burdensome
regulations.
This
also
includes
reforming
our
federal
entitlement
programs
before
they
go
broke.
It
is
the
duty
of
our
government
officials
to
make
the
tough
choices
now
in
order
to
preserve
these
programs
for
current
and
future
generations.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
State
of
the
Union
address
and
my
thoughts
are
these:
Americans
don&#8217;t
care
about
&#8220;pens
and
phones&#8221;;
they
care
about
jobs
and
paychecks.
This
requires
a
President
who
will
work
with
Congress
to
pass
bills
that
grow
the
economy,
not
the
size
of
the
government.
Separate
from
the
speech,
it
was
great
to
see
Gilbert
native,
Sergeant
First
Class
Cory
Remsburg,
honored
for
his
sacrifice.
Last

privileged
to
have
an
opportunity
to
give
him
a

that
was
flown
over

in
his
honor.
