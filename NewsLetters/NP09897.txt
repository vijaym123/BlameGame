Kline's Corner REMINDER: Career and Jobs Fair Tomorrow
Dear Friends,
Happy Mother's Day! I wanted to take a brief moment to remind you of my Career and Jobs Fair tomorrow. To assist Minnesotans with an uncertain job market, I will be hosting a Career and Jobs Fair tomorrow at the Eagan Community Center.
Tomorrow, May 12
9 a.m.-1 p.m.
Eagan Community Center
1501 Central Parkway, Eagan
Too many Minnesotans cant find the jobs or hours they need to make ends meet because of the sluggish economy. I am pleased to provide this opportunity for Minnesotans who are among the millions of Americans looking for a job. I encourage residents of the 2nd Congressional District to attend my jobs fair and share this information with anyone they know struggling to navigate the uncertain economy.

Best wishes,
John Kline
Member of Congress
