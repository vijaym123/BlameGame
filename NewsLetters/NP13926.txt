I want your
opinion
on how to create more jobs and boost our economy.
I do not take lightly the challenges our economy is facing today or the grave situation that every American will face if the job market does not recover, but rather than merely writing more unemployment checks, we should advance policies that help put people back to work. That is why I am working with my fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives to create jobs by restraining excessive spending and restoring certainty in our economy by reducing the regulatory burdens that are making it impossible for businesses to grow and create much-needed jobs during the worst jobs crisis since the Great Depression.
Instead of expanding the size of government, House Republicans are focused on reducing excessive regulatory burdens, preventing harmful job-destroying tax increases, and stopping the out-of-control spending deficits that have created uncertainty for job creators and kept investors on the sidelines. Preventing the regulatory red tape coming out of Washington removes much of the uncertainty in the economy, and helps put Americans back to work.
I would like to hear from you. Please
