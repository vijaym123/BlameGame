Friends,
I just wanted to send you a quick update. As my team mentioned, the latest vote count on Friday saw our lead remaining steady at 697 votes.
At this point the race remains too close to call, and the Registrar will continue to count the final votes throughout the week.
We don&#39;t expect new numbers today, but hope we will get an updated count early this week.
With the vote count as close as it is, it&#39;s important that we continue to fundraise so that our staff can ensure that every legal vote is counted, and to make sure we have the best legal team in place should a recount occur.

You&#39;ve been fantastic so far in making sure that we have the funds necessary to ensure a fair election. Don&#39;t let up now.
And hopefully, before too long, we&#39;ll be celebrating.
Be well,
Ami
