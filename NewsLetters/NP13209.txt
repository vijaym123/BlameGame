Friends,
I wanted to be sure and update you on the latest legislative efforts to
rein in dangerous Constitutional overreaches by the Obama
Administration. President Obama and officials within his administration
have on numerous occasions acted beyond the Constitutional restraints
on the Executive Branch.
Under our system, the Legislative Branch enacts the laws and the
Executive Branch enforces the laws as they are written, with some
reasonable discretion to promulgate details. But, too often the Obama
Administration has selectively enforced or, in some cases, altogether
waived certain laws based on its preferred ideology. That effectively
makes the President a "super-legislator" of sorts. He can pick and
choose which laws matter, and which don't. This must stop.
I am proud to co-sponsor H. Res. 442 the Stop This Overreaching
Presidency (STOP) Resolution
, which would authorize the House to file a lawsuit in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge
particularly egregious instances when the Obama Administration has
demonstrated a lack of respect for laws passed by Congress, including:
*	The lifting of Affordable Care Act-mandated requirements on the
type of insurance providers can offer;
*	The one-year delay of the health care law's employer mandate;
*	The adoption of a policy against deporting certain illegal
immigrants, counter to U.S. immigration and naturalization laws; and
*	The decision to waive compliance with "welfare to work" laws.
The Obama Administration is not the first to overstep its
Constitutional authority. Most presidents in recent history have pushed
the limits of executive power. However, the actions taken in the last
few years have been especially blatant. President Obama and his
administration have recklessly stretched the scope of the executive,
aggressively imposing by administrative rule or regulation what they
could not achieve legislatively.
And, amazingly, in some cases the Administration has moved to delay,
tweak, or otherwise alter the very healthcare law it pushed to enact -
all while dismissing legislative proposals that would have the same
effect, but had the benefit of being legal.
If allowed to stand unchecked, these actions present a dangerous threat
to our Constitutional separation of powers.
I wish this wasn't necessary. I wish President Obama and his
administration officials had the self-restraint to act within their
Constitutional bounds. However, this administration's pattern of
aggressively overstepping its authority to implement policy and win
political battles leaves us no choice but to act.
The STOP Resolution allows the House of Representatives to seek the
intervention of the Judicial Branch to rein in these executive abuses
and reconstitute the proper separation of powers. I hope it also sends
a message to the Obama Administration that the House of
Representatives, as one half of a co-equal branch of the United States
government, will not stand by and watch it erode this country's
Constitutional framework.

Education Overreach
I have long been a proponent for getting the federal government out of
the habit of setting education policy. However, the Obama
Administration has recently unveiled new federal "guidelines" for
school discipline. According to a report by The Washington Post
, the administration is proposing "$50 million in
grants to more than 1,000 schools to train teachers and staff in
research-based strategies aimed at improving student behavior and
school climate.''
Here we go again! Has the Department of Education learned nothing from
messes created by "No Child Left Behind" and "Race to the Top?" The
federal government should not
be using grants and special treatment to coerce states and local
districts to comply with what the Obama Administration thinks is best.
After all, "guidelines" have a way of quickly becoming entrenched
policies.
Parents, teachers, and administrators in Alabama care deeply about
ensuring a safe learning environment for students, and I know they
welcome a conversation about improving discipline methods. But using
federal tax dollars to try to force one-size-fits-all federal policies
into schools is simply inappropriate.
All students need uninterrupted quality instruction. I would hate to
see well-behaved students punished by policies that allow bad behavior
to go unpunished.
A safe, well-behaved classroom is one in which the
teacher is empowered to keep order and enforce discipline. I am wary of
any policy that might undermine that critical role, and I will continue
to monitor this as it develops.
The Week Ahead
The biggest item on the agenda this week will be a new appropriations
bill to fund the government for the remainder of this fiscal year. The
legislation is still being finalized, and my staff and I are following
the process very closely.
Additionally, the House is expected to consider a number of bills,
including:
*	H.R. 2860
: The OPM IG Act;
*	H.R. 2274
: The Small
Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification
Act, and;
*	H.R. 3362
: Exchange
Information Disclosure Act.
As always, feel free to contact my office
to share your thoughts on any of these bills or any
issue of importance to you. My staff and I work for you.
Sincerely,
Washington DC

Friends,
I
wanted
to
be
sure
and
update
you
on
the
latest
legislative
efforts
to
rein
in
dangerous
Constitutional
overreaches
by
the
Obama
Administration. President
Obama
and
officials
within
his

acted

on
the
Executive

Under
our

and
the
Executive
Branch
enforces
the
laws
as
they
are

with

But,
too
often
the
Obama
Administration
has
selectively
enforced
or,
in
some
cases,
altogether
waived
certain
laws
based
on
its
preferred
ideology.
That
effectively
makes
the
President
a
"super-legislator"
of
sorts.
He
can
pick
and
choose
which
laws
matter,
and
which
don&#8217;t.
This
must
stop.
I
am
proud
to
co-sponsor
H.
Res.
442
the
Stop
This

(STOP)
Resolution ,
which
would
authorize
the

and The

recklessly
stretched
the
scope
of
the
executive,
aggressively
imposing
by
administrative
rule
or
regulation
what
they

And,
amazingly,
in
some
cases
the
Administration
has
moved
to
delay,

or
otherwise
alter
the
very
healthcare
law it
pushed
to
enact
&#8211;
all
while
dismissing
legislative

that
would
have
the

but
had
the

of
being

If
allowed
to
stand

these
actions
present
a
dangerous
threat
to

Constitutional
separation

I
wish
this
wasn't
necessary.
I
wish
President

the
self-restraint
to
act
within
their
Constitutional

However,
this

to

Education
Overreach
I
have
long
been
a
proponent
for
getting
the

policy.
However,
the
Obama

has
recently

According
to
a

the

behavior
and
school
climate.''
Here
we
go
again!
Has
the
Department
of
Education
learned
nothing
from
messes
created
by
&#8220;No
Child
Left
Behind&#8221;
and
&#8220;Race

the
Top?&#8221;
The
federal
government
should
not
be
using
grants
and
special
treatment
to
coerce
states
and
local
districts
to
comply
with
what
the
Obama
Administration
thinks
is

After
all,
&#8220;guidelines&#8221;
have
a
way
of
quickly
becoming
entrenched
policies.
Parents,

in
Alabama

A
safe,
well-behaved
classroom
is

which
the

discipline.
I
am
