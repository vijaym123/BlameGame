Friend,
It&#39;s the last day of our fundraising quarter, and normally I would be sending you an email pushing for our deadline-- but after what happened this morning, I had to reconsider.
This morning, in a shocking decision, the Supreme Court decided that employers are allowed to dictate what kind of birth control their female employees have access to.
Isn&#39;t that absolutely unbelievable? As a doctor, husband, and father of a daughter, I&#39;m infuriated.
I trust the women in my life and in my practice to have the final say in their birth control options - their body, their lives, their choice.
I&#39;m so stunned by this morning&#39;s ruling, I don&#39;t even know where to begin.
This is why elections matter. In Congress, I fight every day for you and your family&#39;s right to private, personal healthcare choices, free of government or employer intrusions. I can&#39;t say the same for my opponent.
That&#39;s why, if you haven&#39;t already, I ask that you pitch in $5 or more today to help us hit our goal. This is not about the money, but with your help, we can continue our fight in Washington.
I&#39;m frustrated, but I&#39;m not giving up. I&#39;ll continue to fight in Congress for personal freedom and the sacred right of complete and accurate medical care, free from outside influence.
Click here so I can keep fighting.
Thanks - talk soon.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - Despite today&#39;s ruling, this fight is just beginning. We will not sit down and be quiet - we&#39;ll continue this battle. Click here and give $5 or whatever you can now, and watch the video I recorded while supporting Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California on the steps of the Supreme Court.
