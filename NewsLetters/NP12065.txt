News from Congressman Scott Peters
February 26, 2014
Dear Friend,
Part of my focus in Congress has been promoting the importance of
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education for our
nation's long-term economic competitiveness. Explained below are two
different opportunities for local high-school students, the first
allows them to showcase their tech imaginations and the second regards
the fast-approaching college financial-aid deadlines.
House App Contest
Interested in creating your own software application? Students in the
52nd District have the opportunity to compete to create the best app,
as judged by a panel of local technology and innovation leaders. The
winner will have their app idea featured on my website and on display
in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.
To enter the competition students must submit their app's source code
online during the competition submission period, which began February
1st and runs through April 30, 2014. For complete information, check
out scottpeters.house.gov/houseappcontest.

Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
The college application process can be daunting, and figuring out
financial aid options is often overwhelming. If you have questions
about your FAFSA application process my office will work to answer them
and provide you with important information on the process. The federal
deadline for completing the FAFSA is June 30, but many states and
schools have earlier deadlines - some as early as this month, and many
next month.
Stay Connected
I hope you'll stay connected with what I'm working on. Like my Facebook
page, follow me on Twitter, add my Google + page
to your circles, or visit my website for
more information.
One of the most important jobs I have in Congress is providing a number
of constituent services. As always, if you have any questions, are
having trouble with a federal agency, or want to weigh in on a
particular issue, feel free to email me or call either of my offices at
202-225-0508 or 858-455-5550.
