Dear friend,
Happy
Fourth of July! As we gather at barbeques and parades around the state
today to celebrate, its also a great time to reflect on the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans and give thanks to those who have sacrificed to
defend them. To all of our servicemen and women serving abroad, as well as
all of our veterans, their families, and their loved ones
thank you
all for your service and sacrifices.
In New Hampshire we
are lucky to enjoy unparalleled beauty throughout the state that also
draws visitors from around the country and the world. Whether you are
in the White Mountains, the Seacoast, the Lakes Region, or your
backyard this weekend, I hope you have a chance to relax with friends and
family and enjoy the holiday.
Happy Independence
Day!
Jeanne
