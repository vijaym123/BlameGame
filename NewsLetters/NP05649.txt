Two Events Highlighting the Local
Economy
10/8/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn took part in two
events hosted by local businesses that highlighted the importance of the
local economy. First, was a groundbreaking ceremony for the new
Winslow BMW dealership. Phil Winslow and his wife Ann have been incredible
citizens of Colorado Springs for over five decades. Their family-owned
business has provided thousands and thousands of local jobs. Second,
the Congressman visited the Colorado Springs facility of Ultra
Electronics ProLogic. This cutting-edge group develops extremely advanced
materials in the realms of Communication Security and Cryptography. The
local team accomplishes vitally important work to the safety and
security of our nation.
