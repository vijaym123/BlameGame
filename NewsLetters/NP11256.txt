Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on my week! I really
enjoyed visiting with many constituents around the district and look
forward to taking your message to Washington.
I know you share my excitement that March Madness has officially begun!
Kentucky's Sixth District is the proud home of THREE teams in this
year's NCAA Tournaments!
I enjoyed watching the Eastern Kentucky University Colonels and both
the men and women of the University of Kentucky Wildcats Basketball
program represent the Sixth District so well!
America knows who the EKU Colonels are now! Congratulations to the
players and Coach Neubauer on a great season.
And how about those CATS! The men played hard and kept up the winning
record against Kansas State, while the women cruised to victory in
their fifth-straight tournament appearance.
I am ready to watch the Cats take on Wichita State here shortly and
looking forward to watching the women play tomorrow evening.
GO BIG BLUE!
Gaining Support for My Bipartisan Healthcare Reform Bill
On Thursday, I held a Healthcare Reform Roundtable with dozens of
medical professionals, healthcare providers, students, and others
interested in advancing real bipartisan healthcare reform.
I was glad to have this opportunity to share more information about my
bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act, which is real healthcare
reform that will help improve and lower the cost of care.
My bill, which I introduced with Congressman Ami Bera, MD (D-CA), would
lead to better, more affordable and evidence-based patient care by
removing the need for physicians to worry about practicing defensive
medicine, instead allowing them to focus on their patients' actual
needs.
I was glad to listen to their feedback about my legislation and hear
their personal reasons for supporting my reforms.

Casework Corner: Navigating the IRS
Navigating the federal government can be confusing. My office stands
ready to help when government red tape gets in your way.
For example, my office can help organizations navigate the application
process to receive federal approval as a charitable organization with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
My office was able to help the Michelle Williams Life Skills Academy, a
new organization focused on drug addiction treatment in Bath County,
quickly begin receiving donations as a charitable organization less
than three months after they opened!
And we were able to help the American Legion Post No. 63 in
Nicholasville by expediting their application for tax-exempt status so
they could begin receiving donations to help those at the Thomson-Hood
Veterans Center in Wilmore.
According to the IRS, some applications from the first half of 2012
have yet to be processed and thanks to my office's assistance, these
cases were solved in record time!
If you or anyone you know is having trouble navigating the federal
government bureaucracy, my office is ready to help
. Whenever we can be of
service, or if you have questions or comments about our federal
government, please contact my offices or visit us during our monthly
office hours in your county
.

What an honor for me to participate in the Letter of Intent Ceremony
Tuesday morning for Sayre School student Julian Mok. Julian was
appointed to attend West Point where she will play Division I tennis.
This accomplishment is a true testament to Julian's strong athletic
ability, academic success and most importantly, her character. I am
proud of her decision to serve her country and wish her the best of
luck at West Point!
I enjoyed participating in Sayre School's Don Jacobs Seminar and
speaking to the Upper School on "Civic Responsibility." I was
particularly impressed by the thoughtful questions posed by this bright
group. Thanks for having me!
It was my privilege to meet with new members of the Georgetown College
Administration on Tuesday. I enjoyed my visit with Georgetown's
President, Dr. Dwaine Greene, and Vice-President for Advancement, Dr.
Todd Rasberry. Welcome to Kentucky!
Thanks to the members of the Georgetown Rotary for their hospitality on
Tuesday. The Four-Way Test is on my desk in D.C. and I appreciate the
values Rotarians instill in their communities across the Sixth
District!
It was great to stop in to the Commonwealth's Capitol City to visit
with the 2014 Leadership L.E.A.P. class, representing Lee, Estill,
Wolfe, Owsley, Jackson and Powell Counties. They were in Frankfort to
learn about the different forms of government. I was happy to provide
my take on the federal process as well as the importance of serving as
community leaders.
On Wednesday, I was glad to meet with the Kentucky Homebuilders and
discuss the ways I am working to improve our economy by making
regulations more commonsense for lenders, homebuyers and homeowners in
Kentucky.
I spent a crisp morning with the God's Pantry Food Bank of Lexington
and the Woodford County Hope Ministries Food Pantry for their monthly
ride along and food drive. I had the responsibility of sorting and
delivering food provided by private corporations to the hungry of
Woodford County.
Thank you to the dedicated staff and volunteers for all the great work
you for our community!
