Friends,
As the New Year approaches, I always look forward
with optimism and excitement for what the year will bring. Whether you
resolve to set aside more time for daily devotion or finally complete
that household project, the New Year is a time to set new goals and
renew commitments.
As we begin 2014, I will remain committed to
serving you and our community.
Serving our community well
means providing top-notch constituent services and being accessible to
hear your needs, thoughts and concerns.
Over the past year, Ive hosted nearly 100 public meetings in
the district, responded to 30,000 letters, and helped over 1,500
constituents through casework. From hosting the student Congressional Art
Competition, to expediting passports, to helping folks who are having
problems with federal agencies,
I believe the work I do
through constituent services and casework is the most important part of my
job.
My offices in
Washington and North Carolina are here to serve the needs of the people
of North Carolinas Eighth Congressional District. Recently, a
90-year-old WWII veteran contacted my office looking for help dealing with the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The veteran previously applied
for benefits in 2011, but was denied because several documents were not
reviewed correctly by the VA.
My staff was able to work
directly with the VA to get this veteran what he truly deserved.
In addition to VA casework, we have also been able to help others with
Social Security or immigration issues.
As we begin a New Year, I look forward to renewing my
commitment to serving you.
What can we help
you with in 2014 ?
Help with a Federal Agency:
If you
can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if
you feel you have been treated unfairly, my office may be able to
help. Here is a brief list of examples that involve government agencies
and programs:
IRS and tax
matters
Social Security and Medicare
benefits
Passport
services
Immigration
matters
Veterans
benefits
Federal worker injury
compensation
Student
loans
Service Academy
Nominations:
If youre a high school student and would like to be nominated
to one of our nations service academies, contact my office to go
through the application
process.
Tours of Washington:
If
youd like to visit our nations capital, please reach out to my office
to arrange a tour of the U.S. Capitol and other national attractions.
This year, my office guided more than 1,000 of our citizens on tours of
the U.S. Capitol!
Flags:
You can purchase an American
flag through my office and you may also request that your flag be
flown over the U.S. Capitol. Flags can be flown for a specific person or
event on a specific date with enough advance
notice.
Congressional Art Competition:
Each spring, the Congressional
Institute sponsors a nationwide high school visual art competition to
recognize and encourage artistic talent in the nation and in each
congressional district. Students can submit entries to my office, and a
panel of judges from the district will select the winning entries. The
winning works are displayed for one year at the U.S.
Capitol.
It is truly an honor to
serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives. I promised to be
accessible to our community in 2013, and in the coming year, I will continue
to work just as hard. As we begin a New Year, please dont hesitate
to contact my office if we can help you in any way.
I wish
you and your loved ones a new year that brings blessings and joy, and
I thank you for giving me the privilege of being your
Congressman.
Until next
week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
