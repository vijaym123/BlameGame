Memorial
Day Weekend: Honoring Sacrifices that Protect our
Families
Residents of Morris, Essex, Passaic and Sussex counties will
gather in their hometowns this weekend to remember our unbroken line
of heroes stretching back to the days when General George Washington
encamped at nearby Jockey Hollow, part of the Morristown National
Historical Park.
Since the founding of the Republic,
the sons and daughters of New Jersey have always stepped forward to
serve. And from the battles of Afghanistan and Iraq, to the Korean and
Vietnam wars, to the trials of World Wars, to the struggles that made
us a nation, their names remind us that freedom is not
free.
Our nation
is
free and safe because of
brave Americans like these who volunteer to confront our adversaries
abroad so we do not have to face them here at home.
These
volunteers do the work of freedom so we can all live, work and raise our
families today in the greatest nation on the face of the
earth!
I know I speak for all of my fellow veterans when I say
that no one loves peace more than the soldier.
That is precisely
why all Americans should commit themselves today to the principle first
paraphrased in George Washingtons first State of the Union message
in 1790:
peace through
strength.
This weekend we must never forget that we are truly a nation at war
and the ongoing military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and
elsewhere around the globe make this weekend particularly
important.
Therefore, on Memorial Day 2015, we should remember the words of
President Harry Truman:
Our debt to the heroic men and
valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They
have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their
sacrifices.
Our prayers are also with those recuperating
from wounds of war and veterans suffering the effects of their service
and the families that care for them.
So, this
weekend, I hope you will take time to honor the men and women who have
worn the nation's uniform and were last seen standing
duty.
