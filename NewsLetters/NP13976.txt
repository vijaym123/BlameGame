Friends,
It is easy to get distracted in all the hustle and bustle of the
holiday season - the family to visit, the food to cook, the gifts to
buy. And who can forget it's also Iron Bowl week?
But this Thanksgiving, let's remember to count our many blessings and
thank God for all he has bestowed upon us.
I am so thankful for my husband, Riley, and our children, Margaret and
George. Not a day goes by that they don't remind me why I came to
Washington: to leave behind a better, more stable future for my
children and all those in future generations. I am thankful for my
parents who raised me and will always serve as models of wisdom and
character. I am thankful for the many friends who constantly surround
me with much-needed prayers and support.
I'm also thankful for the men and women of our military - many of whom
won't get to see their families this Thanksgiving. Their willingness to
serve keeps this nation the "land of the free," and for that I am
forever grateful.
Let's remember those who are right now serving in
harm's way and say a special prayer for them as our families gather
this Thanksgiving.
Energy Independence
Last week, the House passed important legislation which would increase
domestic energy production and help middle class families by lowering
energy costs. I had the privilege of presiding over the House of
Representatives as we passed one of the bills, H.R. 1900 the Natural
Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act
.
The House also passed H.R. 2728, Protecting
States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act
and H.R. 1965, Federal Lands Jobs and Energy
Security Act of 2013
.
These bills are part of a larger effort underway in the House of
Representatives to increase domestic energy production. Having access
to affordable energy is an issue that touches every single American.
More costly restrictions on energy producers mean higher electricity
bills, more expensive groceries and increased gas prices. Families need
affordable energy to make ends meet, and that's why I've joined in
pushing for an 'all-of-the-above' strategy that will keep costs low
while putting us on a path to energy independence.
Setting the Record Straight
As you may remember, earlier this year the House passed my bill - The
Working Families Flexibility Act
- which offers employers the option of offering comp
time, or paid time and a half off work, as a benefit to employees if
they want it. Unfortunately, some liberal activists have attempted to
spin my bill into something it is not by saying it somehow threatens
overtime pay. The Working Families Flexibility Act in no way ends
overtime, and if someone tells you it does, they are not telling the
truth.
The ability to bank overtime on top of a 40-hour work week is a
valuable workplace right, one that many families depend on to make ends
meet.
But, for some people, having the ability to earn extra paid time
off work is valuable too. Think about working moms and dads, those with
aging parents, or a military parent with a spouse deployed. Under my
bill, they could arrange with their employer to use the "time and a
half" overtime they earn as actual paid "time and a half" off work
instead of cash, if that's what they'd rather have.
No worker could ever be forced to take paid time off, just like no
business owner would be forced to offer it. This bill does not change
the 40-hour work week or how overtime pay is calculated. The same
protections that have been a part of labor law for decades remain, and
my bill actually strengthens protections for workers.
I am often asked, "why isn't this already legal?" That's a good
question. This "comp time" option is frequently offered and used in the
public sector, thanks to a 1985 revision of the Fair Labor Standards
Act allowing for it. So if it's allowed for government employees, why
not for everybody else?
I think if government employees are allowed this option, private sector
workers ought to have it too. I hope that you will help me set the
record straight and share the real story with any of those who are
spreading false information.
Staying in Touch
Again, I hope you and your family have a blessed Thanksgiving holiday.
As is always the case, if my staff or I can ever do anything for you,
please do not hesitate to contact my office
. It is an honor to be your voice
in Washington.

Friends,
It
is
easy
to
get
distracted
in
all
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
the
holiday
season
&#8211;
the
family
to

the

the

And
who
can
forget
it&#8217;s
also
Iron
Bowl
week?
But
this
Thanksgiving,
let&#8217;s
remember
to
count
our
many
blessings
and
thank
God
for
all
he
has
bestowed
upon
us.
I
am

and
for

I

Energy
Independence
Last
week,
the
House
passed
important
legislation
which
would
increase
domestic
energy
production
and
help
middle
class
families
by
lowering
energy
costs.
I
had
the
privilege
of
presiding
over
the
House
of
Representatives
as
we
passed
one
of
the
bills,
H.R.
1900
the
Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Permitting
Reform
Act .
T he
House
also
passed
H.R.
2728,
Protecting
States&#8217;
Rights
to
Promote
American
Energy
Security
Act
and
H.R.
1965,
Federal
Lands
Jobs
and
Energy
Security
Act
of
2013 .
These
bills
are
part
of
a
larger
effort
underway
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
increase
domestic
energy
production.
Having
access
to
affordable
energy
is
an
issue
that
touches
every
single
American.
More
costly
restrictions
on
energy
producers
mean
higher
electricity
bills,
more
expensive
groceries
and
increased
gas
prices.
Families
need
affordable
energy
to
make
ends
meet,
and
that&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
joined
in
pushing
for
an
&#8216;all-of-the-above&#8217;
strategy
that
will
keep
costs
low
while
putting
us
on
a
path
to
energy
independence.
Setting
the
Record
Straight
As
you
may
remember,
earlier
this
year
the
House
passed
my
bill
&#8211;
The
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act
&#8211;
which
offers
employers
the
option
of
offering
comp
time,
or
paid
time
and
a
half
off
work,
as
a
benefit
to
employees
if
they
w ant
it.
Unfortunately,
some
liberal
activists
have
attempted
to
spin
my
bill
into
something
it
is
not
by
saying
it
somehow
threatens
overtime
pay .
The
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act
in
no
way
ends
overtime,
and
if
someone
tells
you
it
does,
they
are
not
telling
the
truth.
The
ability
to
bank
overtime
on
top
of
a
40-hour
work
week
is
a
valuable
workplace
right,
one
that
many
families
depend
on
to
make
ends
meet.
But,
for
some
people ,
having
the
ability
to
earn
extra
paid
time
off
work
is
valuable
too.
Think
about
working
moms
and
dads,
those
with
aging
parents,
or
a
military
parent
with
a
spouse
deployed.
Under
my
bill,
they
could
arrange
with
their
employer
to
use
the
&#8220;time
and
a
half&#8221;
overtime
they
earn
as
actual
paid
&#8220;time
and
a
half&#8221;
off
work
instead
of
cash,
if
that&#8217;s
what
they&#8217;d
rather
have.
N o
worker
could
ever
be
forced
to
take
paid
time
off,
just
like
no
business
owner
would
be
forced
to
offer
it.
This
bill
does
not
change
the
40-hour
work
week
or
how
overtime
pay
is
calculated.
The
same
protections
that
have
been
a
part
of
labor
law
for
decades
remain,
and
my
bill
actually
strengthens
protections
for
workers.
I
am
often
asked,
&#8220;why
isn&#8217;t
this
already
legal?&#8221;
That&#8217;s
a
good
question.
This
&#8220;comp
time&#8221;
option
is
frequently
offered
and
used
in
the
public
sector,
thanks
to
a
1985
revision
of
the
Fair
Labor
Standards
Act
allowing
for
it.
So
if
it&#8217;s
allowed
for
government
employees,
why
not
for
everybody
else?
I
think
if
government
employees
are
allowed
this
option,
private
sector
workers
ought
to
have
it
too.
I
hope
that
you
will
help
me
set
the
record
straight
and
share
the
real
story
with
any
of
those
who
are
spreading
false
information.
Staying
in
Touch
Again,
I
hope
you
and
your
family
have
a
blessed
Thanksgiving
holiday.
As
is
always
the
case,
if
my
staff
or
I
can
ever
do
anything
for
you,
please
do
not
hesitate
to

It
is
an
