Mitch McConnell just delivered President Obama an outrageous ultimatum: EITHER:
Obama signs the Tea Party Republican agenda into law... OR ELSE:
Republicans will shut down the government
Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.
Twice.
And now, McConnell&rsquo;s openly threatening to SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT if Obama doesn&rsquo;t let the Tea Party set national policy. It&rsquo;s a disgusting abuse of power.
We REFUSE to let Republicans shove their Tea Party agenda down our throats. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching the
Shut Down the Tea Party Project.

David, we&rsquo;re asking you to join this project. We still need 4046 founding members to defeat Obama-bashing Tea Party Republicans. Can you chip in today? ALL MEMBERSHIP FUNDS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
We refuse to let Republicans like Boehner and McConnell win simply because they&rsquo;ve got Big Oil billionaire backers. But we need you to be a part of this.
If we hit our founding member goal today, it&rsquo;ll be a major victory for President Obama -- and humiliating blow to McConnell and Boehner.
Will you chip in any amount to become the first founding member from 60659 zip code? http://dccc.org/Founding-Member
