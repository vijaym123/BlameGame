David Johnson
As of 6:22PM: we&rsquo;re exactly $8,798 away from reaching an UNBELIEVABLE $1OO,OOO online in the first quarter. If every Democrat reading this email contributes $5 right now, we can get there by midnight:
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

Here&rsquo;s why your support is so critical:
Cheri is the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
The first public fundraising deadline of the election is in just 24 HOURS.
But the best reason of all?
This is just an INCREDIBLE milestone. $1OO,OOO online from 1OO% grassroots donations.
Look, we can hit this thing out of the park. But we can&rsquo;t waste any time. The deadline is at MIDNIGHT tomorrow. So David, we&rsquo;re coming directly to you. Will you chip in $5 (or more if you can) before the deadline? Every dollar helps. http://action.cheribustos.com/donate-here
