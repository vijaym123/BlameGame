Tanapag, Marpi among Army Corps cleanup sites
$2.5 million has been allotted for the cleanup of three formerly used defense sites in the Northern Mariana Islands this year. I worked to obtain a robust appropriation for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program,
which is the source of the funding. FUDS, as they are known, were contaminated by military activity during and after World War II. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for doing the cleanup. The projects for fiscal year 2015 include:
*
Tanapag Fuel Farm: $1.525 million. This project consists of the removal of 17 above-ground fuel storage tanks and then a study of any remaining contamination.
*
Marpi Point Field: $343,200. A study will determine the extent and types of unexploded ordinances on the property. The biological survey and digital mapping are in progress and should be completed by the end of March 2015.
*
Hospital Dumpsite: $587,300. The dumpsite is located at the Kingfisher Golf Course. A study will determine the extent of contamination and whether there is any risk to human health. The anticipated decision date is early spring 2015.

There are still five other FUDS sites on Saipan that require remediation: Koblerville Naval Supply Center, Naftan Bomb Storage, Naftan Ordnance Disposal, Northfield, and Ordnance Plan. Projects completed to date include the Tanapag Village removal of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), Kagman Airfield, and Edoni.

FCC releases net neutrality rules
The Federal Communinications Commission released its Open Internet Order
this week. I support the FCCs decision to ensure continued equal access to the internet for all users. To quote an FCC summary
of the 400-page Order: It means innovators can develop products and services without asking for permission. It means consumers will demand more and better broadband as they enjoy new lawful Internet services, applications and content, and broadband providers cannot block, throttle, or create special fast lanes for that content. The FCC's Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to legal online content without broadband Internet access providers being allowed to block, impair, or establish fast/slow lanes to lawful content. These are all values that are especially important for those of us who depend on the internet to shorten the virtual distance and increase communication between our islands and Asia, North America, and the rest of the world.

*
