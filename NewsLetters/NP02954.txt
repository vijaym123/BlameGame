U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper issued the following statement on the passing of U.S. Rep. Alan Nunnelee:
"With heavy hearts, Sidney and I extend our love and prayers to Tori and her entire family in the loss of Mississippi Congressman Alan Nunnelee.
Alan was not only a loyal and dedicated statesman, but he was my friend and encourager. His devotion to his family, his love for Mississippi, and his commitment to our Lord gave me strength and inspiration. He served his congressional district and the people of Mississippi with great care and dedication, and we will miss him greatly."
