David,
I know we&rsquo;ve been sending you a lot of emails this week. Sorry!
But the truth is, if we fall short on our final ad buy deadline, our chance to defeat Bobby Schilling- and keep fighting for Illinois&rsquo; hardworking families -
could be in trouble. With just hours to go, we need to raise just $850 more.
Polls show our race within a single-digit, so we can&rsquo;t afford to fall short on this one. Can you help us close the gap? You can use this link to make a donation: http://action.cheribustos.com/midnight
A gift of any amount helps, David.
Kindest personal regards,
Cheri
