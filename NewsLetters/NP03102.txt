Transcript of
video
Lamborn: Good evening, Im Congressman Doug
Lamborn
Tipton: And Im Congressman Scott
Tipton.
Lamborn: Thank you so much
for coming to Centennial Hall to show your support for Fort
Carson.
Tipton: Since its beginnings
over 72 years ago, Fort Carson has been a vital part of our community
and an essential part of our national defense. Today, this world class
facility houses over 26,000 active duty soldiers whose presence
generates an economic impact of over 2 billion dollars. That impact
positively affects our entire state, including the 3 rd
Congressional
District.
Lamborn: Fort
Carson is a unique installation that has the size, terrain, and community
support necessary to train our soldiers to meet the threats facing
our nation in a dangerous world. Thats why, during his visit I hosted
last year, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry
described our region as, the future of
warfare.
Tipton: The level of community support and the
breathtaking natural beauty have made Fort Carson one of the top two most
popular duty stations in the entire Army. Soldiers want to serve here
because theyve already heard about the type of support youll see
tonight
Lamborn: And they want
to serve here because they want to be on the cutting edge of the
latest military technology and operations. The 10 th
Special
Forces Group, a brand new Combat Aviation Brigade, a Stryker Brigade, a
world class Infantry Division, the most authentic possible training,
stunning natural beauty and outdoor opportunities, and a community that
admires and supports their sacrifices. Fort Carson is a top-notch
facility in the best region in America. Please join us and do your part to
Keep Carson
Strong !
