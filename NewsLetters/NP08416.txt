Wicker Urges Administration to
Drop
Proposed Rule for U.S. Waters
Power
Grab Threatens to Infringe on the
Rights of
Mississippi's Property
Owners
A controversial new rule by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could expand federal
authority in ways that drastically interfere with Mississippians' lives.
The agencies want to broaden the definition of "waters of the United
States," which determines the bodies of water that are covered by the
Clean Water Act. Specifically, small streams, farm ditches, wetlands,
and ponds could be subject to costly and time-consuming permits and
requirements.
More Authority for Washington
Bureaucrats
Like many of our
state's landowners, small businesses, and municipalities, I am opposed to
this extreme example of the Obama Administration's regulatory
overreach.
The proposed rule would allow Washington bureaucrats to have
influence over bodies of water traditionally under the scope of state
and local authorities.
The
impact of such federal intrusion could take a toll on economic growth,
presenting major challenges for local officials.
Counties, for
example, could have trouble properly maintaining ditches and flooding
precautions.
Private citizens' property rights could be
curtailed as environmental groups looking to use the expansive rule in federal
court draw landowners into litigation. For the more than 15,000 beef
producers in Mississippi, even cattle grazing near a mud hole or pond
could be regulated by Washington.
Less Transparency
in Rulemaking
Process
Given the rule's far-reaching consequences, it is disappointing
that EPA and the Corps have failed to follow the proper procedural
actions, such as consulting with stakeholders and evaluating regulatory
alternatives.
A rushed approach suggests the Obama Administration is
more interested in pursuing a radical agenda than a transparent and
fair rulemaking process.
The Clean
Water Act has protected U.S. waters since 1972 using time-honored
definitions.
A rule by the Administration that drastically expands
the "waters of the United States" provision would not only challenge
the intent of Congress but also defy the decisions of the Supreme
Court, which has ruled on the provision
twice.
Senate Bill
Would Stop
Overreach
There is strong support in Congress to prevent EPA and the Corps from
increasing their jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act.
On June
19, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) introduced the "Protecting Water and
Property Rights Act of 2014" to stop the agencies' proposed rule from
being finalized.
The bill is similar to an amendment considered
during last year's debate on the "Water Resources Development Act" (WRDA)
prohibiting the agencies from this expansion of federal authority.
I am a cosponsor of Sen. Barrasso's legislation and voted in favor
of the related WRDA
amendment.
In an economy desperate for growth, a regulatory onslaught is the wrong
way to encourage jobs and investment.
Onerous federal mandates
and requirements ultimately saddle consumers with higher prices and
leave job creators with more uncertainty.
