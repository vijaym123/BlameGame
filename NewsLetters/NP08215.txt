DISTRICT
June 27, 2014
Dear
Friends,
This week, I was joined by Chamber of Commerce and community
leaders in Washington, DC for a special Fly In to advocate for
local initiatives and projects important to our region.
We focused
our attention on securing and expanding our modeling and simulation
industry, improving veterans health care and enhancing our
transportation infrastructure.
Most importantly, attendees for the
first time had the opportunity to hear from and question Dr. Heidi
Shyu, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army for modeling, simulation
and technology contracting.
From the discussions, progress is
being made to further utilize modeling and simulation for manpower
readiness and for keeping Central Florida the leader in this high tech
industry.
Our meetings with veterans officials underscored the
importance of keeping now vacant facilities open and available to provide
for our men and women who served.
These meetings were an
excellent opportunity to bring before Congressional leaders and officials our
District 7 regional priorities.
I appreciate the
incredible local participation in our Fly In and look forward to
continuing these efforts to promote matters important both locally and
nationally.
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
