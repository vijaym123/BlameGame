Recognizing Hoosier Leadership in Congress - Majority Whip Kevin
McCarthy Visits Indiana
Earlier this month, it was my pleasure to invite and host Majority Whip
Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) in Indiana.
We visited with Rafael Sanchez of RTV6 for an interview that aired on
the April 13 edition of Indianapolis this Week.
If you missed the
interview, you can watch it here
.
Reps. Rokita and McCarthy on Indianapolis This Week 4-13-14
We discussed a wide range of issues and problems that, at their core,
all had one simple answer: empower individuals, families, and
communities, and not the federal government to make the best decisions
for themselves.
Whether it be crime, poverty, or unemployment, the
federal government is not the answer.
Republicans are fighting for all
people so they can build better lives for themselves and their families.
Reps. Rokita and McCarthy Field Questions from Orthopaedic Surgeons
4-11-14
In addition to speaking with RTV6, Rep. McCarthy and I participated in
a healthcare roundtable hosted by the Indiana Orthopaedic Society
.
As you might imagine, doctors of all practices are
concerned with the impact of ObamaCare.
Both Rep. McCarty and myself
will continue working to protect Hoosiers from the burdens of ObamaCare
and I will continue to push for the reforms offered in the American
Health Care Reform Act
.

Engaging the Next Generation About Our National Debt
Last week, I brought my debt presentation to Purdue University.
I am
continuing my efforts to engage the next generation of Americans on an
issue that is so critical to their future.
If you'll recall, in
December, I made the same presentation to students at Harvard
University
.
Rokita Discusses the Federal Budget at Purdue 4-14-14
This is the same debt presentation I've delivered all over Indiana and
on the House floor (which you can watch on YouTube
).
You can
also read a PDF copy of the presentation here
The PDF has been updated to reflect the recent House Budget, and the
Ryan-Murray Budget agreement.
Rep. Rokita Delivers Debt Presentation Remarks on the House Floor
4-24-13
I enjoyed meeting the students there and discussing the debt that, if
unaddressed, they, along our children and grandchildren, stand to
inherit.
It is always a surprise to people what makes up the bulk of
our federal spending, and how large the problem really is.

Protecting the Freedom and Future of the Internet - DOTCOM Act Clears
Committee
On April 10, the Communications and Technology Subcommittee of the
Energy and Commerce Committee cleared legislation that I introduced,
the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters (DOTCOM) Act.
The DOTCOM Act prohibits the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) from turning over
its domain name system oversight responsibilities by requiring a
thorough review by the Governmental Accountability Office (GAO) and
evaluation of that review by Congress.
Several weeks ago, the Obama Administration's NTIA announced
it would begin to transfer that control,
ignoring the impact it would have on the freedom of the internet and
the economic impact it would have on the global economy.

Make sure to tune into Garrison on WIBC 93.1 in Indianapolis this
Monday at 10:30 am ET.
I'll be live with Greg discussing recent events.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita
