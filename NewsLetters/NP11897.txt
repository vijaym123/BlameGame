Dear David,
I'll be holding a Telephone Town Hall tomorrow,
March 4, 2014 at 7:00 PM. Will you join?
Click here to register and participate in my town
hall.
A telephone town hall is a large-scale
town hall meeting conducted over the phone. Such town halls allow
thousands of constituents to particpate, including those who would not be
able to travel to an in-person town hall
meeting.
During the town hall meeting I'll be discussing the work I am doing to
create jobs and grow our economy in Rochester and Monroe County. At the
start of the town hall I will deliver opening remarks about jobs and
our economy, and then open the floor to questions from participants like
you.
If you would like to attend my
Telephone Town Hall, simply register by clicking on the following
link:

Once registered, you will
receive a phone call at 7:00 PM tomorrow to connect you to my town
hall.
Simply pick up the phone and stay on the line to be
automatically connected to the town
hall.
Participating in my telephone town hall is FREE, and open to all constituents in
the 25th Congressional District.
If you live in Monroe
County, NY I strongly encourage you to register today and attend
tomorrow's town hall.
Click here
to register and I look forward to speaking with you
tomorrow.
Sincerely,
