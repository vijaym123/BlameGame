$586 billion.
That is the amount by which consumers disposable income could decrease, as a result of the estimated $289 billion more in electricity costs incurred if the Environmental Protection Agencys planned regulations at the center of the Presidents climate change initiative are enacted, according to
a new study
released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Institute for 21st Century Energy. The Obama administrations proposal to impose new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants could exceed $50 billion in annual costs through 2030.
Our analysis shows that Americans will pay significantly more for electricity, the Institute for 21 st

reads, see slower economic growth and fewer jobs, and have less disposable income. Potential EPA regulations would result in a very slight reduction in carbon emissions, which would be overwhelmed by global increases. The study goes on to report that as many as 224,000 jobs would be eliminated annually through 2030 under the proposal.
Bottom line:
ineffectively attempting to conserve our environment, at the expense of our economy and American families, is unacceptable. Bypassing the democratic process and Congress, who serves to represent the voice of the American people, to do so, is simply inexcusable.

P.S.
I cosponsored the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act ( H.R. 367 ), which requires that Congress take an up-or-down vote on every new, major rule issued by a federal agency before it can be enforced on businesses and the American people.
I also supported the ALERRT Act ( H.R. 2804 ), which put measures in place to eliminate excess regulations, and requires more transparency from federal agencies.
