with Congresswoman Doris Matsui celebrating Older Americans
Month
May is Older Americans Month.
Its an important time
to talk about the many contributions that older Americans have made
and continue to make to our community and to our country.
Its
also an important time to reflect on the importance of the Older
Americans Act, Medicare and Medicaid
which all turn 50 in July
and Social
Security, which celebrates its 80 th
anniversary in
August.
Together, these four national treasures improve lives and
help seniors live in dignity.
They are national treasures and
they are part of the American landscape.
Yet, they are under
attack from those are trying to reduce benefits and services.
We
are hearing from some who want to cut Social Securitys earned
benefits, raise the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare, or
reduce spending for senior housing, nutrition, transportation and job
training.
The Republican budget resolution passed last month
seeks to cut Medicaid
the largest payer for home-based, community and
nursing home long-term care services
by more than $1 trillion over
the next 10 years.
That same budget would also repeal major
improvements made to Medicare in the Affordable Care Act
raising
prescription drug costs to seniors as well as people with
disabilities.
As co-chair of the Democratic Caucus Seniors Task Force, Im
fighting as hard as I can to protect Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid
and the Older Americans Act. But simply protecting them as is is not
enough.
More and more Americans are concerned that they will
never be able to retire and maintain their standard of living
or
that they may not be able to retire at all.
The National Institute
for Retirement Security estimates that the average working household
has only $2,500 saved for retirement and households headed by someone
age 55 to 64 have only $14,500.
Nearly 3 in 4 Americans
will rely on their earned Social Security benefits for the majority of
their income; for 1 in 4, it is their only source of income.
That
is why I believe we need to expand benefits and provide a more
accurate cost-of-living adjustment.
I also believe we need to look at
ways to make health care more affordable.
One step we could take
is to expand Medicare to cover vision, dental and hearing
services.
And its time that we provide enact a long-term care strategy
one of the biggest expenses that face older Americans and their
families.
My office is always happy to help you if you have
questions about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid or other senior
issues.
