According to the
World Health Organization , as of August 1 st , there have been over 1,600 reported cases of the Ebola virus, and nearly 900 deaths, stemming from the African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.
Two Americans
have contracted the disease while working in Liberia on a medical mission trip. Both are currently being treated at Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta, and have received doses of an
experimental drug , ZMapp.
While there is not currently an approved vaccine or cure for the Ebola virus, the National Institutes of Health is
fast-tracking
the development of an approved vaccine.
Currently, use of an experimental drug can receive
FDA
approval if it will be used to treat a patient with a serious or life-threatening disease for which there is no alternative treatment.
Further, if border patrol officers recognize an individual with symptoms of the virus, they can be quarantined and evaluated by medical personnel at ports of entry, and airports are utilizing a
screening process
before and after passengers enter the U.S. from the affected African countries.
