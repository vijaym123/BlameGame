Dear Neighbors,
I want to share with you some resources and information to help make
choosing a health insurance plan a little simpler.
I know the initial rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been
incredibly frustrating-frankly, unacceptable. It is because of my
commitment to the law's long-term success that I know there must be
immediate improvements and fixes to the problems with which we are all
too familiar.
As the Administration works to correct these problems, I want to make
sure that everyone in the Tenth District who wants or needs health
insurance knows where and how to enroll. To assist you as you consider
your coverage options, I've compiled below some links that may be
helpful:
*	Visit GetCoveredIllinois (http://getcoveredillinois.gov/
) to start your healthcare coverage search and find
answers to questions or find local assistance to guide you through the
process.
*	Through the GetCoveredIllinois site, individuals and families
can begin the enrollment process here
, and small
businesses can get started here
.
*	The GetCoveredIllinois site also offers answers to
frequently-asked-questions for individuals, families and businesses you
can reach directly here
.
*	If you are looking for enrollment assistance over the phone or
in person from someone specifically trained to help people sign up for
healthcare coverage, this tool
allows you to search for the nearest help in
your area.
*	To check your eligibility for Medicaid, you can visit the State
of Illinois's Medicaid homepage
.
If you would prefer in-person or over-the-phone enrollment assistance
in your specific area, I've also provided a list of locations on my
website that you can link to here:
*	Lake County:
http://schneider.house.gov/Lake-County-Enrollment-Locations
*	Cook County:
http://schneider.house.gov/Cook-County-Enrollment-Locations
Finally, and importantly, to confirm your enrollment be sure to contact
your new insurance provider. Since enrollment processing time varies by
provider, I included the contact numbers for all Illinois providers
here
on my website. Also, be sure to
ask about paying your first premium and when coverage officially
begins.
Should you need any help along the way, feel free to contact my office
any time, either online
or by phone at (847) 793-0625.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
