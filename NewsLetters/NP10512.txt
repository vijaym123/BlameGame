Check out Rep. Garrett's
opinion piece
on the U.S. overly complex tax code.
Dear Friend,
As you finalize this years tax returns, I hope you realize you are not the only one feeling frustrated.
In fact, I hope youll take a few moments to read
my opinion piece
in today's
Express Times
explaining why a simpler, fairer, and flatter tax structure is the solution to our current tax code woes.
I believe its time for us to simplify every Americans tax filing, saving time and hard-earned money, and creating much-needed certainty for job creators and small business owners.
Please feel free to share this note with friends and family who might also be frustrated about the tax code and sound off on my
Facebook
or
Twitter
pages with your thoughts.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
