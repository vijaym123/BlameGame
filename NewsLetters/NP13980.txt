Dear Friends,
I am sure many of you
are frustrated with the roll out of the healthcare.gov website and for
good reason. I do know that the technical difficulties will be fixed
and we will then continue to establish the best health care system for
Americans in the history of this country. Some of you who have had your
insurance companies cancel your individual policies because they do
not meet the new requirements of offering a comprehensive plan should
take note on the administrative changes President Obama has made to
give you the choice of staying on your current policy, or getting a new
and more comprehensive policy on the new exchanges.
Please read
the important messages below for more information on the new
changes.
The President announced that insurers can offer
consumers the option to renew their 2013 health plans in 2014, without
change, allowing them to keep their
plans.
To access
this option, insurers must notify enrollees that they can purchase
coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace where they can
potentially qualify for premium tax credits.
And they must tell
consumers what protections they are giving up to keep the plan they
have.
This option will not allow older plans to be sold to new
customers in 2014, which would undermine the Marketplace and drive up
premiums for millions of hard-working
Americans.
In
short, this administrative fix will give consumers more information
and choices, including keeping their old
plans.
As the
President said, this fix wont solve every problem for every
person.
But it will help a lot of people.
Doing more will require
cooperation from Congress.
He has said from the very beginning
that he is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to fix
problems as they arise.
This fix is an example of what he was talking
about.
But lets not pretend that the old individual market is a
place worth going back to.
Year after year, Americans were
routinely exposed to financial ruin, denied coverage due to a minor
preexisting condition, or dropped from coverage altogether
even if they
paid their premiums on time.
Thats why the President wont accept
proposals that are just another brazen attempt to repeal this law and
drag us back to that broken
system.
The
majority of Americans have employer-based health insurance that is already
providing quality health
coverage.
The Affordable Care
Act strengthens employer coverage while creating new protections for
people in the individual market
preventing them from being charged
more because of a pre-existing condition or getting fewer benefits like
mental health services or prescription
drugs.
The new
Health Insurance Marketplace will help millions of hard-working
Americans find affordable health insurance.
Premiums are, on average,
16 percent below what was originally projected.
Nearly one in
four insurers offering health plans through the Marketplace are selling
to individuals for the first
time.
Except for
the grandfathered plans, health insurers in the individual and small
group markets have to adopt new consumer protections.
In some
instances, they are doing so by cancelling current policies and
replacing them with new and sometimes more costly
plans.
Under the Presidents direction, HHS announced that it will allow
insurers to offer renewals of their current policies without adopting
the 2014 market rule changes.
This gives current enrollees the
choice of staying in their plan next year.
HHS will consider the
impact of this transitional policy in assessing whether to extend it
beyond
2014.
To ensure consumers are informed about
their options, insurers who are offering renewal of 2013 plans must let
consumers know what protections the renewed plan is not including and
how they can learn about new plans with better protections and possibly
tax
credits.
To protect against premium impacts of
this change, HHS intends to adjust the temporary risk corridor program
which is designed to stabilize premiums as changes are
implemented.
Whether an individual can keep their current plan also
depends on their insurance company and State insurance commissioner
but it will no longer be implementation of the law that is forcing
them to buy a new
plan.
With many of enrollees staying
in their individual market plan for a year or less, the number of
people in these bare-bones policies will decrease over time.
This new
action provides a smoother transition for some while allowing others
to go to the Marketplace now to gain the new protections, often at a
lower price
keeping the Marketplace
strong.
This
President is focused on fixing the law and making it work.
And he
is willing to work with anyone in Congress willing to do the
same.
But lets not forget, the Upton bill is just the House
Republicans latest attack as part of their strategy to bring down the
Affordable Care Act piece by piece.
I
will continue to support the Affordable Care Act that will bring health
insurance to all who are eligible. In the Congressional District 15 of
Texas, 34% of the residents are uninsured. By insuring those
thousands our district will save millions of dollars in health care costs that
otherwise would fall on every tax paying resident.
Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
Member of
Congress
