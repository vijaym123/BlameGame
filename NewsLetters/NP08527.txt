News from Representative John Delaney
June 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
Today, the Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act passed in the
House of Representatives, and with it, my amendment to help military
families stay together while veterans and service members are receiving
treatment at VA and military hospitals.
During floor debate on Wednesday, I introduced an amendment which
increases federal support for the Fisher House Foundation. This
non-profit builds homes near hospitals around the country and then
donates them to our military. Since 1990, Fisher Houses have served
over 180,000 families, including 22,000 families in the last year
alone. Today, the Fisher House Program has not only saved our service
members and veterans hundreds of millions in expenses, but has also
provided an invaluable service, keeping military families together
during a challenging time.
When our service members and veterans receive treatment at a military
or VA hospital, their families are often faced with a difficult
dilemma, stay home or find the funds to cover travel and lodging. Some
of families simply can't afford the expense of traveling at all, while
others have been known to sleep in cars outside of hospitals or to set
up tents in the parking lot.
This is a program that works and serves a truly important need. My
amendment increased our support for next year from $4 million to $20
million dollars. That means more husbands and wives, fathers and sons,
sisters and brothers than can be together.
This increased funding is fully offset, by reducing the Operation and
Maintenance Defense-wide account.
We've all been disturbed by recent reports of extended backlogs,
year-long wait times and falsified records at VA care centers. Failing
our veterans is unacceptable, and here in Congress I've worked to take
a stand for our service members by supporting legislation that
strengthens veterans' access to care
and
improves the administration of veterans' benefits. This is a
multifaceted problem and we must continue to be vigilant. If you are
having problems with the VA please contact my office immediately.
Fisher House is a priority for me and this is the second year I have
fought for this program. The full Department of Defense appropriations
bill, which includes my amendment, passed the House on Friday and now
goes to the Senate. I look forward to continued work with both parties
to make sure that my amendment moves forward and we can bring more
families together.
As Congress continues debate on the federal budget for the upcoming
fiscal year, please follow me on Facebook
and Twitter
to learn more about my work to
ensure that support for service members and military families remains
at the top of the agenda. Please feel free to contact my office
with your
comments on my amendment and your legislative priorities as the 113th
Congress moves forward.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
June

2014
Dear
Friend,
Today,
the
Department
of
Defense
(DOD)
Appropriations
Act
passed
in
the
House
of
Representatives,
and
with
it,
my
amendment
to
help
military
families
stay
together
while
veterans
and
service
members
are
receiving
treatment
at
VA
and
military
hospitals.
During
floor
debate
on
Wednesday,
I
introduced
an
amendment
which
increases
federal
support
for
the
Fisher
House
Foundation.
This
non-profit
builds
homes
near
hospitals
around
the
country
and
then
donates
them
to
our
military.
Since
1990,
Fisher
Houses
have
served
over
180,000
families,
including
22,000
families
in
the
last
year
alone.
Today,
the
Fisher
House
Program
has
not
only
saved
our
service
members
and
veterans
hundreds
of
millions
in
expenses,
but
has
also
provided
an
invaluable
service,
keeping
military
families
together
during
a
challenging
time.
When
our
service
members
and
veterans
receive
treatment
at
a
military
or
VA
hospital,
their
families
are
often
faced
with
a
difficult
dilemma,
stay
home
or
find
the
funds
to
cover
travel
and
lodging.
Some
of
families
simply
can&#8217;t
afford
the
expense
of
traveling
at
all,
while
others
have
been
known
to
sleep
in
cars
outside
of
hospitals
or
to
set
up
tents
in
the
parking
lot.
This
is
a
program
that
works
and
serves
a
truly
important
need.
My
amendment
increased
our
support
for
next
year
from
$4
million
to
$20
million
dollars.
That
means
more
husbands
and
wives,
fathers
and
sons,
sisters
and
brothers
than
can
be
together.
This
increased
funding
is
fully
offset,
by
reducing
the
Operation
and
Maintenance
Defense-wide
account.
We&#8217;ve
all
been
disturbed
by
recent
reports
of
extended
backlogs,
year-long
wait
times
and
falsified
records
at
VA

centers.
Failing
our
veterans
is
unacceptable,
and
here
in
Congress
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
take

our

by
supporting
legislation
that
strengthens
veterans&#8217;

and
improves
the
administration
of
veterans&#8217;
benefits.
This
is
a
multifaceted
problem
and
we
must
continue
to
be
vigilant.
If
you
are
having
problems
with
the
VA
please

my

Fisher
House
is
a

for
me
and
this
is
the
second
year
I
have

for
this

The
full
Department
of

which

my

the

now
goes

the

I

to
continued
work
with
both
parties
to
make
sure
that
my
amendment
moves
forward
and
we
can
bring
more
families
together.
