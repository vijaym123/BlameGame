UNTIL 5:59PM: All Donations Triple-Matched
President Obama and President Clinton asked for your help.
Now until 5:59PM, we&rsquo;re making an emergency extension of the Triple-Match for today&rsquo;s huge ad buy deadline. Can you help?
With the biggest ad buy deadline of the entire election hitting at 6pm, here are the stakes:
The race for Congress is a DEAD HEAT...this election could go either way
Boehner is launching the biggest ad blitz of the entire election -- $2O,OOO,OOO
Right now, your TV is being flooded with filthy, Obama-bashing ads&hellip;and it&rsquo;s convincing undecided voters to reject our Democratic campaigns
With all of this at stake, we&rsquo;ve decided to extend the TRIPLE-MATCH for just 3 more hours!
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO TRIPLE-MATCH:

until 5:59pm
The triple-match is our best chance at closing the spending gap, and it&rsquo;s only around until
6:00 PM . Don&rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity. This is our chance to mount a STUNNING COMEBACK.
