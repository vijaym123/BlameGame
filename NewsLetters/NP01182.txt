Congressman Lamborn votes to Protect
Religious Freedom
5/1/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a
bipartisan vote in support of House Joint Resolution 43, a resolution
disapproving of the District of Columbias so-called
Reproductive
Health Non-Discrimination Act (RHNDA).
This discriminatory act
violates the basic freedom of religious and secular organizations to
operate according to their sincerely held beliefs.
H.J. Res. 43 recognizes these serious problems and
outlines Congress disapproval of such intrusions on the ability of
entities to operate in accordance with their moral or religious beliefs.
Congress has constitutional authority over all D.C. laws and is
acting to stop the D.C. Councils blatant disregard of basic constitutional
rights.

Background
information from the Republican Study
Committee
H.J. Res. 43 is a
response to the Districts Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment
Act (RHNDA), which requires employers to provide health insurance
covering the termination of unborn children and to hire individuals who
may advocate for those practices, even if that goes against the
employers religious beliefs.
Text of Congressman Lamborn's
Floor
Speech
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
House Joint Resolution 43, which will stop the implementation of the
Reproductive Health and Nondiscrimination Act within the District of
Colombia. All Americans should have the freedom to live and work according
to their religious and moral convictions without fear of the government
punishing them for doing so.
This bill, passed by the D.C. City Council, discriminates
against religious and pro-life advocacy groups in the District of Colombia
and is a clear violation of their First Amendment freedoms.
Under this discriminatory act, these organizations would be forced to
make employment decisions contrary to their deeply held beliefs about the
sanctity of human life, and would further require them to provide
abortion coverage for their employees.
This law represents a
flagrant disregard for the conscience rights of all D.C. employers and must
be stopped. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members of the House to vote
Yes on this important resolution of disapproval.
