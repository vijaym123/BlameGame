Dear David,
"Lost"
IRS emails . EPA regulatory
over-reach . Cherry-picking which ObamaCare
provisions to delay .
Any way you look at it, the Obama
administration has a bad habit of ignoring the law - and the
Constitution.
Yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner
announced
his plans to pursue measures to sue President
Barack Obama "in an effort to compel the president to follow his oath
of office and faithfully execute the laws of our country." The Speaker
is right.
It's time for Congress to tell President
Obama: You cannot ignore the law. The president's 'pen and phone' do
not supersede the U.S. Constitution.
I'm urging the
Democrat-controlled Senate to allow a vote on a bill I introduced,
the " ENFORCE the Law Act ," to ensure the president
upholds his constitutional obligation to "take care that the laws be
faithfully executed."
The ENFORCE the Law Act puts a
procedure in place to allow Congress to authorize a lawsuit against the
executive branch for failure to faithfully execute the laws. The bill also
provides for expedited consideration of any such lawsuit, first
through a three-judge panel at the federal district court level, and then by
providing for direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The
president has a constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute
the laws of our country. The House already passed this bill, and the
Senate should allow a vote immediately.

continued efforts to stop President Obama's blatant overreach, please

Sincere
regards,
