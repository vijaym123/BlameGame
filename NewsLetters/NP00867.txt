Rubio: Nows No Time To End NSA
Program
On Sunday, Marco offered the opposing
view to USA Todays editorial in an
op-ed arguing for the renewal of Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act and Patriot
Act authorities.
Read an excerpt below and the full op-ed
here .
Rubio: Given these threats, now
is not the time to end this program,
which remains essential to our security.
Congress has until the end of May to act
before the current authorities expire. We
must renew these authorities and provide
those we charge with protecting us every
tool they need to do so.
Foreign Leaders Contradict Obama
Administration Testimony To Rubio
Regarding Iran, Colombia
Earlier this week Marco highlighted
evidence contradicting Obama Administration
officials testimony in Senate
hearings regarding the United States
Arab allies support for the Iran
deal and discussions about the release of
Colombian narco-terrorist Simn
Trinidad:
In
March , Rubio told Secretary of State
John Kerry the negotiations with Iran had
impacted our trust level with Sunni allies
in the region, to which Kerry responded
that Rubio was flat wrong,
and that all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
allies had articulated their support.
Earlier
this week , Saudi Arabias King
Salman pulled out of a summit being hosted
by President Obama tomorrow, signaling the
Arab states arent on board with
negotiations and would continue to act on
their own to thwart Iran.
In
a subcommittee hearing earlier this
month , John D. Feeley, Principal Deputy
Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Western
Hemisphere Affairs, told Rubio the
Colombians had not asked for Trinidad to be
released, but
in
an interview with BBC HARDtalk , Sergio
Jaramillo, Colombias High
Commissioner for Peace, said Trinidad has
been discussed with U.S. officials
at different and highest
levels.
Read Marcos statement below and
read transcripts of the exchanges with
Obama Administration officials
here .
Rubio: Once again, the Obama
Administration says one thing about their
negotiations while foreign leaders say
something completely different. The most
recent examples regarding discussions of
Simn Trinidads potential
release and King Salmans support
of the Iran nuclear negotiations show
once again that the Obama Administration
isnt telling the American people
what is really being discussed at these
talks.
Rubio, Menendez Meet With Venezuelan
Democracy And Human Rights Leaders
On Thursday, Marco and Senator Robert
Menendez (D-NJ) met with democracy and
human rights leaders from Venezuela in the
U.S. Capitol. The Senators hosted Lilian
Tintori, wife of imprisoned opposition
leader Leopoldo Lpez; Mitzy Capriles,
wife of imprisoned Caracas mayor Antonio
Ledezma; and Tamara Suju, International
Director of a leading Venezuelan human
rights organization, Foro Penal.
Read excerpts of Marcos statement
below and read his full statement and see
photos of the meeting
here .
Rubio: I was humbled and
honored to meet with these courageous
leaders who want nothing more than a
better future for Venezuela that the
current regimes corruption and
incompetence cannot achieve. They deserve
the U.S.s strong support, as well
as more robust implementation of the
sanctions law Congress passed targeting
the financial assets and visas of human
rights violators in the
regime.
The U.S. must lead a movement
of free and democratic societies calling
for a fully free and fair election that
gives the people of Venezuela an
opportunity to hold the Maduro regime
accountable for its incompetence, as well
as the murder and repression of innocent
Venezuelans.
Rubio, Nelson Introduce Hurricane
Forecast Improvement Act
With the 2015 hurricane season
approaching, Marco and Senator Bill Nelson
(D-FL)
introduced
legislation
Thursday that would improve
guidance for hurricane track, intensity,
and storm surge forecasts.
The
Hurricane
Forecast Improvement Act of 2015
would codify the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administrations
Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project,
which aims to reduce the loss of life,
injury, and damage to the economy by
reducing errors of tracking and intensity
forecasts.
Rubio: Americans along the east
coast have unfortunately seen first-hand
how devastating hurricanes can be.
Providing more accurate tracking and
intensity forecasts will allow people to
better prepare for the safety of their
families, homes, and businesses. The
Hurricane Forecast Improvement Act is a
common sense approach that will advance
these goals.
