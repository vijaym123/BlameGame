Reflecting on 9/11-- 13 Years
Later
On the 13th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist
attacks that shook our nation, I was reminded of the strength and
resilience of the American people. Thirteen years later, we all still
remember that day vividly. Our nation was under attack by ruthless terrorists
who hated everything America stands for-- freedom, prosperity,
religious liberty. On that tragic day, 2,977 lives were lost. As a
country, our hearts still ache for the families and friends of victims.
But we honor their memories by standing strong against the threat of
terror and remain unified as a nation in our commitment to its defeat.
God bless our great country.
Standing Strong Against
ISIS
Last Wednesday night, President Obama laid out his plan for
defeating The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). I commend the
President for coming before the American people--weneeded to hear from
ourCommander-in-Chief. After the brutal executions of two American
journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the American people are
shaken.
I'm unwavering in my support for
airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq, but hope to see a more specific strategic
approach to dealing with these terrorists. The President, thus far,
has been heavy on platitudes and light on specifics. In my role as your
Congressman, I will continue to support strong action against ISIS and
will push the Adminstration to provide a more comprehensive longterm
strategy for annihilating these militants. Recently, I penned an op-ed
for U.S. News and World Report on the President's handling of the
situation with ISIS. You can read it

Surveying My
Constituents on the Continuing Resolution and
Ex - Im Bank Reauthorization
My job as your representative
in Congress is to make your voice heard in Washington. This coming
week, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on legislation
that would reauthorize current government funding levels through December
11, 2014 as well asreauthorize the Export-Import bank through June
2015.
I am asking you, my
constituents, for your input on how you would like me to vote on this important
legislation. Last week, I sent out a survey asking for your feedback.
If you haven't yet, please let me know how you feel on these issues.
Thank you.
Tailgating
with WCU College Republicans
Last weekend I had a great time
meeting with the Western Carolina University (WCU) College Republicans
before doing the coin toss at the game against Brevard College. What better
way to catch up with young leaders than tailgating at a football
game? Thanks for hosting me.
