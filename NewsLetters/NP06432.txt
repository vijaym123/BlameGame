On
September 11, 2001, we experienced the worst terrorist attack in our
nations history.
America's response was swift, unified and
inspiring.
We will always remember the 3,000 innocent men,
women, and children who lost their lives in the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. We will never forget the
heroic actions of the passengers aboard United Flight 93 and the fearless
emergency responders who rushed toward the wreckage and devastation,
and whose inspiring actions helped save the lives of
others.
On this anniversary, let us also reflect on the service and
sacrifices of our armed forces who have kept our homeland
safe.
Despite the death of Osama bin Laden and the capture of
many members in his terrorist network, we must never let down our guard.
Today, the terrorist group ISIS continues its murderous rampage across
the Middle East, executing two American journalists in the last month
alone. The Islamic State is a serious threat to our national security
and must be
defeated.
One of the worst days
in our nations history brought out the best of the American spirit.
Thirteen years later, September 11th is a day of reverence, remembrance
and reflection; a reminder that America remains the greatest country
in the
world.
God bless
America.
