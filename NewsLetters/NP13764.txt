Obamacare in Critical Condition
Dear Friends,
President Obama has left the White House to go on a resuscitation tour hoping to sell the Obamacare cure-all to the American people and especially to the youth.
Supporters of the law have said that it is critical, if Obamacare is going to make it, to enroll the young to carry the burden of the rest of us.
The problem the President faces is that the young see what Obamacare actually offers: broken promises, disastrous website, risk for identity theft, higher premiums, lost coverage, higher deductibles, higher drug costs, and the list goes on and on.
I have heard time and again both in person and through calls, letters, and emails with my office that Wyoming doesnt want this Federal Government takeover of our Healthcare.
As we continue to fight for your freedom and healthcare please dont hesitate to
contact me
and let me know where you stand and how Obamacare has affected you and your loved ones.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
