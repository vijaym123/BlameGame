Scott
Perry
September 24, 2014
As Jewish Americans at home and abroad mark the first of the High Holy Days, I extend my warmest wishes for the New Year. Tonight, families gather in synagogues and homes to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, reflect on the past year and look forward to the new.
As you share in traditional festivities, you renew your commitment to acts of compassion and to the cause of freedom around the world. We wish all who celebrate Rosh Hashanah a wonderful year of health and prosperity. Lshanah tovah!
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
