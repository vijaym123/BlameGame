Dear Friend,
As Ed told you this morning,
today is the deadline for our FEC pre-primary reporting period.
I wanted to give you a look at the numbers, because you deserve to know what this race looks like from inside campaign headquarters.
If you can, please pitch in $5 before midnight.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Here&rsquo;s how things look:
GOAL: $25,000
RAISED: $21,365 NEEDED: $3,635
Almost there, but not quite.
Get us $5 closer right now -- it only takes a minute.
Thank you for all of your support.
Colleen
