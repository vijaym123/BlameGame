A Step In The Right Direction
For too long, the United States government has operated on short-term
spending measures. Not only has this prevented Congress from doing its
job, but it has also created uncertainty, which has proven detrimental
to our stagnant economy. Lurching from crisis to crisis is business as
usual in Washington, and changing the status quo is exactly why I came
to Washington. We cannot and will not continue down the path of
short-term fixes in order to keep our government open.
This past week, the Budget Conference Committee led by Rep. Paul Ryan
and Sen. Patty Murray introduced a two-year budget proposal to Congress
and the American people. Later in the week, the House of
Representatives voted to approve the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 by a
vote of 332-94. The agreement is the first bipartisan budget deal in a
divided government since 1986. Read more HERE

Meeting with Copley Township Trustees & Constituents
This week, I had the opportunity to meet with the Copley Township
trustees, as well as the police and fire chiefs of the township.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS
As we celebrate during this holiday season, it is important to remember
that we as Ohioans and Americans have much to be thankful for. Next
week marks the end of the 113th Congress, and at this time I want to
take a moment to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent
you in the United States Congress.
Though there is still much work to be done in Washington, I want to
wish each of you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. Also, it is
important that we all keep in mind our troops both at home and abroad
who cannot be with their families during this holiday season. It is
because of their selfless service that we may continue our American way
of life, and for that we are forever grateful.

A
Step
In
The

For

the

has
operated
on
short-term

measures.
Not

has
this
prevented
Congress
from

but
it
has
also
created
uncertainty,
which
has
proven
detrimental
to
our
stagnant
economy.
Lurching
from
crisis
to
crisis
is
business
as
usual
in
Washington,
and
changing
the
status
quo
is
exactly
why
I
came
to
Washington.
We
cannot
and
will
not
continue
down
the
path
of
short-term
fixes
in
order
to
keep
our
government
open.
This
past
week,
the
Budget
Conference
Committee
led
by
Rep.

introduced
a

it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
as
Ohioans
and
Americans
have
much

Next

marks
the

at

I
want
to
take
a

to

you
for
allowing
me
the

you
in

Though
there

still
much
work

in
Washington,
I
want
to
wish
each
of
you
a

our
