A Morning Prayer from a Member of Congress
Dear Lord,
So far today, things are moving magnificently. I have not: cursed at the guy on the other side of the aisle, spread a rumor about a colleague, yelled at a staffer, exercised raw arrogance, nor said things during an interview that I will be required to walk back. However Lord, I am now getting out of bed, and I will need all the strength, love, and guidance you can provide.
P.S. Lord - Grant me extravagant patience with people who are not as good as I am, so that I won&rsquo;t lose my temper. For if you do not help me, I will surely get an ethics complaint.
Emanuel
Cleaver, II
Member of
Congress
