Dear Friend:
Next week, the Senate will vote to restart the Federal Emergency
Unemployment Insurance program.
This action is long overdue as the program
expired on
December 28th and has left millions of Americans without this vital
lifeline as they look for work.
Now the legislation moves to the House where I am working
urgently to pass it so it can become law.
Consider these reasons for
action:
There are still 1 million fewer
jobs in the economy today than when the recession started in December
2007 according to U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
The long-term unemployment rate (those
who rely on the Federal UI) is currently 36.5 percent, twice the rate
of 18.2 percent when the program was established in 2008 according to
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Over 2.8 million job-seeking Americans would receive
UI under the Senate bill according to the Ways and Means
Committee.
I believe the key
to action in the House is telling the stories of unemployed
workers.
When I am home I meet with dozens of local residents
people who have worked all of their lives and who now find themselves
desperately seeking work in a tough economy.
I know if I could
bring these individuals to Washington their personal experiences would
compel action.
If you or
someone you know would like to share their experience with the UI
program, I will do my part to make sure it is heard in
Washington.
If you have a story about how
unemployment insurance impacts you, your family, or
community,
please share it with me by clicking
here.
Thanks in
advance.
Hearing from you helps me do my job.
Sincerely
Sander
Levin
