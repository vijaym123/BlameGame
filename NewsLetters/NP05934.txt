Wicker Champions Updated Muscular Dystrophy
Law
Congress Passes Key Measures to
Expand
Research in Pursuit of a
Cure
On September 18, an important battle was won
in the war against muscular dystrophy when the Senate enacted the MD
CARE Act Amendments of 2014.
This legislation, which I
introduced with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), passed the House of
Representatives this summer, and the President signed it into law on September
26.
We should be encouraged
by the success of federal efforts to promote muscular dystrophy
research.
In 2001, I authored the original Muscular Dystrophy
Community Assistance, Research, and Education (MD CARE) Act, giving impetus
to federal efforts to combat this devastating disease.
The law
established the first research programs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy
at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Its reauthorization
was unanimously passed by Congress in 2008.
Prior to 2001, no legislation had specifically
addressed Duchenne muscular dystrophy
the most common fatal genetic
disorder diagnosed in childhood.
Duchenne affects 1 in 3,500 boys
worldwide.
Despite progress made by scientists, it remains both
incurable and terminal.
Since MD CARE, federal research has paved
the way for groundbreaking therapies, extending the lifespan of
muscular dystrophy patients by an average of 12 years and significantly
improving their quality of life.
Now that children with muscular
dystrophy are reaching young adulthood, an updated law was needed to
advance research for older
patients.
Building on Our
Progress
The latest update to
MD CARE removes restrictions on researchers to focus only on
pediatric patients.
Researchers and medical professionals will be able
to move forward with treatments based on current needs and challenges,
building on the incredible progress that has been made.
The
legislation also now covers multiple forms of muscular dystrophy and adds
accountability measures to the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating
Committee, which establishes objectives for research and
education.
It is remarkable that children who once
faced a bleak prognosis are now enjoying longer, more active lives.
Muscular dystrophies, which affect more than 100,000 Americans,
involve the progressive debilitation of muscle strength.
Although
there are varying types of the disorder, severe forms lead to serious
complications in the heart and lungs.
The law now recognizes the
need to focus research on these complications as patients live
longer.
Encouraging Collaboration for Pediatric
Research
We are coming closer to a
cure for muscular dystrophy, and bipartisan support in Congress for
targeted and effective research is helping make a crucial difference.
The updated MD CARE Act follows last year's passage of the National
Pediatric Research Network Act (NPRNA), another innovative
achievement.
NPRNA, which I sponsored
with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), facilitates the coordination of
findings among NIH researchers on childhood diseases, encouraging the
most efficient use of federal resources.
The legislation, which
became law last November, allows pediatric research institutions across
the nation to join forces to combat horrible childhood diseases like
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
For example, the newly created
National Pediatric Research Network will allow children to participate in
some of the most revolutionary clinical trials, even if they live
thousands of miles from the primary institution.
Additionally, because
of the law, rare pediatric diseases will receive increased attention
by NIH.
I intend to
press forward in the fight against muscular dystrophy.
I joined
this battle 13 years ago when a fellow Mississippian told me about his
sons diagnosis with Duchenne.
Daunting challenges remain;
however, the gains we have made hold the promise of even greater
breakthroughs to come and, one day, a cure.
