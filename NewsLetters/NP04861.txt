We&rsquo;re asking you for $5. Wonder why we keep asking for money?
It determines&hellip;
--
HOW MANY
doors we can knock
--
HOW MANY
phone calls we can make
--
HOW MANY
Republican attacks we can respond to
To be specific, we have set a goal of knocking on 1 MILLION doors in the last of 4 days of this election. Yes, it&rsquo;s ambitious. It&rsquo;d break every record we have. But we think we can pull it off if we bring in another 4 donations from the 60659 zip code today.
That&rsquo;s why tonight&rsquo;s final monthly fundraising deadline is so important. So David, can you help us out? $5 or $50 would go a long way.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
