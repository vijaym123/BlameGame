Kansas Common Sense
April 6, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Easter Sunday and Passover
I hope you and your family celebrated a meaningful Easter. I spent the
day with family in Manhattan, where we attended services at First
Presbyterian Church where Robba played piano during the Easter Sunday
service.
Also this week, Jewish families and friends around the world gathered
to celebrate the holiday of Passover. At the traditional Passover meal,
the Seder, Jews recall the experience of Israelites in ancient Egypt
and the Exodus led by Moses. During this annual holiday, the story and
lessons of the Exodus are passed from one generation to the next.
Negotiators Announce Framework for Potential Nuclear Agreement with Iran
This week international diplomats announced a negotiated agreement
outlining the framework for a deal regarding Iran's nuclear program.
Negotiators will now work to define specifics of a deal by mid-summer.
Details of this initial agreement are yet unknown to the public, but
the outline published suggest that Iran's nuclear infrastructure would
not be dismantled. This framework appears to fall short of America's
benchmarks for a good deal, including the standard set by President
Obama at the outset of these diplomatic talks.
American foreign policy regarding the Middle East should seek long-term
stability, peace and protection of American interests. Accordingly, I
have serious concerns about the wisdom of this potential nuclear
agreement. Congress has thus far relied on press reports for
information about the Obama Administration's negotiations with Iran. As
more details about this framework become known, I will continue to
support Senate legislation that affirms Congressional review and
oversight of any potential deal. Congress and the American people must
have a say in the final decision on policy of such importance.
Agri-Pulse Open Mic Interview
This week, I am the guest on Agri-Pulse's Open Mic radio program where
the conversation focused on preserving farm policy and other issues of
importance to farmers and ranchers across the country. As a Senator
from rural Kansas and Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee, I understand well that the concerns of producers range
from issues at home to outside their farm gate, and even outside the
borders of the United States.
Many in the Ag community are concerned with overregulation from the
federal government. Farmers in Kansas and across the country are also
concerned with issues outside their farm gate, and even outside the
borders of the United States. Farmers want to be able to sell their
crops on the global market on a fair and level playing field. Farmers
also want us here in Washington to fight on their behalf to gain access
to new international markets for our homegrown products.
In addition to over-regulation and trade, the discussion touched on the
Congress' recent passage of a balanced budget. The Senate voted for 15
hours on 49 amendments offered by both Republicans and Democrats to the
budget resolution, related to wide-ranging issues such as defense
spending, Iran sanctions, estate taxes and Obamacare. The budget
passage sets the stage for conference negotiations with the House of
Representatives, which passed its own budget resolution last Thursday.
Congress has not successfully adopted a budget conference report since
2009, an important duty of governing which the new majority is eager to
restore.
Thank you again for reporter Jeff Neeley for inviting me to be his
guest this week on Agri-Pulse Open Mic. It was a productive discussion
about what can be done to make reduce interference from the federal
government and help make certain Ag families can pass on their farm or
ranch - and their agriculture heritage - to the next generation of
producers. Click here
to listen to the full
interview and learn more.
Touring Hallmark Cards in Kansas City
On Friday, I visited Hallmark Cards headquarters in Kansas City for a
tour with President and CEO, Don Hall, Jr.
Hallmark is a company that
has called Kansas City home since the early 1900s and has made a
tremendous impact on the region ever since. The Hallmark story is one
of entrepreneurship and the American dream that continues to inspire
startups in and around the Kansas City area. Thanks again to Don Hall,
Jr. and the other Hallmark employees who took time to visit with me.
Speaking to Kansas City Tomorrow 2015 Leadership Class
After my visit to Hallmark on Friday, I had the opportunity to speak to
the Kansas City Tomorrow 2015 leadership class about public service.
The KC Tomorrow is a program through the Civic Council of Greater
Kansas City and the 2015 Leadership Class is a group of professionals
and CEOs committed to working together to make certain good things
continue happening in the Kansas City area. I was inspired by the
group's enthusiasm for making a difference in our community, and I was
honored to visit with them about the economic future of the entire KC
region. Thanks to my friend, Mary Birch of Lathrop and Gage, for
inviting me to participate.
Woodson County Listening Tour Stop
Thanks to the Woodson County residents who joined me at the Yates
Center Ambulance Community Room on Saturday morning for my Town Hall
meeting. I heard feedback on a number of issues facing our country,
including the Veterans Choice Act and concerns with the new proposed
Federal Dietary Guidelines. The conversation also focused on issues
important to rural Kansas like crop insurance, rural mental health, the
importance of community hospitals, pharmacies and banks, and local
control of education.
I heard real concerns today about highway construction in the area and
traffic being routed 30 miles away from local businesses due to
replacement of the RR overpass east of Yates Center. Thanks again to
everyone who attended, including Co. Commissioner Bud Moore, Co.
Commissioner John Weseloh, and Rep. Larry Hibbard.
Upcoming Kansas Listening Tour Stops
This week, I am continuing my Kansas Listening Tour with seven stops in
Central and Southwest Kansas. On Thursday, April 9, 2015, I will be
stopping in Sherman, Greeley, Wichita and Haskell Counties. On Friday,
April 10, 2015, I'll be visiting with folks in Kiowa, Pratt and Reno
Counties. You can find more information on the town hall locations and
times in the sidebar of this newsletter or on my website. The issues I
focus on and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the
conversations I have with Kansans so making certain I am home to visit
with folks is my top priority.
Now Accepting 2015 Service Academy Applications
Even as students are beginning their summer breaks, I want to remind
them of the opportunity to apply to a United States Service Academy.
Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.;
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; the U.S. Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings
Point, N.Y., is one of my favorite duties as a U.S. Senator.
To find out the requirements and apply, please download an application
from my website or contact my Olathe office. All application materials
are due to my Olathe office by September 4, 2015. After applications
have been reviewed, applicants will be notified of interviews with my
Service Academy Selection Board, which will take place on Saturday,
September 26, 2015, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene.
Celebrating Georgina Webb's Life
Late last week, I joined friends and family in celebrating Georgina
Webb's life at her funeral service at North Topeka Baptist Church. I
served with Georgina's son Anthony Hensely in the Kansas State Senate.
Robba and I extend our sympathies and prayers to Georgina's entire
family, including Anthony, Daryle Coleman, Randall Hensley, and Timothy
Hensley.

Kansas
Common

April

2015
Hello,
Welcome
to
" Kansas
Common
Sense ."
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
Easter
Sunday
and
Passover
I
hope
you
and
your
family
celebrated
a
meaningful
Easter.
I
spent
the
day
with
family
in
Manhattan,
where
we
attended
services
at
First
Presbyterian
Church
where
Robba
played
piano
during
the
Easter
Sunday
service.
Also
this
week,
Jewish
families
and
friends
around
the
world
gathered
to
celebrate
the
holiday
of
Passover.
At
the
traditional
Passover
meal,
the
Seder,
Jews
recall
the
experience
of
Israelites
in
ancient
Egypt
and
the
Exodus
led
by
Moses.
During
this
annual
holiday,
the
story
and
lessons
of
the
Exodus
are
passed
from
one
generation
to
the
next.
Negotiators
Announce
Framework
for
Potential
Nuclear
Agreement
with
Iran
This
week
international
diplomats
announced
a
negotiated
agreement
outlining
the
framework
for
a
deal
regarding
Iran's
nuclear
program.
Negotiators
will
now
work
to
define
specifics
of
a
deal
by
mid-summer.
Details
of
this
initial
agreement
are
yet
unknown
to
the
public,
but
the
outline
published
suggest
that
Iran's
nuclear
infrastructure
would
not
be
dismantled.
This
framework
appears
to
fall
short
of
America's
benchmarks
for
a
good
deal,
including
the
standard
set
by
President
Obama
at
the
outset
of
these
diplomatic
talks.
American
foreign
policy
regarding
the
Middle
East
should
seek
long-term
stability,
peace
and
protection
of
American
interests.
Accordingly,
I
have
serious
concerns
about
the
wisdom
of
this
potential
nuclear
agreement.
Congress
has
thus
far
relied
on
press
reports
for
information
about
the
Obama
Administration's
negotiations
with
Iran.
As
more
details
about
this
framework
become
known,
I
will
continue
to
support
Senate
legislation
that
affirms
Congressional
review
and
oversight
of
any
potential
deal.
Congress
and
the
American
people
must
have
a
say
in
the
final
decision
on
policy
of
such
importance.
Agri-Pulse
Open
Mic
Interview
This
week,
I
am
the
guest
on
Agri-Pulse's
Open
Mic
radio
program
where
the
conversation
focused
on
preserving
farm
policy
and
other
issues
of
importance
to
farmers
and
ranchers
across
the
country.
As
a
Senator
from
rural
Kansas
and
Chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
understand
well
that
the
concerns
of
producers
range
from
issues
at
home
to
outside
their
farm
gate,
and
even
outside
the
borders
of
the
United
States.
Many
in
the
Ag
community
are
concerned
with
overregulation
from
the
federal
government.
Farmers
in
Kansas
and
across
the
country
are
also
concerned
with
issues
outside
their
farm
gate,
and
even
outside
the
borders
of
the
United
States.
Farmers
want
to
be
able
to
sell
their
crops
on
the
global
market
on
a
fair
and
level
playing
field.
Farmers
also
want
us
here
in
Washington
to
fight
on
their
behalf
to
gain
access
to
new
international
markets
for
our
homegrown
products.
In
addition
to
over-regulation
and
trade,
the
discussion
touched
on
the
Congress'
recent
passage
of
a
balanced
budget.
The
Senate
voted
for
15
hours
on
49
amendments
offered
by
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
to
the
budget
resolution,
related
to
wide-ranging
issues
such
as
defense
spending,
Iran
sanctions,
estate
taxes
and
Obamacare.
The
budget
passage
sets
the
stage
for
conference
negotiations
with
the
House
of
Representatives,
which
passed
its
own
budget
resolution
last
Thursday.
Congress
has
not
successfully
adopted
a
budget
conference
report
since
2009,
an
important
duty
of
governing
which
the
new
majority
is
eager
to
restore.
Thank
you
again
for
reporter
Jeff
Neeley
for
inviting
me
to
be
his
guest
this
week
on
Agri-Pulse
Open
Mic.
It
was
a
productive
discussion
about
what
can
be
done
to
make
reduce
interference
from
the
federal
government
and
help
make
certain
Ag
families
can
pass
on
their
farm
or
ranch
&ndash;
and
their
agriculture
heritage
&ndash;
to
the
next
generation
of
producers.

Touring
Hallmark
Cards

Kansas
City
On
Friday,
I
visited
Hallmark
Cards
headquarters
in
Kansas
City
for
a
tour
with
President
and
CEO,
Don
Hall,
Jr.
Hallmark
is
a

since
the
early
1900s
and
has
made
a
tremendous
impact

The
Hallmark
story
is
one
of
entrepreneurship
and
the
American
dream
that
continues
to
inspire
startups
in
and
around
the
Kansas
City
area.
Thanks
again
to
Don
Hall,
Jr.
and
the
other
Hallmark

who
took
time
to
visit
with
me.
Speaking
to
Kansas
City
Tomorrow
2015
Leadership
Class
After
my
visit
to
Hallmark
on
Friday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Kansas
City
Tomorrow
2015

about
public
service.
The
KC

and
CEOs
committed
to
working
together
to
make
certain
good
things
continue
happening
in
the
Kansas
City
area.
I
was
inspired
by
the
group's
enthusiasm
for
making
a
difference
in
our
community,
and
I
was
honored
to
visit
with
them
about
the
economic
future
of
the
entire
KC
region.
Thanks
to
my
friend,
Mary
Birch
of

for
inviting
me
to
participate.
Woodson

Thanks
to
the
Woodson
County
residents
who
joined
me
at
the
Yates
Center
Ambulance
Community
Room
on
Saturday
morning
for
my
Town
Hall
meeting.
I
heard
feedback
on
a
number
of
issues
facing
our
country,
including
the
Veterans
Choice
Act
and
concerns
with
the
new
proposed
Federal
Dietary
Guidelines.
The
conversation
also
focused
on
issues
important
to
rural
Kansas
like
crop
insurance,
rural
mental
health,
the
importance
of
community
hospitals,
pharmacies
and
banks,
and
local
control
of
education.
I
heard
real
concerns
today
about
highway
construction
in
the
area
and
traffic
being
routed
30
miles
away
from
local
businesses
due
to
replacement
of
the
RR
overpass
east
of
Yates
Center.
Thanks
again
to
everyone
who

Celebrating
Georgina
Webb's
Life
Late
last
week,
I
joined
friends
and
family
in
celebrating
Georgina
Webb's
life
at
her
funeral
service
at
North
Topeka
Baptist
Church.
I
served
with
Georgina's
son
Anthony
Hensely
in
the
Kansas
State
Senate.
Robba
and
I
extend
our
sympathies
and
prayers
to
Georgina's
entire
family,
including
Anthony,
Daryle
Coleman,
Randall
Hensley,
and
Timothy
Hensley.
