Friends,
Today I voted for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) because it unlocks the trade deal vault, and lets the American people in. TPA is a trade oversight bill that puts the Republican-controlled Congress and the American people in the drivers seat in three ways:
First, we set the objectives and guide the negotiation process.
Second, we end secrecy and open the vaults so the American people have months to review and weigh in on any final proposals.
Third, Congress has the power to approve a good deal or stop a bad deal.
Additionally, as a conservative, I believe that free markets are essential to a free society. Georgia businesses should be able to sell their goods to customers around the world. With 1.2 million Georgia jobs dependent on trade, there is too much at stake for Congress to sit on the sidelines. Thats why conservatives across the country, such as Senator Ted Cruz and the American Conservative Union, have supported this oversight bill. It will help our government negotiate good deals that allow our businesses to compete in a fair global marketplace.
These trade negotiations also call for the greatness of America. Dozens of nations are ready to lower trade barriers and open up new pathways to prosperity, and they look to the United States for leadership. To take a back seat now would empower China and other countries to fill the void. In recent years, we have seen Russia and Iran expand their influence in places neglected by the Obama administration. Those developments are a threat to our economy and security. Its time to lead the world again. Lets do it on our terms, through our values, and for the prosperity of future generations.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
