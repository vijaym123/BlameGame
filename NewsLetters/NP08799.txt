Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Veterans Affairs Problems Must Be Uncovered - And Addressed
Despite large increases in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
budget that have moved through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan
majorities in recent years (see chart above), veterans' access to
healthcare has become slower and more bureaucratic, leading to the
scandals that have made headlines for the past several weeks. On
Tuesday, the House of Representatives took action to rectify the
problem, unanimously passing H.R. 4810
, the
Veterans Access to Care Act.
Report VA Scheduling Irregularities
To Me
618-288-7190
The act would allow veterans to bypass long waits for VA appointments
and obtain care from non-VA doctors and facilities. The VA then would
provide reimbursement for the cost of that care.
Also last week, an Access Audit confirmed that the problems with
veterans getting timely service - and efforts by VA employees to
conceal that fact - are even more widespread than previously revealed.
My office has aided numerous veterans through the years who have
experienced such issues, and I encourage anyone currently in that
situation - as well as VA employees - to share with me any knowledge of
irregularities at the VA.
The Access Audit revealed 57,436 veterans waiting for appointments more
than 90 days after requesting them, as well as confusing scheduling
practices and more efforts to hide the long wait times. The audit
flagged 112 VA facilities for further review and investigation,
including the Illiana Health Care System in Danville and the Marion
Medical Center, located in or near the 15th Congressional District.
I will be returning to VA facilities that serve my constituents to seek
answers, and I have asked to talk to veterans and employees without
administrators present. Anyone who seeks anonymity in fear of reprisal
can also call my office at 618-288-7190.
House Votes To Provide America's Small Business Tax Relief
On Thursday, I supported legislation that helps the economy and
provides certainty for small businesses regarding specific tax
provisions. America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014, H.R. 4457
, passed
the House on a bipartisan 272-144 vote.
One of the provisions included in this legislation is Section 179,
which will extend permanently the expensing level for small businesses
and farmers to $500,000. This is something that I have been hearing
about from farmers since last year.
The amount available for deduction under Section 179 has fluctuated
over the last several years. Simply put, this area of the tax code
encourages businesses and farmers to invest in capital investment by
allowing a deduction for qualifying purchases.
H.R. 4457 now heads to the Senate, where similar language has also been
introduced.
At The Crossroads Of Europe
In the center of the photo at left, I am shown
participating in the Wroclaw Global Forum
in Poland, an event that brings
together decision-makers and business leaders from the United States
and Europe to discuss Central Europe's role as a critical partner in
U.S. efforts to promote political, security and economic ties across
the Atlantic.
Of note: the Polish-heritage population of the 15th District's
Washington County is second only to Cook among Illinois counties.
Announcements
Fraud Watch Speech: I will be addressing a "Frauds, Scams and
Protecting Your Identity" program on Monday, July 7, at the LifeSpan
Center, 11021 East County Road 800N, in Charleston. The AARP Fraud
Watch Network is sponsoring the 9 a.m.-noon event. Registration, which
can be done online
or by calling, toll-free, 1-877-926-8300, is required. An on-site
shredding truck will be available from 10 a.m.-noon.
Fire Grant Awarded: Sidell Fire and Rescue has been selected as a
recipient of a Fiscal Year 2013 Assistance to Firefighters Grant.
The district will be receiving $46,075 under the Operations and Safety
category. Operations and Safety grants can fund professional training,
wellness and fitness programs and equipment, personal protective
equipment, modifications to facilities, and supplies that support
firefighting and non-hospital affiliated Emergency Medical Services
operations and safety.
Free Medical Services Reminder: Military personnel will be offering
free medical services June 16-27 at Harrisburg Middle School as part of
Southern Care Innovative Readiness Training,
a
partnership between the Delta Regional Authority and the Department of
Defense. Medical screening and non-emergency medical treatment, dental
exams, cleanings and extractions and optometry exams and glasses are
offered to all ages, regardless of income. For questions or an
appointment, call 1-866-611-5627. This free medical clinic will be open

Bulldog Boulevard in Harrisburg.
