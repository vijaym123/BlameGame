Dear Friend-
We did it! The Senate passed a compromise bill to make flood insurance affordable for the half million families in Louisiana who have waited for two years to stop draconian rate increases.
Share this great news with your friends and family!
I couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you to the thousands of Louisianians who e-mailed or tweeted to the #MyHomeMyStory movement.
And this never would have happened without Republicans and Democrats working together for millions of families across the country.
Now that we are beyond the immediate crisis, we must dedicate ourselves to crafting a program that works decade to decade so generation after generation can continue to affordably and safely live along our coasts and inland waterways where they work to power our nation's economy. This will require vigilant oversight of the NFIP by Congress and continued engagement from industry groups and passionate grassroots organizations that made flood insurance reform a national priority.
This compromise reestablishes affordability as a critical and necessary centerpiece of the nation flood insurance program. It's about protecting our unique culture, a treasured way of life and preserving the historic coastal communities that are the engine's our of nation's economy.
Again, thank you for making this a national priority and I am so proud to tell you that relief is in sight.
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
