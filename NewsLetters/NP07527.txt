Dear
Friends,
This Tuesday, July 22,
marked the 10-year
anniversary of the release of
the 9/11 Commission Report.
As the Chairman of the
Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs
Committee, I can tell you
that this report has been and
continues to be incredibly
important to the work that we
do in the Committee and in
Congress.
On Wednesday, I took to
the Senator floor to
commemorate this important
occasion.
Nearly 13 years ago, on
September 11, 2001, our
nation suffered its most
devastating attack on U.S.
soil since Pearl Harbor. In
the months after this
horrific attack, Congress and
the president endeavored to
answer the many painful
questions we were all asking
ourselves in the aftermath of
the tragedy.
Together, we
established the 9/11
Commission.
The bipartisan commission,
led by former New Jersey
Governor Tom Kean, a
Republican, and former
Congressman Lee Hamilton, a
Democrat, interviewed more
than 1,200 people in 10
countriesincluding
every single relevant senior
national security official
from two
administrationsand
reviewed more than 2.5
million pages of documents.
Despite the political
tensions and partisan climate
that had engulfed nation at
the time, the commissioners
put aside their own political
differences and issued their
final report 10 years
ago.Their overall
findings, including 41
recommendations to enhance
national security, were
published in the final
592-page 9/11 Commission
Report. It was a remarkable
achievement, not only because
of the depth and breadth of
the commissions
findings, but because all 10
commissioners
five
Democrats and five
Republicans
came to agreement on every
single word in that
report.
In the months and years
following the reports
release, Democrats and
Republicans in Congress
worked together with the Bush
administration to enact two
major laws to implement the
reports
recommendations. Among other
things, these two historic
bills created a new director
of national intelligence to
coordinate and oversee all
information sharing and
intelligence activities,
implemented a passenger
prescreening system that
ensures terrorists
arent able to fly on
aircraft, and established a
Privacy and Civil Liberties
Oversight Board. When
you think about these
accomplishments, I think
its safe to say that
the 9/11 Commission Report
has proven to be one of the
most important and
influential efforts of its
kind in recent history.
We owe a debt of gratitude to
the commissioners for their
determined and clear-eyed
approach to improving the
security of our nation.
Today, we in Congress
should recapture the spirit
of unity that made this
incredible bipartisan
achievement possible. We must
remember to set aside what
separates us, remember what
binds us, and come together
to keep Americans safe and
our homeland secure. Given
the challenges that our
country still faces at home
and abroad, it is our
duty.
