Dear Friend,
This week the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in one of the most critical cases on religious liberty in the modern history of our country. Three companies, Hobby Lobby, Mardel&#39;s Books and Conestoga Wood Specialties&#44; are taking a stand against ObamaCare and its requirement that all employers include abortion services in their employee health plan. While these three companies are leading the charge in Washington&#44; this case will ultimately impact businesses and organizations in Missouri and throughout the country.
The problems with ObamaCare are serious. From soaring monthly premiums, to lost coverage, families, workers and small businesses are all feeling the pinch from President Obama&#39;s healthcare mandate. Furthermore, through the contraceptive mandate that includes abortion services, ObamaCare ignores American&#39;s First Amendment right to freely exercise religious beliefs. By forcing employers to provide abortion services to their employees, even if the employer has a religious objection, ObamaCare disregards an individual&#39;s religious beliefs in the work setting. Put more simply, President Obama&#39;s healthcare law is forcing people with deeply held religious beliefs to choose between their conscience and their business.
America&#39;s founding fathers wanted a better, less intrusive federal government. The founders included religious liberty as a fundamental right of all Americans in our Constitution. Generations of Americans, of all faiths, have celebrated, defended and expanded religious freedom throughout all fifty states and the District of Columbia. America can be distinguished from other nations of the world because we do not feel threatened by each other&#39;s faiths. The chronicles of history are filled with nations that have limited or suppressed their citizen&#39;s right to worship. As Americans, we are blessed to live in a country that respects people of all faiths and their right to worship freely.
As the Supreme Court considers the lawsuit brought by Hobby Lobby, Mardel&#39;s Books and Conestoga Wood Specialties, it is my hope that the Justices will respect the First Amendment of the Constitution. The federal government should not force people who own businesses to check their religious beliefs at the doorway of their business. I pray that the Supreme Court will uphold the Constitution by ruling in favor of religious liberty.

THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
This week I had breakfast with members of the Missouri Farm Bureau. I was honored to be joined by my colleague, Congressman Paul Ryan who spoke about the importance of simplifying the tax code and ending deficit spending.
On Tuesday I had the great honor of welcoming Salem Mayor Gary Brown and Tammy Snodgrass from the Meramac Regional Planning Commission. It is always great to see familiar faces here in Washington D.C.
I enjoyed meeting the Jones family from Hayti who were spending their Spring break in Washington. Our staff is always happy to welcome guests and facilitate visits to the Capitol! If you are planning a trip to Washington and would like to visit the Capitol, please contact my office at (202) 225-4404.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
