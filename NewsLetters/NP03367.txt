Davis Delivers First Weekly Republican Address of 2015
On January 3rd, I had the opportunity to deliver the first Weekly Republican Address to the nation from Springfield, Illinois.
My message centered around this new Congress' focus on legislation to spur job creation and create more opportunities for the American people including my bill, the
Hire More Heroes Act , which helps businesses hire more of our nation's veterans.

The
Hire More Heroes Act
was the first bill considered in the 114th Congress and passed the House 416-0 on January 6, 2015.
This idea didn't come from Washington, it came from a constituent in the 13th District.
Brad Lavite, Superintendent of the Madison County Veterans Assistance Commission, brought this issue up at a veteran's advisory board meeting I held in the district and we began working on legislation.
I was honored to have Brad join me in D.C. last week to see the bill he inspired pass unanimously.

Davis Sworn Into 114th Congress
On January 6, I took the oath of office and was sworn into a second term in Congress.
Thank you for another opportunity to serve the people of Illinois 13th Congressional District.
This oath is one that I take very seriously and will continue to uphold by supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States. Very excited to have my wife, Shannon, and children, Toryn, Clark, and Griffin with me as I was sworn in.

ISU
vs.
NDSU
Last week, I made a friendly bet with Congressman Kevin Cramer (R-ND) on last weekend's FCS National Championship game in which I wagered two dozen cupcakes from Sugar Mama's Bakery near my office in Normal and Congressman Cramer wagered bison jerky and summer sausage. The Redbirds fought a good fight but were ultimately defeated by the Bison. Stay tuned to my
Facebook
and
Twitter
pages in the coming weeks as I make good on our bet and deliver these cupcakes wearing NDSU colors to Congressman Cramer.

Meet Illinois' 42nd Governor
Earlier this week, I had the honor of participating in the inauguration of Illinois' 42nd Governor, Bruce Rauner.
It was a bittersweet day as we watched Governor Rauner take the oath office and look forward to a brighter future for Illinois but missed the presence of a great friend and public servant: Judy Baar Topinka.
I was humbled to recognize Judy by leading a moment of silence in her honor.
She will truly be missed.
Congratulations to Governor Rauner and his entire team on such a memorable day.
I look forward to working with the Governor on opportunities to move our great state forward.

Help with the IRS
Mary Boyer of Bloomington is this week's constituent highlight.
She had a complicated issue with the IRS that my office was able to help with.
After Mary's husband passed away, she was having trouble filing her tax refund with the IRS because she was missing information on her late husband.
Fortunately, my office was able to work with the IRS to ensure Mary received her full refund.
If you're having trouble with a federal agency like Mary, my office is happy to assist.
