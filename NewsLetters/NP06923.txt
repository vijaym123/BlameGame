Thanks for Honors from the Federation of Southern Cooperatives Land Assistance Fund
On Thursday, I was honored to receive the Estelle Witherspoon Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Federation of Southern Cooperatives Land Assistance Fund in Birmingham, Alabama.
I generally do not travel from D.C. to speak or receive awards (too much to do here!).
However, my most memorable time in the civil rights movement was in the rural South, which gave birth to the movement.
On this 50th Anniversary of Freedom Summer, I needed to go.

Reaching for Lasting Remedies in Ferguson, MO
Last week, the nation witnessed the shooting of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The law enforcements handling of the
situation, including the protests that followed, was alarming and excessive, particularly the armored vehicles and militarized police officers roaming the streets with body armor and assault weapons.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) almost immediately announced
a federal investigation into the matter.
I believe that the outpouring of anger in Ferguson represents a deep and long-standing breakdown in relations between the community and law enforcement officials.
That is why I called upon the DOJ to introduce to
Ferguson the DOJ
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)
program to help improve relations with the community and to train local law enforcement officials in community policing, much like what D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier has famously done in our city.
