ACA Enrollment Reaches 8
Million
More than 8 million Americans have
signed up for private health insurance through healthcare.gov, with
35 percent of enrollees under the age of 35.
Millions more have
new coverage under Medicaid.
Up to 129 million Americans with
pre-existing health conditions, including 17 million children, no longer
have to worry about being denied coverage or being charged higher
premiums due to their health status.
Further, 3.1 million young
adults have gained health coverage because they can now stay on their
parents' health plan up to age 26. Numbers like these show that the
Affordable Care Act is working.
Also, on April 14, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
issued a report on the Affordable Care Act in which it projected
reduced costs and increased coverage under the ACA.
CBO projects that
the ACAs expansion of health coverage would cost $104 billion less
over the next decade than previously projected.
The primary reason
that CBOs cost projections of the ACA continue to decrease is that
premiums are lower than projected.
Lawmakers Urge Action to Keep
Asian Carp Out of the Great Lakes
A bipartisan group of eight House lawmakers,
including Rep. Levin, recently wrote a
letter
to the Army
Corps of Engineers to underscore the need for both short- and
long-term measures to stop the Asian carp from getting into the Great
Lakes.
The carp would devastate the Great Lakes fishery if they become
established there.
Specifically, the lawmakers letter urges the
Corps to move aggressively to begin implementing the recommendations
contained in the January 2014 Great Lakes and Mississippi River
Inter-basin Study.
Find Out How Your Tax Dollars Are
Spent
When you go to the grocery store to
buy food, you walk out with an itemized receipt showing how much you
paid and what your hard-earned dollars bought.
Federal taxes
should be no different.
The White House has created an online
calculator
that will tell you what your federal taxes paid
for.
All you need
to do is enter how much you paid last year for income tax, Social
Security and Medicare taxes.
(You can find this information on your
W-2s and 2013 tax return.
If this information isnt handy, you
can have the calculator do a rough estimate based on a range of
incomes.)
The calculator will then give you an individualized receipt
showing how your tax dollars were spent.
