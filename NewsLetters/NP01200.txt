VISITING DC
May 01, 2015
This week, in response to
the horrible news that an illegal immigrant killed four in North
Carolina, Senators Tillis, Grassley and I introduced legislation prohibiting
people with gang ties from receiving deferred deportation and other
immigration benefits.
The circumstances around this
bill
are incredibly sad and preventable.
If the
President cant take steps to ensure that Americans are safe from criminal
gang members,
then Congress must take preventative
action . I hope that Congress will pass this law to ensure criminals
cannot stay in this country, even under this Presidents edict. You can
read the Charlotte Observers report on this bill
here .
Wednesday, I sat down with the Charlotte Observer to
discuss
my recent amendment
to the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which will free up nearly $24 million
for our nations schools, including North Carolina:
Its pretty simple. North Carolinas been cheated
since the last time this was reauthorized, along with 33 other states,
Burr said in an interview on Wednesday. Now weve revised it to
where the money is going to follow the population and the kids that are at
risk.

Monday, I joined a
bipartisan group of Senators
urging
Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald to
grant benefits to post-Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange
while serving as crew members of C-123 aircraft. It has been proven
that these veterans were exposed to toxic herbicide residue while they
served on aircraft used to spray Agent Orange in Vietnam. Justice for
these veterans is long overdue.

Secretary McDonald

Finally, on Thursday Senator Tillis, Rep. Rouzer, and I introduced
bicameral legislation to reunite Brunswick county with the Wilmington
metropolitan area following an arbitrary split made by the Census
Bureau and the Office of Management of Budget (OMB) two years
ago.
In this classic Washington maneuver, this mindless application of a
bureaucratic rule at the federal level has had an enormous effect on
the economy in the area. This is a fact that North Carolinians know --
Brunswick County is part of the greater Wilmington area. However,
since the Administration has chosen not to address this mistake, Ive
joined together with Senator Tillis and Rep Rouzer to make sure OBMs
guidelines reflect what reality looks like for people in North Carolina.

Sincerely,
Richard Burr
