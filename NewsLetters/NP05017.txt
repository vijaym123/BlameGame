Friend -- We are PRETTY DARN EXCITED to give you the good news:
CO: Democrats have overcome a 6 point deficit to pull into a one point lead: 45-44
GA: Democrats have erased a 4 point deficit to gain a three point lead: 47-44
KY: Democrats have battled back from a 3 point deficit to TIE with Mitch McConnell.
You&rsquo;ve helped stage an incredible Democratic turnaround this month -- thank you. But we can&rsquo;t celebrate yet: A dozen races are within FIVE points.
The Republicans WON&#39;T let their number one target -- the Senate -- go easily. The gobs of right-wing cash are coming: McConnell himself just loaned his own campaign $1.8 MILLION for the final 10-day stretch!
Our final-week Get Out The Vote deadline hits tomorrow at midnight, and we need a grassroots SURGE to fill the $198,216 hole in our GOTV budget. If you give TONIGHT we&rsquo;ll TRIPLE-MATCH your gift!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We want to make this election&rsquo;s GOTV operation our MOST AGGRESSIVE EVER by getting every single Democrat to the polls. But if you don&rsquo;t help TONIGHT, that means we&rsquo;ll have to forgo critical canvasses and voter reminder calls.
If you DO pitch in, however, we&rsquo;ll be able to go out in full force in Colorado, Georgia (Nate Silver&rsquo;s new &ldquo;tipping-point state&rdquo;), Kentucky, and EVERY other race, getting out EVERY voter for the win on November 4!! We&rsquo;ll overwhelm and devastate the Republicans!
Friend, this is the most critical moment yet! Democratic senators will triple match your gift until midnight tonight!
