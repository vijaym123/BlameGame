Highlighting West Virginia
Agriculture
From sun up to sun down farmers are hard at
work to ensure our families can put food on the table. They are a key
part of our economy and create good jobs.
On Tuesday
I completed a
tour of three farms
in Eastern West
Virginia to highlight the importance of agriculture in the Mountain
State and better understand the challenges the agricultural community
faces.
Excessive government regulations often make
their jobs harder with too much red tape. The EPA and other agencies
impose unnecessary and overbearing rules on these family businesses who
are just trying to do the right thing. This tour was a great opportunity
to listen and learn what we can do to help our farmers in
Washington.
Joined by leaders from the West Virginia Farm
Bureau and local farmers, we toured the
Flying W Farm
in
Burlington; the
Eight is Enough
Farm
in Old Fields; and the
Cottage Hill Farm
in Petersburg.
The West
Virginia
farming family
is made up of hard working
people who are dedicated to improving our lives. They make our
communities and state a better place to live and we want to do all we can to
work on their behalf.
Honoring Brooke Countys
Veteran of the Year
Last weekend, World War II
veteran
Bill Schwertfeger
received the Brooke
County Veterans Memorial Park Foundations Veteran of the Year award. The
90-year-old Schwertfeger served in the Army in World War II and was
part of the efforts to free Italy from Nazi forces.
It was an
honor to meet with and hear Mr. Schwertfegers story. Mr.
Schwertfeger received the Bronze Star for rescuing a fallen soldier and later
served his community as both a Follansbee councilman and commander of the
Follansbee American Legion Post. He also had a 32 year career in
education, serving as a teacher and administrator at several schools in
the area. This veteran not only was a member of the Greatest Generation,
but has devoted his life to the service of others.
Thank you
Mr. Schwertfeger.
Standing up for

Health and Human Resources in Wood County, Medicare and Medicaid,

Exporter of the Year.
Rep. McKinley Visits Wheeling Truck Center in
2011
Ive had the opportunity to visit the Wheeling
Truck Center to see his operations and am excited about the success of
their business, which sells trucks and parts to more than 50 foreign
countries. Congratulations to Chad for this
honor.
Busy Week in the First District
During the
district work period I traveled all over the first district to meet
with constituents in Mineral, Grant, Marion, Harrison, Hancock, Brooke,
Pleasants, and Wood Counties. Stops included a tour of the Resolute
Forest Products Plant in Fairmont and Oak Glen High School in New
Cumberland to meet with students. This week I also met with city officials in

and priorities.
