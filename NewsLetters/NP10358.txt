Dear Friend,
You may be wondering...what's the most unusual thing your
representative has done in the past two weeks?
Well, since my last update, I've been all over the district - visiting
with local employers, meeting with community groups, chatting with
Chambers of Commerce in Poulsbo and Port Angeles, participating in a
bunch of policy roundtables, and having great discussions about the
future of our region.
But in terms of unusual activities, I would say a couple of things take
the cake.
First, earlier this week on a visit to Pierce Transit, I was invited to
drive one of their buses (after a good discussion of federal transit
policy). In my short spin around the obstacle course, I managed to
knock down two orange cones but got off the bus with my dignity
(mostly) intact.
Second, I got to spend a morning doing a ride-along with a UPS driver
in Bremerton, delivering packages on his regular route. I had a great
time meeting small business owners and making a stop at West Hills STEM
Academy. Visiting folks at the start of their day reminded me of the
exciting things happening in Bremerton - from quality education to
innovative products. I appreciated the opportunity as part of my
ongoing "Kilmer at Your Company" visits. Everyone at UPS and at the
locations we visited was very welcoming - though almost everyone told
me that brown is not my color.
Now, on to the news!
WA State Cyber Summit
In my brief tenure in office, I've been surprised at how often concerns
about cybersecurity have come up. I've heard concerns from local
utility providers about risks to the power grid. I've heard from
financial institutions and even military officers who fear the
potential for substantial disruption tied to a cyber-attack.
But I've also heard from companies who believe there may be economic
opportunities for our region in combating these threats. As we get
further into the 21st century, we are starting to see the emergence of
industries - and jobs - that didn't even exist 20 years ago. On April
17th I had the chance to speak about the importance of the Puget Sound
region emerging as a leader in cybersecurity at the Washington State
Cyber Summit.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I understand how
important it is for our nation to be well prepared against growing
cyber threats, and I also want to make sure that our region is well
positioned to be a hub for a growing cybersecurity industry and the
jobs that come with it. In fact, when Congress reconvenes next week,
I'll be introducing a bill to enable areas like ours to better work
with the Department of Defense on cybersecurity capabilities.
I authored an Op-Ed in the Tacoma News Tribune arguing that our state
can be at the forefront of cybersecurity. If our region can capitalize
on our cyber interests and capabilities, we can make progress against
these threats. We could also position ourselves at the center of a
rapidly growing sector of our economy. You can read more about why I
think this is so important for our region by reading my op-ed here
.
Welcome to the Puget Sound Caucus, Rep. Peter DeFazio!
A couple weeks ago, I joined with my colleague and fellow Puget Sound
Recovery Caucus founder Rep. Denny Heck to host Rep. Peter DeFazio, the
Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee, at a series of
events in our region so he can learn more about the work we're doing to
protect the Puget Sound. Our first stop was a roundtable in which we
talked about salmon recovery and treaty rights. We heard from the
Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission about the important role that
Puget Sound plays in our regional economy. We also visited the Center
for Urban Waters in Tacoma for a discussion of the important work being
undertaken by the Puget Sound Partnership.
As of this past Tuesday, I am happy to welcome Rep. Peter DeFazio from
Oregon as the newest member of the Puget Sound Caucus
. Along with being the first member of the
caucus from outside Washington State, Rep. DeFazio is the Ranking
Member of the House Natural Resources Committee which oversees a whole
range of important policy areas relating to our environment and
watersheds. This is great news for everyone who cares about the future
of the Puget Sound. It marks real progress in our effort to raise
national awareness about the Sound's role in our state's economy and
identity.
Tribal Summit
I was also proud to join every tribe from the 6th District in welcoming
U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to the House of
Awakened Culture in Suquamish yesterday for a tribal summit. We spent a
productive morning detailing the challenges facing our region's tribes
and ideas regarding what we can do to make progress.
In particular we had valuable conversations related to tribal
sovereignty, the best ways to increase economic development
opportunities, and the impact that climate change and the increased
incidents of severe weather are having on our coastal communities.
The discussions highlighted the importance of some of the legislation
I'm working on. As we heard about the inadequacy of broadband in the
remote parts of the district, it gave me an opportunity to talk about
the Promoting Rural Broadband Act that I've introduced. I've also
introduced the Coastal Resiliency Act of 2014 in hopes of addressing
some of the flooding challenges facing our coastal tribes and coastal
communities.
Our region is blessed to have such a wide array of diverse tribal
communities, and I was proud to play a role in helping to organize and
be a part of this conversation. You can read more about the summit here
, and here
.
A Brief Word About Bipartisanship
Sometime in the next few weeks you may be able to catch a broadcast on
TVW of a discussion that Rep. Dave Reichert and I participated in at
the Seattle City Club. The forum was called "Working Across the Aisle"
and focused on bipartisanship.
Rep. Reichert and I had a good dialogue about getting Congress
re-focused on making progress for our country rather than getting
wrapped around the axle on partisan bickering. You can also check it
out here

Congressional Art Competition
Congratulations to Rebekah Fleming, a senior at the Tacoma School of
the Arts, for winning First Place in the Congressional Art Competition
for the 6th District. Rebekah will head to D.C. on June 26th for the
winners' reception. A big thank you to the Tacoma Art Museum for
hosting an exhibit of all the entries this year - I'm proud to see such
terrific artistic talent displayed by our high school students.
Upcoming Telephone Town Hall - Tuesday, April 29th
Finally, I will be holding another Telephone Town Hall on Tuesday,
April 29th, at 6pm PST. I work for you, and I want to make sure that I
continue to be accessible and accountable to you. Residents of the 6th
District who would like to join the call can sign up here
or send an email to
kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.gov with their name and phone number by
3pm PT on Monday April 28th.
It's an Honor to Represent You
Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I or my
office can be helpful to you. I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek

2014 Dear
Friend,
You
may
be
wondering...what&#8217;s
the
most
unusual
thing
your
representative
has
done
in
the
past
two
weeks?
Well,
since
my
last
update,
I&#8217;ve
been
all
over
the
district
&#8211;
visiting
with
local
employers,
meeting
with
community
groups,
chatting
with
Chambers
of

in
Poulsbo
and
Port
Angeles,
participating
in
a
bunch
of
policy
roundtables,
and
having
great
discussions
about
the
future
of
our
region.
But
in
terms
of
unusual
activities,
I
would
say
a
couple
of
things
take
the
cake.
First,
earlier
this
week
on
a
visit
to
Pierce
Transit,
I
was
invited
to
drive
one
of
their
buses
(after
a
good
discussion
of
federal
transit
policy). In
my
short
spin
around
the
obstacle
course,
I
managed
to
knock
down
two
orange
cones
but
got
off
the
bus
with
my
dignity
(mostly)
intact.
Second,
I
got
to
spend
a
morning
doing
a
ride-along
with
a
UPS
driver
in
Bremerton,
delivering
packages
on
his
regular
route. I
had
a
great
time
meeting
small
business
owners
and
making
a
stop
at
West
Hills
STEM
Academy.
Visiting
folks
at
the
start
of
their
day
reminded
me
of
the
exciting
things
happening
in
Bremerton
&#8211;
from
quality
education
to
innovative
products. I
appreciated
the
opportunity
as
part
of
my
ongoing
&#8220;Kilmer
at
Your
Company&#8221;
visits. Everyone
at
UPS
and
at
the
locations
we
visited
was
very
welcoming
&#8211;
though
almost
everyone
told
me
that
brown
is
not
my
color.
Now,
on
to
the
news!

speak
about
the

of
the

at

As

I
understand
how
important
it
is
for
our
nation
to
be
well

and
I
also
want
to
make

that
our

is
well

be

a

our
economy.

Welcome
to
the
Puget
Sound
Caucus,
Rep.
Peter
DeFazio!
A
couple
weeks
ago,
I
joined
with
my
colleague
and
fellow
Puget
Sound
Recovery
Caucus
founder
Rep.
Denny
Heck
to
host
Rep.
Peter
DeFazio,
the
Ranking
Member
of
the
Natural
Resources
Committee,
at
a
series
of
events
in
our
region
so
he
can
learn
more
about
the
work
we're
doing
to
protect
the
Puget
Sound.
Our
first
stop
was
a
roundtable
in
which
we
talked
about
salmon
recovery
and
treaty
rights. We
heard
from
the
Northwest
Indian
Fisheries
Commission
about
the
important
role
that
Puget
Sound
plays
in
our
regional
economy. We
also
visited
the
Center
for
Urban
Waters
in
Tacoma
for
a
discussion
of
the
important
work
being
undertaken
by
the
Puget
Sound
Partnership.
As
of
this
past
Tuesday,
I
am
happy
to
welcome
Rep.
Peter
DeFazio
from
Oregon
as
the
newest
member
of
the
Puget
Sound
Caucus .
Along
with
being
the
first
member
of
the
caucus
from
outside
Washington
State,
Rep.
DeFazio
is
the
Ranking
Member
of
the
House
Natural
Resources
Committee
which
oversees
a
whole
range
of
important
policy
areas
relating
to
our
environment
and
watersheds.
This
is
great
news
for
everyone
who
cares
about
the
future
of
the
Puget
Sound.
It
marks
real
progress
in
our
effort
to
raise
national
awareness
about
the
Sound&#8217;s
role
in
our
state&#8217;s
economy
and
identity.
Tribal
Summit
I
was
also
proud
to
join
every
tribe
from
the
6th
District
in
welcoming
U.S.
Department
of
the
Interior
Secretary
Sally
Jewell
to
the
House
of
Awakened
Culture
in
Suquamish
yesterday
for
a
tribal
summit.
We
spent
a
productive
morning
detailing
the
challenges
facing
our
region&#8217;s
tribes
and
ideas
regarding
what
we
can
do
to
make
progress.
In
particular
we
had
valuable
conversations
related
to
tribal
sovereignty,
the
best
ways
to
increase
economic
development
opportunities,
and
the
impact
that
climate
change
and
the
increased
incidents
of
severe
weather
are
having
on
our
coastal
communities.
The
discussions
highlighted
the
importance
of
some
of
the
legislation
I&#8217;m
working
on. As
we
heard
about
the
inadequacy
of
broadband
in
the
remote
parts
of
the
district,
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
Promoting
Rural
Broadband
Act
that
I&#8217;ve
introduced. I&#8217;ve
also
introduced
the
Coastal
Resiliency
Act
of
2014
in
hopes
of
addressing
some
of
the
flooding
challenges
facing
our
coastal
tribes
and
coastal
communities.
Our
region
is
blessed
to
have
such
a
wide
array
of
diverse
tribal
communities,
and
I
was
proud
to
play
a
role
in
helping
to
organize
and
be
a
part
of
this
conversation. You
