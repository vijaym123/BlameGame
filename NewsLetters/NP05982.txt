Dear Friends,
The United States is at war with ISIS, and
it appears our Commander-In-Chief is neglecting the advise of his
military advisors.
[READ HERE:
WashPo:
Rift widens between Obama, military leaders]
ISIS is
not just any terrorist organization; it is an extremist army that is
better networked and more well-funded than Al-Qaeda ever has been. ISIS
has more than 35,000 fighters nearly three times larger than it was
in Juneand it is growing larger every day. The group holds and
governs territory the size of Indiana and is taking in roughly $3 million a
day to fund its reign of terror.
President Obama
has tasked his military leaders to degrade, and ultimately destroy
ISIL, as he told the nation on Sept. 12, with the pretense that it will
not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. Not
only has he continued with this narrative, but others in his
administration
to include Secretary John Kerry and National Security Advisor
Susan Rice
have done the presidents bidding, asking for defeat without
troops on the ground.
Unfortunately,
the president is not telling the American people the truth
and is
instead merely spouting poll-tested rhetoric. His promise of no boots
on the ground ties the hands of U.S. military commanders and places our
servicemembers at a disadvantage by precluding all military options
from being considered. Simultaneously,
the president
is conveniently neglecting to remind the American public
that he
recently sent an additional 350 members of the U.S. military to Baghdad
that help compose the now more than 1,600 U.S. troops on orders in
Iraq.
As Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee,
I asked Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey
earlier this
month about the Presidents plans for ISIS. I commend both men for being
blunt in their statements, particularly when Gen. Dempsey stated that
if a coalition effort fails, and there are threats to the United
States, then of course I would go back to the president and make a
recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.
Gen. Dempsey also acknowledged that if a servicemembers plane is
targeted and goes down in Syria, that hed send troops in for a rescue
mission.
Gen. Dempsey was later asked by press to clarify if
his comments meant that he was asking for boots on the ground. He
responded with: The president gave me a mission
destroy ISIL. I will
recommend to him what it takes to destroy ISIL. He clarified that if
destroying ISIS meant at some point having U.S. soldiers more closely
integrated with a foreign ground force then, yes, he would recommend
it.
During a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 18,
former Commander of U.S. Central Command Marine Corps Gen. James
Mattis recently testified before Congress and declared: you just dont
take anything off the table up front, which it appears the
administration has tried to do.
When former
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
appeared on CBS This Morning on Sept
17, he not only echoed the exact
concerns of the other military
leaders but he also noted the strategic corner the president has
forced himself into: "There will be boots on the ground if there's to be
any hope of success in the strategy. And I think that by continuing to
repeat that [the U.S. won't put boots on the ground], the president, in
effect, traps himself."
I have two leading concerns with
the presidents ongoing no boots on the ground rhetoric. First, he
is failing to acknowledge the many men and women in uniform who have
been deployed to the region to assist with the mission to defeat ISIS.
Their spouses, children, and loved ones are reminded daily that
someone dear to them is on the ground and in harms way charged with
safeguarding Americas interests and our national security. Second, if the
situation is as grave as our military leaders and intelligence are
saying, and if the Presidents goal is as he stated two weeks ago to defeat
ISIL, then the President needs to listen to his military leaders and
at the very least leave all options on the table to do what it takes
to win a war.
Its important to know what you
think about the situation our nation faces in the threat against ISIL. I
hope you will take a moment to answer my survey questions
below:
Would you support U.S. boots on
the ground, leading in direct combat, if it were at the advice of our
military leaders in order to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria?
Yes No Undecided Do you believe airstrikes alone in Iraq and Syria will be effective
in accomplishing the Presidents mission to ultimately defeat ISIS?
Yes No Undecided Do you believe the President has presented an honest and
effective strategy for U.S. involvement in defeating ISIS?
Yes No Undecided How concerned are you that ISIS forces pose a direct threat to the
homeland? Very

Thank you for
taking an interest to understand what I am doing to best represent you
in Washington.
Sincerely,
Jim Inhofe
