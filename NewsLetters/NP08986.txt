Dear Neighbor-
Summer is here! Folks around the Twin Cities are finally getting the
chance to spend time in the best public park system in the country
. We Minnesotans know that our public
spaces and clean environment are some of the best things about our home.
I want to make sure that our children and grandchildren will have the
opportunity to enjoy the same things about our state that we do now.
That's why it's so important to talk about how we are affected by
climate change.
Climate change is already harming Minnesotans.
We've had three
1,000-year flooding events in the last decade. According to the
Minnesota Department of Health, children, the elderly, and poor
communities are most at risk from heat waves. Increased summer
temperatures have also lead to higher rates of asthma and respiratory
illness, especially among communities of color and low-income families.
Minnesota has started to take important action in the fight against
climate change. In the last five years, energy from renewable sources
in Minnesota has increased by more than 80%, putting us on track to
meet our goal of 25% renewable energy statewide by 2025.
Rep. Ellison speaks at a rally for climate justice with Green for All,
the Sierra Club, and the NAACP in North Minneapolis
But we need to do more. Last week, President Obama announced the
first-ever standards to limit the carbon pollution from power plants
around the country. This is a huge step in curbing the effects of
climate change, and will help ensure a cleaner planet for future
generations. It's good to see the President following Minnesota's lead,
and these standards will help Minnesotan energy get even cleaner.
My parents always taught me to leave the places I visited cleaner than
the way I found them. It's our civic and moral obligation to leave our
kids cleaner air, land and water.
How do we do it? All of us need to take responsibility for our future.
Let's work together to reduce our consumption, reuse old belongings,
and recycle and compost what we can. Buy local produce, bike to work,
or use public transit. The products and services we use should minimize
environmental impact by opting for less packaging, additives, or
pesticides. And we can defend our environment by standing up for the
Environmental Protection Agency as they work to protect us by stopping
dangerous carbon pollution.
Minnesota is doing a lot to stop climate change, but we must do more.

fight, please let me know by leaving a message on our website at

Dear
Neighbor-
Summer
is
here!
Folks
around
the
Twin
Cities
are
finally
getting
the

We
Minnesotans
know
that

some

I
want
to
make

that
our
children
and
grandchildren
will
have
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
same
things
about
our
state
that
we
do
now.
That&#8217;s
why
it&#8217;s
so
important
to
talk
about
how
we
are
affected
by
climate
change.
Climate

is

Minnesotans.
We&#8217;ve

take
important
action
in
the
fight

In

My
