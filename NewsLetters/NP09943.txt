Capitol Update
Congressman Cook's Statement on the I-15 Bridge Fire
The news coming from Hesperia is devastating. I learned of the bridge
fire late last night and have remained in contact with local officials
in the High Desert. I applaud the firefighters, police, and other first
responders that were able to extinguish the fire and secure the area.
They protect our community every day and deserve our gratitude.
In the aftermath of this fire and collapse, I urge all residents and
I-15 users to cooperate with local law enforcement to ensure a safe and
speedy clean-up. I'll be working with local officials to restart this
project as soon as possible.
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Bill to Ensure Local Input for Endangered
Species Listings
Recently, Congressman Cook cosponsored H.R. 4419, the Sage-Grouse and
Endangered Species Conservation and Protection Act. Recently, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service has been considering listing the Greater Sage
Grouse as a threatened or endangered species. This could impose land
use restrictions on over 60,000,000 acres of public and private land
across 11 states. Mono County would be particularly hard-hit by this
listing with potentially devastating effects on its local economy.
H.R. 4419 would do three things to prevent this from happening. First,
it provides the federal government, states, and local communities with
proactive, common sense resource management options. Second, it
establishes a funding source for habitat management projects related to
these listings. Finally, it ensures that the federal government
fulfills its obligation to provide funding for habitat projects when
habitat issues are the source of a proposed listing.
Said Cook, "It's important that we protect threatened species, but it's
even more important that we protect our local economies. This bill
provides the tools to manage the sage grouse responsibly, without
imposing a one-size-fits-all Washington solution. It's possible to
balance local property rights and conservation and this bill does
exactly that."
Congressman Cook Applauds Formation of Select Committee to Investigate
Benghazi
Congressman Cook praised the Speaker's decision to allow a vote on the
House floor to form a Select Committee on Benghazi. As a cosponsor of
H. Res. 36,establishing a select committee to investigate and report on
the attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya,
Congressman Cook knows just how important a proper Benghazi
investigation is. The committee will investigate the attack, hold
officials accountable for any failures or cover-ups, and ensure that
justice is finally served.
Said Cook, "This committee will be a vital step toward finally
answering the questions about what happened in Benghazi, why four
Americans died, and why this administration has mislead Congress and
the American people about the attacks and their aftermath. The most
recent emails show an administration more concerned with politics and
pushing a false narrative than with bringing the terrorists responsible
to justice. The American people deserve honest answers and this
committee will get those answers."
Holocaust Denial Has No Place in Our Public Schools: A Message from
Congressman Cook
I'm shocked and offended by the recent revelation that a school in
Rialto assigned students to do a report on whether or not the Holocaust
was an "actual event" or a "propaganda tool that was used for political
and monetary gain." While I welcome the decision by the school district
to strike any references denying the Holocaust from future assignments,
this never should have happened.
As a former educator, I know that teaching students to think critically
is a vital part of their education, but in a time of rising
anti-Semitism at home and abroad, this is a dangerous assignment. The
holocaust was the most monstrous crime of the Twentieth Century.
Afterward, the world vowed to never forget what happened.
Unfortunately, this misguided assignment actually makes it more likely
that people will forget, raising the specter of this tragedy being
repeated. Holocaust denial has no place in our society and assignments
like this are a slippery slope leading to denial.

I

late
last

They

In

I

Congressman

Cosponsors
Bill
to
Ensure
Local
Input
for
Endangered
Species
Listings Recently,
Congressman
Cook
cosponsored
H.R.
4419,
the
Sage-Grouse
and
Endangered
Species
Conservation
and
Protection
Act.
Recently,
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
has
been
considering
listing
the
Greater
Sage
Grouse
as
a
threatened
or
endangered
species.
This
could
impose
land
use
restrictions
on
over
60,000,000
acres
of
public
and
private
land
across
11
states.
Mono
County
would
be
particularly
hard-hit
by
this
listing
with
potentially
devastating
effects
on
its
local
economy.
H.R.
4419
would
do
three
things
to
prevent
this
from
happening.
First,
it
provides
the
federal
government,
states,
and
local
communities
with
proactive,
common
sense
resource
management
options.
Second,
it
establishes
a
funding
source
for
habitat
management
projects
related
to
these
listings.
Finally,
it
ensures
that
the
federal
government
fulfills
its
obligation
to
provide
funding
for
habitat
projects
when
habitat
issues
are
the
source
of
a
proposed
listing.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;It&#8217;s
important
that
we
protect
threatened
species,
but
it&#8217;s
even
more
important
that
we
protect
our
local
economies.
This
bill
provides
the
tools
to
manage
the
sage
grouse
responsibly,
without
imposing
a
one-size-fits-all
Washington
solution.
It&#8217;s
possible
to
balance
local
property
rights
and
conservation
and
this
bill
does
exactly
that.&#8221;
Congressman
Cook
Applauds
Formation
of
Select
Committee
to
Investigate
Benghazi Congressman
Cook
praised
the
Speaker&#8217;s
decision
to
allow
a
vote
on
the
House
floor to
form
a
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi.
As
a
cosponsor
of
H.
Res.
36, establishing
a
select
committee
to
investigate
and
report
on
the
attack
on
the
United
States
consulate
in
Benghazi,
Libya,
Congressman
Cook
knows
just
how
important
a
proper
Benghazi
investigation
is.
The
committee
will
investigate
the
attack,
hold
officials
accountable
for
any
failures
or
cover-ups,
and ensure
that
justice
is
finally
served.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;This
committee
will
be
a
vital
step
toward
finally
answering
the
questions
about
what
happened in
Benghazi,
why
four
Americans
died,
and
why
this
administration
has
mislead
Congress
and
the
American
people
about
the
attacks
and
their
aftermath.
The
most
recent
emails
show
an
administration
more
concerned
with
politics
and
pushing
a
false
narrative
than
with
bringing
the
terrorists
responsible
to
justice.
The
American
people
deserve honest
answers and
this
committee
will
get
those
answers.&#8221;
Holocaust
