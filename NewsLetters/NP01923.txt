Dear Friend,
Over the last five years, public trust in government has hit historic lows because of a lack of accountability.
Since coming to Washington,
Ive made it my mission to restore the public's trust in government.
Last week,
I introduced the Transparency in Government Act (TGA), which creates a more accessible and open government that shines light on every branch of government, strengthens our democracy, and encourages an efficient, open government.
TGA would modernize public access to information by utilizing 21st century technology, strengthening oversight of federal spending, increasing financial disclosures of both lawmakers and lobbyists, and improving judicial transparency.
Interested in knowing more?
You can find information about TGA
here
and a complete summary of my bill is available
here .
Show your support for action on this issue by

Sincerely,
Mike Quigley
