Veterans Jobs Fair A
Success
Our Veterans Jobs Fair on Wednesday was a huge
success! We had more than 60 vendors, ranging from NASA to Arch Coal, at
the Erickson Alumni Center in Morgantown there to interview veterans
and discuss new opportunities for these American
heroes.
Thank you to all the businesses that attended and the veterans who have
served our country. Read more about event

We look forward to holding another job fair in the future, so
stay tuned!
Obama Administration Backs Off Ammo
Ban
Last week, we told you about the Obama
Administrations threat to ban the M855 greentips ammo. This
unprecedented action was an example of major overreach in defiance of the
Second Amendment.
Thankfully, Americans spoke up and flooded the
ATF with over 80,000 comments on the proposed ban while hundreds of
Representatives and Senators sent letters condemning this move. This
week, the Administration
announced
they were
backing off the new regulations.
We will keep an eye on this
issue and remain vigilant against the ATF trying to bring back this bad
idea.
Coming Up
Important Legislation in
Committee
Next Wednesday, the House Energy and
Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on my legislation on EPA regulations
on coal ash. Our proposal would create certainty and ensure we
protect jobs and our environment. You can watch the hearing
here
at 10:15am on March 18.
Coal ash, an important
component in many everyday products, such as concrete and drywall,
supports 316,000 jobs in America. We can protect those jobs and give job
creators certainty by passing this
legislation.
Sistersville Tank Works Groundbreaking
Despite
the hurdles government puts in front of private businesses,
entrepreneurs continue to invest and expand. Congratulations to Sistersville
Tank Works and the Wells and Morgan families for continuing on in the
American tradition of bold risk-taking.
It was a pleasure to
join them at the groundbreaking and offer support to them and the
community. Read more about the day

Catching Up With
Hoppy
On Tuesday, I joined Hoppy to discuss the EPAs
job-killing regulations that will close coal power plants across the country.
It is important West Virginians decide how to deliver safe and
affordable energy, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC.

Mountaineers Update
West Virginia suffered a
knockout loss yesterday against Baylor in the Big 12 quarterfinals.
Hampered by injuries, WVU was able to hold off Baylor, despite big
players such as Juwan Staten and Gary Browne out on injuries. However,
Baylor wore down the WVU bench and came back for an 80-70 victory in the
final minutes.
It was not the end to WVUs Big 12 run we
hoped for, but the Mountaineers are already looking forward to the
tournament!
Have a great week,
David
