January 11, 2015
Friends,
On Tuesday, January 6, I took my oath
of office and was officially sworn in to the 114th Congress.
It
is truly an honor to represent you, your family, and our
community.
When I took my oath of office, it was again a surreal
experience.
But this time, it also brought forth different
emotions.
Two years ago, I was excited and awestruck to take my
oath.
Being your voice in Congress is an enormous responsibility, and
our government is a model of democracy for the rest of the world.
I could not believe that I had the opportunity to represent our
district on the national scale.
Two years later, my
excitement was accompanied by a sense of
hopeful resolve.
This is not to say that I have mastered
the halls of the Capitol and dont open a wrong door or two, but I have
no trouble getting back to our office at 223 Cannon House Office
Building.
It is here that I read over jobs bills that will get
Americans back to work, draft legislation that will make our country
competitive again, and most importantly, meet with members of our community
about issues impacting their lives.
Our office has become a hub
of ingenuity and a classroom for principled conservative policy, and I
am hopeful that great things lie ahead for our district.
The
resolve I felt when I took my oath of office stems from the
accomplishments of last Congress, as well as the relationships I have forged in our
district and in Washington.
As you know, for the first
time in eight years, Republicans have a majority in both chambers of
Congress.
We must use this opportunity to act on stalled bills, like
the
Keystone XL Pipeline , and put forth an
agenda that will make America more competitive.
Last
week, the House unanimously passed the
Hire More
Heroes
Act of 2015, which allows employers to exclude TRICARE-insured
employees from the calculations used to determine whether an employer is
subject to the Obamacare employer mandate.
On Wednesday, I
re-introduced the Uphold the Oath Americans Trust and Honor (OATH)
Resolution to protect the Constitution and stop the Presidents recent
immigration overreach.
On Wednesday, I also re-introduced the American
Competitiveness Resolution I drafted with Harvard Business School
Professor Michael Porter.
This resolution lays out a clear plan on
how we can make doing business in America easier and
cost-effective.
I look forward to drafting additional bills to improve the
quality of life for every American, especially residents of the Grand
Strand and Pee Dee.
In the coming weeks and months, I look forward
to introducing some common-sense bills that will rein in the size of
government, assist our veterans, and reduce the deficit.
Please
visit my
Facebook

Twitter
page, and

for daily updates on
legislation that impacts you.
Again, thank you for putting
your trust in me.
I am hopeful that together we can accomplish
great things.
Have a good
week,
