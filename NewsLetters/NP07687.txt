My dad was a World War II veteran, who served in Normandy in the weeks after D-Day. My mother was a homemaker, who could find the silver lining on the darkest cloud. Both of them taught me the value of hard work, honesty, and caring for others. The lessons they shared have stuck with me to this day. Sometimes, I can still hear the echoes of their words as Im making tough decisions.
Since this Sunday is National Parents' Day, I would like to take a moment to thank all of the parents in this nation who do the same thing for their children that my parents did for me.
Thank you for instilling in them important values. Thank you for teaching them that hard work is a good thing, and that integrity matters. I salute you. I am fighting for you. I cosponsored
H.J.Res.50 , the Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, which specifically states that the "liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right." I have fought for the safety of young girls and the right of parents to be involved in their childrens life-altering decisions ( H.R.732 ). I believe that no federal or state government action, including the ratification of an international treaty, can infringe upon parents fundamental rights without demonstrating a governmental interest of the highest order. I will continue to fight to protect the rights of parents from unnecessary government interference.
Yours in service,
Randy
