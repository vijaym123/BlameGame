As Americans, we
have several reasons for which to be thankful this Thanksgiving Day,
including the many freedoms we enjoy as a nation.
Personally, I
am grateful for the blessings of a wonderful family, great friends and
the opportunity to represent you in the United States Senate. As we
prepare to pay tribute to our blessings this Thursday, lets all be
sure to say a special prayer for those brave men and women serving
overseas, who will not have the opportunity to spend the holiday with their
families.
Julianne and I wish our service members and
their families, as well as all Georgians, a safe and happy
Thanksgiving.
May God bless you, and may God continue to bless the
United States of America.
Very Truly Yours,
