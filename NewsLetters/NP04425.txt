WEEK IN
REVIEW
Every veteran is a hero, and in preparation to celebrate and
honor them on November 11 th
Veterans Day
I spoke at the
Pig Trail Harley-Davidson Veterans Day Ceremony on Saturday and at
the Tyson Foods Veterans Day Event on Monday. On Tuesday, I headed down
to Atkins to address Atkins High students during their Veterans Day
assembly. There is simply no way to fully express our gratitude for our
servicemen and women.
Without their selfless service,
patriotism, and commitment to defending our freedom, America would not be
herself.
We are forever indebted to them, and again I say a heartfelt
and humbled thank you for the sacrifices made for our
country.
On Wednesday, Congress
returned to Washington to continue our work before the end of the 113th
Congress.
Our first order of business was considering and passing
five bills
including the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014
( H.R. 4194 ) and the
Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 ( H.R. 1233 )
under suspension of the
rules.
On
Thursday, in addition to considering four more bills under suspension, the
House Republican Conference elected its leadership team for the 114th
Congress. Im proud to have Rep. John Boehner (R-OH-8) continuing to
serve as Speaker of the House, as well as Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23)
as Majority Leader, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA-1) as Majority Whip, Rep.
Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA-5) as Republican Conference Chair, Rep.
Greg Walden (R-OR-2) as NRCC Chairman, Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-KS-2) as
Conference Vice-Chair, and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC-5) as Conference
Secretary. I applaud Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN-6) for joining the leadership
team as our Republican Policy Committee Chairman.
Congratulations!
On
Friday, the House passed
H.R.
5682 , a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Specifically,
H.R. 5682 authorizes the construction, connection, operation, and
maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline and deems the Final
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Secretary of State in
January of 2014 sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and any other federal
law that requires federal agency consultation or review. Building the
Keystone XL would put thousands of Americans to work, set the momentum
for more plants, pipelines, and transmission lines to be built, and
ultimately drive down the price of gas at the pump for and the cost to
heat the homes of Americans. It would also
make it practical
and
affordable
for manufacturers to bring production back to
America. But unfortunately, for over six years, the administration has
inexplicably refused to take action on it. Americans deserve better,
and Americans want
and need
the opportunities created by the
Keystone XL. I hope the Senate will listen to the American people and
join us in passing this bipartisan legislation
straightaway.
Finally, Id like to say
thank you to all of the Arkansans who visited my office while in
Washington this week, including the Buron family from Rogers, the Arkansas
Chapter of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors,
Carole Sherman from Little Rock, and
the Arkansans representing
the American Network of Community Options and Resources. Id also
like to give special thanks to Susan and Tommy Weaver
the parents of
Kyle, my projects director
for visiting! I hope you enjoy the rest of
your visits to our nations capital and have safe trips
home!
Next
week, in addition to suspensions, the House will consider the EPA
Science Advisory Board Reform Act (H.R. 1422), the Secret Science Reform Act
(H.R. 4012), and the Promoting New Manufacturing Act (H.R. 4795).
Until then
From the Front...
