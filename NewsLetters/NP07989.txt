Dear
Friends,
Recently Ive
devoted a considerable amount
of my time and energy to
working to pass and fund a
bill that invests in our
national transportation
system for years to come. The
closure of I-495 in
Wilmington is a reminder of
how important a strong
transportation system is to
Delawareans and to our
states economy.
However, with time running
out to solve the problem,
some of my colleagues in
Congress have reverted to
crisis governing
applying a band-aid on a
massive wound by proposing
short-term fixes for
long-term problems.
As your former governor, I
know that major
transportation projects
like the Indian River
bridge in Sussex County
take years to plan
and construct, which is
impossible without the
certainty of a long-term
federal partnership in paying
for them.
American cities, states,
businesses and taxpayers
cannot continue to get by
with a stop-and-start
transportation policy that
will not allow them to plan
for the projects that will
truly transform our
infrastructure and grow our
economy.
This Congress has an
opportunity to pass a
long-term transportation bill
that will fund projects that
offer the highest national
and regional benefits and
make freight transportation
more affordable and reliable,
helping small and large
businesses of all types to
compete globally. Some
members of Congress want to
punt this legislation down
the road
but this is
something that needs to be
done this year and by this
Congress. It is our job.
As your Senator, I will
continue to fight for the
prudent path that leads to a
multi-year transportation
bill that local government
leaders, businesses, workers
and commuters have told me
time and again that they need
this year.
Dutifully yours,
Stay Connected with
Senator Carper
