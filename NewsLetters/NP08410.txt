&ldquo;The Koch brothers&rsquo; financial network is planning on spending almost $300 million in the 2014 election, including a new anti-environment effort.&rdquo;

Dear Friend,
A couple weeks ago, we told you about the Koch brothers&rsquo; plan to spend $125 million on this year&rsquo;s elections. I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you, but that&rsquo;s old news --
the Kochs&rsquo; network is actually going to spend more than twice that amount.
According to
The Daily Beast , the Kochs are going to spend at least $290 million on this year&rsquo;s elections. That is an astronomical amount of money, and we need your help to stay strong against the Kochs&rsquo; onslaught. We need to raise $36,000 by June 30, and you can get us $5 closer by donating today.
Because you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
This election cycle has already broken the pundits&rsquo; preconceptions. A House Majority Leader lost a primary
for the first time in history . Two billionaire brothers are spending hundreds of millions to buy Senate seats.
And we have no way of knowing what&rsquo;s coming next.
But here&rsquo;s what we do know: the campaigns that prepare are the campaigns that win. Ed has always looked to grassroots supporters like you to fuel this organization, and this year is no different. Give $5, $10, or more before the FEC filing deadline on June 30 to help Ed keep fighting.
Thanks for reading this. Hopefully, this will be the last time we have to update you on a Koch-fueled spending spree -- but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it.
Sincerely,
Colleen
