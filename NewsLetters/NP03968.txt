Mitch McConnell: &ldquo;Number one: We certainly will have a vote on proceeding to a bill to repeal Obamacare&rdquo;
Friend -- UNBELIEVABLE: Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are already governing irresponsibly. Next year they plan &ldquo;to gut Obamacare through a complicated budget process that requires only a simple majority,&rdquo; according to
Politico .
They warn, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Republicans best shot yet at dealing a long-term blow to the health care law.&rdquo;
Democrats in the Senate are working hard to overcome this, but we need your help holding Republicans accountable. Without your support, Republicans could leave millions without access to affordable health care just to score political points and kill President Obama&rsquo;s signature achievement.
ADD YOUR NAME: Demand that Republicans STOP their irresponsible Obamacare repeal vote. Let&rsquo;s get 100,000 Democrats on board.
Your Action History

No to Obamacare Repeal:
Signature Pending &gt;&gt;
The Affordable Care Act &mdash; Obamacare &mdash;
has already been a huge success. According to the New York Times, &ldquo;the number of uninsured Americans has fallen by about 25 percent this year, or about eight million to 11 million people.&rdquo; And millions more Americans are benefiting from the law&rsquo;s other provisions &mdash; like an end to &ldquo;preexisting conditions.&quot;
But despite these enormous improvements in our health care system, the Republicans refuse to admit that Obamacare is working and are working day and night to repeal it and take health coverage away from millions of Americans.
Don&rsquo;t let them! Sign on and demand that Senate Republicans drop their Obamacare repeal vote.
Thanks,
