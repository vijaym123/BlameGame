VISITING DC
January 17, 2014
This week, the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence released the most detailed bipartisan report to date on the
September 11, 2012, terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.
The
Committee's report presents a wide range of declassified findings that
will allow the public to more fully understand the deteriorating security
situation in Benghazi leading up to the attacks and the lack of State
Department recognition of the danger to our
personnel.
This bipartisan report is a step forward in our understanding of these
events, but should not be viewed by any means as a final verdict. To the
extent this report is incomplete, it is not due to the Committee's
unwillingness to investigate, but the State Department's intransigence.
It is our obligation and duty to continue to ask probing questions and
investigate all details as they continue to come to light - as they
invariably will.
Despite the Committee's best efforts to
investigate all relevant threads of information, I still feel strongly
that there remains a disappointing lack of accountability. It is my hope
that this bipartisan report will serve as a foundation to continue
this vital discussion and to search for more answers. To read the
report,

On
Tuesday evening, Congress passed legislation that reauthorizes vital
support to the poison control network, specifically the poison control
center national toll-free number, national media campaign, and state
grant program. The poison control network is an essential program that
impacts thousands of lives every year through prevention and treatment
efforts at centers across the country, and I know that the knowledge
that help will be there when they need it most will give many
Americans peace of mind. Read more about this legislation,
here .
In case you missed it, Fox Business wrote a
story on my legislation to consolidate the Department of Commerce and
the Department of Labor into a single entity, which was introduced last
month. This legislation would save billions of dollars by eliminating
duplicative functions and would improve the quality of our country's
economic policies by ensuring a consistent, coordinated
approach.
Legislation that consolidates government is the toughest
legislation to get through here in Washington, but there is value in fighting
for reducing the size of government and cutting federal
spending. Read Foxs article
here

about the bill
here .
Finally, as you
may have heard, this week Congress passed legislation, also known as
an Omnibus bill, that funds the government for the rest of the
fiscal year.
While I am pleased that we were able to avert another
government shutdown, I could not in good faith support the Omnibus. Our
nation has been on a precarious path of spending and debt, and
this legislation does nothing to address the problem. Congress is tasked
with funding our government, and we should do so in a fiscally
responsible way. Neither this years Omnibus bill nor the Ryan-Murray budget
responsibly spends the taxpayers hard-earned money, and both
use legislative gimmicks to hide billions of dollars in additional
spending.
It is time for the Senate to return to regular order
consideration of annual appropriations bills, and it is past time to
exercise fiscal restraint in the halls of Congress.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
