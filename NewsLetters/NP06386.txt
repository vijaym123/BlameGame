&ldquo;Senate Republicans can taste majority&rdquo; - The Hill , 9/11/2014
Dear Friend,
The
New York Times
is projecting that Republicans will hold 52 Senate seats after this November. Nate Silver&rsquo;s
FiveThirtyEight
gives Republicans a 54.7% chance of taking the Senate. The
Washington Post
and the
Rothenberg Report
are making similar predictions. The Republicans are pulling out all the stops to take over the Senate this year.
We need to build up our grassroots defense to make sure Massachusetts isn&rsquo;t one of their conquests. We need to hit our $145,000 fundraising goal before the FEC deadline on the 30th. You can help with a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Your efforts are going to mean the difference in this year&rsquo;s races. If our grassroots supporters make their voices heard on Election Day, all the pollsters and pundits might be in for a rude awakening.
But if we start missing our goals -- if we falter this close to the finish line -- there&rsquo;s no telling how bad things might look on November 5. Keep us on track for victory in November. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford before the FEC deadline.
Thank you,
Ed
