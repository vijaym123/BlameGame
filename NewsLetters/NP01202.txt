David, I&rsquo;m emailing for $5.
Brad Schneider&rsquo;s FIRST end-of-month fundraising deadline of the election is 24 hours away, and he needs to raise $2,250 TODAY to stay on track and hit his goal.
Will you contribute to his Democratic campaign for Illinois immediately?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$36 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Here&rsquo;s why we need your support:
Brad&rsquo;s running in the MOST competitive district in Illinois.
His race could be the TOP pick-up opportunity for Democrats in the entire country.
But Republicans will spend whatever it takes to smear Brad&rsquo;s proud progressive record -- and keep Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district in the &ldquo;R&rdquo; column.
This one&rsquo;s personal for me. Not only is Brad Schneider one of my staunchest allies, but he&rsquo;s a progressive champion and a dear friend.
So David, I&rsquo;m asking you. Will you chip in to Brad&rsquo;s campaign before the April 30th deadline? A gift of any amount goes a long way. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/donate
