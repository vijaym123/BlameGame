Heller Statement on Panel
Recommendations for National Security
Agency
(Washington, D.C.)
Yesterday, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV)
responded to recommendations by the
five-member Review Group that the National
Security Agency end the governments
massive collection of Americans
telephone call records saying:
Just two days after a federal
judge found the bulk data collection
programs to be unconstitutional, these
programs have yet again come under
much-deserved scrutiny. Many of my Senate
colleagues from both sides of the aisle
agree that these programs do not pass the
Fourth Amendment smell test. This
Administration should heed this
panels recommendations and end this
program once-and-for-all, said
Senator Dean Heller.
Background
Senator Heller joined chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy
(D-VT), as an original Republican cosponsor
to the USA Freedom Act. This legislation
would, among other things, rein in the
NSAs bulk data collection
program.
Senator Heller also partnered with
Senator Al Franken (D-MN)
to
introduce legislation
that will bring
greater transparency to these programs and
allow companies that have been served a
subpoena to share basic information with
their customers.

Hellers thoughts

about the NSA
surveillance practices in this op-ed that
he penned for the Las Vegas Review-Journal
in November of 2013.
