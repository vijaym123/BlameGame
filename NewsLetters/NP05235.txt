Dear Friend,
For nearly fifty years, Medicare has provided millions of Hoosiers with quality and dependable health care in retirement.
That is why I am pleased to tell you that the Medicare open enrollment period has begun for 2015.
If you are satisfied with the Medicare coverage you have,
you don&rsquo;t need to do anything at all . If you are currently a Medicare beneficiary, you remain eligible and will continue to receive Medicare benefits.
However, if you are interested in making changes to your Medicare plan or need to sign up for 2015 coverage, you should do so before the enrollment period closes on December 7, 2014.
Below are some helpful resources courtesy of
Medicare.gov
that will guide anyone interested in participating.
Medicare Plan Finder
-- Here you can review, compare, and join a 2015 plan using your zip code or through a more personalized search.
Enroll in a Medicare Plan
-- Visit this page if you already know the name of the plan you want to join.
Check Your Enrollment
-- Use this tool to check your current and future enrollment.
Remember, this is the only time you can change your plan this year, so take this opportunity to find an option that works for you or your eligible family member. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me on this or any other federal issue of importance to you.
Regards,
Andr&eacute; Carson

Help with Veterans services
Earlier this month, my office was able to help James, a local veteran, receive $35,000 in retroactive pay after he had waited nearly a year for a hearing.
Once James contacted my office, we were able expedite the process for a hearing, which James received three months later.
After the VA ruled in favor of James, he received the back pay he was owed less than a month later.
