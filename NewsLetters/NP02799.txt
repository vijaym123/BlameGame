CONGRESSMAN ROBERT PITTENGER . .
. LIVE FROM JERUSALEM
Earlier
this evening, I traveled to the Fox News Jerusalem bureau for a
live interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News
Channel .
Our focus was my meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, which took place earlier today, and the grave threat of a
nuclear Iran.
As you
know, Iran has provided financial assistance to terrorism for the last
thirty years, and
Iran with nuclear arms will be an enormous
peril .
Our
Middle East partners are all gravely concerned about Iran with nuclear
arms, yet
President Obama just doesnt get it .
In
my opinion, Prime Minister Netanyahu is the Winston Churchill of our
day.
He is the one crying out, trying to tell the world of this
imminent threat.
Neville Chamberlain has returned in the person
of President Obama.
He is in total denial of what this threat
is.

Warfare, I am in Israel this week to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu
and other top government officials, tour Israeli security and
counter-terrorism facilities to learn more about how to keep our families safe,
and meet with both Israelis and Palestinians to gain insight into
their ongoing conflict.
