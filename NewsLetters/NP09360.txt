Dear Constituent,
It is always with great pleasure that I write to you to inform you of
the work I am doing on your behalf as your Representative. This year
has been full speed ahead as I returned to Washington to tackle some of
our countries most challenging issues and present key concerns for the
First Congressional District. There are several pressing issues before
the House of Representatives that need immediate action including an
extension of unemployment benefits, an increase in the minimum wage,
energy concerns and job creation.
I have been busy at work addressing your concerns by sponsoring and
cosponsoring legislation in addition to requesting hearings as the
senior ranking Democratic member on the Energy & Commerce Committee to
writing letters to influential governmental services. What I have done
legislatively is reflected in my consistent voting record for the
issues that matter to you the most. Take a look at my website
rush.house.gov to follow the legislative process and be sure to visit
my Facebook and Twitter pages to keep up with the latest issues of the
day.
I strive to be in tune with the needs of my constituents, therefore I
appreciate your phone calls, letters and e-mails that keep me informed.
District News
During House recess I return to the district and work with my staff to
provide information to you that will address your questions and
concerns. Below are some of the highlights from this year's district
events:
Grant Seeking Seminar
The Grantseeking Seminar titled Understanding the
Grantseeking Process was an educational seminar for nonprofit
organizations, chambers of commerce, and associations to learn about
available grants in the private and public sectors. Participants
learned best practices of successful grant writers, and listened to
fundraising experts show how to identify potential resources.
A panel
of grantmakers from the public, and private sectors discussed their
agency giving programs, new initiatives and shared insights into how
their agency finds and funds successful programs. Two grantseeking
seminars were held both in the city of Chicago and the suburbs.
Military Academy Day
Military Academy Day is nationally recognized
across the country where many Members of Congress seek to connect with
high school students interested in pursuing careers in the armed
forces. Military Academy Day is also an opportunity to share
information with students who may not be aware a career in the
military. I hosted Military Academy this year to offer high school
students interested in serving in the armed forces an opportunity to
learn about the application and nomination process for the nation's
five service academies.
Art Competition Winner
Congratulations to this year's art
competition winner, Lorena Villanueva a junior at Bremen High School.
The title of her self-portrait is "Breaking" drawn with charcoal.
Lorena says, "My project shows a girl who has been fed up with emotions
for a while and is finally letting them out."
Constituent Story: Help When Needed Most
In June 2009 Dwayne Brazil was working at 26th on
the Dan Ryan as a Traffic Safety Worker. When a high speed motorist
went thru the lane closure barrier at a speed of 70 mph and slammed
into him shattering his left leg, vertebra and causing him to suffer a
mild heart attack. When Dwayne awoke in he learned that he had been
tossed 20 feet from his work site. Dwayne underwent four separate
operations to repair the damage to his leg and other parts of his body
where skin grafts were needed from the accident.
Dwayne continued to suffer medical issues several months after the
accident that resulted in unemployment and the inability to sustain an
income. He decided that he needed to apply for social security
assistance. Dwayne state, "At first I did not know where to turn to get
the type of assistance I needed. I had contacted the social security
office several times and was given the explanation that because of my
injuries I would not be able to manage a monthly check. Then a friend
of mine, a retired U.S. Marshall told Dwayne to contact the Office of
Congressman Bobby Rush. Dwayne shared, "I called Congressman Rush's
office and was asked to submit release forms and not a week later after
I submitted the release forms I was able to get the assistance I needed
from the social security office and also started receiving disability
payments." Dottie Hall, a constituent service representative from
Congressman Rush's office jumped right in full force and took care of
business. Also, James was very helpful when I showed up at the office
to drop off my paperwork.
Since the accident Dwayne has undergone 15 separate surgeries, but has
been able to move forward with life and appreciate each new day. Dwayne
stated, "I am grateful to Congressman Rush and his staff for being
vigilant about getting me the help I needed."

Quote
"And I think it makes no progress for us to find out who made what
argument. It is our position that whether or not you base this case
solely on the Intent of Congress or whether you base it on the logical
extension of the doctrine as set forth in the McLaurin case, on either
basis the same conclusion is required, which is that this Court makes
it clear to all of these states that in administering their
governmental functions, at least those that are vital not to the life
of the state alone, not to the country alone, but vital to the world in
general, that little pet feelings of race, little pet feelings of
custom-I got the feeling on hearing the discussion yesterday that when
you put a white child in a school with a whole lot of colored children,
the child would fall apart or something. Everybody knows that is not
true."

Constituent
Story:
Help
When
Needed
Most
In
June
2009
Dwayne
Brazil
was
working
at
26th
on
the
Dan
Ryan
as
a
Traffic
Safety
Worker.
When
a
high
speed
motorist
went
thru
the
lane
closure
barrier
at
a
speed
of
70
mph
and
slammed
into
him
shattering
his
left
leg,
vertebra
and
causing
him
to
suffer
a
mild
heart
attack.
When
Dwayne
awoke
in
he
learned
that
he
had
been
tossed
20
feet
from
his
work
site.
Dwayne
underwent
four
separate
operations
to
repair
the
damage
to
his
leg
and
other
parts
of
his
body
where
skin
grafts
were
needed
from
the
accident.
Dwayne
continued
to
suffer
medical
issues
several
months
after
the
accident
that
resulted
in
unemployment
and
the
inability
to
sustain
an
income.
He
decided
that
he
needed
to
apply
for
social
security
assistance.
Dwayne
state,
&#8220;At
first
I
did
not
know
where
to
turn
to
get
the
type
of
assistance
I
needed.
I
had
contacted
the
social
security
office
several
times
and
was
given
the
explanation
that
because
of
my
injuries
I
would
not
be
able
to
manage
a
monthly
check.
Then
a
friend
of
mine,
a
retired
U.S.
Marshall
told
Dwayne
to
contact
the
Office
of
Congressman
Bobby
Rush.
Dwayne
shared,
&#8220;I
called
Congressman
Rush&#8217;s
office
and
was
asked
to
submit
release
forms
and
not
a
week
later
after
I
submitted
the
release
forms
I
was
able
to
get
the
assistance
I
needed
from
the
social
security
office
and
also
started
receiving
disability
payments.&#8221;
Dottie
Hall,
a
constituent
service
representative
from
Congressman
Rush&#8217;s
office
jumped
right
in
full
force
and
took
care
of
business.
Also,
James
was
very
helpful
when
I
showed
up
at
the
office
to
drop
off
my
paperwork.
Since
the
accident
Dwayne
has
undergone
15
separate
surgeries,
but
has
been
able
to
move
forward
with
life
and
appreciate
each
new
day.
Dwayne
stated,
&#8220;I
am
grateful
to
Congressman
Rush
and
his
staff
for
being
vigilant
about
getting
me
the
help
I
needed.&#8221;

Quote
&#8220;And
I
think
it
makes
no
progress
for
us
to
find
out
who
made
what
argument.
It
is
our
position
that
whether
or
not
you
base
this
case
solely
on
the
Intent
of
Congress
or
whether
you
base
it
on
the
logical
extension
of
the
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
the
McLaurin
case,
on
either
basis
the
same
conclusion
is
required,
which
is
that
this
Court
makes
it
clear
to
all
of
these
states
that
in
administering
their
governmental
functions,
at
least
those
that
are
vital
not
to
the
life
of
the
state
alone,
not
to
the
country
alone,
but
vital
to
the
world
in
general,
that
little
pet
feelings
of
race,
little
pet
feelings
of
custom-I
got
the
feeling
on
hearing
the
discussion
yesterday
that
when
you
put
a
white
child
in
a
school
with
a
whole
lot
of
colored
children,
the
child
would
fall
apart
or
something.
Everybody
knows
that
is
not
true.&#8221;
