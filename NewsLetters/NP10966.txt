WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) delivered the following statement on the House Floor in support of the Save American Workers Act (H.R. 2575), legislation to apply the traditional 40-hour definition of "full-time employment" to Obamacare's employer mandate:
"Helping those without health insurance to get coverage is a noble goal, but the method that was used to achieve it under Obamacare has done far more harm than good.
"Take for instance the provision we are talking about today that requires employers to provide health insurance for any employee that works 30 or more hours a week.
Their thinking must have been that more part time workers would receive employer-sponsored care and that employers would not change their behavior and simply absorb these new costs.
"I guess when you think like government and are unconcerned with costs or balancing your books, that thinking makes sense, but in the real world it does not work.
"Employers must live in the real world.
They are in business to make money and must balance their books.
And these very onerous provisions of Obamacare make it very difficult for them to continue with business as usual, to comply with the law and stay in business. So employers have been forced to cut workers' hours.
"And we also need to look at those who have been impacted the most negatively impacted. According to a study done by the Hoover Institution, the 30-hour rule puts 2.6 million workers with a median income of under $30,000 a year at risk for losing their job or having their hours cut. 89% of the impacted workers do not have a college degree; 59% are between the ages of 19 and 34; and 63% of these workers are women.
"So this rule impacts some of the most vulnerable in our economy who are just starting to make their way in the world or who are working hard to support their families. And I didn't need a study to tell me that because I am hearing it directly each and every day from those that I am so proud to serve.
"This is from a mother, Tracy, from Macomb County, Michigan.
She said, 'My daughter, who is a single mom and struggles to make ends meet, has had her hours at work cut by 50 hours a month so that her company doesn't have to provide health care.
She is now looking for a second job which means less hours she is able to spend with her children.'
"Being a single mom is tough, and what we do here in Washington shouldn't make it tougher.
"Being a small business owner and job creator is tough, and again, what we do here in Washington shouldn't make it tougher.
"The 40-hour work week has been the bedrock of our economy for decades, and workers and families have come to depend on it, that is, until Obamacare changed the rules. It is time for us to correct this mistake and repeal this terrible provision."
