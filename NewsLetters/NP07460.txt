Dear Friend &ndash;
It is my duty as your Congresswoman to represent you in Washington, but it is also to my duty help you navigate the federal government and make sure it&rsquo;s serving you and your families.
I want to share the story of Juan Contreras, a resident from our district who recently completed 20 years of service in the U.S. Marine Corps. Through the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which I cosponsored, Juan qualified to receive assistance from the Veterans Administration to attend Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. But last fall Juan&rsquo;s benefits were not awarded in time, putting him a month behind on rent and wondering if his dreams of becoming a professional chef were slipping away.
Juan reached out to my office and one of my caseworkers, Laura Martinez, was able to work with the VA and the school to get Juan his benefits less than a week later.
I&rsquo;m happy to report that Juan completed his education and just accepted a job as a culinary manager at California Pizza Kitchen.
If you, or anyone you know, are having difficulty with a federal agency, please contact my office for assistance. Even if I am unable to directly help you or your family with an issue, I can connect you to the appropriate public official or agency that can.
You can contact us through my
website , by phone at (714) 621-0102, or by visiting my Garden Grove Office in person at 12397 Lewis Street, Suite 101, Garden Grove, CA 92840.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
