Dear Friends:
The 114th Congress began in January and the Senate is already off to a
busy start! We have already had more amendment roll call votes than in
all of 2014. This is an important first step toward returning to
regular order in the Senate, and will help us pass bipartisan
legislation to get our country back on track. A prime example is my
Keystone XL Pipeline bill, which the Senate passed after weeks of
debate by a vote of 62-36. You can read more about this important bill
below.
We were also successful in getting FEMA to approve
Fargo's basement
exception application, which means city residents can continue to
protect their belongings through the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) without having to fulfill any additional requirements. In
December, our delegation wrote a letter in support of Fargo's
application because the city has successfully implemented the basement
exception in the NFIP for close to 40 years.
Fargo also celebrated the NDSU Bison, who won their 4th consecutive
national championship. Mikey and I
were thrilled to
witness the historic win, and we could not be more proud of the
players, Coach Klieman and all of the fans who cheered the Bison to
victory.
I authored and worked to pass a Senate resolution recognizing
the Bison's achievement
.
I am happy to announce that you can now follow me on Instagram. Click
the Instagram icon above or click here
to visit my page. Be sure to check in often
to see new posts and pictures from the Capitol and around North Dakota.
In closing, I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to the
victims of the tragic accident last month in Larimore. This tragedy was
absolutely devastating, but we were encouraged by the courageous
efforts of the first responders and by the many people who have given
generously to support the affected families. The bravery and kindness
that arose from something so terrible shows just how caring North
Dakotans are, and why we are truly blessed to call North Dakota home.
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

2015 Dear
Friends:
The
114th
Congress
began
in
January
and
the
Senate
is
already
off
to
a
busy
start!
We
have
already
had

than
in
all

2014.
This
is
an
important
first
step

returning
to
regular
order
in
the
Senate,
and
will
help
us
pass
bipartisan
legislation
to
get
our
country
back
on
track.
A
prime
example
is
my
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
bill,
which
the
Senate
passed
after
weeks
of
debate
by
a
vote

62-36.
You

We
were
also

can
continue

In

our

of
Fargo&#8217;s
application
because
the
city
has
successfully

40
years.
Fargo
