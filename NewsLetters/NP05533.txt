Carper's Connection
October 10, 2014
Dear Friends,
This week I had the opportunity to visit two of Delmarva's television
stations, WMDT and WBOC. I hope many of you had a chance to see the
resulting stories, in which I discussed a number of salient issues
facing Delawareans and Americans across the country and around the
world today.
My first stop was at WMDT, where I had the chance to sit down with
Lenita Wesson and discuss the importance of long-term transportation
funding and comprehensive postal reform. It's critical that Congress
bypasses partisan gridlock and passes both a long-term transportation
plan that our states, cities, and businesses need and a postal plan
that would enable this American institution to do what it needs to do
to grow and get back to financial health.
Next stop, I visited the WBOC studios. During my time with the news
team, I had the opportunity to discuss some of the challenges facing
our homeland, including the threat of the terrorist extremists abroad
and Ebola in West Africa. To hear some of my thoughts on those issues,
watch here:
I always enjoy having the opportunity to share my thoughts with
Delawareans - but more important, I appreciate hearing the thoughts of
Delawareans like you. As always, I welcome hearing your views on these
issues, or any other, through email
or by
contacting me on Twitter @SenatorCarper
and on Facebook at facebook.com/tomcarper
