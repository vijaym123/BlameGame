Wicker: After Six Years,
President Still
Punting on Keystone XL
Administration's Political Delays Have Put
Job
Creation, Economic Development on
Hold
On September 19, 2008, TransCanada applied for a U.S.
presidential permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline.
The
1,179-mile-long project would ship more than 800,000 barrels per day of
crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Gulf Coast refineries.
Moreover,
Canada's oil output is projected to hit 6.4 million barrels per day
by 2030
almost double today's
levels.
What should have been a routine approval process with America's
ally and largest trading partner has instead been ensnarled for six
years in political tactics by the Obama Administration.
Radical
environmental groups have put pressure on the President to reject the
project entirely.
In response, he has repeatedly delayed a final
decision, sidestepping any backlash from voters in an election
year.
Pipeline Would Mean 42,000
Jobs
The advantages of the pipeline are numerous.
Chief among them is the potential for new jobs and economic growth.
According to the State Department, the construction of Keystone XL
could support more than 42,000 jobs.
Funded by private-sector
dollars, it would cost taxpayers
nothing.
Keystone XL has also cleared multiple environmental assessments
by the State Department, which is overseeing the review because the
pipeline crosses an international border.
Although critics allege
that the project would have a harmful impact on the environment, the
Administration's own reports conclude that the effects would be
negligible.
In fact, pipelines are proven to be the most efficient way
to transport oil.
If approved, Keystone XL would join more than
10,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines that have already been built in
the United States over the past six years.
Keystone XL has bipartisan backing in Congress as well
as the support of a majority of Americans.
Before the sixth
anniversary of TransCanada's application, every Republican in the Senate
signed a letter to the President once again urging a decision without
delay.
Eleven Democrats sent a similar letter of support for the
project earlier this year.
President Obama had promised a
decision by the end of last year.
Administration Sets Radical
Climate Priorities
The indefinite postponement of Keystone XL is not the only
job-killing item on the Obama Administration's extreme climate
agenda.
The President has put forward drastic proposals for the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions,
effectively waging an all-out war on coal.
In forcing the
closure of coal-fired power plants, EPA's sweeping overreach of executive
power would jeopardize investment, jobs, and U.S. competitiveness
as
well as energy security.
Americans would bear higher energy
costs, and little impact would be made on the environment.
Earlier this month, the Administration
went even further with environmental initiatives to phase out a chemical
coolant commonly found in refrigerators and air conditioners
citing
an alleged link to global warming.
The announcement preceded
President Obama's appearance at the United Nations Climate Summit in New
York.
It is disappointing that
the President continues to pursue his dubious fight against climate
change and his political agenda as Americans look for relief in a
difficult economy.
Keystone XL would provide needed job growth and
economic development, putting tens of thousands of Americans to work right
away.
There is no doubt that Canada's rich energy resources will
be developed.
The question is whether America will seize this
opportunity to build its capacity for North American energy or send
these abundant and stable resources to Asian markets.
Americans are
looking to the President for a decision that recognizes the national
interests at stake.
