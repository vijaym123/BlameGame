Teamwork Makes the Case for Amphibious Warship Funding on Capitol Hill
In the legislative process, there's nothing quite as powerful as
constituents taking their message directly to Washington. I had the
privilege of watching that process play out at the United States Navy
Amphibious Warship Forum in the Cannon Caucus Room on Tuesday morning.
The bottom line: Right now there is not adequate funding in the Navy's
budget for additional ships, and that needs to change. As a Member of
the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am constantly making
that case to my fellow colleagues. I welcome the teamwork from the
small, medium, and large businesses that make up the Amphibious Warship
Industrial Base Coalition.
Business owners in the Coalition attended the forum and later fanned
out across Capitol Hill to take that message to Members of the House
and Senate.
In my remarks to them, I encouraged spreading the word
that the Navy needs and deserves a larger piece of the Defense pie to
keep its ship-building program moving forward.
To put a picture to words: We're talking about the USS New York which
sailed in to homeport at Naval Station Mayport in early December. Soon
to follow later this year - the USS Iwo Jima and USS Fort McHenry.
The presence of these vessels on the First Coast and other locations at
home and around the globe is made possible through federal defense
dollars as well as the companies that build and maintain these
warships. By working together, we can make sure that process keeps
steadily moving ahead.
Addressing participants at the United States Navy Amphibious Warship
Forum in the Cannon Caucus Room on Tuesday morning.
Protecting Our Veterans Pay - COLA Adjustment Fix
Our veterans deserve to know that the benefits they earned through
selfless service and dedication are preserved. I was honored to take a
vote on their behalf on Tuesday to repeal the caps on an annual
increase in military retired pay. That legislation has now moved to the
United States Senate for consideration.
Specifically, I joined my colleagues in repealing a portion of a
previous federal budget deal that would have reduced annual Cost of
Living Adjustment (COLA) increases by 1 percentage point for "working
age" retirees under 62, starting in late 2015.
This should be the
final fix and is in combination with my vote to restore the full COLA
adjustment for medically-retired personnel in January. That provision
has since been signed into law.
IRS "Free File" Online Tax Assistance Program Briefing Set for February
21 at University of North Florida
With tax season in full swing, the February 21 "Free File" program at
UNF comes at just the right time. This briefing will review the
Internal Revenue Service program that provides free access to tax
preparation software that easily prepares and e-files federal taxes
online at no cost to the individual.
I'll talk about the benefits of the program, and a hands-on workshop
will then engage community and non-profit organization leaders on how
the program works. They can then take that information back to their
communities and help folks use it to prepare their taxes in a few easy
steps, e-file their taxes for free, and possibly receive a refund in as
few as ten days.
The February 21 program is sponsored by the Computer & Communications
Industry Association and will take place at the University of North
Florida Friday, February 21, at 1 p.m. A hands-on workshop on how to
use "Free File" will follow from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. at the Tom and Betty
Petway Hall, Building 57, Room 2500, on the UNF campus, located at 1
UNF Dr., Jacksonville, 32224.
Every American taxpayer with a 2013 Adjusted Gross Income of $58,000 or
less is eligible to use "Free File" to prepare, complete and e-file
their federal tax returns at no cost. Additional information is
available at www.IRS.gov/freefile
.

Teamwork
Makes
the
Case
for
Amphibious
Warship
Funding
on
Capitol
Hill
In
the
legislative
process,
there&#8217;s
nothing
quite
as
powerful
as
constituents
taking
their
message
directly
to
Washington.
I
had

The

Right
now
there
is
not
adequate
funding
in
the
Navy&#8217;s
budget
for
additional
ships,
and
that
needs
to
change.
As
a

Defense
Appropriations

I
am
constantly

that
case
to
my

I
welcome
the

from
the
