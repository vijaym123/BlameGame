Dear Friends,
As the
Israeli-Gaza conflict continues, earlier this month I joined several of
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see first-hand the
challenges faced by our democratic ally in the Middle East, and to report
back to my constituents.
Please
read my
op-ed
in the
Chicago Sun-Times
about
what I saw in Israel and what challenges this tiny nation faces every
day. I believe we can and must work to end the hostilities and pursue
peace among Israel and the nations in the region.
It was Friday night, the
beginning of the Jewish Shabbat (Sabbath), and our host family had
graciously invited us to join them for dinnerThe parents prayed, sang and
blessed their son as he headed back to the front to defend his country
and protect his family. Like all parents, they love their child but
worry for his future, and for the future of their nation Our dinner with this Jewish family in Jerusalem
underlined the struggles, hopes and fears of modern-day Israelis whose
heritage extends back thousands of years .
