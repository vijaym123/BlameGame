David, I&rsquo;m emailing you again, because I have to. I&rsquo;m pleading with you again, because I have to.
We&rsquo;re in serious danger here.
If we don&rsquo;t hit our goal, it'll be a huge victory for Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans. But we&rsquo;re still falling short.
Please -- can you answer President Obama's call-to-action today? 24-HOUR DEADLINE: All Gifts

I'm sorry to email you first thing on a Monday.
But I&rsquo;m pleading with you, David, because as it stands right now, we will fall short of our goal.
We are just 24 hours from the deadline, and we're not even close.
David -- President Obama deserves a Congress that works WITH him. The American people deserve a Congress that works FOR the middle-class, not Big Oil billionaires.
But we simply can&rsquo;t win if we don&rsquo;t have the funds to compete.
So David, I have to ask one more time: can you chip in before the most critical fundraising deadline of the election? 24-HOUR DEADLINE: All Gifts
