Dear David,
As we celebrate the holiday season with our
friends and families, let us take a moment to say a special thank you
to our country's military heroes stationed and deployed around the
world. These brave men and women defend our country and allies, often
sacrificing spending time with their family and loved ones in order to
keep us safe.
We owe these heroes a debt of gratitude for
keeping America safe. Please join me in saying thank you to our military
heroes and their families this holiday season for all that they do so
that we are able to enjoy the freedoms that make this nation
great.
