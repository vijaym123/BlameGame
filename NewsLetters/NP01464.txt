Fighting for a Better Mail Service
Regular mail service helps us get prescriptions we need, have packages
delivered from other parts of our state and country, and enables our
small businesses to ship their products. And these services are
particularly important for North Dakotans living in rural areas.
But, I've heard from North Dakotans across our state about how they
have had to deal with extensive delays with mail delivery or other
problems with their postal service. These problems have to be fixed.
In January 2014, I launched my Fix My Mail initiative
, a grassroots
effort to gather the challenges folks across our state have faced with
the Postal Service. To date, I've heard from more than 200 North
Dakotans, writing about not receiving prescriptions on time to their
local rural post offices not being open for business enough hours. I
shared these stories with the previous Postmaster General and requested
a formal review by the United States Postal Service Inspector General
of these issues.
And last week, when the Inspector General's report was released, it
confirmed what I've been hearing for more than a year from folks like
you across our state. The report found the Postal Service failed to
process and deliver mail in a timely fashion, lacked enough retail
windows to meet demand, did not have a plan to address rapid population
growth and staff turnover, overworked employees, and rarely met
national service standards in the state. Now we need to make changes
that better serve North Dakotans.
I've been committed to improving mail delivery and service throughout
all of North Dakota, particularly in our rural communities. And as the
top Democrat on the Senate subcommittee overseeing the federal
workforce, I'll continue my push for comprehensive legislation to
reform the agency. And I'll keep fighting to make sure Postal Service
employees are treated fairly so we can better retain and recruit a
strong federal workforce in North Dakota. My focus will also remain on
keeping six-day mail delivery, making sure service standards are met,
and protecting rural post offices - often a communication lifeline for
many rural residents.
And if you're still facing problems with mail delivery, I want to hear
from you so we can keep pushing the Postal Service to make changes that
better work for our state. Click here to submit your story
.
We can work to make sure mail delivery in North Dakota gets back on
track, and now is the time for action. Congress must work together to
make common sense changes so we can keep up the pressure and fight for
a Postal Service that works for all North Dakotans.
