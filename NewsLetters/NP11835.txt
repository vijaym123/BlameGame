Judge's Boarding Pass - February
24
28
This weeks legislation in the House was dedicated to stopping
government abuse. The House passed 12 bills that help rein in government
abuse, including bills that stop the IRS from targeting
conservatives.
On Monday, the House passed by voice
vote
H.R. 2531 ,
the Protecting Taxpayers from
Intrusive IRS Requests Act
which I was also a cosponsor of. H.R.
2531 stops the IRS from asking tax-payers about their social, political
and religious beliefs.
On Wednesday, the
House passed
H.R. 3865 , the
STOP Targeting of
Political Beliefs by the IRS Act
of 2014,
which I am a
cosponsor of (See
Roll Call #69 ). This bill
prohibits for one year the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) from finalizing their proposed 501(c)(4) regulations
issued on November 29, 2013, keeping in place the regulations that were
in effect on January 1, 2010.
On Tuesday,
in an effort to ensure these regulations are not implemented I joined
many of my colleagues in
commenting on the proposed
rule
prior to the closing of comments on Feb.
26.
In recognition of Rare Disease Week I took time to
remember and celebrate the life of Cal Long, a former Cedar Park child who
lost his life at age five to an undiagnosed disease. Cal was the
inspiration behind
H.R. 1591 , the Charles August Long
Undiagnosed Diseases Research and Collaboration Network Act that I
introduced to the House in 2013.
Currently,
there is no universal network for physicians handling undiagnosed
disease. The CAL Network Act Congressman Carter sponsored would provide a
registry for primary care physicians to collaborate and find answers for
the many men, women, children, and military Service Members and
Veterans who have unexplained symptoms and medical problems. It would help
physicians and researchers better outline demographic factors, and
essentially provide physicians who are handling undiagnosed cases to
search for similar cases and to network with other physicians handling
similar cases in order to find a
diagnosis.

Rare
Disease Day
I am now headed back to
Texas to work in the district for the weekend. Our next session begins
March 3.
