Fighting
Ebola
On Friday, I called on the President to put forth a
transparent plan on how we will contend with Ebola.
This plan
should include a commercial travel ban between the U.S. and all West
African countries affected by the outbreak.
You can read my
recommendations to the President
here .
We
must take every measure necessary to prevent Ebola from spreading and to
keep Louisiana families healthy.
Restoring our Coast
Last Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced how it would implement
the RESTORE Act. The RESTORE Act takes fines collected from BP and
others responsible for the 2010 Gulf oil spill and disburses it to Gulf
States.
Louisianas share will go toward restoring our
coast.
Ensuring we receive our fair share of funding to restore our
coast and protect families remains one of my
priorities.
Promoting Louisiana
Seafood
Finally, I urged the Presidential Task Force on Combating
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and Seafood Fraud to
examine how unfair seafood subsidies allow foreign companies to dump
products, like shrimp and crawfish, on the U.S. market.
This hurts
Louisiana workers and companies.
Louisiana is a leader in the
seafood industry.
The seafood industry and its workers must be
protected.
