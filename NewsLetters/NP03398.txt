Dear Friend,
Last week in Washington, I officially reintroduced pieces of key legislation, voted on several critical bills, and was renamed to several Subcommittees in the 114th Congress.
I first reintroduced several important pieces of legislation that were not afforded the opportunity to come before the House of Representatives for a vote in the 113th Congress. I reintroduced
six bills thus far including:
&middot;
the
Multimodal
Opportunities via Enhanced (MOVE) Freight Act
(H.R. 198), which would strengthen our existing freight network by ensuring that it be comprised of all modes of transportation;
&middot;
the
Bicycle
and Pedestrian Infrastructure Improvement Act
(H.R. 199), which would provide low-cost credit assistance to large-scale transportation
projects, such as bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure initiatives;
&middot;
the
Commute
LESS Act
(H.R. 200), which would create and expand commuter benefit programs for our nation&#8217;s workers;
&middot;
the
Community
Parks Revitalization Act
(H.R. 201), which would establish a grant and innovative loan program for the creation and rehabilitation of America&#8217;s parks and recreation areas;
&middot;
the
Respect
for Peace Corps Volunteers Act
(H.R. 267), which would allow the Peace Corps name and logo to be used for the purpose of death announcements,
grave markers, and tomb stones; and
&middot;
the
Promoting
Tourism to Enhance our Economy Act
(H.R. 268), which would allow certain Canadian citizens to visit the United States for 240 days for tourism purposes.
I was also pleased to be renamed to two Subcommittees within the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, both of which I served on in the 113th Congress. In the 114th Congress, I will remain
an active member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia, as well as remain the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. I look forward to working with my colleagues on each of these Subcommittees to advance legislation to better the
lives of American citizens as well as our allies around the world.
Finally, last week I supported the unanimous passage of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act (H.R. 203). This piece of legislation was passed once before
in the House of Representatives in the 113th Congress, but was blocked in the Senate. This bill would expand access to mental health services for our nation&#8217;s veterans and increase the capacity and efficiency of VA care for the more than one million veterans
returning from war. The veterans of our country are owed and deserve our support as they return home.
