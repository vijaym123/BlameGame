Dear
Friend,
A few months ago, I held a teletown hall meeting where I was able to
take questions and comments from Northeast Georgians over the
phone.
I love those, because even when I'm in Washington, I can keep
up with what you're hearing there.
Gene Ballew was on that
call, and he told me about his business, Ballew Sky Aviation in
Gainesville. In fact, he invited me to come by for a
visit.
Friday morning,
I went over to
check it out .
Gene showed me around and
told me about some of the most important work they do: preparing
veterans to enter the civilian workforce.
I love seeing firsthand
what Georgians are building. You're proud of your work, and I am too.
If you'd like for us to come by and check out what you're doing and
discuss the ways our community benefits from your work, please,
let me know .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
