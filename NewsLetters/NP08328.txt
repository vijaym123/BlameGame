Dear Friend:
Today, as Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, I teamed up with transportation leaders to underscore the urgent need for Congress to save the Highway Trust Fund now, before it goes broke next month.

Thousands of businesses and millions of jobs depend on the Highway Trust Fund.
It is the major source of funding for our surface transportation system - including highways, bridges, buses, and transit rail systems - and it is on the verge of bankruptcy.
In May, the EPW Committee
unanimously passed
a long-term bill to reauthorize the nation's surface transportation programs for six years at current funding levels plus inflation.
Congress needs to put politics aside and come together on a solution that will save the Highway Trust Fund by addressing its looming short-term and long-term funding crisis.
We must act now because failure is not an option.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
