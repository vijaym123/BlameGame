Are You a Veteran?
My office can assist veterans with disability claims, hospitalization
questions, benefits determinations, and with obtaining information
throughout the federal government. Veterans who need assistance should
contact my office at (303) 844-4988 or email me here
.
Dear Friend,
The recent reports of scheduling delays and cover-ups at the Veterans
Health Administration facilities are very troubling. The information
showing unacceptable wait times, significant mismanagement, and lack of
integrity at facilities are a terrible disservice to our veterans. As
more revelations come to light, it is clear that fundamental reforms
are needed.
While Eric Shinseki served our country honorably as a combat soldier,
general, and Secretary of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), we
need to start with new leadership. But Secretary Shinseki's resignation
will not solve any problems unless this change in leadership is coupled
with a commitment to reform from everyone involved. Congress must also
do its part to solve these problems, providing the resources needed to
handle expanding responsibilities at the VA as well as genuine
oversight of the department's operations.
Our veterans deserve nothing less.
While the VA has released system-wide information
, it is also vital to
investigate at the state and facility level to get to the root of these
problems. We need to dig deeper to understand which facilities were
falsifying records, how they were doing so, and who was directly
responsible. To get to that level of detail, the VA needs to audit each
facility and release specific state and facility information to
Congress and the public. Last week, I was joined by Senators Mark Udall
and Michael Bennet and Congressmen Ed Perlmutter and Jared Polis in
asking President Obama and former Secretary Shinseki for specific audit
details on facilities that serve Colorado veterans. I hope that the VA
will share this information very soon.
I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Colorado and our
nation's veterans receive the quality health care they deserve.
Fighting Against Unfair Immigration Practices
Colorado and our nation have been in need of comprehensive immigration
reform for some time. We have all heard far too many stories in our
communities that cause our friends to live in fear of being separated
from their family and loved ones. Reform will provide much needed
support for our friends and neighbors, strengthen our communities, and
grow our economy.
After hearing this week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) officials have been targeting immigrants at courthouses, I joined
my colleagues to urge Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to
address this unfair practice immediately. It is unacceptable for ICE
agents to question, detain, and initiate removal proceedings against
people who appear at courthouses.
Our nation's courthouses are important public spaces open to everyone,
and members of our community should not be targeted while attempting to
fulfill their civic duties and responsibilities. Until comprehensive
immigration reform can be achieved, the Administration should act
swiftly to end this policy that conflicts with some of our nation's
longest held traditions and values.
As always, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up-to-date on the latest news from Washington and in Colorado. Also,
you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can read
my positions on issues and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While you're there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about
what matters most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to share
this email with your friends, family, and neighbors so that they too
can be a part of this important dialogue.
Sincerely,

Dear
Friend,
The
recent
reports
of
scheduling
delays
and
cover-ups
at
the
Veterans
Health
Administration
facilities
are
very
troubling.
The
information
showing
unacceptable
wait
times,
significant
mismanagement,
and
lack
of
integrity
at

are
a
terrible
disservice
to
our
veterans.
As
more

it
is
clear
that
fundamental
reforms
are
needed.
While
Eric
Shinseki
served
our
country
honorably
as
a
combat
soldier,
general,
and
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Veteran

(VA),
we
need
to
start
with
new
leadership.
But
Secretary
Shinseki&#8217;s
resignation
will
not
solve
any
problems
unless
this
change
in
leadership
is
coupled
with
a

to

Congress
must
also

it

how
they
were
doing
so,
and
who
was

To
get
to
that
level
of
detail,
the
VA
needs
to
audit
each
facility
and
release
specific
state
and
facility
information
to
Congress
and
the
public.
Last

I
was
joined

I
hope
that
the
VA
will
share
this

very

I
will
continue
to
work

my
colleagues
to
ensure
Colorado

quality
health
