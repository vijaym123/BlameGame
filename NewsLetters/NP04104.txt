Dear Friend,
The first Thanksgiving Proclamation was issued by President Lincoln in 1863 at the height of the Civil War. One may have not necessarily expected that to be a time of gratitude, for the conclusion of the war was still over a year away. Yet, Lincoln believed that it was exactly the time to establish an official national holiday across the country to remember Gods blessings and to give thanks for them. He wrote, It has seemed to me fit and proper that they (the gracious gifts of the Most High God) should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.
I am often reminded of our blessings through the doxology and hymn, Praise God from Whom all blessings flow. I join you in giving thanks for the incredible blessing of being an American. And yet we have so much for which to be thankful for. May God bless your family and our great nation during this holiday season, and may God especially bless our men and women celebrating Thanksgiving while serving America far away from their families and in harms way. For them and their sacrifices, we are especially grateful.
Sidney and I cannot thank you enough for the honor of serving each of you in Congress. Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
