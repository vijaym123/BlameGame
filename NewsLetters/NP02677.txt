Right to Work
Earlier this week, I announced my support and co-sponsorship of the
"National Right to Work Act." This pro-worker, reform-minded piece of
legislation I introduced with Senator Rand Paul and Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell would prevent workers from being forced to join
a union or from being forced to pay union dues as a condition of
employment.
I firmly believe that no worker should be forced to join a union or pay
dues for their job.
South Carolina and twenty three other states have
passed Right to Work laws to address this issue.
It's no surprise that
states like ours, in part because of our Right to Work status, are
seeing improvements in real personal income and average annual
employment.
Academy Nominations
This week I also announced the nominations of 48 South Carolina
students to the United States Military Service Academies for the class
of 2019. The Academies are the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, NY,
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, the U.S. Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, CO, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings
Point, NY.
I am extremely proud to nominate these students.
These young South Carolinians represent some of our state's best
students and I am grateful for their willingness to wear our nation's
uniform and serve.
A full list of my nominations is available HERE
.
For more information about the nomination process to the Service
Academy, students and their families can call the Service Academy
Coordinator at (803) 771-6112.
MUSC Visit
(to see video from my visit, click the photo)
Each year, I stop by MUSC Children's Hospital in Charleston, which
serves children from around the state, to deliver valentine cards to
some of the children. These brave children remind me of the important
things of life - love and family - even during difficult times, and I
am always amazed by their strength and courage.
Community Office Hours
I'm committed to providing South Carolinians with the highest-quality
constituent services possible and last week I launched my office's 2015
Community Office Hours series.
Members of my staff will meet with
residents and offer assistance with federal issues in their own
communities throughout South Carolina.
This week, they traveled to
nine communities and I plan to add more throughout the year.
I want
South Carolina families to use my office as a resource, whether or not
they can travel to one of my regional offices in North Charleston,
Columbia or Greenville. For additional information, residents can call
one of my regional offices at (843) 727-4525 (Lowcountry), (803)
771-6112 (Midlands) or (864) 233-5366 (Upstate).
Veterans Job and Resource Fairs
Last October, I launched my Veterans Job Training Initiative
to support
the men and women who have bravely worn our nation's uniform as they
transition from active military service to the civilian workplace.
This March, as part of that initiative, I'll host two veterans job and
resource fairs - March 9th in the Lowcountry and March 25th in the
Upstate.
The job and resource fairs follow a series of workshops
around the state that focused on providing veterans with various skills
and information on topics, including: how they can transfer their
military skills and certifications to the civilian world, an overview
of the available educational and entrepreneurial resources, and a
resume writing and interviewing skills workshop with a hiring manager's
panel.
Thank you again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim

Right
to
Work
Earlier
this
week,
I
announced
my
support
and
co-sponsorship
of
the
"National
Right
to
Work
Act."
This
pro-worker,
reform-minded
piece
of
legislation I introduced
with
Senator
Rand
Paul
and
Senate
Majority
Leader
Mitch
McConnell
would
prevent
workers
from
being
forced
to
join
a
union
or
from
being
forced
to
pay
union
dues
as
a
condition
of
employment.
I
firmly
believe
that
no
worker
should
be
forced
to
join
a
union
or
pay
dues
for
their
job.
South
Carolina
and
twenty
three
other
states
have
passed
Right
to
Work
laws
to
address
this
issue.
It&#8217;s
no
surprise
that
states
like
ours,
in
part
because
of
our
Right
to
Work
status,
are
seeing
improvements
in
real
personal
income
and
average
annual
employment.
Academy
Nominations
This
week
I
also
announced
the
nominations
of
48
South
Carolina
students
to
the
United
States
Military
Service
Academies
for
the
class
of
2019.
The
Academies
are
the
U.S.
Military
Academy
in
West
Point,
NY,
the
U.S.
Naval
Academy
in
Annapolis,
MD,
the
U.S.
Air
Force
Academy
in
Colorado
Springs,
CO,
and
the
U.S.
Merchant
Marine
Academy
in
Kings
Point,
NY.
I
am
extremely
proud
to
nominate
these
students.
These
young
South
Carolinians
represent
some
of
our
state&#8217;s
best
students
and
I
am

I&#8217;m

providing
South
Carolinians
with
the
highest-quality

last
week
I
launched
my

Members
of
my
staff
will
meet
with
residents
and
offer
assistance
with
federal
issues
in
their
own

throughout
South
Carolina.
This
week,
they
traveled
to
nine
communities
and
I
plan
to
add
more
throughout
the
year.
I
want

Veterans
Job

Re s ource
Fairs
Last
October,
I
launched
my
Veterans
Job
Training
Initiative
to
support
the
men
and
women
who
have
bravely
worn
our
nation&#8217;s
uniform
as
they
transition
from
active
military
service
to
the
civilian
workplace.
This
March,
as
part
of
that
initiative,
I&#8217;ll
host
two
veterans
job
and
resource
fairs
-
March
9th
in
the
Lowcountry
and
March
25th
in
the
Upstate.
The
job
and
resource
fairs
follow
a
series
of
workshops
around
the
state
that
focused
on
providing
veterans
with
various
skills
and
information
on
topics,
including:
how
they
can
transfer
their
military
skills
and
certifications
to
the
civilian
world,
an
overview
of
the
available
educational
and
entrepreneurial
resources,
and
a
resume

workshop
with
a
