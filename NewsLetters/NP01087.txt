London ISD School Visits Washington
It was a pleasure to visit with the students of the London Independent School District from the Corpus Christi area.
They were in Washington last week to learn about our nation's history and stopped by the U.S. Capitol to take a photo and receive a tour from one of my staff.
FREEDOM Act Strengthens Civil Liberty Protections
This week in Washington, the House Judiciary Committee voted to end bulk data collection on Americans under section 215 of the Patriot Act. The
USA Freedom Act , if enacted into law, would end bulk collection of the phone records by the NSA and would prohibit the government from large-scale indiscriminate collection of data. This legislation, though not perfect, goes a long way towards reigning in what I believe is an unconstitutional data grab by the NSA.
The bill makes national security agencies even more transparent with included provisions that permit tech companies and carriers to publicly disclose information about government requests for customer data and improved legal representation for citizens in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts.
As an attorney, I know the Fourth Amendment, and as a computer consultant I understand the necessity for digital privacy. The USA Freedom Act is a step in the right direction. Although some amendments I previously supported were not included, the legislation strikes a balance between civil libertarians and national defense hawks and may be able to make it to the president's desk for his signature into law.
Farenthold Questions FBI, Others on Encryption Technology
Last week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on encryption technology.
Representatives from law enforcement, industry, and academia all testified. The FBI asserted that they need a so-called "golden key" that would permit law enforcement to access citizen's phones and other devices in order to stop a potential terrorist attack.
As someone who knows technology, building such a secure back door would be difficult if not impossible, and that key would also then be the biggest target for every hacker in the world.
The FBI's proposal sounds good in theory, but would be a disaster in practice.
Check out the above video to see me at the hearing.
H.R. 2029 is a Vote for Our Armed Forces
On Thursday, I voted to ensure that our veterans receive the benefits and care they have earned. I supported
H.R. 2029 , the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016, because it is critical that Congress fulfill our nations commitment to its veterans while simultaneously enacting reforms to fix management and healthcare problems at the VA.
The bill also allocates $85 million to the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) to finish construction of their new Powertrain facility. Although our Constitution gives Congress limited powers, it goes give Congress the responsibility to provide for a strong national defense. By funding military construction, such as facilities like CCAD, we can ensure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment and resources they need to keep us safe.
Farenthold Offers Veterans Amendment
Last week during the debate on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations, I offered an amendment that proposed to strip pay for VA employees who had received unsatisfactory marks on their performance reviews. Although many VA employees cannot be fired, Congress should be able to take away their pay if they are found to be negligent in serving our nation's veterans. The Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs committee asked me to work with him on my amendment and I am currently doing that.
Veterans Town Hall Today
Today I will be holding a Veterans Town Hall and I wanted to remind you of the location change. The event has been moved from Del Mar College and will be held at American Legion Post 364 in Corpus Christi at 11am on Tuesday, May 5. I will be listening to local veterans about their experiences with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and sharing what I have been working on in Washington with respect to veterans issues. We will also have a staff member from the House Veterans Affairs committee to hear concerns and provide the latest details about the committee's continued work in support our veterans. American Legion Post 364 is at 5323 Kostoryz Road.
I am also happy to report that my team of red-tape cutters will be at the Veterans Town Hall to help folks deal with any bureaucratic problems they are facing. Unfortunately the great majority of problems that my red-tape cutters fix are with the VA, and it is shameful that our veterans need to come to their Congressman to get help with the government they served. Seeing VA bureaucracy at work makes me work that much harder to ensure that our veterans are receiving the prompt care and benefits they have earned.
I encourage you to check out my social media accounts to receive more information on my upcoming Veterans Town Hall event. You can Like me on
