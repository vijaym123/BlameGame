Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today, the Senate
confirmed Richard Boulware to the U.S. District Court for the District
of Nevada. Richard Boulware is an intelligent and talented lawyer
from Las Vegas. He has impeccable credentials, and is an incredibly
worthy candidate.
After growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada, Mr.
Boulware attended Harvard University as an undergraduate. He received his
law degree from Columbia, where he was on the Columbia Law Review.
Following graduation, Richard worked at Covington &amp; Burling in New
York, and also as a federal defender.
Since 2007, Richard
Boulware has worked as a federal public defender in Nevada. Now, Richard
Boulware will become the first African-American man to serve on the
U.S. District Court in Nevada. I have been impressed with Mr.
Boulwares dedication to the state of Nevada and the American justice system.
He has proven himself to be a distinguished public
servant.
I have no doubt Richard Boulware will be a valuable addition to the
United States District Court.
