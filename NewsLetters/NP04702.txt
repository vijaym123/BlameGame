3rd Annual Youth Leadership
Summit
Congressman Adam Kinzinger hosted his 3rd Annual Youth
Leadership Summit on Friday, November 7th at Illinois Valley Community
College. High schools throughout the 16th district were invited to bring
their school's top student leaders to the event. Over 200 students
attended the summit.
Congressman Kinzinger began the summit by
meeting with the students from each school. He then spoke to the
students about his own personal journey of leadership, which led him to the
U.S. House of Representatives. He stressed the importance of
following your dreams and being nice to those around you. He defined a leader
as somoene "you would follow to hell because you truly believed in
what he or she was leading you to do."
Congressman Kinzinger discussed his
high school years and how they shaped him into being the leader he is
today.
Congressman Kinzinger then introduced former
NASA astronaut Scott Altman. Altman talked about how being rejected
from the Air Force didn't stop him from being a pilot; instead, he
joined the Navy and eventually made his way to NASA. Altman emphasized
strong teamwork and a common goal as necessary parts of
leadership.
Altman
showed footage from his last mission to space- a big hit with all the
high schoolers.
The second guest speaker at the
Youth Leadership Summit was Carl Cannon. Cannon, a former Correctional
Officer, has established youth advocacy programs in Peoria. He talked
about the importance of staying away from bad influences and being true
to yourself. He reminded the students that they are the hope for the
future, and that they must treat each other with respect.
Cannon got
everyone to dance at the end of his talk- including Congressman
Kinzinger.
Congressman Kinzinger ended the day by talking
about how everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. Leadership
depends on how a person uses those strengths and weaknesses. Several
students left the event saying they couldn't wait until next year. Judging
by the reaction on Twitter, the students thought the Youth Leadership
Summit was a success.
Everyone was excited to use
