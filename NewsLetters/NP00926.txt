Dear Friends,
This week is Public Service Recognition Week. Since 1985, the first
week of May has been dedicated to highlighting the millions of
hardworking Americans who serve our nation as federal, state, county
and local government employees and members of the uniformed services.
In keeping with the spirit of Public Service Recognition Week, I would
like to recognize one of Delawares own dedicated public servants.
Beth Blank has called the First State her
home for more than 30 years. At the Social Security Administration
(SSA) office in Lewes, Beth is the district manager. There, she wears
many different hats to make sure Delawareans get the help they need
when they contact the SSA office. Her colleagues tell us Beth provides
critical oversight to ensure that operations run smoothly and that
questions, concerns and cases are seen through to their resolution. She
takes pride in her work with and instills integrity in every office
task.
As your U.S. Senator, I serve as your liaison to the federal
government, including to agencies like the SSA. When Delawareans
contact my office for assistance with their Social Security matters, my
constituent services team knows that Beth is the one to call. According
to them, Beth provides exceptional care and pours energy into every
case she handles. Just like me, Beth is deeply committed to helping the
people of Delaware.
I thank Beth, and all of Delawares local, state, and federal public
servants and service members for the work they do each and every day.
Dedicated Americans like them help to make our nation so great. I
encourage all of you to take some time this week to show your gratitude
to a public servant and to learn more about the important work that he
or she does each day to provide the services we all enjoy.
As always, I welcome hearing your views on this issue, or any other,
through email or by contacting me on Twitter @SenatorCarper

Dear
Friends,
This

is
Public
Service
Recognition
Week .
Since
1985,
the
first
week
of
May

the
millions
of
hardworking
Americans
who
serve
our
nation

federal,
state,
county
and
local
government
employees
and
members
of
the
uniformed
services.
In
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
Public
Service
Recognition
Week,
I
would
like
to
recognize
one
of
Delaware&#146;s
own
dedicated
public
servants.
Beth
Blank
has called
the
First
State
her
home
for
more
than
30
years.
At
the
Social
Security
Administration
(SSA)
office
in
Lewes,
Beth
is
the
district
manager.
There,
she
wears
many
different
hats
to
make
sure
Delawareans
get
the
help
they
need
when
they
contact
the
SSA
office.
Her
colleagues
tell
us
Beth
provides
critical
oversight
to
ensure
that
operations
run
smoothly
and
that
questions,
concerns
and
cases
are
seen
through
to
their
resolution.
She
takes
pride
in
her
work
with
and
instills
integrity
in
every
office
task.
As
your
U.S.

I
serve
as
your

to
the

government,
including
to
agencies
like
the
SSA.
When
Delawareans
contact
my
office
for
assistance
with
their
Social
Security
matters,
my
constituent
services
team
knows
that
Beth
is
the
one
to
call.
According
to
them,
Beth
provides
exceptional
care
and
pours
energy
into
every
case
she
handles.
Just
like
me,
Beth
is
deeply
committed
to
helping
the
people
of
Delaware.
I
thank
Beth,
and
all
of
Delaware&#146;s
local,
state,
and
federal
public
servants
and
service
members
for
the
work
they
do
each
and
every
day.
Dedicated
Americans
like
them
help
to
make
our
nation
so
great.
