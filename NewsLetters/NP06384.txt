Share Your Thoughts on ISIL
Friends,
Last week the president addressed the American people revealing his strategy to defeat and destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
I agree with many of the components of his plan including working with a broad coalition of international allies, increasing airstrikes and intelligence, and eliminating their funding sources.
However, I am concerned that some of the elements proposed leave room for the possibility of unintended consequences for the U.S. down the road.
As the president and Congress continue to work together to bring justice and resolve to the issue, I want to hear from you on the issue.
I hope youll share your thoughts with me by taking the survey below.
And as always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my

In your service,
Steven M. Palazzo
Member of Congress
