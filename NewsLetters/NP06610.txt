David --
I know that your inbox has been flooded with emails, so I&rsquo;ll make this quick. Speaker Boehner has his sights set on unseating Cheri Bustos and replacing her with a Republican rubber stamp.
The only thing standing in his way is you, David.
With Election Day right around the corner, it is going to come down to races like this one. That is why your support today is more critical than ever. So David, I&rsquo;m asking:
will you chip in $5 or more to help Cheri Bustos fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s ruthless attacks? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Every day, I see Cheri fighting to protect Illinois&rsquo; middle class families.
But if Cheri is going to continue that fight, she needs you with her every step of the way.
Will you chip in for Cheri today? http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-Back
Thanks for all you do,
