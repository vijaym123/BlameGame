Blaine's Bulletin
All Americans are granted freedoms and rights that are guaranteed to us by the Constitution, including the Second Amendment. And when those guaranteed rights get trampled on by the administration, I will not back down.
In February, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives issued a proposal to ban green tip ammunition which is the most commonly used ammunition for the most popular rifle design in American
the AR-15. The ATF has long considered green tip ammo to be allowable under the sporting purposes test, but, recently, the ATF announced that it would ban it, because repeating handguns that fire it are commercially available.
When this proposal was announced to the public, it was met with tremendous outpouring of opposition
including from hundreds of constituents in the 3 rd
District.
Allowing the ATF to move forward with banning this specific ammo could open up other previously allowed types of ammunition to the same ban, which could hurt individuals and small businesses across the country, and undermine our Constitutional rights.
In the House, 237 colleagues of mine joined me in signing a letter to the head of the ATF opposing this action. We also sought clarification and expressed outrage about the fact that the ATF did not follow federal law
the Administrative Procedures Act to be precise
and publish its proposed framework in the Federal Register, and we also demanded to know what other ammo the ATF is considering to ban under the new framework.
With all the pressure from Second Amendment supporters inside and outside Congress, the ATF recently decided to withdraw its ban
however, that does not mean this fight has is completely over.
Living in rural St. Elizabeth, Missouri, I learned from an early age to respect firearms and handle them responsibly.
With freedom comes great responsibility. Thats why I will continue to stand up for our right to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
