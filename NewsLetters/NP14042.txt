Earlier this month, the Administration
announced
that it would support "limited, targeted, and reversible" easing of international sanctions against Iran if they agreed to halt their nuclear program.
In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
bill
strengthening and expanding existing U.S. sanctions.
Despite the strong bipartisan support for this legislation, the President urged Senate leaders this week to oppose enacting additional sanctions while the talks in Geneva are ongoing.
The P5+1 negotiations with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
the United States, China, Russia, Britain, and France
plus Germany, began in October, and the next round of talks is scheduled to begin this week.
The goal of the negotiations is to reach an agreement regarding how to address Irans nuclear program.
Question of the week:
Do you believe that the United States should unilaterally reduce the tough sanctions it has placed on Iran in the hope that doing so will make a deal to disarm their nuclear program more likely?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
