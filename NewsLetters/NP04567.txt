Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Native American heritage is part of Nevadas historical
fabric, and the dynamic cultures and traditions of Tribes across Western
states are deeply embedded into everyday American life. In November, we
celebrate Native American heritage and honor all the sacrifices their
ancestors endured many years ago. By celebrating a heritage, nations
are able to ensure future generations of young people have respect for
their people's past and strong values in forging their
future.
Throughout American history, Native Americans have been removed and
disenfranchised from their homelands, their religions have been
stifled, their ceremonies outlawed, and their languages stolen. In spite of
our countrys shameful history, many Native Americans have served
with honor and distinction in the Armed Forces of the United States, and
continue to serve in the Armed Forces in greater numbers per capita
than any other group in the United States. Native Americans like Chester
Nez, a World War II veteran and Code Talker, put it this way:
Somebodys got to defend this country. Somebodys got to defend the
freedom. Corporal Nez and other Code Talkers used their gift to save
countless lives and helped win the war. And their willingness to share it made
them American heroes.
For this and many other reasons, it is
essential that the United States commits itself to preserving Native
American languages. Its a shame that distinct and beautiful
languages- languages that contribute to the vibrancy of American history- are
at risk of dying out. There have been many elements which have
contributed to this problem, one of which is a lack of resources devoted to
cultural and language preservation. That is why I have helped secure
millions of dollars in grants from the National Park Service, the
Historic Preservation Fund, and the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development to assist tribes with community development and cultural
preservation. Additionally, I have sponsored a number of bills in the Senate
this year to transfer land back into the hands of Nevada tribes.
Notably, the Nevada Native Nations Land Act and Moapa Band of Paiutes Land
Conveyance Act would expand tribal lands by more than 100,000 acres
and enable Nevadas tribes to develop that land and expand their
communities on their own terms.
This National American Indian
Heritage Month, I thank the countless Native Americans who have contributed
so much to the cultural richness of Nevada communities. This occasion
is also an opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to Indian Countrys
community, heritage, and autonomy. I will continue to work so Nevada
Tribes, and all tribes, have new opportunities to protect their heritage
and flourish.
