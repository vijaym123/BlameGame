David -- We have a MAJOR problem. And only a few hours left to find a solution. Please read this immediately:
This week, Boehner and his allies are spending $2O,OOO,OOO against us. We repeat: $2O,OOO,OOO worth of deceitful, Obama-bashing ads are hitting TVs across the country starting tomorrow.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt: right now, we can&rsquo;t match that and we can&rsquo;t fight back. But our next ad buy deadline is tomorrow. That&rsquo;s why President Clinton emailed you today -- to ask you to help us out in the final stretch. If 32,OOO answer President Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action by tonight, we can avoid a crushing defeat at the hands of Boehner and his corporate buddies.
If you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we need your help.
David -- please answer President Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action tonight.
