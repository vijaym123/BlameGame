Friend,
On the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, it is our duty to take a hard look at events overseas and then vote on how our country will respond.
Last week, the President defined his proposed plan for the United States&#39; engagement with the ISIL-Iraq-Syrian conflict.
When dealing with any conflict abroad, we must do our due diligence to hear all sides, understand the potential costs and actions, and take steps to protect our nation.
As we debate the best course of action for our country, I want to give you the opportunity to weigh in.
Please click here to share your thoughts about how our nation should engage with this ongoing conflict.
We will likely be faced with many hard decisions in the coming weeks, and it&#39;s important to have a full and honest debate about our next steps.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Be well,
Ami
