Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Honoring America's Veterans
This past Tuesday, our nation collectively recognized the sacrifices of so many great Americans as we celebrated the Veterans Day holiday.
Communities
across th e
10th District gathered together to give thanks to their greatest sons and daughters, those who served our country in the American Armed Forces.
I spent the day sharing stories of NC-10 veterans from a variety of local newspapers including the
Forest City Daily Courier , the
Gaston
Gazette , and the
Asheville Citizen-Times .
I recognized Veterans Day in a ceremony last week when I presented Shelby resident Charles Peeler with the medals his brother Franklin earned while fighting in Europe during World War II.

Celebrating Congressman Coble
As the 113th Congress comes to a close, we say goodbye to members who are leaving the body.
Few of those leaving will be missed more than Congressman Howard Coble of North Carolina's 6th District who is retiring after 30 years of service.
Howard is the definition of a dedicated public servant, having served his constituents with distinction.
More importantly, Howard is a true gentleman loved by members on both sides of the aisle.
This week, I took to the House floor wearing one of Howard's
patented madras jackets
to recognize his service to the people of North Carolina and thank him for being a mentor and friend to me.

House Leaders for the 114th Congress
With Congress returning to session following the November election, House Republicans elected our new leadership team for the 114th Congress which will begin in January.
I will be resuming my role as Chief Deputy Whip for House Republicans in the new Congress and recently took some time to discuss the new role and what it means for North Carolina with the
Charlotte Observer .
Additionally, I joined the entire House Republican leadership team to discuss our priorities for the remainder of this year and the coming years at a press conference this past Thursday.

Proud to Support
This Friday, the House of Representatives
again voted , with my support, to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline allowing for the transport of oil from Canada to refineries on the Gulf coast.
While this is a vote the House has taken on multiple occasions in the past, this week's vote is different as outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has finally relented and will allow the Senate to take up this important legislation as well.
While the Senate's delays are completely indefensible and go counter to the wishes of the majority of Americans who support the project, I am thankful they will finally allow it to come up for a vote.
This project will
create jobs and help reduce the cost of energy , it is long past time Congress get out of the way and allow construction to begin.
