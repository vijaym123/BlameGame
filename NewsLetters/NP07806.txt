Meeting with Israeli Ambassador to Discuss the
Escalating Conflict Between Israel and
Hamas
Following the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli boys and the murder
of a Palestinian boy, tensions came to a head between Israel and the
terrorist group Hamas. Hamas, which is now part of the Palestinian
unity government, began pummeling Israel with hundreds of rockets and
missiles earlier this week. On Thursday alone, over a hundred rockets
were fired at Israel. The Israeli people were forced to flee to bomb
shelters to take cover.
I met with Israeli
Ambassador Ron Dermer earlier this week, who showed me an Iphone
application that notifies the user everytime terrorists launch missiles,
rockets, and mortars at Israel. I can tell you, the app eerily goes off
nonstop throughout the day. Please join me in praying for the peace and
security of our ally Israel. My prayers are with the innocent people
involved in both sides of the
conflict.
I penned an op-ed for Fox News on the need for Congress to show
unwavering support for our ally Israel. You can read it

I'm taping interviews, and other happenings on the Hill. We're a small
office and rely heavily on the dilligent work of our top-notch

Discussing the Latest on the IRS Scandal on Fox
News
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials continue to
stonewall Congress. The same agency that expects American taxpayers to keep
documents for years is apparently incapable of holding on to its own
documents. But we are making progress getting to the bottom of this
scandal. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the IRS to explain under
oath how the emails were "lost."
I will continue to demand answers
from the IRS. This sort of corruption cannot go unaddressed.

IRS targeting scandal
