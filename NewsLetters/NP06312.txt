September 13, 2014
Friends,
Last week, our country remembered the thousands of innocent lives lost
in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
Many of us will
never forget where we were that day as we turned on the TV or radio
and heard the tragic news.
On this 13th anniversary and the second anniversary of the terrorist
attacks in Benghazi, Lybia, we are reminded that our freedom is precious
and we must preserve it, especially when foreign enemieslike
ISISare dedicated to taking our freedoms away.
At a time of
increasing terrorist threats, America stands united by our commitment to
defend our nation at home and
abroad.
During the
Presidents address to the nation, he outlined his plan on how the
United States will defeat the radical terrorist group ISIS.
While
his speech was emotional, his plan was not very specific.
Last
week, the Presidents advisors met with my colleagues and me to discuss
the details of how our country will defeat ISIS.
Both Chambers of
Congress will vote on legislation that outlines our defensive
strategy.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on an ISIS
strategy this week and I look forward to seeing what this final
legislation will look like and sharing the details with you.
I
discussed ISIS, immigration, and other important federal issues with WPDE
News Channel 15s Tim McGinnis last week.
You can watch
this interview tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. on Carolina This Week with
Tim McGinnis,

VA Listening
Forums
Our veterans not only fought battles on
foreign soil, sadly, they have been fighting through bureaucratic battles
back at home.
In a good-faith effort to resolve the issues that
have crippled the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dorn Hospital in
Columbia and Ralph Johnson Hospital in Charleston are both holding
listening forums this month to get input from our states veterans on how
their facilities can improve care.
The Dorn town hall
event is on September 24, 2014 from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and the Ralph
Johnson listening forum is on September 25, 2014 from 4:00 p.m. to
5:00 p.m.

Library Receives Sparks!
Grant
I am excited to share with you some good news about a grant awarded
to Georgetown County Library.
The Institute of Museum and
Library Services notified the library last week that it received a Sparks!
Ignition Grant for its project to improve the digital-age workforce
skills of local young people through STEM-related digital activities.
Classes relating to online STEM resources, digital video
production, and app development will result in increased skills and
interpersonal abilities, as well as an appreciation for the public library as a
dynamic and informative place.
By working with a number of
community organizations, the library seeks to reach a local youth
community that has historically experienced high rates of poverty and low
rates of high school completion, and build on previous efforts to
provide job fairs, skills training, and other initiatives.
This
program will greatly benefit our district and I look forward to seeing its
success.
Have a good week,
