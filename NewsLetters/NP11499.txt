Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Visiting Longview Yarns in Hickory
This past Monday, the House of Representatives was out of session, allowing me to spend a long weekend back home in NC.
I took the time to visit Longview Yarns in Hickory.
You might remember Longview Yarns from previous weekly emails.
They were the 10th District textile company that helped dye the yarn used to
make the uniforms
the American Olympians wore during the Opening Ceremonies of the recently concluded Winter Olympics in Sochi.
During my visit I met with owners John and Russ Perkins who took me on a tour of their facility.
Employing only 10 people, Longview is one of the many small textile companies located throughout the district.
2,000 Days and Counting for Keystone Approval
This past Wednesday marked the 2,000th day since paperwork seeking approval for the Keystone XL pipeline was first submitted to the State Department.
This pipeline would help create an estimated 20,000 jobs and has been deemed environmentally safe by the State Department but President Obama still refuses to make a decision on allowing its construction.
The House has passed legislation on multiple occaisions to force the President to make a decision but still we wait.
With our economy continuing to struggle, it is time the President approve this project to create jobs and reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil.

Proud to Support
As I continue my efforts to keep you updated on what I do in Washington, I wanted to begin highlighting legislation introduced in the House that I have cosponsored.
This week one of the bills I cosponsored, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act,
passed the US Senate
and will now be sent to President Obama to be signed into law.
Originally passed by the House last December, the bill increases funding for pediatric disease research.
You can click the image below to learn more about the bill and its namesake, Gabriella Miller,
a 10 year old girl who died from cancer.

What I Have Been Reading
The president's power grab
Los Angeles Times
One of the most frustrating aspects of the past few years, has been President Obama's blatant disregard for Congress and the Constitution.
Time and again, he has refused to enforce or unilaterally altered laws passed by Congress.
From Obamacare delays, to the Defense of Marriage Act, to immigration laws President Obama the op-ed above outlines how President Obama works around Congress and questions the constitutionality of his moves.
This week, the House passed
two
bills
addressing this issue.
Obamacare's Year of Delayed Deadlines
Bloomberg Businessweek
President Obama's most consistent executive overreach has been in dealing with the rollout of his signature healthcare law.
Starting in April 2013, President Obama has now acted over a dozen times to alter parts of Obamacare and has not once sought Congress' approval.
The length of this list is both a testament to how deeply flawed the ACA is and also highlights the President's continued disregard for the Constitution and Congress.
6 brilliant new breweries across the U.S.
CNN
I enjoyed seeing Asheville's Wicked Weed featured on this list of brilliant new breweries in America.
I personally think this list could have and should have been comprised of only Western North Carolina breweries as there are many more that deserve recognition.
Regardless, it was great to see Wicked Weed and Beer City USA recognized.
