Friend,
We knew this was coming - outside money has started pouring into our race.
Just last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce made a commitment to one of my opponents to the tune of more than $250,000 -
BEFORE
the primary.
To be clear, that&#39;s $250,000 between now and
June 3rd .
They&#39;ll be spending that money on television ads that spread misinformation and prop up our opponent.
Meanwhile, national tea party groups have committed thousands more to one of our other opponents for ads and ground support.
We need your help -- right now. Can you chip in $5 or more so we can fight back against the outside special interests trying to influence this election?
These groups don&#39;t know our district -- but what they lack in inside knowledge, they make up for in outside money. We can&#39;t let them be our voice.
We have to speak up. We have to fight back. Click here now -- your $5 can make a difference.
We don&#39;t have to match them dollar for dollar-- but we need the resources to push back quickly and effectively.
We can do that with your help.
Thanks for standing with us.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - More than $250,000 can buy a lot of misinformation, and we&#39;re going to need your help to set the record straight - click here now and give $5 or more.
