Dear Friend,
My team and I are dedicated to working for the constituents of the 8th
Congressional District of Tennessee. We know that it's not always
possible to get to one of our dedicated District offices, so we're
taking this opportunity to come to you, which is why I'm launching
Mobile Office Hours.
Through Mobile Office Hours, my team will be more widely available to
assist communities in the District in order to provide the best
customer experience possible to our constituents. I invite those facing
an issue with a federal agency or department to meet with staff at our
mobile office locations or at any of the District offices.
Mobile Office Hours are open to the public and no appointment is
needed. Hours and locations are as follows:
