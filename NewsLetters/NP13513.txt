Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
As 2013 comes to a close I will be sending a series of newsletters
recapping the year in Congress.
The newsletters will review (1) some
of my initiatives during the year, (2) some of the key measures
considered by the House; and (3) the major issues tackled by the
committees on which I serve.
This newsletter will review some of the initiatives that I pushed
during 2013 and will provide an update on the status of each.
1. Blocking pay increases for members of Congress, members of the
President's cabinet, the Vice President and non-military federal
employees.
At the end of 2012, the President issued an executive order
to grant automatic pay increases to federal officials and non-military
employees, including members of Congress.
Because the U.S. economy has
been stagnant for years (resulting in little to no wage growth for
millions of private sector workers) and because the federal government's
balance sheet was deep in the red, I filed a bill to block these
increases.
The bill passed the House in February as a standalone
measure and was subsequently attached to the continuing resolution in
March of 2013.
It is now law.
2. Applying budget sequestration to members of Congress.
When the
automatic spending reductions mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act
(BCA) took effect in March of 2013, many described the reductions as
indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts.
Interestingly (and perhaps
expectedly), the cuts exempted the pay of members of Congress entirely.
My bill, which was co-sponsored by Democratic Congressman Ami Bera from
California, applies the automatic spending reductions to congressional
pay. My goal was to submit this bill as an amendment to a related bill.
Unfortunately, I was never permitted to offer this amendment.
3. Stopping ineffective foreign aid that undermines our values and
allies.
Americans and taxpayers get frustrated when they see our
government sending money to foreigners who do not display good behavior
in return.
My Palestinian Accountability Act cuts off U.S. aid to the
Palestinian Authority unless the PA, among other things, (1) recognizes
Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state; (2) cuts ties with terrorist
groups such as Hamas; and (3) ceases the government-sponsored
instigation of hatred against Jews and Israel in the Palestinian media
and education system.
We have yet to consider a State
Department/Foreign Affairs authorization bill, but when we do I will
offer this an amendment.
4. Prohibiting members of Congress from exempting themselves from the
laws they pass.
I filed a resolution to amend the Constitution so
that all laws which apply to society as a whole also apply to members
of Congress.
As James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 57, one of
the fundamental maxims of representative government is that the
legislature "can make no law which will not have its full operation on
themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of the
society."
I have met with the relevant committee chairman about this
measure and am optimistic that we will be able to slate it for
consideration at a congressional hearing, which is the first step
towards passing it through the House.
5. James Madison Congressional Accountability Act.
I wrote a bill to
make members of Congress, as well as the President and key White House
officials, live under the terms of the Obama health law.
As written,
the law ends the congressional health plan for all members of Congress
and congressional staff and makes them go to the exchanges for their
insurance.
No subsidies are authorized, yet in August the Obama
administration issued an administrative rule granting members of
Congress and staff taxpayer-financed subsidies and authorizing members
of Congress to exempt their staff from the terms of the law.
My
amendment would stop this charade, which is yet another example of the
DC ruling class playing fast and loose with the law.
The bill was
attached to the government funding bill of September 30 (along with a
delay in the ObamaCare individual mandate tax).
It passed on the House
by a vote of 228-201, but was, unfortunately, defeated in the Senate.
6. If You Like Your Plan, You Can Keep it Act.
In response to the mass
cancellation of insurance policies due to the mandates contained in the
Obama health law, I joined with Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) to write a
bill that would provide grandfather protection to all existing health
insurance policies.
Defenders of the cancellations claimed that the
canceled policies were "inferior" to those offered on the ObamaCare
exchanges, but if this is the case then policyholders will voluntarily
choose those exchange plans; they should not need to be coerced under
penalty of law to purchase such plans.
The House passed a more limited
version of this bill on November 15, 2013 by a vote of 261-157.
Not
surprisingly, the Senate took no action on the measure.
7. Resolution of Disapproval re: the President's Failure to Take Care
that the Laws be Faithfully Executed and re: the Usurpation of
Legislative Authority.
America's constitutional structure is fairly
easy to understand: we have a legislative body (Congress) with the
authority to make laws, an executive (the President) charged with the
duty to enforce the laws, and a judicial branch (the Supreme Court and
inferior federal courts) that is required to adjudicate cases and
controversies and, thus, to interpret the laws.
The current incumbent
has asserted the authority to re-write key provisions of federal
statutes (i.e., changing the effective date for the employer mandate in
ObamaCare), to grant waivers regarding statutory mandates to
politically-connected entities (i.e., the waivers granted to various
unions re: the law health care law) and to suspend the application of
laws (i.e., allowing the offering of policies that conflict with his
own health care law by refusing to enforce the applicable provisions.)
Because this is inconsistent with the separation of powers and the
proper functioning of constitutional government, I drafted a resolution
in which the House formally disapproves of the President's failure to
"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" as required by the
Constitution; disapproves of the President's usurpation of the
legislative power of Congress through the rewriting of key provisions
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and re-affirms that
the preservation of the Constitution's separation of powers is
essential for the protection of individual liberty and the maintenance
of the rule of law.
I have over 50 cosponsors for this resolution and
am hoping to get the resolution a vote before the House in 2014.
The next newsletter will review some of the important measures
considered by the House.
I will also include some of the initiatives
for which I was a cosponsor.
Merry Christmas!

Dear
Friend&#8211;
As
2013
comes
to
a
close
I
will
be
sending
a
series
of
newsletters
recapping
the
year
in
Congress.
The
newsletters
will
review
(1)
some
of
my
initiatives
during
the
year,
(2)
some
of
the
key
measures
considered
by
the
House;
and
(3)
the
major
issues
tackled
by
the
committees
on
which
I
serve.
This
newsletter
will
review
some
of
the
initiatives
that
I
pushed
during
2013
and
will
provide
an
update
on
the
status
of
each.
1.
Blocking
pay
increases
for
members
of
Congress,
members
of
the
President&#8217;s
cabinet,
the
Vice
President
and
non-military
federal
employees.
At
the
end
of
2012,
the
President
issued
an
executive
order
to
grant
automatic
pay
increases
to
federal
officials
and
non-military
employees,
including
members
of
Congress.
Because
the
U.S.
economy
has
been
stagnant
for
years
(resulting
in
little
to
no
wage
growth
for
millions
of
private
sector
workers)
and
because
the
federal
government&#8217;s
balance
sheet
was
deep
in
the
red,
I
filed
a
bill
to
block
these
increases.
The
bill
passed
the
House
in
February
as
a
standalone
measure
and
was
subsequently
attached
to
the
continuing
resolution
in
March
of
2013.
It
is
now
law.
2.
Applying
budget
sequestration
to
members
of
Congress.
When
the
automatic
spending
reductions
mandated
by
the
2011
Budget
Control
Act
(BCA)
took
effect
in
March
of
2013,
many
described
the
reductions
as
indiscriminate,
across-the-board
cuts.
Interestingly
(and
perhaps
expectedly),
the
cuts
exempted
the
pay
of
members
of
Congress
entirely.
My
bill,
which
was
co-sponsored
by
Democratic
Congressman
Ami
Bera
from
California,
applies
the
automatic
spending
reductions
to
congressional
pay.
My
goal
was
to
submit
this
bill
as
an
amendment
to
a
related
bill.
Unfortunately,
I
was
never
permitted
to
offer
this
amendment.
3.
Stopping
ineffective
foreign
aid
that
undermines
our
values
and
allies.
Americans
and
taxpayers
get
frustrated
when
they
see
our
government
sending
money
to
foreigners
who
do
not
display
good
behavior
in
return.
My
Palestinian
Accountability
Act
cuts
off
U.S.
aid
to
the
Palestinian
Authority
unless
the
PA,
among
other
things,
(1)
recognizes
Israel&#8217;s
right
to
exist
as
a
Jewish
state;
(2)
cuts
ties
with
terrorist
groups
such
as
Hamas;
and
(3)
ceases
the
government-sponsored
instigation
of
hatred
against
Jews
and
Israel
in
the
Palestinian
media
and
education
system.
We
have
yet
to
consider
a
State
Department/Foreign
Affairs
authorization
bill,
but
when
we
do
I
will
offer
this
an
amendment.
4.
Prohibiting
members
of
Congress
from
exempting
themselves
from
the
laws
they
pass.
I
filed
a
resolution
to
amend
the
Constitution
so
that
all
laws
which
apply
to
society
as
a
whole
also
apply
to
members
of
Congress.
As
James
Madison
wrote
in
The
Federalist
No.
57,
one
of
the
fundamental
maxims
of
representative
government
is
that
the
legislature
&#8220;can
make
no
law
which
will
not
have
its
full
operation
on
themselves
and
their
friends,
as
well
as
on
the
great
mass
of
the
society.&#8221;
I
have
met
with
the
relevant
committee
chairman
about
this
measure
and
am
optimistic
that
we
will
be
able
to
slate
it
for
consideration
at
a
congressional
hearing,
which
is
the
first
step
towards
passing
it
through
the
House.
5.
James
Madison
Congressional
Accountability
Act.
I
wrote
a
bill
to
make
members
of
Congress,
as
well
as
the
President
and
key
White
House
officials,
live
under
the
terms
of
the
Obama
health
law.
As
written,
the
law
ends
the
congressional
health
plan
for
all
members
of
Congress
and
congressional
staff
and
makes
them
go
to
the
exchanges
for
their
insurance.
No
subsidies
are
authorized,
yet
in
August
the
Obama
administration
issued
an
administrative
rule
granting
members
of
Congress
and
staff
taxpayer-financed
subsidies
and
authorizing
members
of
Congress
to
exempt
their
staff
from
the
terms
of
the
law.
My
amendment
would
stop
this
charade,
which
is
yet
another
example
of
the
DC
ruling
class
playing
fast
and
loose
with
the
law.
The
bill
was
attached
to
the
government
funding
bill
of
September
30
(along
with
a
delay
in
the
ObamaCare
individual
mandate
tax).
It
passed
on
the
House
by
a
vote
of
228-201,
but
was,
unfortunately,
defeated
in
the
Senate.
6.
If
You
Like
Your
Plan,
You
Can
Keep
it
Act.
In
response
to
the
mass
cancellation
of
insurance
policies
due
to
the
mandates
contained
in
the
Obama
health
law,
I
joined
with
Senator
Ron
Johnson
(R-WI)
to
write
a
bill
that
would
provide
grandfather
protection
to
all
existing
health
insurance
policies.
Defenders
of
the
cancellations
claimed
that
the
canceled
policies
were
&#8220;inferior&#8221;
to
those
offered
on
the
ObamaCare
exchanges,
but
if
this
is
the
case
then
policyholders
will
voluntarily
choose
those
exchange
plans;
they
should
not
need
to
be
coerced
under
penalty
of
law
to
purchase
such
plans.
The
House
passed
a
more
limited
version
of
this
bill
on
November
15,
2013
by
a
vote
of
261-157.
Not
surprisingly,
the
Senate
took
no
action
on
the
measure.
7.
Resolution
of
Disapproval
re:
the
President&#8217;s
Failure
to
Take
Care
that
the
Laws
be
Faithfully
Executed
and
re:
the
Usurpation
of
Legislative
Authority.
America&#8217;s
constitutional
structure
is
fairly
easy
to
understand:
we
have
a
legislative
body
(Congress)
with
the
authority
to
make
laws,
an
executive
(the
President)
charged
with
the
duty
to
enforce
the
laws,
and
a
judicial
branch
(the
Supreme
Court
and
inferior
federal
courts)
that
is
required
to
adjudicate
cases
and
controversies
and,
thus,
to
interpret
the
laws.
The
current
incumbent
has
asserted
the
authority
to
re-write
key
provisions
of
federal
statutes
(i.e.,
changing
the
effective
date
for
the
employer
mandate
in
ObamaCare),
to
grant
waivers
regarding
statutory
mandates
to
politically-connected
entities
(i.e.,
the
waivers
granted
to
various
unions
re:
the
law
health
care
law)
and
to
suspend
the
application
of
laws
(i.e.,
allowing
the
offering
of
policies
that
conflict
with
his
own
health
care
law
by
refusing
to
enforce
the
applicable
provisions.)
Because
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
proper
functioning
of
constitutional
government,
I
drafted
a
resolution
in
which
the
House
formally
disapproves
of
the
President&#8217;s
failure
to
&#8220;take
Care
that
the
Laws
be
faithfully
executed&#8221;
as
required
by
the
Constitution;
disapproves
of
the
President's
usurpation
of
the
legislative
power
of
Congress
through
the
rewriting
of
key
provisions
of
the
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act;
and
re-affirms
that
the
preservation
of
the
Constitution&#8217;s
separation
of
powers
is
essential
for
the
protection
of
individual
liberty
and
the
maintenance
of
the
rule
of
law.
I
have
over
50
cosponsors
for
this
resolution
and
am
hoping
to
get
the
resolution
a
vote
before
the
House
in
2014.
The
next
newsletter
will
review
some
of
the
important
measures
considered
by
the
House.
I
will
also
include
some
of
the
initiatives
for
which
I
was
a
cosponsor.
Merry
Christmas!
Congressman
Ron
DeSantis
