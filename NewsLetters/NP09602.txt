Dear Friend,
Every student, regardless of where they
live, deserves access to a quality
education. Ensuring that the next
generation has the opportunity to learn the
skills necessary to succeed is the America
our Founders envisioned, and it is also the
key to a healthy economy.
Charter schools play an integral role in
our nations educational system and
our effort to promote school choice. Nearly
6,500 charter schools exist in the United
States, just 6 percent of all public
schools. They are in 42 states, including
Ohio and Washington, D.C. Charter schools
provide Americas young students with
an opportunity to escape underperforming
schools and empower parents to play a more
active role in their childrens
education. They pave the way for teachers
to implement innovative methods and
encourage competition at the state and
local levels.
Most important, charter schools continue
to get results and their students are
excelling. More than one quarter of the
Newsweek/US News &amp; World Reports
Best High Schools in America are charters.
Enrollment has doubled in the past six
years, yet nearly one million students are
currently on charter school wait lists due
to lack of enrollment slots.
In Northeast Ohio, we have seen
firsthand the successes of Breakthrough
Schools, the highest-performing network of
free, public charter schools in Ohio.
Breakthrough Charter Schools is a
nationally recognized network of schools
that was formed in 2010 by three of the
highest-performing public charter schools
in Cleveland. Their vision is to further
Greater Clevelands transformation by
providing distinctive school options for no
fewer than 6,000 children in 19 schools by
2020. Currently, they have nine schools
serving more than 2,500 students throughout
Cleveland. On Wednesday, I had the
opportunity to visit the Preps Woodland
Hills Campus in Cleveland, Ohio and learned
more about its mission, its faculty, and
its students. I was thoroughly impressed
and I look forward to watching Breakthrough
Schools build upon its successes.
This past week, during National Charter
School Week, the House of Representatives
passed the Success and Opportunity Through
Charter Schools Act. This legislation
strengthens the charter school program and
allows successful charter school models to
be replicated nationwide. It passed the
House with broad bipartisan support, and I
was proud to vote in favor of a bill that
will allow successful schools, like
Breakthrough Schools in Cleveland, the
opportunity to grow and provide an
excellent education to todays young
students.
It is important that we remove barriers
to charter school growth and give
hardworking families
regardless of
their income or where they live - more
options when it comes to their
childrens school. I am hopeful that
the Senate and the President will act
swiftly on this legislation, which is
essential to enabling charters to serve
more students throughout the country and
ensuring that the next generation is
prepared to enter the workforce and keep
America competitive.
Very impressed by all of the
students, faculty, and administrators I
met at Breakthrough Schools Preps
