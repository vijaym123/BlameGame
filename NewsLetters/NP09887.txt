15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Happy Mother's Day to all moms, whether your children are grown with little ones of their own, or whether this is your first Mother's Day as a mom. We are so thankful for you and the roles you play in our lives and in shaping the next generation.
Let us not let a day go by when we don't thank you for all that you do for us.
Dennis A. Ross
Congressman for Florida's 15th District
