Dear Friend,
When the American people learned the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeted
political groups for extra scrutiny,
shockwaves were sent across the country.
Not only do these actions represent an
arrogant abuse of power, but they also
violated the publics trust.
Political targeting is not a Republican
or Democrat issue. It is absolutely
unacceptable for a government official to
consider the political leanings of any
taxpayer when conducting official business.
If it is determined that a federal employee
did in fact engage in targeting, they
should be relieved of their duties. It is
that simple.
In 1998, Congress enacted the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act. This
legislation allows for the immediate
termination of IRS employees who engage in
the so-called 10 Deadly Sins
against taxpayers. Unfortunately, while the
legislation covers many offenses it did not
include political targeting. I am confident
its omission was simply an oversight.
That is why I introduced the Prevent
Targeting at the IRS Act. This legislation
authorizes the IRS to terminate employees
who target individuals based on their
political beliefs by adding political
targeting to the list of fireable offenses,
or 10 Deadly Sins, at the IRS.
Unfortunately, failure of leadership and
lack of accountability at the IRS remains.
Just last week, the Treasury Inspector
General for Tax Administration revealed the
IRS rehiredhundreds of employees with
records of misconduct or performance
issues. This includes employees with a
history of unpaid taxes, unauthorized
access to taxpayer information,
falsification of official forms, and
unfiled tax returns. This is a government
agency that expects all hardworking
Americans to file their tax returns on
time, yet it employs those who dont
file returns at all? The IRS is not above
the law, and its time Congress
reminds them of it.
Though it has been nearly two years
since we first learned of the initial
abuses at the IRS, the American
peoples lack of trust in the federal
agency remains
and rightly so. The
Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act is
commonsense legislation that brings the
accountability the American people expect
and deserve, and I expect it to move
swiftly through the legislative
process.
