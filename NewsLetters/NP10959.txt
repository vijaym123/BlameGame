David,
For decades, I've been focused on consumer protection. As Connecticut's Attorney General, I fought marketing by big tobacco that illegally targeted children, financial scams that preyed on seniors, and other unconscionable wrongdoing.
I believe that part of my job as your Senator is to protect you, the consumer, from the same kinds of threats and dangers. For at least a decade, General Motors knew about a major, lethal defect in certain models of their cars and failed to fix it or even properly disclose it to their customers. At least 13 Americans have died and 31 have been injured in accidents linked to the faulty ignition switches in these cars. The ignition switch defect causes cars to shut down, resulting in loss of steering, brakes, and airbag functions.
Unfortunately, GM has failed to adequately warn customers about the real risk of driving these models, and has not acted to compensate victims of these accidents. Senator Ed Markey and I are working together to push legislation that will make auto companies more accountable for reporting defects and to help prevent tragedies in the future. We made this video in the hope that General Motors will hear our pleas to help take these cars off the road.
Watch our video, and sign the petition to tell GM we want affected cars removed from the roads:
We need your help in making sure this gets shared far and wide. Forward this email to your friends and make sure they hear our message as well. Hopefully you, or no one you know, is driving one of these cars.
Sign the petition today:
