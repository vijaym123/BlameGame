Congressional Report -- Week of June 16-20: Celebrating the San
Antonio Spurs - 2014 NBA Champions!!
Hello Friend,
This was a great week. It began with a phenomenal victory - it is
ending with some special family time. In between, I spent the week
working in Washington, attending meetings and briefings, meeting
constituents and casting votes on behalf of the residents of the 23rd
District of Texas. On Friday, I headed to San Antonio. Today, I'm
spending some quality family time with Mara Elena and Nicols before
attending several meetings on Sunday. I'll head back to Washington on
Monday for another week of work in our nation's capital. It never ends,
but I love it.
Field staff was also busy during week. Field Representatives visited
fort Stockton, City of Pecos, Presidio, Valentine, Fort Davis, Del Rio,
Eagle Pass, Crystal City and San Antonio.

Recognizing San Antonio Spurs as 2014 NBA Champions on House Floor
It was indescribably cool to watch perfect basketball being played.
And, it's also pretty cool to represent a few of the best basketball
players in America. Throughout their last games, they displayed grace,
teamwork, humility, resiliency, strength and unity. Who can't help but
admire that?
So on Tuesday, our first day back in session, I took to the House floor
to honor the San Antonio Spurs on winning the 2014 NBA Championship and
completing the Drive for Five.
Everywhere I've been over the last few weeks - from east to west - the
Spurs were a topic of conversation. I heard them mentioned in
graduation speeches, at the post office, in stores, at gas stations -
even the Clerk of the US House of Representatives told me she was a
Spurs fan and had watched each of their games.
Congress can learn a lot from the Spurs. They come from many places and
several countries. Yet, they played as one team. They passed the ball
around and didn't care who got the credit so long as the job was done.
They earned respect by working hard. They never gave up. And, in the
end, they achieved success.
Congratulations to each and every member of the Spurs, their families,
their coaches, their staff, their owners - and congratulations to each
and every one of their fans.

Interactive Telephone Town Hall Meeting with Veterans
On Tuesday evening, I also hosted a telephone town hall meeting with
veterans and constituents from across the 23rd District of Texas. The
telephone town hall platform is another way that I maximize my
interaction with constituents in one of the biggest congressional
districts in the country.
The telephone town hall meeting let me speak to and answer questions
from veterans and their family members from San Antonio to El Paso and
parts in between. It let me learn firsthand how the VA wait list issue
has impacted the veterans in our region and now allows me to focus on
finding area-specific solutions. I got to give an update to several
thousand people - all at once - and all while they remained in the
comfort of their own homes.
While I talked about my ongoing work to address the critical issues at
the VA, local staff held "house meetings" in different places where
veterans joined the telephone town hall as a group to listen and asked
questions or gave comments to the staff as well. I was honored that the
radio station in Alpine - whose former owner gave me a job in college
and later talked me into running for the Legislature - carried the
entire telephone town hall live on radio.

offices.
$795,133 Grant for Pecos County Head Start
The Pecos County Community Action Agency received a federal grant of
$795,133. The funds will help operate the local Head Start program.
This grant is special to me. My mom is from Pecos County. She was born
in Fort Stockton in 1928. I've heard a lot about the educational
challenges she faced. Though things are much different and much
improved, I always want to be sure that kids living there today - and
kids throughout the 23rd District - have as many or more opportunities
as kids living anywhere else in the country.
Head Start is critical in getting young kids ready for elementary
school. As a dad, I know how important it is to give our kids a head
start on their education. Kids in Fort Stockton don't just compete with
neighboring communities like Pecos, Monahans or Kermit anymore. They
will eventually compete globally for jobs because we now live in a
global economy. The same is true for kids anywhere in the district.
Head Start funds serve our kids well. I'll always be on the lookout for
ways to give our kids more opportunities.

.
$782,316 Grant for Texas Biomedical Research Institute
Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio also received a
federal grant of $782,316. The project is funded by the National Eye
Institute and the National Institute of Health and is called "Genetic
Epidemiology of Ocular Health and Disease." Texas Biomed will be
conducting research to identify genetic factors that influence eye
health and disease, such as nearsightedness and cataracts.
Like many of us, my eyesight has gotten poorer over time. That's
natural, I think. But I know others in the 23rd District of Texas whose
eyesight has deteriorated because of specific genetic conditions.
Hopefully, one day we can do something about that. When I get a chance
to support medical research that will help improve people's lives, I
always do it.
In addition, it's also important to support folks in health care fields
who work and conduct research in 23rd District of Texas. It's great to
see their work having a global impact and improving the lives of many -
with the potential to improve even more. This particular study also
helps create jobs in health care and research in San Antonio. For more
on this grant, click here
.
Lastly, know I am tremendously grateful to you for allowing me to be
your representative and your voice in the U.S. House of
Representatives. It is a huge privilege and a responsibility I take
seriously. If I can help you with a federal agency or issue, please
call on any of our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed
below. I'll say it again: I've never been a big fan of politics -
helping people is my favorite part of the job - so please put us to
work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

of
the
residents

On
Friday,
I
headed

Interactive
Telephone
Town
Hall
Meeting
with
Veterans On
Tuesday
evening,
I
also
hosted
a
telephone
town
hall
meeting
with
veterans
and
constituents
from
across
the
23rd
District
of
Texas.
The
telephone
town
hall
platform
is
another
way
that
I
maximize
my
interaction
with
constituents
in
one
of
the
biggest
congressional
districts
in
the
country.
The
telephone
town
hall
meeting
let
me
speak
to
and
answer
questions
from
veterans
and
their
family
members
from
San
Antonio
to
El
Paso
and
parts
in
between.
It
let
me
learn
firsthand
how
the
VA
wait
list
issue
has
impacted
the
veterans
in
our
region
and
now
allows
me
to
focus
on
finding
area-specific
solutions.
I
got
to
give
an
update
to
several
thousand
people
&#8211;
all
at
once
&#8211;
and
all
while
they
remained
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes.
While
I
talked
about
my
ongoing
work
to
address
the
critical
issues
at
the
VA,
local
staff
held
&#8220;house
meetings&#8221;
in
different
places
where
veterans
joined
the
telephone
town
hall
as
a
group
to
listen
and
asked
questions
or
gave
comments
to
the
staff
as
well.
I
was
honored
that
the
radio
station
in
Alpine
-
whose
former
owner
gave
me
a
job
in
college
and
later
talked
me
into
running
for
the
Legislature
-
carried
the
entire
telephone
town
hall
live
on
radio.

Lions
Clubs
International
in
Del

as
they
install
new
offices. $795,133
Grant
for
Pecos
County
Head
Start The
Pecos
County
Community
Action
Agency
received
a
federal
grant
of
$795,133.
The
funds
will
help
operate
the
local
Head
Start
program.
This
grant is
special
to
me.
My
mom
is
from
Pecos
County.
She
was
born
in
Fort
Stockton
in
1928.
I've
heard
a
lot
about
the
educational
challenges
she
faced.
Though
things
are
much
different
and
much
improved,
I
always
want
to
be
sure
that
kids
living
there
today
-
and
kids
throughout
the
23rd
District
-
have
as
many
or
more
opportunities
as
kids
living
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
Head
Start
is
critical
in
getting
young
kids
ready
for
elementary
school.
As
a
dad,
I
know
how
important
it
is
to
give
our
kids
a
head
start
on
their
education.
Kids
in
Fort
Stockton
don't
just
compete
with
neighboring
communities
like
Pecos,
Monahans
or
Kermit
anymore.
They
will
eventually
compete
globally
for
jobs
because
we
now
live
in
a
global
economy.
The
same
is
true
for
kids
anywhere
in
the
district.
Head
Start
funds
serve
our
kids
well.
I'll
always
be
on
the
lookout
for
ways
to
give
our
kids
more
opportunities.

$782,316
Grant
for
Texas
Biomedical
Research
Institute Texas
Biomedical
Research
Institute
in
San
Antonio
also
received
a
federal
grant
of
$782,316.
The
project
is
funded
by
the
National
Eye
Institute
and
the
National
Institute
of
Health
and
is
called
&#8220;Genetic
Epidemiology

Ocular
Health
and
Disease.&#8221;
Texas
Biomed
will
be
conducting
research
to
identify
genetic
factors
that
influence
eye
health
and
disease,
such
as
nearsightedness
and
cataracts.
Like
many
of
us,
my
eyesight
has
gotten
poorer
over
time.
That's
natural,
I
think.
But
I
know
others
in
the
23rd
District
of
Texas whose
eyesight
has
deteriorated
because
of
specific
genetic
conditions.
Hopefully,
one
day
we
can
do
something
about
that.
When
I
get
a
chance
to
support
medical
research
that
will
help
improve
people's
lives,
I
always
do
it.
In
addition,
it's
also
important
to
support
folks
in
health
care
fields
who
work
and
conduct
research
in
23rd
District
of
Texas.
It's
great
to
see
their
work
having
a
global
impact
and
improving
the
lives
of
many
&#8211;
with
the
potential
to
improve
even
more.
This
particular
study
also
helps
create
jobs
in
health
care
and
research
in
San
Antonio.
