Dear Friends,
For more than half a century, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has led space exploration in the world. The scientists, engineers and astronauts have literally taken us boldly where no one had gone before.
In Northern Ohio, NASA maintains a robust presence with the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and the Plum Brook Station in Sandusky while NASA related research is conducted at the University of Toledo and other Ohio institutions.
Because of the importance of NASA to our regional economy, I was pleased to hear Administrator Charles Bolden announce, &ldquo;The future of Glenn is bright,&rdquo; during our recent tour of the facility.
For more information about Glenn Research Center, click

The workers at Glenn Research Center and Plum Brook have a clear mission: to help advance exploration of our solar system and maintain America&rsquo;s global leadership in aeronautics.
I am particularly interested in working with the leadership at Glenn to take the center&rsquo;s research into the community, helping local communities and businesses meet today&rsquo;s technological challenges.
I am also interested in your thoughts about America&rsquo;s role in space exploration
and the role of NASA Glenn in our community.

U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
