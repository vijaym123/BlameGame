House Plan
to Balance the Budget, Grow the Economy,
and Protect Hardworking Taxpayers
Dear Friend,
Just as we have done each of the last
four years, the House of Representatives
approved an annual budget focused on
setting a course for our nation and its
future. The Path to Prosperity budget puts
us on a path to fiscal sustainability so we
can preserve the promise of this great
country for our children and
grandchildren.
While the Senate may not agree with the
necessity of passing an annual budget, a
budget is a framework that makes important
choices and sets priorities needed to
manage our limited resources in the best
interests of our great country. Unlike the
Presidents budget, which never
balances, the Path to Prosperity budget
plan balances in ten years and is the
Houses vision of a brighter tomorrow
for this generation and future
generations.
This budget reduces total spending by
$5.1 trillion over the course of the next
decade by tackling the drivers of our
astounding national debt of $17 trillion.
We reject the status quo of trillions in
debt, an anemic economic recovery, and a
federal budget that never balances and
continues to run large annual deficits. Our
balanced budget is focused on creating more
jobs and better opportunities for all
Americans. It protects and strengthens
Medicare and Social Security for seniors
and future recipients to ensure a secure
retirement. Our balanced budget puts money
back into Americans pockets by
reforming our tax code to make it fairer
and simpler while cutting out special
interest tax breaks. It cuts unnecessary
red tape and gives small businesses the
certainty to expand and create jobs in
their communities. Our balanced budget
establishes a true American energy plan
that will lower fuel costs, increase
domestic energy production, and create jobs
in Virginia and beyond.
This budget is a pro-growth document to
strengthen our nation and reverse the
Presidents policies that have put us
on a path to a bankrupt federal government.
Virginians and Americans deserve a budget
that will guarantee a brighter future for
our nation, and I am proud to support the
Path to Prosperity budget that ensures
it.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues toward a fiscally
sustainable path for our great nation, and
it is my sincere hope that the President
and the Senate will join the House in this
important goal.
