Dear Friend,
Today we are blessed to celebrate the birth of the United States of America and the unprecedented expansion of liberty, freedom and democracy that came with it.
Its incredible to think that a mere 238 years ago, the idea of a government chosen by the people that leaves the people free to determine their own paths through life simply did not exist. Throughout the history of the world, people have lived under the oppression of monarchies that ruled by no mandate other than might. While many countries have since attained liberty in varying degrees, without the commitment and bold ideas of fifty-six American revolutionaries in 1776 the world would be a very different place today.
I could not be prouder to be an American and to share this great day with the residents of New Jerseys Fifth District. It is an honor to serve you in Congress, and I am humbled to defend the United States Constitution and the vision of the Founding Fathers that so many brave Americans have fought and died for.
May we never lose sight of our responsibility to preserve the blessings of liberty for every future generation. I wish you and your family a very happy Independence Day!
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
