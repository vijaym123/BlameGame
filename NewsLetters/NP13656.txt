A Firm Step Forward
The Bipartisan Budget Act reduces the deficit and doesn't raise taxes -
that's a start.
By Paul Ryan
Yesterday, Senator Patty Murray and I introduced the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2013. It's the first budget agreement of its kind since 1986,
and I'm proud to support it. This bill will reduce the deficit by $23
billion. It won't raise taxes. And it will cut spending in a smarter
way. It doesn't go as far as I'd like. But it's a firm step in the
right direction.
First, let's remember how we got here: In 2011, President Obama signed
into law the Budget Control Act. The law tasked a twelve-member
"supercommittee" with cutting at least $1.2 trillion from the federal
deficit. And to spur them to action, the law essentially made a threat:
If the committee couldn't come to an agreement, the law would order
arbitrary, across-the-board cuts - known as the sequester - to get
those savings. It would make half of the cuts in defense programs and
the other half in domestic programs. In other words, the alternative to
an agreement would be so painful that the supercommittee would just
have to reach one.
Unfortunately, the committee couldn't come to an agreement. And this
year, the sequester took effect. Now, House Republicans wanted to keep
these savings. In fact, we wanted to save more. But we didn't think our
troops should bear the brunt of these cuts. The Defense Department
warned it would have to shrink our armed forces and make serious cuts
to training, readiness, and modernization. Members of both parties
quickly realized there was a better way to cut spending.
When Senator Murray and I started these negotiations, we agreed on some
ground rules. We knew if we tried to force each other to violate one of
our core principles, we'd never get anywhere. I wasn't going to raise
taxes. She wasn't going to change major entitlements.
Instead, we looked for common ground. There was some overlap between
the budget she proposed in the Senate and the budget I proposed in the
House. We knew we wouldn't resolve all our differences. So we found
some commonsense ideas both parties could support.
Here's what we came up with: The Bipartisan Budget Act
will provide $63 billion in
sequester relief - split evenly between defense programs and other
domestic priorities - in exchange for $85 billion in savings elsewhere
in the budget. In other words, this bill will reduce the deficit by an
additional $23 billion, without raising taxes. And most important, it
will cut spending in a smarter way.
How do we cut spending? First, we eliminate waste. We stop paying
Medicaid bills that dead-beat dads should cover. That alone is a $1.4
billion cut. We stop sending unemployment checks to criminals. And we
stop sending government checks to dead people. There's no reason to
tolerate fraud.
Second, we cut corporate welfare. For instance, we repeal a government
research program for private energy companies. A profitable industry
shouldn't rely on taxpayers to pay for its research.
Third, we make real reforms to the real problem: autopilot spending.
The federal government makes trillions of dollars in empty promises to
retirees. And these empty promises don't only drive the national debt;
they threaten these retirees' security. We don't solve all these
problems, but we make a good start: We make sensible reforms to
federal-employee and military-retirement programs.
We ask new federal employees to contribute a little bit more to their
retirement, so taxpayers don't have to pick up the full tab. And for
younger military retirees, we trim their cost-of-living adjustments
just a bit. It's a modest reform for working-age military retirees,
many of whom have second careers after leaving the armed forces.
Finally, we don't think taxpayers should have to bail out private
companies' pension benefits. So we ask these companies to cover more of
the cost of guaranteeing their benefits. That will protect taxpayers
and save $7.9 billion.
These are real cuts that will become law immediately. If we pass this
bill, we'll eliminate waste - right now. We'll cut corporate welfare -
right now. And new government employees will start paying a fairer
share. These savings will build up over time. But they will be even
greater than what we'd save by doing nothing. That's why this is a good
deal.
We haven't squandered the gains from the Budget Control Act. We build
on them. Our agreement preserves 92 percent of the sequester cuts -
even though Democrats wanted none of them. We don't get rid of this
fiscal discipline - we get more and do so in a smarter way.
Now, I'll be the first to admit that this bill doesn't solve the
problem. I've passed three budgets in the House, all three of which
would have fully paid off our debt without raising taxes. This bill
doesn't go nearly far enough. But in divided government, you don't get
everything you want. You have to work with the other side. And when you
get the chance to take a step forward - however small - you take it.
Here's what we've accomplished: We've cut spending in a smarter way.
And we've made it clear: Tax hikes aren't an option. We've said budget
talks should be about how Washington can live within its means, not how
families should pay more. For conservatives, this agreement shows we
can make Washington work - and on our own terms. It's not perfect. But
it's a start. And I ask all my colleagues in the House to support it.

A
Firm
Step
Forward
The
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
reduces
the
deficit
and
doesn&#8217;t
raise
taxes
&#8212;
that&#8217;s
a
start.
By
Paul
Ryan
Yesterday,
Senator
Patty
Murray
and
I
introduced
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013.
It&#8217;s
the
first
budget
agreement
of
its
kind
since
1986,
and
I&#8217;m
proud
to
support
it.
This
bill
will
reduce
the
deficit
by
$23
billion.
It
won&#8217;t
raise
taxes.
And
it
will
cut
spending
in
a
smarter
way.
It
doesn&#8217;t
go
as
far
as
I&#8217;d
like.
But
it&#8217;s
a
firm
step
in
the
right
direction.
First,
let&#8217;s
remember
how
we
got
here:
In
2011,
President
Obama
signed
into
law
the
Budget
Control
Act.
The
law
tasked
a
twelve-member
&#8220;supercommittee&#8221;
with
cutting
at
least
$1.2
trillion
from
the
federal
deficit.
And
to
spur
them
to
action,
the
law
essentially
made
a
threat:
If
the
committee
couldn&#8217;t
come
to
an
agreement,
the
law
would
order
arbitrary,
across-the-board
cuts
&#8212;
known
as
the
sequester
&#8212;
to
get
those
savings.
It
would
make
half
of
the
cuts
in
defense
programs
and
the
other
half
in
domestic
programs.
In
other
words,
the
alternative
to
an
agreement
would
be
so
painful
that
the
supercommittee
would
just
have
to
reach
one.
Unfortunately,
the
committee
couldn&#8217;t
come
to
an
agreement.
And
this
year,
the
sequester
took
effect.
Now,
House
Republicans
wanted
to
keep
these
savings.
In
fact,
we
wanted
to
save
more.
But
we
didn&#8217;t
think
our
troops
should
bear
the
brunt
of
these
cuts.
The
Defense
Department
warned
it
would
have
to
shrink
our
armed
forces
and
make
serious
cuts
to
training,
readiness,
and
modernization.
Members
of
both
parties
quickly
realized
there
was
a
better
way
to
cut
spending.
When
Senator
Murray
and
I
started
these
negotiations,
we
agreed
on
some
ground
rules.
We
knew
if
we
tried
to
force
each
other
to
violate
one
of
our
core
principles,
we&#8217;d
never
get
anywhere.
I
wasn&#8217;t
going
to
raise
taxes.
She
wasn&#8217;t
going
to
change
major
entitlements.
Instead,
we
looked
for
common
ground.
There
was
some
overlap
between
the
budget
she
proposed
in
the
Senate
and
the
budget
I
proposed
in
the
House.
We
knew
we
wouldn&#8217;t
resolve
all
our
differences.
So
we
found
some
commonsense
ideas
both
parties
could
support.
Here&#8217;s
what
we
came
up
with:
The
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
will
provide
$63
billion
in
sequester
relief
&#8212;
split
evenly
between
defense
programs
and
other
domestic
priorities
&#8212;
in
exchange
for
$85
billion
in
savings
elsewhere
in
the
budget.
In
other
words,
this
bill
will
reduce
the
deficit
by
an
additional
$23
billion,
without
raising
taxes.
And
most
important,
it
will
cut
spending
in
a
smarter
way.
How
do
we
cut
spending?
First,
we
eliminate
waste.
We
stop
paying
Medicaid
bills
that
dead-beat
dads
should
cover.
That
alone
is
a
$1.4
billion
cut.
We
stop
sending
unemployment
checks
to
criminals.
And
we
stop
sending
government
checks
to
dead
people.
There&#8217;s
no
reason
to
tolerate
fraud.
Second,
we
cut
corporate
welfare.
For
instance,
we
repeal
a
government
research
program
for
private
energy
companies.
A
profitable
industry
shouldn&#8217;t
rely
on
taxpayers
to
pay
for
its
research.
Third,
we
make
real
reforms
to
the
real
problem:
autopilot
spending.
The
federal
government
makes
trillions
of
dollars
in
empty
promises
to
retirees.
And
these
empty
promises
don&#8217;t
only
drive
the
national
debt;
they
threaten
these
retirees&#8217;
security.
We
don&#8217;t
solve
all
these
problems,
but
we
make
a
good
start:
We
make
sensible
reforms
to
federal-employee
and
military-retirement
programs.
We
ask
new
federal
employees
to
contribute
a
little
bit
more
to
their
retirement,
so
taxpayers
don&#8217;t
have
to
pick
up
the
full
tab.
And
for
younger
military
retirees,
we
trim
their
cost-of-living
adjustments
just
a
bit.
It&#8217;s
a
modest
reform
for
working-age
military
retirees,
many
of
whom
have
second
careers
after
leaving
the
armed
forces.
Finally,
we
don&#8217;t
think
taxpayers
should
have
to
bail
out
private
companies&#8217;
pension
benefits.
So
we
ask
these
companies
to
cover
more
of
the
cost
of
guaranteeing
their
benefits.
That
will
protect
taxpayers
and
save
$7.9
billion.
These
are
real
cuts
that
will
become
law
immediately.
If
we
pass
this
bill,
we&#8217;ll
eliminate
waste
&#8212;
right
now.
We&#8217;ll
cut
corporate
welfare
&#8212;
right
now.
And
new
government
employees
will
start
paying
a
fairer
share.
These
savings
will
build
up
over
time.
But
they
will
be
even
greater
than
what
we&#8217;d
save
by
doing
nothing.
That&#8217;s
why
this
is
a
good
deal.
We
haven&#8217;t
squandered
the
gains
from
the
Budget
Control
Act.
We
build
on
them.
Our
agreement
preserves
92
percent
of
the
sequester
cuts
&#8212;
even
though
Democrats
wanted
none
of
them.
We
don&#8217;t
get
rid
of
this
fiscal
discipline
&#8212;
we
get
more
and
do
so
in
a
smarter
way.
Now,
I&#8217;ll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
this
bill
doesn&#8217;t
solve
the
problem.
I&#8217;ve
passed
three
budgets
in
the
House,
all
three
of
which
would
have
fully
paid
off
our
debt
without
raising
taxes.
This
bill
doesn&#8217;t
go
nearly
far
enough.
But
in
divided
government,
you
don&#8217;t
get
everything
you
want.
You
have
to
work
with
the
other
side.
And
when
you
get
the
chance
to
take
a
step
forward
&#8212;
however
small
&#8212;
you
take
it.
Here&#8217;s
what
we&#8217;ve
accomplished:
We&#8217;ve
cut
spending
in
a
smarter
way.
And
we&#8217;ve
made
it
clear:
Tax
hikes
aren&#8217;t
an
option.
We&#8217;ve
said
budget
talks
should
be
about
how
Washington
can
live
within
its
means,
not
how
families
should
pay
more.
For
conservatives,
this
agreement
shows
we
can
make
Washington
work
&#8212;
and
on
our
own
terms.
It&#8217;s
not
perfect.
But
it&#8217;s
a
start.
And
I
ask
all
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
support
it.
