Getting Answers on the Secret Service's Failures
I traveled back to
Washington, DC on Tuesday to attend a special Oversight and Government
Reform Committee hearing on the Secret Service's recent security
failures. A couple weeks back, an armed man scaled the White House fence,
darted across the lawn, and made it all the way into the East Room of the
White House before being apprehended. This is wholly unacceptable.
While I often may not agree with President Obama's policy positions, I
care tremendously about ensuring that he and the First Family are safe.
I attended a classified briefing on the security breach and believe
that there is an immediate need for top-down reform of the agency
tasked with one of the most important jobs in the
country.

Hearing
on Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi
This
week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a special hearing on
US Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who has been jailed in Mexico since
earlier this year. There has been mass public outcry and pushes from
Members of Congress to have him released. Retied Navy Lietenant
Commander and television personality Montel Williams testified on
Tahmooressi' behalf, explaining the struggles of those who battle Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD). It's been too long. It's time to bring back
our Marine, who served his country honorably. I'll continue to do all
that I can to help ensure his release.
