Congressman Aderholt talks to students on April 8, 2015 at
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
Dear Friend,
Here is a
quick update with the latest in what is happening in Washington and
around Alabama's 4th District. As always, please let me know whenever I can
be of assistance.
Keep in touch
and
remember to follow me on
Twitter
and
Facebook . Also, for updated information check out my
virtual office
and encourage your friends and family to sign-up

Sincerely,

Aderholt
Member of
Congress
Repealing the Death
Tax
I was pleased to vote this month to repeal the death tax. It is
another burden that is felt particularly by family farms and small
businesses. At a difficult time when families are dealing with the loss of a
loved one, the last thing they need is Uncle Sam knocking at the door
with his hand out, taking advantage of a familys
grief.
I hope now that the Senate will also pass this legislation and that
the President will sign it into law. I will keep you updated on this
bills progress.
Visitors to Washington
The month of April is also a busy time for
people from Alabama and the 4th District to visit Washington. We have
had numerous schools groups and families on vacation to come tour the
Capitol. There have also been a large number of chamber of commerce
members from across Alabama as well.
Whether its a small or
large group, we always look forward to seeing the friendly faces from
Alabama that visit our office and tour the Capitol. With summer fast
approaching, and if you plan to be in Washington, please call our office
or visit our website to schedule a tour for you and your family or
your group.

A Busy Month for Appropriations
April has been a very
busy month in Washington, D.C. I continue to serve as Chairman of the
House Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, where our subcommittee
conducted over 10 hearings and briefings over the past couple of months.
Those of us who serve on this subcommittee are tasked with formulating
a budget for the Federal Departments under the Department of
Agriculture. Therefore, we have had numerous heads of departments testifying
before our committee about their budget needs for 2016. Unfortunately,
many of them have come before us with unrealistic expectations for
funding. In an environment where we are currently 18 trillion dollars in
debt, our budgets must be kept as lean as possible, being sure to cut
bureaucracy in Washington while maintaining important services in the
states.

and proposed Tricare changes for our military
retirees.
UPDATE: Secure Rural Schools
In last
months newsletter I told you about efforts to renew the Secure Rural
Schools program. Back when lands were taken by the federal government to
create national forests like Bankhead National Forest in Winston and
Lawrence counties, a promise was made to the local communities to
replace the canceled property taxes (and other revenue) that previously paid
for community priorities, like roads and
schools.
However, the funding expired last year. Teaming up with other Members
from Utah and other western states, we were able to restore the
funding. I am proud to say that the fundings renewal passed in the House,
then in the Senate, and was signed into law by the President on April
16, 2015.
