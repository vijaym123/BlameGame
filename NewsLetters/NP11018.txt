Dear David,
These days, it seems like everything in Congress is a partisan fight. And you don't see homestate Senators from different parties joining together very often. That's why I was thrilled last week to team up with my friend and colleague Senator Roy Blunt to demonstrate that America's security, and Missouri's role in our national defense, isn't a Democratic or Republican issue.
Missouri is home to world-class military installations that play a vital role in keeping our country safe at a bargain cost for taxpayers. Serving on the Armed Services Committee has allowed me to fight for the needs of our military community and tout our state's leadership role - and when Senator Blunt joined the committee, it became an even more bipartisan effort.
Last week, Senator Blunt and I
teamed-up to meet with leaders
at the Missouri Air National Guard Base in St. Joseph to talk about the impact of a recently proposed Pentagon budget. We wanted to send a signal to the community and the base that they have our strong support, and that we will advocate for this facility as one that is absolutely necessary to our national defense.
Our roundtable discussion allowed us the opportunity to meet with community leaders, as well as leadership from the 139th Airlift Wing. Their presentations and our discussion thoroughly highlighted the issues facing the 139th, the Advanced Airlift Tactical Training Center, and the surrounding community.
And this isn't the first time that Senator Blunt and I have worked together for Missouri's bases and surrounding communities. Last year, we jointly
urged the Air Force
to provide the 139th Airlift Wing with a C-130 simulator training facility that would save taxpayer dollars and enhance the AATTC's training capabilities. We also teamed up to
urge
the Air Force to bring additional C-130 aircraft to the 139th Airlift Wing, touting the base's personnel, expertise, and resources to house additional aircraft.
When base commander Colonel Ralph Schwader called last week's event "historic," it was a reminder that America's security isn't and shouldn't be a partisan issue.
All the best,
