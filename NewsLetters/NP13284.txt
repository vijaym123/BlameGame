Simplify the
Tax Code
Every occupation has its busy
season. For farmers, its during planting and harvesting. For
teachers, its the hustle and bustle of a new year. For amusement parks, its
the summer season. Its no different for tax accountants who are busy
studying up on the over 70,000 pages of tax rules and
regulations.
Ive never understood why we need a tax code that is so
complex you have to hire someone else just to understand it. We
desperately need tax reform to simplify a massive tax code. Hard-working
Americans spend too much money and time filling out government forms just to
pay their taxes.
The best way to reform the tax code is
not to nibble around the edges. We should rip up the old code and
start over with a blank piece of paper. There is no shortage of ideas on
how to create a better code. Currently, there are bills in Congress for
a Fair Tax and a Flat Tax. There are other ideas too that deserve a
look.
I believe Congress should flatten the tax code by
ending special deductions. This simplification would also broaden the
tax base to include everyone- even the underground economy that escapes
taxation today. This would help lower the tax burden while giving the
government enough money to operate.
What is clear is that
almost no one thinks the code we have now makes sense. We need a tax
code that is simple, fair and promotes economic growth. This is a
worthwhile goal we should continue to pursue in 2014.
