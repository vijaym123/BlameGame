LEGISLATION
May 24, 2015
Dear David,
For the first time in California history, Governor Brown issued an
executive order on April 1 st
requiring mandatory conservation
for all California residents, directing several state agencies to take
immediate action to conserve the states remaining urban water
supplies. On May 5 th , in accordance with the Governor's order,
the State Water Resources Control Board
adopted an
emergency regulation requiring an immediate 25 percent reduction in
overall urban water use statewide.
The conservation
standards for certain communities range between 4 percent and 36 percent, with
55 gallons as the target daily water use per person. Local agencies
are authorized to fine property owners up to $500 a day if they fail to
implement the water use prohibitions and restrictions, and water
agencies that violate cease and desist orders are subject to a civil
liability of up to $10,000 a day.
With these mandatory
restrictions on water use, the drought is changing each of our lifestyles. From
farmers and ranchers to those living suburban and urban areas, each
one of us is facing consequences of this prolonged and severe water
shortage. Please share your story with me belowhow has the drought
impacted you and your family?
