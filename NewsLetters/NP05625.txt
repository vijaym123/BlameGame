URGENT: All Gifts Today Now
Triple-Matched Today's ad buy deadline is the most critical of the election. This is our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
We just got a look at the latest national poll -- and we have some great news (finally!):
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW UP TWO -- 41%-39%
David, do you have any idea what this means? We can deliver a shocking defeat to Boehner in this election!!! But first, we have to close this budget gap.
This morning, Republicans launched their largest ad buy of the entire election -- $1O,371,656 just this week. We&rsquo;re trying to play catch-up -- but we&rsquo;re critically low on time. The ad buy deadline is in 5 hours.

Can you help us get to 2O,OOO donations to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action before midnight? UPDATE: All donations now
Triple-Matched
through midnight! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
It&rsquo;s great to be up (finally!) but we should be clear-eyed about this. The race for Congress is still at stake right now. Today&rsquo;s poll shows us up by 2 points, 41% to 39%. But after the beating we&rsquo;ve taken from the Republicans and the SuperPACs, we&rsquo;ll take good news wherever we can get it!
Now, it&rsquo;s up to us to take advantage of this opportunity. And that means falling short on tonight&rsquo;s deadline is NOT an option.
Please -- stop what you&rsquo;re doing, answer President Obama&rsquo;s request, and help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
We need 4 donors from 60659 by midnight to close the gap. http://action.dccc.org/midnight-deadline
