Cook Sponsors Bills to Protect Veterans' COLA
Congressman Cook has heard from many concerned constituents regarding
the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for veterans contained in the
Budget Act of 2013. Cook remains dedicated to keeping America's promise
to our veterans. He is an original cosponsor of two bills that ensure
that all veterans will continue to receive their full COLA. The first
measure, H.R. 3789, would eliminate any COLA reduction for veterans who
are medically retired, receiving Combat Related Special Compensation,
and/or Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments. The second
measure, H.R. 3790, would eliminate the COLA reduction for all military
retirees.
District Update
Yucca Loma Bridge Ground Breaking
On Friday January 10, the town of Apple Valley will break ground on the

transportation through Apple Valley and Victorville. The Town Council,
local community leaders, and others involved with the construction of
the bridge project are expected to be in attendance.
The groundbreaking will begin at 10 AM Friday, January 10, on Yucca
Loma Road just west of Apple Valley Road. For more information, please

Critical Habitat Designation Could Restrict Public Lands: Meetings
Scheduled
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is planning to hold two public
meetings on proposals to list and designate critical habitat for the
Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, the northern distinct population
segment of the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the Yosemite toad. With
over 90% of the land in Mono and Inyo counties already held by the
federal government, this proposal could further restrict public access
and economic development in these counties. The meetings will be held
in Bridgeport on Wednesday, January 8 from 1 to 3 PM and in Fresno on
Monday, January 13 from 1 to 3 PM. This is your chance to have your
voice heard.

Veterans' Corner
As the deadlines approach for applying to schools, veterans with
college-aged children should look into the College Tuition Fee Waiver
for Veterans' Dependents. The program offers children and dependents of
service-connected disabled or service-related deceased veterans a
waiver of state tuition and fees. It is applicable at any California
Community College, California State University, or University of
California campus. Benefits are awarded on an "academic year" basis and
are based on the student's income. Students are required to reapply
each year for continued benefits.
To obtain complete eligibility requirements and assistance in applying
for these valuable benefits, please contact your local County Veterans
Service Office
or your school's veterans office.
