Senator Reid: Legislation Supporting Troops A Waste of
Time.
The
Outrageous Statement of the
Week
probably belongs to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid
(NV) as he declared this week that considering the bipartisan defense
authorization bill in Congress is waste of time.
I find
this comment troubling.
It is a fact that our Constitution says
that the first duty of Congress is to provide for the common
defence.
To that end, my Appropriations Committee on Defense worked
this week to pass our FY 2016 Defense Appropriations bill in the full
Appropriations Committee.
The panel passed my
legislation which would give the President the funding he requested this
year, cuts Pentagon waste, pays our troops and cares for their families.
Yet to Senator Reid, doing all these things is a waste of time. Which
brings up other questions:
Does Sen Reid believe
its a waste of time to improve the readiness of our
troops?
Does Sen. Reid believe its a waste of time to provide our
Combatant Commanders with more actionable
intelligence?
Does Sen. Reid believe its a waste of time to reinforce the
mission to defeat ISIL?
Does Sen. Reid believe its a waste
of time to stand up to Putin and provide lethal defensive assistance
to our ally Ukraine?
Do Sen. Reid believe its a
waste of time to strengthen our cyber defenses?
Does Sen
Reid believe its
a waste of time
to keep terrorist
detainees out of the United States?
Protecting
America, our allies and our interests and meeting our troops' needs is
never a waste of time. Suggesting otherwise is
irresponsible.
Full scale Invasion of Ukraine, White House
Watches
Ukraines President, Petro Poroshenko, is warning of
a possible "full-scale invasion" from Russia, amid a surge of
violence in eastern Ukraine.
Poroshenko, with whom I visited earlier
this year, says 9,000 Russian troops were deployed in Ukraine. The
outbreak of violence this week was among the worst in eastern Ukraine since
a ceasefire was signed in Minsk in February.
My 2016
Defense Appropriations bill, which will be considered by the House next
week, contains a dedicated $200 million in additional assistance to the
government of Ukraine, including a provision which would allow the
transfer of defense lethal systems to Ukraine.
In the
meantime, repeated calls to declare Ukraine a major non-NATO ally,
including three letters from me, have been ignored by the Obama
Administration.

Obamas Legacy in the Middle Eastern Desert
Wes
Pruden wrote a column this week that is on target for the Washington
Times.
Its clear now to nearly everyone that this president
and his administration have cornered the market on ineptitude."

Chinas Military Is Not Worried About Obama
Josh
Rogin writes for
Bloomberg View
Chinese military officials attending a major security
conference in Singapore over the weekend made clear that they have no
intention of halting their aggressive activities in the South China Sea,
and they are confident that U.S. President Barack Obama is not going to
be able to stop them.

Hardworking Families Face Double Digit
Premium Hikes
According to a recent Kaiser Family
Foundation survey, nearly half of all people with individual Obamacare
plans said its very or somewhat difficult for them to afford
their monthly premiums
and its about to get even worse.
The
presidents health care law is already failing to bend the cost curve
as he promised it would, and is set to deliver an even bigger blow to
working families next year.

More Health-Care Insurers Seek
Big Premium Increases
Major carriers from around the
country are proposing big increases in the premium rates paid by
consumers who buy insurance policies on their own.
Around the country,
some of the main market leaders are looking for double digit increases.
( Wall Street
Journal )
Insurers Eye ObamaCare Hikes
Health insurers across
the country are eyeing slightly steeper cost increases in 2016, a year
that will be an important test for how well Obamacare is working.
The proposed 2016 rates will offer the most accurate portrait so far
about the health of the marketplaces.
Tennessees biggest insurer has
proposed an increase of 36 percent for some plans, while one of New
Mexicos biggest carriers is looking at a 50 percent increase. The most
popular carrier in Maryland has called for a 30 percent hike. ( The Hill )
Many Health
Insurers Go Big with Initial 2016 Rate Requests
Dozens of
health insurers say higher-than-expected care costs and other expenses
blindsided them this year, and theyre going to have to hike premiums
for individual policies well-beyond 10 percent for 2016. Its hard
to generalize, but that said, I think all signs are pointing to bigger
premium increases than in 2015, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan
Kaiser Family Foundation, a clearinghouse for information on the
health care system. ( Associated
Press )
Obamacares Double-Digit Rate Hikes for 2016
Disclosed [R]ates will jump in 2016 by double-digit percentages
for individual policy purchasers on public exchanges under the
Affordable Care Act in practically every state, according to the first glimpse
of proposed costs for next year released by the Obama
administration. ( Forbes )
Listening Tour Continues
I was pleased to have the
opportunity to meet with members of the Morris Plains Rotary this
morning where we discussed national security, the advance of ISIL forces
and international
trade.
Salute:
Congratulations to the Lincoln Park Emergency Medical
Squad
(LPEMS) as it celebrates its 50 th
Anniversary.
I
was honored to attend their Open House at LPEMS headquarters on Chapel
Hill Road last weekend where I thanked the members for their long and
valuable service to Lincoln Park.
I would also note that LPEMS
also provided important assistance to New York City in the aftermath of
9/11 as well as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, assisting in many
evacuations throughout the state, including nursing home evacuations,
and also a hospital evacuation in Hoboken in preparation of
Superstorm Sandy.
