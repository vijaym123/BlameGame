Dear Friend, The FEC pre-primary filing deadline is today.
And unfortunately, we&rsquo;re still a little bit short of our $25,000 goal.
Can you contribute $5 to help us get there by midnight?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Reaching our goal will show Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and the Tea Party that our people-powered network is ready to roll in this year&rsquo;s race. And with
Republicans opening up offices on the ground in Massachusetts , we need to stand strong. That means hitting our goals and following through on our reelection plan. Help me keep this Senate seat in progressive hands -- give $5 before midnight tonight and help us reach our $25,000 pre-primary goal.
My opponent has said, &ldquo;We can beat Ed Markey.&rdquo; He can try -- but I know all of you are going to help me give him one heck of a fight.
Thank you.
Ed
