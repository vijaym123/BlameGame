Dear
Friend,
Alabama retailers
visit my office on a regular basis asking me to support legislation
that forces Alabama internet users to pay Alabama sales taxes on
internet purchases from non-Alabama internet retailers.
Generally
speaking, Alabama retailers argue (a) current law puts brick and mortar
retailers at a price disadvantage because their customers have to pay
costly sales taxes while internet customers dont have to pay sales
taxes, (b) Alabama loses retail store jobs because of lost sales to
internet retailers, and (c) under current Alabama law, Alabama citizens
already owe sales taxes on all internet sales but are not paying them
because the State of Alabama lacks enforcement
mechanisms.
Generally speaking, opponents of the internet sales tax legislation argue
that the proposed federal legislation (a) forces struggling American
families to suffer from even higher sales tax burdens, (b) costs
internet retailers jobs by shifting sales from internet retailers to brick
and mortar retailers, and (c) places an onerous compliance burden on
internet retailers who would have to comply with thousands of different
sales tax rates across America.
Please advise Congressman Brooks how you prefer he vote on this
issue. Should Congressman Brooks vote for or against federal legislation
that forces Alabama residents to pay sales taxes on internet
sales? Yes, vote for internet
sales tax legislation No, vote against internet sales tax legislation
