News from Representative Peter Roskam
Fighting Superbugs
This week's Chicago Sun-Times featured an op-ed
by Dr. Thomas R. Frieden,
Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
highlighting my bill, the DISARM Act
, which
aims to spur the development of drugs to fight antibiotic resistant
infections, or superbugs.
Each year more than two million people suffer antibiotic-resistant
infections, and 23,000 of them die as a result. There is a critical
shortage of research and development of advanced antibiotics, often
leaving doctors and hospitals with few options when treating patients
with these deadly bugs. Read more about the fight against superbugs

Save our miracle drugs
By Dr. Thomas R. Freiden
The Chicago Sun-Times recently reported on proposed federal legislation
to develop an innovative strategy for combating antibiotic resistance.
The bill was introduced by two Chicago-area representatives, Peter
Roskam and Danny Davis. We thank them for their leadership in an area
of vital importance to our nation's health security.
Combating antibiotic resistance-bacteria outsmarting the drugs designed
to kill them-is critical now, as these microbes could return us to the
time when there were no antibiotics and simple infections were fatal.
