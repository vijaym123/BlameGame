Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
Throughout this year, Nevada will celebrate
the 150th anniversary of its path to statehood. Next week, while I am
back home visiting with constituents and family, the Silver State will
celebrate the day that Congress passed, and President Abraham Lincoln
signed legislation paving the way for Nevada to become the 36th
state.
Congress was in a rush to welcome Nevada to the Union since
the Civil War was raging.
The only other state admitted to
the Union during the war was West Virginia, which seceded from
Virginia to remain part of the Union in 1863. Congress did not want to wait
until its next session to admit another new state. One that could
swing the presidential election in Lincolns favor, and provide crucial
votes for the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery. And Nevadans had
already rejected one proposed state Constitution, so there was no time
to waste.
On March 21, 1864, in the waning hours of the
38th Congress, a law was passed allowing Nevada to enter the union
whenever voters finally passed and President Lincoln approved a state
constitution. It was not the normal course of business. Typically Congress
would get the final word on admission of a new state to the Union, but
these were not normal times.
Even today, we acknowledge
Nevadas unique path to statehood on our state flag with the words
Battle Born.
Throughout this year, we will celebrate with
events in every corner of the state. From my hometown of Searchlight to
Virginia City to Elko, there is a 150th anniversary event to match every
interest. We will mark Nevadas second constitutional convention. It
is the day Nevada voters finally approved its constitution and the
day, October 31, 1864, that Lincoln proclaimed Nevadas
statehood.
The 150th anniversary of our admission to the Union provides a
wonderful opportunity to study Nevadas history. It is also a chance to
reflect on our great states unique pioneer spirit, a spirit that
continues to make it special today.
