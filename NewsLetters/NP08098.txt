Examining VA Mental Health Care and
Suicide Prevention
7/10/14
This morning, at
7:15am MT/ 9:15am ET, Congressman Doug Lamborn will be taking part in
a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing discussing mental
health care and suicide prevention programs in the
VA.
Information
from the House Veterans Affairs
Committee
The hearing will explore the effectiveness of
VAs mental health and suicide prevention programs in reducing the
prevalence of mental health issues and suicide among veterans. In 2013,
VA released the 2012 Suicide Data Report which found that 18 to 22
veterans per day commit suicide, a number that has remained stable since
1999 despite significant increases in the departments mental health
and suicide prevention budget, programs and
staff.
Additionally, the
hearing will look at access problems for veterans seeking mental health
care in light of persistent delays in care across the VA health care
system and a 2012 VA Inspector Generals report that found the
majority of first-time patients waited an average of 50 days to receive a
full mental health evaluation from the department.
