The Scalise Capitol Report
Lets get to work
When the American people elected a Republican majority in the House and Senate, they spoke loud and clear: they have had enough of President Obamas job-killing agenda. The American people are hungry for bold ideas that get our economy moving and create jobs. Energy production, specifically approving the Keystone XL pipeline, minimizing radical regulations, reforming our tax code and crafting a budget early on that controls Washingtons out-of-control spending, are just some of the
Republican agenda ideas
we want to implement when we begin the 114th Congress in January. Im humbled the American people have placed their confidence in us, and
we will follow through
with our commitment to pass legislation that continues to make America the greatest nation in the history of the world. We will move good policies through the House and Senate to President Obama's desk, and this will force him to finally do his job and make tough decisions.

Long past time to secure the border
President Obama owes it to the American people to secure the border. Not only is it his job, but it will also restore the rule of law so that those who want to come into our country legally, and who play by the rules are not at a disadvantage. Instead of looking the other way and rewarding those who break the law, the president needs to enforce the laws already on the books. This is one of the many issues I look forward to addressing with my colleagues now that we have the majority in the House and Senate.

The Marine is home
We recently celebrated the much-anticipated homecoming of United States Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who had been held in jail in Mexico since March. After 214 days behind bars, I am glad Tahmooressi is finally reunited with his family and is safely back home in the United States. This is long overdue, and would not have been possible without
the relentless work
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as my colleagues Chairman Ed Royce and Rep. Matt Salmon, whose efforts helped make this heros release a reality. My colleagues and I will continue to fight for those who have made countless sacrifices for our country because they deserve the best opportunities possible.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
