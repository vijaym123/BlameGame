ISSUES
LEGISLATION
January 18, 2015
Dear
David,
During our second week of the 114th Congress, the House of
Representatives took action to keep our promise with the American
people and defund Obamas unlawful executive amnesty order. On Wednesday, I
voted for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of
2015 ( H.R. 240 ), legislation that
will provide funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while
preventing any taxpayer dollars from being used to authorize President
Obamas lawless actions on immigration.
President Obamas
unilateral rulemaking shows blatant disregard for legislative authority
and for the will of the American people. The Constitution makes it
clear that Congress holds the power of the purse, no exceptions. The
legislation passed this week will restore the system of checks and
balances of our republic and pave the way for Congress to start working
together toward responsible reform that respects our rule of law, secures
the border, and honors the values of this country. Please take a moment
to fill
out this survey on my
website
to share your thoughts regarding the decisions we face on
immigration.

Celebrating Religious
Freedom
On Friday, our nation celebrated Religious Freedom Day,
the 229th anniversary of Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute for
Religious Freedom, which later became the Free Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment of the Constitution. Our country has a rich heritage of
religious freedom, and I am pleased to take part in honoring this right
and helping protect it for generations to come.

Reducing Regulatory Burden
Bureaucratic red
tape coming from Washington imposes $15,000 in costs a year upon each
household, and an annual burden of $1.86 trillion dollars on our
economy. Last week, the House passed two measures to start cutting these
costly regulations. The Regulatory Accountability Act ( H.R. 185 ) requires the Executive Branch to adopt the least costly
method to effectively implement the laws set by Congress.
H.R. 37 , the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act, is a package of common sense, regulatory relief
bills that
will relieve small businesses from existing,
overwhelming tax burdens. Economic growth comes from our local economies; it
does not come from Washington. I will continue to support measures to
reduce unnecessary costs for American households and
businesses.
Helping Our Heroes
This past week, the House passed
H.R. 203 , the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act. Tragically, an average of
12-22 veterans committed suicide each day over
the past decade . Named after a Marine vet who took his own life,
this measure will increase veterans' access to mental health services
and will connect active service members with other veterans to help them
transition from active duty.
Our veterans should have access to
the care they need when they return home.
