Stockman Helps Honor Pasadena WW-II Vet on
90th Birthday
On December 30, 2013, the
family of Arthur William "Bill" Cushman of Pasadena, Texas celebrated
his 90th birthday.
When World War II broke out,
Bill left Perdue University and was commissioned in the United States
Army Air Corp as a Navigator in the South Pacific.
During the
course of the war Bill and his plane were shot down over Formosa and
Bill was classified as Missing in Action.
Eventually, Bill
was returned to his unit and stayed in the Army Air Corp until the end
of WWII.
Upon returning to civilian life, Bill returned to
Purdue where he completed his BS degree in
Industrial Engineering. Bill worked for US Steel as Superintendent of Industrial
Engineering and retired to Texas.
To celebrate this
outstanding patriot and the milestone of his 90th birthday, and to recognize
his service to his country, Congressman Steve Stockman had a
flag flown over the US Capitol. The flag, accompanied with a
certificate of merit and appreciation were presented to Bill by his
niece Judy Cushman DuBose of Baytown who is also a United States Army
Veteran.
Pictured with Bill are his sisters who each
have been a part of public or military
service:
Sister: Charlotte Cushman Radtke Carol, currently residing in Pasadena,
Texas -- USN WW-II.
Birthday Celebrant: Arthur William
"Bill" Cushman United States Army Air Corp

Sister: Cathy Cushman Bennett State of the Texas Senior Citizen

Congressman Stockman has a long history of supporting veterans and senior
citizens.
NASA/Space
News
Great news for
the space program. NASA has announced the extention of the life of our
space station to at least 2024.
ISS
provides incredible benefits in medical and technological advances,
helping keep the US the leader in high tech in an increasingly competitive
world.
Congressman Stockman applauds NASA for this extension which will
allow scientists to plan longer-term research than before, and supports
continued extensions of ISS to 2028 and
beyond.
T here were two commercial launches
this past week.
Orbital's Antares rocket was launched to ISS carrying
supplies, and
Space X launched a television satellite for Thailand
on their upgraded Falcon-9 rocket--America is reclaiming the worldwide
commercial launch market.

Stockman's science advisor is the co-founder of the House Space
Advocates Group, the forum for top Congressional space advisors.

engineers from NASA's Langley center briefed the participants on progress on
Orion's launch escape system, and the aerodynamics of the Space Launch
