A Budget that Balances
Our national debt is more than $18 trillion and each year Washington is
spending
$1 trillion more than it takes in .
Washington now borrows $3 billion a day to pay for things like the interest on the debt. Our debt is growing faster than our economy and Washingtons promises are growing faster than its ability to pay for them. Regardless of political party this is completely irresponsible.
In order to build a healthier and more secure economy, Washington must begin to act under the same expectations put on everyday American families, and that is to be responsible and live within your means.
Thats why this week, the House passed a budget
our vision for America
one that will allow us to pass along a greater nation to our children and grandchildren.
This is a budget that doesnt continue to borrow from future generations but calls for but calls for pro-growth economic reforms instead.
Our budget balances in 10 years, cuts spending by $5.5 trillion, and calls for a fairer, simpler tax code.
A budget is a framework for how to prioritize spending. We will then use it to guide us through our constitutional appropriations process where we can go line-by-line to set spending levels for programs that work and reduce those that dont.
Highlights from our budget for a stronger America include:
Places the country on a path to paying off the debt
Calls on Congress to pass a balanced budget amendment to
the Constitution
Repeals Obamacare in full
including all of its taxes,
regulations and mandates
and promotes patient-centered health care reforms
Prevents government bureaucrats from coming between seniors and their doctors by eliminating the Independent Payment Advisory Board
Provides for a strong national defense through robust funding of troop training, equipment and compensation
Strengthens Medicare by making structural improvements to save the program
Prevents borrowing from the regular Social Security Trust Fund
Continues to help students pay for college by maintaining the current maximum Pell Grant award
