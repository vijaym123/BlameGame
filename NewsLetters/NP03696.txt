Wicker: Return to Regular Order Tops Agenda for
2015
New Congress Looks to Jobs, Economy as Early
Priorities
Americans voted for change in the
midterm elections, voicing their readiness for a new direction in
Washington.
The new Republican majority is entrusted with following
through on this obligation and should work to pass legislation that
has a positive impact on Americans' lives.
Instead of expanding
the size of government, the focus should be on expanding opportunity
for everyone.
The
first step is to return the Senate to regular order.
Dysfunction has
dominated the chamber over the past eight years of Democratic
control.
Rather than protecting the Senate as a unique legislative
institution, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has prevented it from
operating as our Founders intended, where members could engage in free
and open debate.
The practice of lurching from one crisis to the
next is no way to run a government.
I am encouraged by incoming
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) commitment to restoring the
traditions of the Senate, including the open amendment process.
Focusing on Pro-Growth
Legislation
Leader McConnell has already announced
that the Keystone XL pipeline will be among the Senate's first
legislative items in 2015.
The private-sector infrastructure project,
which has substantial bipartisan support, has been awaiting approval from
the Obama Administration for six years, despite clearing multiple
environmental reviews.
It is a major jobs win, putting tens of
thousands of Americans back to work.
The pipeline also promises to
pump more North American energy into the world market.
Like Keystone XL, a number of other
job-creating ideas are ready for action.
Dozens of pro-growth bills
were passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives during
the 113th Congress.
Instead of being stifled by Senate
Democrats, they now have an opportunity to go to the President's desk to become
law.
The Republican
majority also has an opportunity to reverse some of the most harmful
elements of the President's health-care law.
Obamacare's
burdensome mandates continue to drag down the economy and have negatively
affected thousands of Mississippians.
Although President Obama has
threatened to veto a repeal of the entire law, there are components
ripe for overturning, including the costly medical device tax.
Holding the Administration
Accountable
In keeping with the Constitution's checks
and balances, Congress is responsible for overseeing the executive
branch and the implementation of federal policy.
The President has
repeatedly tried to usurp this legislative authority with executive
action, unilaterally advancing his agenda on immigration and the
environment, to name just a few.
The recent proposal by the
Environmental Protection Agency to change the standards for ground-level ozone
has been called the most expensive rule to date.
Congress should do its part to rein in executive
overreach through the appropriations process and oversight hearings,
as well as legislation that offers solutions to the most pressing
issues of the day.
I look forward to continuing my work on the
Senate Armed Services Committee; the Budget Committee; the Commerce,
Science, and Transportation Committee; and the Environmental and Public
Works Committee.
I will also join the Rules Committee, which handles
Senate rules and regulations, in addition to federal election law.
The American people have
given the Republican Party the majority in Congress for the next two
years.
This is a solemn responsibility and deserves constructive
policymaking with practical results.
