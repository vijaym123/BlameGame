Friends,
You might've heard that Congress will soon have to address a highway funding shortfall.
Predictably,
some in Washington want to fix the problem by raising taxes.
Not me.
I've been working to pass the
Transportation Empowerment Act , which cuts the federal gas tax and empowers each state to take control of highway construction.
Today, my plan got a boost when
National Review endorsed the bill .
Here's a link to the editorial .
The plan cuts out Washington's politics and red tape, which means roads would be constructed more quickly and at a lower cost to taxpayers.
My office estimates that
Georgia would've saved $185 million this year under my plan .
Above all, I believe
this policy battle has a very real impact on your life.
Think about it this way: if we had new and better roads, how much shorter would your commute be?
How much more time could you spend with your family?
Would you be connected to new job opportunities or more affordable housing?
Better roads would mean a better life for a lot people.
I think we can get there by taking power from Washington and transferring it back to the states.

Honored to serve you,
National Review Editorial : Don't Raise the Gas Tax
"Cut the gas tax and let states pay for the highways within their borders. Senator Mike Lee (R., Utah) and Representative Tom Graves (R., Ga.) have proposed a bill that would do essentially this, and it makes a number of other important improvements to highway policies."
