Rogers Co-Sponsors Bill to Prevent Obama's Executive Action on Immigration
WASHINGTON, DC
-
U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) signed on as a co-sponsor of the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act ( H.R. 5759 ), reaffirming that the President does not have the authority to exempt more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation. This legislation will apply to President Obamas recently announced executive actions and any future orders that would also attempt to circumvent the law.
"Executive amnesty undermines the spirit of our Constitution, the integrity of our immigration laws and discourages the thousands of people who are patiently working to achieve the American dream through the legal immigration process," said Rogers. "This bill reiterates the authority of Congress and speaks for thousands of Americans who have widely rejected the President's blanket pardon of illegal immigrants."
The effective date of the bill coincides with the Presidents speech on November 20, and applies to all new and previously denied requests for exemptions and deferrals of removal from the United States, as well as any related work authorization. It also provides for necessary exceptional humanitarian and law enforcement exceptions.
Additionally, this bill does not affect federal funding and will not put the country at risk of a government shutdown.
The bill is scheduled to be considered by the House on Thursday, December 4, 2014.
