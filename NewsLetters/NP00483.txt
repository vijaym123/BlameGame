Critical issue for economy, national security
Senator Stabenow Calls
for Upgrades And Repairs to Aging Soo Locks
Last week, Senator Debbie Stabenow visited the Soo Locks and
highlighted the critical role they play in our nation's ability to ship
commercial goods from iron ore to wheat. U.S. iron ore, a commodity
vital to American manufacturers and our national defense, can only be
transported from mines to steel mills by ship in the Great Lakes.
Stabenow met with members of the Detroit District of the Army Corps of
Engineers, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection. During
the meeting, they discussed the need to upgrade and replace the aging
lock infrastructure as well as Great Lakes safety and security. "The
Soo Locks are the gateway for Great Lakes freighters carrying staple
foods like wheat and materials our manufacturers and military depend
on," said Stabenow. "A failure of the aging locks causing even a
temporary outage could cost our economy millions of dollars- a cost we
cannot afford. I am fully committed to working with the Army Corps to
secure the necessary funding to make upgrades and build a replacement
lock, ensuring this vital gateway remains open," she added.

Stabenow Introduces Measure to Keep Plastic Microbeads out of
Great Lakes
Senators Stabenow and Peters introduced legislation to protect the
Great Lakes from pollution caused by small, plastic microbeads that are
ingredients in certain soaps and personal care products. These
microbeads are able to get through water treatment facilities and end
up floating in the Great Lakes, where they can build up as plastic
pollution and are often mistaken for food by fish. The Microbeads Free
Waters Act of 2015 protects the Great Lakes by phasing out the
manufacture and sale of microbeads found in household products.
Congressmen Fred Upton (R-MI) and Frank Pallone (D-NJ) are sponsors of
the companion bill introduced in U.S. House of Representatives.
"Microbeads seem like a nice way to get extra scrub' in your soap, but
they pose a very real danger to our Great Lakes," said Senator
Stabenow, co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. "Researchers
are finding these bits of plastic building up in our lakes, rivers and
streams. When we see these kinds of things are threatening our Great
Lakes and potentially threatening fish populations, we need to take
swift action."

Bipartisan Vehicle Innovation Act Will Pave Way for Next Generation of
Fuel-efficient American Autos
Senator Stabenow recently teamed with her colleagues Senators Peters
and Alexander to introduce the bipartisan Vehicle Innovation Act. "Our
automakers are surging back with new innovations and new technologies,
and we need to keep that momentum going," said Stabenow. The Vehicle
Innovation Act will promote investments in research and development of
clean vehicle technologies that will create more fuel-efficient
vehicles, reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil, and support
American auto manufacturers. By strengthening public-private
partnerships in Michigan and across the country, we can make sure our
workers and businesses have the right technologies to drive our economy
forward," said Stabenow.
