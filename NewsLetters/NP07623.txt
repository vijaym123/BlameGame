Friend,
In Congress, I&#39;m privileged to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. In the wake of recent events in Israel, Ukraine, and Iraq, we will be holding many hearings and briefings in the coming weeks.
I truly value the thoughts of my supporters, and given the sensitivity and complexity of these issues, I felt it was important to give you the opportunity to share your insights.

You and I both know that these are complicated issues and that we live in a complex world. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to consider many points of view, and to create opportunities to foster dialogue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and to keeping you updated on our work.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
