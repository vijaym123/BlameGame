David,
Happy Father&rsquo;s Day to all the incredible dads out there!
I want to recognize the hard work and compassion my husband, Gerry, has put into raising our three boys. Along with our son, Tony, who is an amazing father to our two grandchildren.
Today we also remember all of our fathers who we've lost and are with us in spirit. This will be my first Father&rsquo;s Day since the passing of my father this past August, and not a day goes by that I don't think about him.
I hope today is a day of love for all the fathers in your life.
Have a happy Father&rsquo;s Day,
Cheri
