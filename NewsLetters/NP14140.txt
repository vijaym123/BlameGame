Dear Friend,
Last week I traveled to Israel where I met with high-ranking Israeli
officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss
foreign policy. It is always an honor to visit Israel and meet with the
Prime Minister. My time there only reaffirmed for me the pressing need
for the United States to stand unequivocally with our friend and ally.
I agree wholeheartedly with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the reported
Geneva deal to pull back sanctions on Iran was a very bad deal for
Israel and the national security interests of the United States. For

I-94 to Receive Much-Needed Expansion
On Thursday, Central Minnesotans received some great news: the Minnesota
Department of Transportation will be able to begin the expansion
of the Interstate 94 Corridor, thanks to Corridors of Commerce
funding.
Expansion of the I-94 corridor has been a top priority, and I am pleased
to see that my constituents' concerns have been taken into consideration
and this project will come to fruition. Expansion of this corridor is
vital to Minnesota's current and future competitiveness and will provide
some relief to the area.
President Obama Tries to Legislate by Press Conference
After more than a month of website malfunctions and broken promises from
the Obama Administration, President Obama spoke at a press conference
Thursday about the millions of Americans who lost their existing health
care plans thanks to Obamacare-despite three years of assurances that
this wouldn't happen. His solution? A unilateral "political fix
" that is unconstitutional and won't really
solve the problem.
A decree brought down on high from President Obama to fit daily
political objectives is not how the legislative process works. The
bottom line is that Obamacare cannot be fixed. Higher premiums, doctor
shortages, and cancellation notices are the law's main features and are
only going to get worse. The only way to fix Obamacare is to scrap it
altogether and start over with patient-centered reforms.
National Adoption Month
I joined my fellow co-chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption,
Congresswoman Karen Bass (CA-37) in introducing House Resolution (H.RES)
409
, a bipartisan resolution supporting the goals and ideals of
National Adoption Month and National Adoption Day in November.
This issue is very near and dear to my heart. My husband and I were
privileged to raise five biological children and 23 foster children.
Every child needs to know that at least one person is crazy about them.
I hope everyone will join us this month and throughout the year to
encourage new advocacy on behalf of America's "forgotten children."
In honor of this month, I wrote my first Buzzfeed post: Top 10 Reasons
to Consider Adoption.
Coffee with your Congresswoman in Waconia on Saturday
On Saturday,
November 16, I will be at the Egg-Cetera Caf in Waconia,
MN from 10am-11am for coffee with constituents. I appreciate every
opportunity to hear my constituents' comments and concerns, and I hope
you will join us! For more information on this event, click here
