News from Representative Peter Roskam
Recognizing Student Leaders in Our Local High Schools
On Thursday, April 24, Congressman Roskam announced the student
recipients of the 6th Congressional District Excellence Award. Each
area high school chose one senior for the award who has demonstrated
academic excellence and leadership qualities.
As parents, teachers, coaches and mentors, we strive to put in place
every opportunity so that our kids can succeed. So times like this are
extra special, because we're honoring a group of high school seniors
who have not only taken advantage of the educational opportunities
their schools provide but also the programs and activities in the
community to go above and beyond all of our hopes and expectations.
I
applaud each student recognized this year, they have accomplished so
much already and prepared themselves well for the next chapters of
their lives.
