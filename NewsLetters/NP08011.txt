Friends,
This weekend we gather
with family and friends to celebrate the Fourth of July, our nations
238th birthday.
Between the parades, fireworks, and celebrations, I encourage us to
take a moment to reflect on the significance of this holiday.
Our
great country would not exist today if our revolutionary heroes did
not have the courage to declare independence from the British Empire, or
have the vision to establish a government for the people, by the
people.
On June 7,
1776, Virginia Representative Richard Henry Lee proposed before
Congress the need for independence from the King of England.
Congress
then debated Representative Lees idea, leading to the establishment of
a committee to draft a serious proposal.
Nearly one month
passed as writers prepared the document and the thirteen colonies
negotiated the details. On July 4, 1776, Congress reached an agreement and our
Declaration of Independence from the British Empire was officialthe
United States of America was born!
Today, Congress goes through a similar process when
creating new laws. Ideas are proposed, written, and negotiated before they
are agreed on by all three branches of government.
It takes much
more time now since our country has tripled in size.
We now have
535 state representatives and a President who has to agree on
legislation before our country can establish a new law.
Admittedly,
this process seems frustrating at times, but even in times of frustration
we must recognize that our system of government was established to
protect the interests of the people and ensure it would never evolve
into a government similar to the British Empires
monarchy.
It is now our responsibility,
as Americans, to protect our government and freedoms.
We must
ensure that the separation of powers, Declaration of Independence, and
our countrys laws are upheld and honored.
While our country has
hit some roadblocks and has experienced setbacks, we still remain the
greatest nation on the planet and the freedom leaders of the
world.
It is an honor to
serve you, your family, our state, and country.
This is not a
responsibility I take lightly and will always do my best to ensure that
our country remains a beacon of freedom, the home of hope, and land
of prosperity.
May God Bless you and May God Bless the
U.S.A.!
