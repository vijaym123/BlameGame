Northern Marianas kids, ages 8-12, with a knack for nutritious cooking are again invited to enter a recipe in First Lady Michelle Obamas Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. The winning entrant from each state and territory will be invited to attend a Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House, where a selection of the winning healthy recipes will be served. Previous top chefs from the NMI were Esther Huh with her Pitaya Healthy Salad in 2012 and Genzo Gonzales with Kangkung Pomegranate Salad in 2013. Ms. Huh [inset photo] also visited her congressional office while in Washington for the State Dinner. For more information go to the First Ladys Lets Move website . Closing date for submission of your recipe is April 5, 2014.
One more requirement of P.L. 113-34 completed: transfer of oil, gas, mineral rights to CNMI
As required by U.S. Public Law 113-34, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell signed the conveyance of oil, gas, and mineral rights in the submerged lands around the Northern Marianas to the Commonwealth on March 13. Governor Eloy Inos accepted the resource rights this Thursday. I wrote to Secretary Jewell in January
to make sure that this fine point of the Territorial Submerged Lands Act was not overlooked. The minerals rights provision was added to the law
by Representatives George Miller (D-California), Nick Rahall (D-West Virginia), and the late Philip Burton (D-California), among others in 1980. Before that the federal government held on to oil, gas, and minerals in territorial submerged lands. The law also requires that all rentals, royalties, or fees on rights already leased by the federal government will now go to the Commonwealth. Secretary Jewell has not yet confirmed whether there are any existing leases.

The Honorable Frances Tydingco-Gatewood, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for Guam, and the Honorable Ramona V. Manglona, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, visited this week. The two were in Washington for a judicial conference. Judge Manglona is the first person from the Northern Marianas to hold this important federal office. She was nominated by President Obama in January 2011 and confirmed by the Senate in July of that year.
Statement
lays out the case for tapering off CW workers past 2014
Labor Secretary Tom Perez appeared before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce this week to defend his Departments budget request. At the hearing I made the case for continuing the transition of the NMI economy
to 100 percent U.S. workers beyond 2014. Perez is required to make a decision by July 4 on whether to extend the transition or let it end on December 31. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 9,716 Commonwealth-only (CW) workers were permitted in 2013. Thats down from over 17,000 when the immigration transition began. But we do not have 9,716 local workers to replace those CWs by the end of this year. If those workers all have to leave, businesses will close and the local workers they employ will be out of a job. We need to continue the steady reduction in foreign workers. But, as the Government Accountability Office has advised Congress
any substantial and rapid decline in the availability of CNMI-only work permits for foreign workers would have a negative effect on the economy.

Thomas E. Perez, U.S. Secretary of Labor, testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce this week explaining his Departments budget proposal for fiscal year 2015. I took the opportunity to remind the Secretary of the importance to the Northern Marianas of extending the immigration transition period for a few more years, until we have enough U.S. workers to fill all the jobs in our economy. Perez must make a decision on the extension by July 4.
Democrats voice support for increasing minimum wage
Along with all of the Democrats at this weeks Education and the Workforce Committee budget hearing, I spoke up for increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. I have had to make sure the wage increase is not so fast that it hurts our economy and reduces the number of jobs, but I have never wavered in my commitment to federal minimum wage for Northern Marianas workers. We will reach the current federal minimum, $7.25 per hour, in 2018. If the federal minimum is raised, then we will continue increasing by 50 each year in the Marianas until we reach $10.10. Ranking Member George Miller, who has introduced legislation to raise the national minimum wage,
explained the economics: [W]hen low- and middle-income consumers make more, they spend more of it at the grocery store, and in shops and restaurants, generating economic activity that benefits everyone. Next week, the Government Accountability Office is scheduled to release its latest report on the impact of minimum wage increases in the Northern Marianas, an important gauge of how quickly we can raise the wage.

H.R. 4296 requires extension of immigration transition period
I introduced legislation this week that requires a five-year extension of the immigration transition period now scheduled to end on December 31, 2014. This is the same language contained in my Omnibus Territories Act, H.R. 2200 , and its Senate companion, S.1237.
Both of those bills are moving slowly because they contain other changes to territorial law, some of which are controversial. So I have decided to improve chances of enacting the transition extension with a stand-alone bill, H.R. 4296.
This is the same strategy that worked with the transfer of ownership of submerged lands. The transfer was originally part of H.R. 2200 and S.1237, but it was a free-standing bill, S. 256, that moved more quickly and became law on September 18, 2013. Extending the transition period by five years will protect our tourism industry by preventing claims of asylum in the Northern Marianas by persons who enter under parole status.

Ms. Eileen Sobeck, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries at the National Marine Fisheries Service, and Dr. Paul Doremus, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Operations, briefed me on the agencys fiscal year 2015 budget
this week. The Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs Subcommittee, on which I serve as Ranking Member, has oversight responsibility for the nations fisheries. This is the time in the budget process when Congress reviews the Presidents requests and decides which programs to fund and how much money to appropriate.
NMFS to determine ESA listing for 29 NMI corals in June
In a meeting to review their FY15 budget request
National Marine Fisheries Service officials explained why the possible classification of 66 corals as endangered species requires an additional $4 million for the agency. 29 of the corals are found in the Northern Mariana Islands. A decision on whether to list the corals under the Endangered Species Act is expect by June 7. The agency said the new money would speed consultation and permitting requirements of the ESA, so that fishing, marine transportation, and tourism are minimally impacted. Coral reefs are the breeding and nursery grounds for many fish that have commercial importance. The reefs are key to our tourism industry, too. Protecting corals protects both of those industries. But to avoid potential resource conflicts I have asked NMFS always to take into account the efforts of states and territories to protect corals and to be pragmatic when deciding how best to protect the endangered species that help make our islands unique.

$2.4 million grant awarded for CNMI fish and wildlife projects
The U.S. Department of Interior has awarded $2.4 million to the CNMI Department of Lands and Natural Resources to support fish and wildlife management and conservation initiatives, improve recreational boating access, and bolster aquatic education programs. Congratulations to DLNR!

Students in grades 9 to 12 may submit original paintings, drawings, collages, prints, computer-generated art, or photography to the competition. But the deadline is Friday, April 11, 2014.
