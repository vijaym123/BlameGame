Helping Families Save for
College
2/25/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 529, to amend
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to Improve 529
Plans.
H.R. 529 makes three important improvements
to 529 Savings Plans and keeps them
tax-free:
1) Empowers students to use
their 529 savings for computers, reflecting the modern reality that a
computer is a necessity for todays college
student.
2) Eliminates an
outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule required when the funds are
distributed that increases paperwork and costs on plan
administrators.
3)
Allows taxpayers to re-deposit refunds from colleges without taxes or
penalties.
"529s are a proven and popular tool that allows Americans to
set aside money for the college education of their children. H.R. 529
is bipartisan legislation that expands and strengthens this program
already being utilized by 12 million families. As the cost of college
rises and students enter the workforce with higher and higher levels of
debt, it is important that our tax system serves as an incentive for
people to play by the rules and work hard. That's why it is baffling
that President Obama threatened to tax 529s. Thankfully he has backed off
of this proposal, but I would encourage him to support and advocate
for the bipartisan step we took today in the
House."
