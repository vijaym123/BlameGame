Dear Friend,
I just wrapped up town halls and other meetings in southern, central,
and eastern Oregon, covering 1599 miles in nine counties (it was
supposed to be 10, but transportation difficulties prevented me from
getting to Lakeview on Friday).
Here's the snow and rain over Mt. Hood
as I headed from Bend to Hood River last week (taken from the
passenger's seat.):
While on the road, we got word that the board of Cover Oregon voted to
scrap the site and move to the federal insurance exchange.
Cover Oregon is the digital equivalent of the 1962
Columbus Day storm. It is the worst financial failure in information
technology in state history-and it was completely avoidable. This
admission of failure underscores the need to stop the waste and get the
truth. How did this happen? Who was in charge? That's why I've sought
and secured a federal investigation into Cover Oregon.
The Government
Accountability Office is already at work to get taxpayers answers and
accountability.
Meeting with ranchers in Burns after BLM refuses to follow the law
On Friday, I was in Burns for a meeting with ranchers on Steens
Mountain and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) because the agency is
clearly ignoring the letter and spirit of a law passed by Congress 14
years ago. Allow me to explain:
In the waning days of the Clinton Administration, the Secretary of the
Interior at the time, Bruce Babbitt, made it clear that the President
would use his power to designate national monuments to unilaterally
lock up thousands of acres of Steens Mountain putting a noose around
the neck of local ranchers who had been excellent stewards of this
magnificent part of Oregon.
Before he could do this, I teamed up with
local families and my colleagues in the Oregon delegation to write a
law that worked for ranchers and the Clinton Administration.
That law
prevented Clinton from declaring it a monument and put in place a
lasting framework rooted in cooperation and local control. It
facilitated land exchanges on the most fragile parts of the mountain
and allowed local ranchers to continue grazing their cattle in other
areas. The Steens Act was passed unanimously by the House and the
Senate and signed into law in October 2000.
The law contained a very clear sentence: "The Secretary [of the
Interior] shall be responsible for installing and maintaining any
fencing required for resource protection within the designated no
livestock grazing area."
To me-and probably to you-that sentence means that the Interior
Department and the BLM are responsible for putting up fencing around
the cow-free areas. But the BLM of today is violating the letter and
the spirit of the law. The BLM has made it clear they feel that the
responsibility for building the fences falls to the ranchers. How could
we have written the law any more clearly?!
It's not the first time I've had to educate the BLM on the intent of
this law, because-like so many agencies-they continue to try to
interpret it their way. Some in the agency think it's their land, or
the government's land, not the public's land. Now they have some
high-priced lawyers running around, trying to interpret nuances to get
to a result that they want. And I'll be darned if I'm going to let them
do that. I refuse to let them and their lawyers flout the clear intent
of Congress and the law.
I made this very point to the ranchers and the BLM representatives who
came to Burns.
And I will continue to do everything I can to make sure
the BLM respects the letter and the intent of the law.

Better care for veterans in Grants Pass
Last Thursday, I was in Grants Pass for the dedication of their new
Veterans Administration (VA) clinic. For many years, the VA has
operated a small clinic that mostly served veterans in rural Josephine
County. That left most veterans in the area forced to drive 30 to 70
miles to White City or Roseburg for routine medical treatment.
This new clinic, though, will bring the VA to veterans instead of
forcing more veterans to go to the VA. Along with local veterans and
other leaders, Senator Wyden and I worked hard for many years to prod
the VA to upgrade their clinic. This upgrade will help about 1,000
additional veterans receive high-quality care closer to home. Men and
women who served this country and fought for our freedom deserve
nothing less.
Time for more accountability at the VA
I also met with veterans in Bend and Ontario last week. A major issue I
heard about (and I hear about all too often) is the claims backlog at
the VA. Over 725,000 veterans are currently waiting for a claims
decision. The latest numbers from the Portland office show that about
62% of veterans' claims are older than 125 days. That's unacceptable.
It's time for greater accountability at the VA.
That's why I support a bill working its way through Congress-the VA
Management Accountability Act
-to hold senior level VA managers accountable for the
agency's progress. Current law puts layers and layers of red tape in
the way before a senior manager at the VA can be held accountable for
their actions. This bill would cut away a lot of that red tape to give
the Secretary the authority to clean up the agency.
As Speaker John Boehner recently said when talking about the bill, "The
VA is failing our veterans and their families.
It's time we hold these
people accountable and get people in there who can fix this backlog
once and for all."
This week, the House will vote on funding legislation for the VA that
continues our efforts to upgrade their computer systems and provide the
personnel needed to solve this problem.
At the meeting in Bend, I had the chance to recognize three recent
service academy appointees from Central Oregon, Emily Shunk (left)
accepted an appointment to the US Air Force Academy; Tim Gorman
(center) and Braden Bell (shaking hand) accepted an appointment to West
Point.
Being nominated to one of our nation's service academies represents
years of hard work and discipline. It takes a special commitment to
pursue the rigors of an academy education, and these young Americans
are continuing a long line of patriotic Oregonians in their endeavor.

FDA pulls back on regulations that could harm brewers, ranchers,
consumers
I've told you before about a new proposal from the FDA that could harm
Oregon's brewers, ranchers, and consumers. It is common for brewers to
give or sell a byproduct of the brewing process-known as "spent grains"-
to local ranchers for use as animal feed. But the FDA has proposed
tightly regulating this practice to prevent food-borne illness, even
though there's never been a case we are aware of where spent grains
from a brewery fed to cattle caused any kind of food-borne illness. It's
a solution in search of a problem.
I met with brewers and ranchers from Central Oregon last week about
this issue.
If
the rule were to go through, it could have a big impact on both these
groups, and even force them to raise costs on beer and beef sold to
consumers. No one wants that.
After the meeting, the FDA announced they would rework the rules. That's
encouraging, but I will keep a close eye on the agency's actions moving
forward to make sure the final proposal doesn't unnecessarily harm
these small businesses or consumers.
I was able to achieve a similar success when it came to proposed
irrigation regulations the FDA drafted for onions that were also
completely unworkable.
The FDA listened and pulled back those draft
rules, too.
Promoting forest access in John Day
On Friday, it was on to John Day for a meeting on forest access with
Grant County citizens. I was joined by John Bastian of the Grant County
Snowballers (local snowmobile club), Commissioners Boyd Britton and
Chris Labhart, and other members of the community.
We discussed legislation I have introduced to stop the Forest Service's
travel management rule, the Forest Access in Rural Communities Act.
This legislation would require the Forest Service to get input
and consent from affected counties before any future road closure could
take effect. It would help bring local input and needs back into the
process and ensure that local citizens have a clear say on the
management actions that affect the forests that surround them.
For too long, the input and wishes of local citizens have been pushed
to the backseat when it comes to decisions about access to our public
lands. This common-sense bill will put local communities back in the
driver's seat in the Forest Service's travel management planning
process.
Teaming up with Facebook to help small businesses grow
Finally, thank you to Facebook
for hosting workshops in Medford and Bend to help
small businesses learn to use social media to better to reach
customers. More than 200 people turned out for each session!
It was
great to attend these two sessions to meet more Oregon entrepreneurs
who are the real engines of job growth in our economy.
Helping Oregon's small businesses grow and create more jobs is
essential if we're going to lower our unemployment rate and boost the
wages of workers.
That's all for this time. Have a great week.

Greg Walden

Meeting
with
ranchers
in
Burns
after
BLM
refuses
to
follow
the
law
On
Friday,
I
was
in
Burns
for
a
meeting
with
ranchers
on
Steens
Mountain
and
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
(BLM)
because
the
agency
is
clearly
ignoring
the
letter
and
spirit
of
a
law
passed
by
Congress
14
years
ago.
Allow
me
to
explain:
In
the
waning
days
of
the
Clinton
Administration,
the
Secretary
of
the
Interior
at
the
time,
Bruce
Babbitt,
made
it
clear
that
the
President
would
use
his
power
to
designate
national
monuments
to
unilaterally
lock
up
thousands
of
acres
of
Steens
Mountain
putting
a
noose
around
the
neck
of
local
ranchers
who
had
been
excellent
stewards
of
this
magnificent
part
of
Oregon.
Before
he
could
do
this,
I
teamed
up
with
local
families
and
my
colleagues
in
the
Oregon
delegation
to
write
a
law
that
worked
for
ranchers
and
the
Clinton
Administration.
That
law
prevented
Clinton
from
declaring
it
a
monument
and
put
in
place
a
lasting
framework
rooted
in
cooperation
and
local
control.
It
facilitated
land
exchanges
on
the
most
fragile
parts
of
the
mountain
and
allowed
local
ranchers
to
continue
grazing
their
cattle
in
other
areas.
The
Steens
Act
was
passed
unanimously
by
the
House
and
the
Senate
and
signed
into
law
in
October
2000.
The
law
contained
a
very
clear
sentence:
&#8220;The
Secretary
[of
the
Interior]
shall
be
responsible
for
installing
and
maintaining
any
fencing
required
for
resource
protection
within
the
designated
no
livestock
grazing
area.&#8221;
To
me&#8212;and
probably
to
you&#8212;that
sentence
means
that
the
Interior
Department
and
the
BLM
are
responsible
for
putting
up
fencing
around
the
cow-free
areas.
But
the
BLM
of
today
is
violating
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
law.
The
BLM
has
made
it
clear
they
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
building
the
fences
falls
to
the
ranchers.
How
could
we
have
written
the
law
any
more
clearly?!
It&#8217;s
not
the
first
time
I&#8217;ve
had
to
educate
the
BLM
on
the
intent
of
this
law,
because&#8212;like
so
many
agencies&#8212;they
continue
to
try
to
interpret
it
their
way.
Some
in
the
agency
think
it&#8217;s
their
land,
or
the
government&#8217;s
land,
not
the
public&#8217;s
land.
Now
they
have
some
high-priced
lawyers
running
around,
trying
to
interpret
nuances
to
get
to
a
result
that
they
want.
And
I&#8217;ll
be
darned
if
I&#8217;m
going
to
let
them
do
that.
I
refuse
to
let
them
and
their
lawyers
flout
the
clear
intent
of
Congress
and
the
law.
I
made
this
very
point
to
the
ranchers
and
the
BLM
representatives
who
came
to
Burns.
And
I
will
continue
to
do
everything
I
can
to
make
sure
the
BLM
respects
the
letter
and
the
intent
of
the
law.

Better
care
for
veterans
in
Grants
Pass
Last
Thursday,
I
was
in
Grants
Pass
for
the
dedication
of
their
new
Veterans
Administration
(VA)
clinic.
For
many
years,
the
VA
has
operated
a
small
clinic
that
mostly
served
veterans
in
rural
Josephine
County.
That
left
most
veterans
in
the
area
forced
to
drive
30
to
70
miles
to
White
City
or
Roseburg
for
routine
medical
treatment.
This
new
clinic,
though,
will
bring
the
VA
to
veterans
instead
of
forcing
more
veterans
to
go
to
the
VA.
Along
with
local
veterans
and
other
leaders,
Senator
Wyden
and
I
worked
hard
for
many
years
to
prod
the
VA
to
upgrade
their
clinic.
This
upgrade
will
help
about
1,000
additional
veterans
receive
high-quality
care
closer
to
home.
Men
and
women
who
served
this
country
and
fought
for
our
freedom
deserve
nothing
less.
Time
for
more
accountability
at
the
VA
I
also
met
with
veterans
in
Bend
and
Ontario
last
week.
A
major
issue
I
heard
about
(and
I
hear
about
all
too
often)
is
the
claims
backlog
at
the
VA.
Over
725,000
veterans
are
currently
waiting
for
a
claims
decision.
The
latest
numbers
from
the
Portland
office
show
that
about
62%
of
veterans&#8217;
claims
are
older
than
125
days.
That&#8217;s
unacceptable.
It&#8217;s
time
for
greater
accountability
at
the
VA.
That&#8217;s
why
I
support
a
bill
working
its
way
through
Congress&#8212; the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act &#8212;to
hold
senior
level
VA
managers
accountable
for
the
agency&#8217;s
progress.
Current
law
puts
layers
and
layers
of
red
tape
in
the
way
before
a
senior
manager
at
the
VA
can
be
held
accountable
for
their
actions.
This
bill
would
cut
away
a
lot
of
that
red
tape
to
give
the
Secretary
the
authority
to
clean
up
the
agency.
As
Speaker
John
Boehner
recently
said
when
talking
about
the
bill,
&#8220;The
VA
is
failing
our
veterans
and
their
families.
It&#8217;s
time
we
hold
these
people
accountable
and
get
people
in
there
who
can
fix
this
backlog
once
and
for
all.&#8221;
This
week,
the
House
will
vote
on
funding
legislation
for
the
VA
that
continues
our
efforts
to
upgrade
their
computer
systems
and
provide
the
personnel
needed
to
solve
this
problem.
At
the
meeting
in
Bend,
I
had
the
chance
to
recognize
three
recent
service
academy
appointees
from
Central
Oregon,
Emily
Shunk
(left)
accepted
an
appointment
to
the
US
Air
Force
Academy;
Tim
Gorman
(center)
and
Braden
Bell
(shaking
hand)
accepted
an
appointment
to
West
Point.
Being
nominated
to
one
of
our
nation&#8217;s
service
academies
represents
years
of
hard
work
and
discipline.
It
takes
a
special
commitment
to
pursue
the
rigors
of
an
academy
education,
and
these
young
Americans
are
continuing
a
long
line
of
patriotic
Oregonians
in
their
endeavor.

FDA
pulls
back
on
regulations
that
could
harm
brewers,
ranchers,
consumers
I&#8217;ve
told
you
before
about
a
new
proposal
from
the
FDA
that
could
harm
Oregon&#8217;s
brewers,
ranchers,
and
consumers.
It
is
common
for
brewers
to
give
or
sell
a
byproduct
of
the
brewing
process&#8212;known
as
&#8220;spent
grains&#8221;&#8212;to
local
ranchers
for
use
as
animal
feed.
But
the
FDA
has
proposed
tightly
regulating
this
practice
to
prevent
food-borne
illness,
even
though
there&#8217;s
never
been
a
case
we
are
aware
of
where
spent
grains
from
a
brewery
fed
to
cattle
caused
any
kind
of
food-borne
illness.
It&#8217;s
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem.
I
met
with
brewers
and
ranchers
from
Central
Oregon
last
week
about
this
issue.
If
the
rule
were
to
go
through,
it
could
have
a
big
impact
on
both
these
groups,
and
even
force
them
to
raise
costs
on
beer
and
beef
sold
to
consumers.
No
one
wants
that.
After
the
meeting,
the
FDA
announced
they
would
rework
the
rules.
That&#8217;s
encouraging,
but
I
will
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
agency&#8217;s
actions
moving
forward
to
make
sure
the
final
proposal
doesn&#8217;t
unnecessarily
harm
these
small
businesses
or
consumers.
I
was
able
to
achieve
a
similar
success
when
it
came
to
proposed
irrigation
regulations
the
FDA
drafted
for
onions
that
were
also
completely
unworkable.
The
FDA
listened
and
pulled
back
those
draft
rules,
too.
Promoting
forest
access
in
John
Day
On
Friday,
it
was
on
to
John
Day
for
a
meeting
on
forest
access
with
Grant
County
citizens.
I
was
joined
by
John
Bastian
of
the
Grant
County
Snowballers
(local
snowmobile
club),
Commissioners
Boyd
Britton
and
Chris
Labhart,
and
other
members
of
the
community.
We
discussed
legislation
I
have
introduced
to
stop
the
Forest
Service&#8217;s
travel
management
rule,
the
Forest
Access
in
Rural
Communities
Act.
This
legislation
would
require
the
Forest
Service
to
get
input
and
consent
from
affected
counties
before
any
future
road
closure
could
take
effect.
It
would
help
bring
local
input
and
needs
back
into
the
process
and
ensure
that
local
citizens
have
a
clear
say
on
the
management
actions
that
affect
the
forests
that
surround
them.
For
too
long,
the
input
and
wishes
of
local
citizens
have
been
pushed
to
the
backseat
when
it
comes
to
decisions
about
access
to
our
public
lands.
This
common-sense
bill
will
put
local
communities
back
in
the
driver&#8217;s
seat
in
the
Forest
Service&#8217;s
travel
management
planning
process.
Teaming
up
with
Facebook
to
help
small
businesses
grow
Finally,
thank
you
to
Facebook
for
hosting
workshops
in
Medford
and
Bend
to
help
small
businesses
learn
to
use
social
media
to
better
to
reach
customers.
More
than
200
people
turned
out
for
each
session!
It
was
great
to
attend
these
two
sessions
to
meet
more
Oregon
entrepreneurs
who
are
the
real
engines
of
job
growth
in
our
economy.
Helping
Oregon&#8217;s
small
businesses
grow
and
create
more
jobs
is
essential
if
we&#8217;re
going
to
lower
our
unemployment
rate
and
boost
the
wages
of
workers.
That&#8217;s
all
for
this
time.
Have
a
great
week.

regards,
Greg
Walden
