Heller Calls for Reno VARO Director to
Resign
Says Enough is Enough; VA Should
Consider Taking Immediate Steps for His
Removal
(Washington, D.C.)
After reviewing a report by the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General
on the Reno VA Regional Office (VARO), U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) today called for
the resignation of Ed Russell, Director of
the Reno VARO. The Reno VARO is responsible
for processing benefits claims for veterans
living throughout the state of
Nevada.
Enough is enough, said
Senator Dean Heller. Ed Russell
should either resign or the Department of
Veterans Affairs should take immediate
steps to ensure his removal. The Reno VARO
has consistently topped the charts as one
of the worst-performing regional offices in
the nation, and, just today, a report from
the VA Inspector General asserts that these
problems have persisted due to poor
management.
Nevada veterans should not be
forced to wait for their disability
benefits due to managements bad
decisions. There are hard-working men and
women who show up every day at the Reno
VARO in order to help Nevadas
veterans, but unfortunately Ed
Russells poor management practices
are impeding progress.
The VA Inspector General is expected to
release the report this afternoon detailing
problems at the Reno VARO. The VA Inspector
General releases a report evaluating each
VARO once every three years.
