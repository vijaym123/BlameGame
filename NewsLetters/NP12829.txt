Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Telephone Town Hall
We concluded the month of January this week by hosting our first
district-wide telephone town hall of 2014. Keeping the lines of
communication open has always been a priority for my office.
Residents from Miami, Kingston, Broken Bow, McAlester, Soper, Madill
and Checotah, among other towns, asked questions on a variety of issues
including the high cost of propane, Obamacare, and the overzealous
executive branch. I appreciated so many people taking time out of their
schedules to join us in our seventh telephone town hall since taking
office. It is important to always be accessible and accountable to the
people I am privileged to represent. I also appreciate hearing from
them on what issues they are most concerned about.

hall.
State of the Union
The President gave his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. In
his remarks, he confirmed that his bipartisan talking points are
hollow. His willingness to circumvent Congress, the clear
representation of the American people and American values, shows his
agenda of hope and change is just rhetoric. Threatening ultimatums for
if and when Congress doesn't act contradicts our founding principles.
Forcing an executive agenda, without constructive conversation, creates
a divided nation. Let's sit down with our nation's best interests in
mind and come to bipartisan solutions that put America back in business.
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act
This week I voted today in support of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding
for Abortion Act. The House approved the measure with a vote of
227-188.
In April 2011, CNN conducted a poll that revealed 61% of those
responding were in opposition to supporting abortion with public funds.
Taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortions. The American people
have made that quite clear. And as their representatives, we expressed
their voice this week. I will continue to work to protect the unborn,
and H.R. 7 helps achieve that goal.
Various federal policies, that received bipartisan support in the past,
currently prohibit taxpayer funded abortions: the Hyde amendment, the
Smith Federal Employees Health Benefits Program amendment, and the
Dornan amendment. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the
Hyde Amendment alone is estimated to result in up to 675,000 less
abortions annually. Yet these policies are only approved on a year by
year basis, typically through appropriations bills. H.R. 7 makes these
pro-life policies permanent and ensures the sanctity of life will
continue to be protected.
Government Regulation
The federal government must stop putting people out of business through
regulation, and help get our country back to work. Click the picture
below to listen to my remarks on the House floor this week about
regulation and accountability in the federal government.
Farm Bill
The House of Representatives passed the Conference Report on H.R. 2642 -
the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 - also
known as the farm bill. I supported the 5-year farm bill to ensure
stability throughout America's farming community and cut $23 billion in
spending from the previous farm bill. We cannot continue to handcuff
our farmers and ranchers across the nation and expect to move forward.
While some work was done in the area of SNAP reform, the farm bill is
not perfect. But we have reached a bipartisan solution that farmers can
depend on for the next few years. I commend Chairman Frank Lucas on his
unwavering support of rural Oklahoma and his commitment to America's
agriculture.
Week Ahead
The month of February brings the debate over the debt ceiling and
whether the United States should raise its borrowing limit. Back in
October, our nation's debt ceiling was suspended to February 7.

No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act
This
week
I
voted
today
in
support
of
H.R.
7,
the
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act.
The
House
approved
the
measure
with
a
vote
of
227-188.
In

CNN
conducted
a
poll
that
revealed
61%
of
those
responding
were
in
opposition
to
supporting
abortion
with
public
funds.
Taxpayers
should
not
be
forced
to
fund
abortions.
The
American
people
have
made
that
quite
clear.
And
as
their
representatives,
we
expressed
their
voice
this
week .
I
will
continue
to
work
to
protect
the
unborn,
and
H.R.
7
helps
achieve
that
goal.
Various
federal
policies,
that
received
bipartisan
support
in
the
past,
currently
prohibit
taxpayer
funded
abortions:
the
Hyde
amendment,
the
Smith
Federal
Employees
Health
Benefits
Program
amendment,
and
the
Dornan
amendment.
According
to
the
Congressional
Budget
Office,
the
Hyde
Amendment
alone
is
estimated
to
result
in
up
to
675,000
less
abortions
annually.
Yet
these
policies
are
only
approved
on
a
year
by
year
basis,
typically
through
appropriations
bills.
H.R.
7
makes
these
pro-life
policies
permanent
and
ensures
the
sanctity
of
life
will
continue
to
be
protected.
Government
Regulation
The
federal
government
must
stop
putting
people
out
of
business
through
regulation,
and
help
get
our
country
back
to
work.

on
the
House
floor
this
week
about
regulation
and
accountability
in
the
federal
government.
Farm
Bill
The
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Conference
Report
on
H.R.
2642
&#8211;
the
Federal
Agriculture
Reform
and
Risk
Management
Act

&#8211;
also
known
as

I
supported
the
5-year
farm
bill
to
ensure
stability
throughout
America&#8217;s
farming
community
and
cut
$23
billion
in

from
the
previous
farm
bill.
We
cannot
continue
to
handcuff
our
farmers
and
ranchers
across
the
nation
and
expect
to
move
forward.
While
some
work
was
done
in
the
area
of
SNAP
reform,
the
farm
bill
is
not
perfect.
But
we
have
reached
a
bipartisan
solution
that
farmers
can
depend
on
for
the
next
few
years.
I
commend
Chairman
Frank
Lucas
on
his
unwavering
support
of
rural
Oklahoma
and
his
commitment
to
America&#8217;s
agriculture.
Week
Ahead The
month
of
February
brings
the
debate
over
the
debt
ceiling
and
whether
the
United
States
should
raise

Back

our
nation's
