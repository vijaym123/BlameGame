Dick Durbin just emailed you for the second time in a month. Here&rsquo;s why:
-- we&rsquo;re 43 DAYS out
-- Brad&rsquo;s race is a TOSS UP
-- and Republicans are about to start their
biggest
ad buy of the election. Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:
if we let up, even for a second, Brad&rsquo;s first re-election will be in serious jeopardy. So, we&rsquo;ve got a decision to make. Either we all step up for Brad today, or we could be in for a Republican takeover of Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district.
That&rsquo;s not an option. If you agree, join our campaign:
