New Guidance Available for Applying ASCE
24-05 to Hazard Mitigation Flood Projects - FEMA has released
the publication of
FEMA Policy
203-074-1 ,
Minimum Design Standards for Hazard Mitigation Assistance
(HMA) Projects in Flood Hazard Areas . The policy will align
structure elevation, dry flood proofing and mitigation reconstruction
projects in flood hazard areas, that are funded by the
HMA grant program , with a nationally recognized
consensus standard for flood resistant design and
construction.
The Federal Insurance and Mitigation
Administrations (FIMA) HMA programs provide grant funding assistance to state,
local, tribal, and territorial governments for eligible and
cost-effective projects that increase resiliency by reducing and eliminating
risks to property from flood hazards and their effects. All HMA-funded
projects in flood hazard areas will be required to be designed and built
according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard
24-05, Flood Resistant Design and Construction, or its equivalent, as
the minimum design criteria. ASCE 24-05 is a nationally recognized
consensus standard for all flood resistant design and construction
projects. The use of this recognized standard, and involvement of licensed
design professionals for design and construction of HMA-funded projects
in flood hazard areas, will provide for more consistent and efficient
verification of engineering and technical feasibility and will help
preserve the public investment toward reducing
risk.
FEMA has also developed an implementation guidebook,
Guidance for Applying ASCE 24-05
Engineering Standards to Hazard Mitigation Flood Retrofitting and
Reconstruction Projects , which identifies key design and
construction requirements that apply to HMA flood mitigation projects. The
guidebook also provides guidance on how the standard should be applied to
each HMA-eligible flood project
type.
