You're Invited: New Hampshire Veterans Forum with VA Officials
Dear Friends,
Throughout my travels in New Hampshire and during my town hall meetings, I've heard numerous concerns from our veterans about the VA's problematic roll-out of the Veterans Choice Card program in our state. I have been working with Senator Shaheen to address these problems and to ensure that the VA implements the program as Congress intended. As a part of our ongoing efforts, Senator Shaheen and I are inviting New Hampshire veterans to attend a public forum with VA officials on Tuesday, May 26, at 2 p.m. at Saint Anselm College. The forum is free and open to the public.
We're hosting this forum in order to provide New Hampshire veterans with an opportunity to hear directly from VA officials and ask questions regarding their health care options under the Choice Card program. Representatives from VA New England Healthcare System, Manchester VA Medical Center, and White River Junction VA Medical Center are scheduled to participate. The forum will be moderated by Jack Heath, Host of New Hampsire Today on WGIR, WQSO, and iHeart Radio.
New Hampshire veterans deserve to know their options when it comes to receiving health care under the Veterans Choice Card program, and I hope this forum will help provide veterans with accurate information about how to use the program. I will continue my efforts to ensure this program is properly implemented so that New Hampshire veterans have more choices to receive quality, timely care closer to home.
If you or someone you know is a veteran interested in learning more about the Veterans Choice Card program, please join us on Tuesday. More details are below - I hope to see you there.
