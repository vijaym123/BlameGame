Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, President Obama created a large new national monument in
Dona Ana County, New Mexico. This new national monument designation is
yet another example of President Obama overstepping his authority and
blatantly disregarding the rule of law. Congress gave presidents the
ability to designate national monuments in order to protect small,
specific areas of land, not large swaths of a state. It is unacceptable
for a president to abuse this authority and I will do everything in my
power to rein in this practice and fight this overreach.
In addition, by creating this monument, the President ignored the very
real possibility that it will endanger the lives of American citizens.
Since the Border Patrol is not allowed to patrol national monument
lands, this monument will become a safe haven for the smuggling of
drugs and illegal immigrants, endangering the lives of countless
people. The President's apparent disregard for the safety of this
country's citizens is simply shocking. To read more, click HERE

Our Veterans Deserve Better
When the employees of the VA are more concerned about concealing
lengthy wait times than about caring for our veterans, it's obvious
that the agency has a serious lack of accountability. In order to
prevent deaths such as those that likely occurred due to negligence at
the Phoenix VA from occurring again, Congress and President Obama must
hold senior VA employees accountable when they are found to have
committed acts of malfeasance and fail in their responsibility to
provide timely and quality care for our veterans. To that end, I voted
on Wednesday for the Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act, which would allow for the Secretary of the VA to
fire senior executives who are inept. Currently, these bureaucrats have
so many protections that it is nearly impossible for them to be fired.
Veterans fought honorably to protect this nation and our freedoms. Now
it's our turn to fight for them. I will continue to seek answers about
what exactly happened at the Phoenix VA and to take measures to ensure
that veterans receive the care they were promised. Click HERE

Demanding Better Protections
On Thursday, I voted against the so-called USA Freedom Act. The
original Freedom Act, of which I'm proud to have been an original
cosponsor, would have prevented the federal government from
unconstitutionally spying on innocent Americans, ended the bulk
collection of private information and required the FISA court, which
operates in secrecy, to become more transparent and operate like a real
judicial court. These are necessary reforms demanded by Americans and
our Constitution. The original bill provided important protections for
American citizens' civil liberties. Unfortunately, however, this
legislation was changed at the last minute, causing me to withdraw my
support and vote against its passage. The key reforms in the original
bill were stripped or weakened to such an extent that I could not in
good faith continue to support it.
I was not sent to Congress to be a
rubber stamp for business as usual.
Although the bill contains a few improvements to current law - such as
minor reforms to FISA courts - the legislation was severely weakened
and still permits the large-scale collection of private data without
complying with basic 4th Amendment requirements. Even more maddening is
the fact that a provision was snuck in to the revised bill that extends
Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act through 2017. The original version of the
Freedom Act let this dangerous provision expire in 2015. The Patriot
Act needs a full and fair debate. Sneaking in an extension is not in
the public's best interest.
I am disappointed that the House accepted this watered down piece of
trash, which was endorsed and pushed by the Obama administration and
fails to remedy serious government abuses. Our citizens deserve a
government that upholds the Constitution and protects our constituents'
civil liberties and privacy. A real opportunity was missed this week to
fight back against an overreaching federal government that has violated
the trust and rights of its citizens. Rest assured that I will continue
to fight to end this unconstitutional practice. Click HERE

Honoring Mr. Conservative
My bill that would name the post office at 442 Miller Valley Road in
Prescott after Barry Goldwater cleared a key hurdle on Wednesday. It
passed the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, on which I
serve, and now awaits action by the full House of Representatives.
Barry Goldwater served Arizona and our nation with honor and integrity
for decades. His lengthy tenure as a public servant included five terms
in the United States Senate and a nomination to be the Republican
candidate for president in 1964. Known as 'Mr. Conservative,' he was
influential in the revival of political conservatism during the 1960s.
I have deep respect for Barry Goldwater and his efforts to restore
conservatism in our nation and I'm pleased the Committee recognized
that this patriotic American deserves a fitting tribute. I now urge the
full House to take up this bill in a timely manner. Click HERE

Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
As one of the largest suppliers of turquoise, Kingman, Arizona is
termed the Turquoise Capital of the World. The turquoise is sourced out
of a mountain just to the northwest of town. Kingman gained the title
Turquoise Capital of the World due to some smart marketing on the part
of Leonard Hardy, who produced and sold turquoise in Kingman.

Dear
Friend,
On

President
Obama
created
a
large
new
national
monument
in
Dona
Ana
County,
New
Mexico.
This
new
national
monument
designation
is
yet
another
example
of
President
Obama
overstepping
his
authority

Congress

presidents
the
ability
to
designate
national
monuments
in
order
to
protect

not
large
swaths
of
a

It
is
unacceptable
for
a

to
abuse
this
authority
and
I
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
rein
in
this
practice
and
fight
this
overreach.
In
addition,
by
creating
this
monument,
the
President
ignored
the
very
real
possibility
that
it
will
endanger
the
lives
of
American
citizens.
Since
the
Border
Patrol
is
not
allowed
to

national
monument
lands,
this
monument
will
become
a
safe
haven
for
the
smuggling
of
drugs
and
illegal
immigrants,
endangering
the
lives
of
countless
people.
The
President's
apparent

When
the

are
more
concerned
about
concealing
lengthy
wait

than
about
caring

it's
obvious
that
the
agency
has
a
serious
lack
of

In
order
to
prevent
deaths
such
as
those
that
likely
occurred
due
to
negligence
at
the

Congress

To
that

I

Act,
which
would
allow
for
the
Secretary
of

Currently,
these

Now
it's

fight
for
them.
I

Demanding

On
Thursday,
I
voted
against
the
so-called
USA
Freedom

The
original
Freedom

of
which
I&#8217;m
proud
to
have

would
have
prevented
the

ended
the
bulk

and
required
the
FISA
court,
which
operates
in
secrecy,
to
become
more
transparent
and
operate
like
a
real
judicial
court.
These
are
necessary
reforms
demanded
by
Americans
and
our
Constitution.
The
original
bill
provided
important
protections
for
American
citizens'
civil

Unfortunately,
however,
this
legislation
was
changed
at
the
last

causing
me
to
withdraw
my

and
vote
against
its

The
key

to
such
an
extent
that
I
could
not

it.
I
was
not
sent
to
Congress
to
be
a
rubber

Although
the
bill
contains
a
few
improvements
to
current
law
-
such

-
the
legislation
was

Sec.
215
of

The

Our

A

opportunity
was
missed
this

to

against
an
overreaching
federal

that
has
violated
the

Rest

included
five

the
