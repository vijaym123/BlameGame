Support Affordable Child Care &gt;&gt;
Child care is critical for working parents. However, the average cost of child care in Illinois is $12,697 per year -- or more than half the median annual income for a single mother!
Cheri is leading the effort to expand quality, affordable child care.

David --
Working families should never have to choose between child care and putting food on the table.
But in Illinois, child care costs an average of $12,697 a year -- more than half the median income for single moms.
Working families shouldn&rsquo;t have to spend over half their income on child care. It&rsquo;s just not right. Sign your name: Stand up for affordable child care&gt;&gt;
Cheri is in Congress fighting to expand economic opportunity. And that means that middle class families should have access to affordable and quality child care. Stand with Cheri to support more affordable child care: http://action.cheribustos.com/affordable-child-care
