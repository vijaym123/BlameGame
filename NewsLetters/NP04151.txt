Dear Friend,
It's that time again! Join Joyce and me in
supporting small businesses this Saturday by shopping locally this
weekend!
Small
businesses employ nearly half (48.5%) of all private sector employees and
create more than half of the private non-farm gross domestic product.
With about 28.2 million small businesses estimated in the U.S., that's
a lot of jobs!
Thank you in advance for joining us in
honoring small businesses this Saturday and every day. Small business owners
are the backbone of our economy.
Forward this email to your friends and family and pass on the
message!
Thank you,
Enter e-mail
