Rep. Miller Reinforces Need to Pass Legislation to Strengthen Border Security
WASHINGTON D.C.
&#8211; Today, Rep. Candice Miller (MI-10),
Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,
issued the following statement reinforcing the need to strengthen border security:
&#8220;Last night, with zero regard for the popular will of the American people, who have rejected his policies on immigration, the President took it upon himself to grant amnesty to millions of immigrants here illegally.
This action, like
the President&#8217;s 2012
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program that contributed to this summer&#8217;s surge of unaccompanied minors crossing our southern border, is certain to
increase the number of those seeking refuge in the U.S. illegally and underscores the urgent need to improve our border security.
&#8220;Last year, the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee introduced legislation that included a strategic plan for improving our border security with specific metrics
on achieving operational control of our borders. The legislation unanimously passed the Subcommittee and the full Committee with broad bipartisan support. To address the urgent need to improve our border security, I plan to work with Committee Chairman, Rep.
Michael McCaul, and my colleagues on Homeland, from both sides of the aisle, to refine the legislation.
&#8220;The President challenged Congress to pass a bill, and I fully intend to work to pass border security legislation as soon as Congress reconvenes in January.
If we pass this bill, I would then challenge President Obama to sign it and prove he is serious about the American people's top priority on the immigration issue, which is the need to secure our border.&quot;
