Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

It All STEMS From Education
I joined a panel Monday at the Madison County Science, Technology,
Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) Roundtable Discussion in Edwardsville.
STEM and CTE (Career & Technical Education) are vital in training the
next generation of workers in the critical skills they need to enter
the emerging market of high-tech manufacturing. Over the past decade,
STEM careers have grown three times faster than non-STEM jobs. The
panel included Congressman Rodney Davis (R, Illinois-13), left, Rob
Werden of Madison County CTE, speaking, and Bob Daiber, the Regional
Superintendent of Schools, far right.
House Takes Aim At IRS Targeting Of Conservative Organizations
I supported three separate bills this past week to rein in the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) and protect American taxpayers. The legislation
comes in response to the IRS's widespread targeting of conservative and
Tea Party affiliated groups first documented in a 2013 report
from the Treasury Department's Inspector
General.
Americans shouldn't have to live in fear of their own government. The
targeting and harassment of anyone for their political or religious
beliefs is outrageous and unacceptable.
Given the bipartisan support these bills received in the House, I urge
my Senate colleagues to act quickly and help us reassure our
constituents back home that their elected representatives have zero
tolerance for government abuse.
The three bills are:
H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of
2014
, which prevents proposed IRS regulations
on 501(c)(4) organizations from taking effect;
H.R. 2530, the Taxpayer Transparency and Efficient Audit
Act, which requires the IRS to disclose to
taxpayers when the IRS has shared their tax information with another
government agency and places a time limit on how long an individual can
be subjected to an IRS audit;
H.R. 2531, the Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act
, which prevents the IRS from inquiring
about an individual's religious, political, or social beliefs.
New Chemicals In Commerce Act Fosters Manufacturing Renaissance
On Thursday, I presented draft legislation
to modernize the regulation of chemicals in
commerce. The Chemicals in Commerce Act (CICA) keys off a bipartisan
bill introduced in the Senate and provides a solution to improve public
confidence in the safety of chemicals produced and used in the United
States and to encourage innovation and job creation.
The draft legislation would provide much-needed updates and
improvements to the current law regulating the management of U.S.
chemicals - the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). It
reforms the law to ensure a transparent, workable, and risk-based
process for chemical review and regulation. It would create a
commonsense prioritization and evaluation program for all existing
chemicals in commerce and establish a uniform federal standard to help
better facilitate interstate commerce in chemicals and other downstream
U.S. manufactured goods. The bill would also broaden access to specific
chemical information while maintaining protection of intellectual
property.
Over the past year, my Environment and the Economy Subcommittee has set
out on a comprehensive review of chemical regulation. We held a total
of five hearings examining what has worked in the current law and what
can be improved. Through our evaluation, we determined that in order to
have a system that works best for public safety and our economy, we
must modernize the regulatory process.
This discussion draft begins the legislative phase of the committee's
work, and I am hopeful we can get something across the finish line with
strong bipartisan support. It is a win-win solution that will improve
safety protections while promoting innovation and economic growth
across multiple sectors of our economy. Let's continue our
manufacturing renaissance.
Department Of Defense Investing In Illinois' Digital Manufacturing
Congressman Rodney Davis (R, Illinois-13) and I last week welcomed the
news that the UI LABS, a Chicago-based research and commercialization
collaborative, has been awarded $70 million from the U.S. Department of
Defense for the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation (DMDI)
Institute
. The federal investment for the DMDI Institute
will be used to establish the Digital Lab for Manufacturing (Digital
Lab), led by UI LABS.
"With the state of Illinois' strong tradition in manufacturing, it's
only fitting that we remain at the forefront of the future of
manufacturing, and that's digital manufacturing," said Davis. "Like the
University of Illinois' world-class Research Park in Urbana-Champaign,
this lab will operate on the principals of innovation and
entrepreneurship...It will spur long-term economic growth and job
creation, with as many as 75,000 jobs created in the first five years
alone. And now, through the work of the university, we will see defense
companies, contractors, and manufacturers across the country looking to
the state of Illinois as the national hub for digital manufacturing."
In addition to the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois
University, Lake Land College, and Southwestern Illinois College are
partnering in this program. Local employers, such as Boeing, General
Dynamics, and Caterpillar, are also key partners in advancing new
manufacturing techniques.
Digital manufacturing is here, and we need to embrace this technology
and advance its use in order to maintain and grow our competitive
advantages in Illinois. Training will also be vital to accomplish the
implementation of the research at this new lab.

House
Takes
Aim
At
IRS
Targeting
Of
Conservative
Organizations
I
supported
three
separate
bills
this
past
week
to
rein
in
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
and
protect
American
taxpayers.
The
legislation
comes
in
response
to
the
IRS&#8217;s
widespread
targeting
of
conservative
and
Tea
Party
affiliated
groups
first
documented
in
a
2013
report
from
the
Treasury
Department&#8217;s
Inspector
General.
Americans
shouldn&#8217;t
have
to
live
in
fear
of
their
own
government.
The
targeting
and
harassment
of
anyone
for
their
political
or
religious
beliefs
is
outrageous
and
unacceptable.
Given
the
bipartisan
support
these
bills
received
in
the
House,
I
urge
my
Senate
colleagues
to
act
quickly
and
help
us
reassure
our
constituents
back
home
that
their
elected
representatives
have
zero
tolerance
for
government
abuse.
The
three
bills
are: &#8226;
H.R.
3865,
the
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
of
2014 ,
which prevents
proposed
IRS
regulations
on
501(c)(4)
organizations
from
taking
effect; &#8226;
H.R.
2530,
the
Taxpayer
Transparency

Efficient
Audit
Act,
which requires
the
IRS
to
disclose
to taxpayers
when
the
IRS
has
shared
their
tax
information
with
another
government
agency
and
places
a
time
limit
on
how
long
an
individual
can
be
subjected
to
an
IRS
audit; &#8226;
H.R.
2531,
the
Protecting
Taxpayers
from

Act ,
which prevents
the
IRS
from
inquiring
about
an

New Chemicals

and
to

The
draft
legislation
would
provide
much-needed
updates
and

to
the
current
law
regulating
the
management
of
U.S.
chemicals &#8211;
the
decades-old

It
reforms

It
would

The

Over
the
past
year,
my
Environment

has
set

on
a
comprehensive

of
chemical
regulation.
We
held
a
total
of
five
hearings
examining
what
has
worked
in
the
current
law
and
what
can
be
improved.
Through
our
evaluation,
we
determined
that
in
order
to
have
a
system
that
works
best
for
public
safety
and
our

we

a
win-win

that
will
improve

Department
Of
Defense
Investing
In
Illinois'
Digital
Manufacturing
Congressman
Rodney
Davis
(R,
Illinois-13)
and
I
last
week
welcomed
the
news
that
the
UI
LABS,
a
Chicago-based

has
been
awarded
$70
million
from
the
U.S.
Department
of

Davis.
&#8220;Like
the
University

world-class

in
Urbana-Champaign,
this
lab
will
operate
on
the
principals

long-term
economic
growth
and
job
creation,
with
as
many
as
75,000
jobs
created
in
the
first five
years
alone.
And
now,
through
the
work
of
the
university,
we
will
see
defense
companies,
contractors,
and
manufacturers
across
the
country
looking
to
the
state
of
Illinois
as
the
national
hub
for

we
