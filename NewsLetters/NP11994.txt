As Americans,
one of our most cherished values is freedom of speech.
Our
Founding Fathers enshrined free speech in the First Amendment to the
Constitution, and we have worked over the generations
through today
to
protect that cherished principle from any and all
threats.
Unfortunately, we have learned over the past year that the IRS
has been engaged in a systematic campaign to target and punish
organizations who want to practice free speech and advance their political
beliefs.
While President Obama called it a phony scandal, in fact,
it was an outrageous abuse of government power.
As Americans,
we should never tolerate the use of government agencies to silence
people through backdoor regulations.
This is the type of
authoritarianism that we freed ourselves from during the War of Independence, and
if it took place in a foreign country today, we would all be united
in condemning it.
This week, I joined a majority of my
House colleagues in protecting freedom of speech and stopping
government abuse.
We passed H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs Act of 2014.
This bill will prohibit for one year a
proposal by the IRS to unilaterally change their regulations governing
501(c)(4) organizations.
501(c)(4) organizations are non-profit
groups like civic leagues and volunteer fire departments that are
primarily engaged in promoting social welfare. However, 501(c)(4)s can also
engage in political activity, so long as the majority of their money
is spent on social welfare. The IRS proposed rules would impact
501(c)(4) organizations by redefining non-partisan voter registration and
candidate forum activities as political campaign intervention.
We
believe it is essential that Congress complete its investigation into
the IRS scandals before the IRS push these rules into effect.
Our bill will give us the time to do that and ensure that free speech is
protected.
Im pleased that H.R. 3865 passed in a strong
bipartisan vote, 243 to 176.
We also passed a series of other
bills as part of what we called Stop Government Abuse Week.
These
bills
all of which passed with my support
include legislation
requiring the IRS to notify you when your information has been shared
with other government agencies, stronger safeguards against government
seizure of your property, and even a bill allowing you to unlock your
cell phone.
In a similar vein, the Judiciary Committee
held a hearing this week on Presidential abuse of power and the
Presidents failure to execute the law.
One witness, constitutional
law professor Jonathan Turley, said President Obama has brought us to a
constitutional tipping point that has to be addressed.
