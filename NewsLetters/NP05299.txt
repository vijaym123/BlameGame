Friend -- I know I&#39;m sending A LOT of emails.
It&#39;s because this election couldn&rsquo;t be closer. PLEASE PAUSE what you&#39;re doing and READ THIS:
The election is tied. Seriously -- 12 races are TIED.
The GOP&rsquo;s plan to break the tie? A $5 MILLION spending advantage over the last 13 days.
That&rsquo;s a huge amount -- and it could tip the election if we don&rsquo;t respond.
We
can
beat the Republicans with our massive Get Out The Vote operation, but frankly, we&#39;re short on funding. Our leadership team is making a tough decision TODAY -- will we need to cut GOTV from key states?
Friend, will you donate to help us win and avoid a heartbreaking last-minute disappointment? We&rsquo;ll TRIPLE-MATCH your gift until midnight only.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
or donate another amount.
I won&rsquo;t lie: This isn&rsquo;t going to be a walk in the park.
National Journal
reports that this election &ldquo;is going to come down to old-fashioned trench warfare, fought on a race-by-race basis.&rdquo; And without your support, we risk having to pull out of key states.
But if you give today, we&rsquo;ll stay competitive all over the map, deploy our staff and volunteers, and use our ground game to compete against the GOP&rsquo;s big bucks. That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll win.
Friend, there are only 13 days left. Your donation will make a difference -- THE difference. Please, donate NOW to allow us to win.
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
