Dear Friend,
There were no votes in Congress this week and I enjoyed spending it at
home in Memphis, where I helped open the new Fairway Manor affordable
housing complex, had the opportunity to speak with elementary school
students about the importance of public service, and participated in a
conference focused on ensuring that our community's cemeteries are
properly maintained and respected. Keep reading to learn more about
what I did in Memphis this week.

Keeping Housing Affordable
Yesterday, I was pleased to be at the grand opening of the Fairway
Manor Apartments, a celebration of the continuing mission of building
affordable housing in Memphis. The Fairway Manor Apartments have now
replaced Graves Manor, and the 28 new multi-family units along with 68
units for the elderly will help change the fortunes of our community.
The Fairway Manor project was made possible by the federal Low Income
Housing Tax Credit and HUD Capital Funds. Those funds will not only
transform the physical condition of this public housing community but
it will positively impact the lives of the Fairway Manor residents.
Affordable housing is an extremely important and vital issue for the
City of Memphis. Even though the economy is slowly climbing out of the
recession, many Memphians are still struggling to put a roof over their
heads. While some in Congress, including Republican Budget Chairman
Paul Ryan, are trying to cut funding to programs that help build and
develop affordable housing, I will continue my efforts to reach across
the aisle to increase the allocation of federal funding for housing
programs-and I am always advocating for more of that funding to come to
Memphis.
Jackson Elementary School Career Day
Yesterday was career day at Jackson Elementary School, and I enjoyed
the opportunity to speak with several classes about why I chose public
service and my role as the Ninth District's Congressman. With many of
Jackson Elementary's fifth graders having recently learned about our
federal government, I was glad to be able to talk to them and answer
questions about how the legislative branch works.
Supporting Memphis Families and Workers
I received an "A" grade-the highest grade awarded to any member of the
Tennessee Congressional Delegation-from the United Food & Commercial
Workers International Union (UFCW) for my votes over the last year to
improve the lives of workers and their families. The UFCW is made up of
more than 1.3 million people working primarily in grocery and retail
stores, and in the food processing and meat packing industries.
It is an honor to be recognized for my efforts to give working
Memphians and their families a fair shot at a better life. Workers'
rights must be protected and all Americans who work hard and play by
the rules should be able to lead a long and happy life, earn a fair and
livable wage, keep a roof over their families' heads, and put food on
their tables.
Helping Maintain and Preserve African-American Cemeteries
Earlier this afternoon, I spoke at the 8th annual "Memorial in May"
cemetery preservation conference at Rhodes College, put together by the
Preservation of African American Cemeteries (PAAC) organization. In
2009, I was part of a Congressional hearing with Congressman Bobby Rush
of Illinois to look into the Burr Oak Cemetery scandal, where employees
had been charged with digging up more than 200 graves and reselling the
plots. The cemetery was the final resting place for lynching victim
Emmett Till, legendary blues singers Dinah Washington and Willie Dixon
and thousands of others, and it is one of the Chicago area's most
storied black cemeteries.
Our hearing produced the Bereaved Consumers Protection Act, which I
cosponsored in 2010, which would force cemetery directors to bolster
their record keeping and make those records available to federal, state
and local officials. It would also create a kind of consumer Bill of
Rights for cemeteries, prohibiting directors from misleading customers
about the prices of funeral goods and services, and clarifying
contracts for burial plots, entombments and inurnments.
But just this January, Galilee Memorial Gardens in Memphis was shut
down because of allegations that the workers allegedly stacked bodies
and buried corpses outside of the cemetery. In an effort to prevent
this from happening again, I have also signed on as a cosponsor of the
Funeral Rule Improvement Act of 2014, would expand regulations on
cemeteries and subject owners to up to $10,000 in penalties if they
violate the rules.
Cemeteries are the final resting place and marker for each life. It is
the place loved ones gather to visit, remember, embrace and celebrate
those who have passed and those who are part of one's ancestry. These
irreplaceable cultural resources tell the real stories of our history;
yet, they are neglected, lost and essentially forgotten-but they should
not be.The desecration of bodies shouldn't be allowed to occur. I will
continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure cemeteries
are respected.
Fighting for Struggling Students
This morning, I joined U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and several other
Senators and Representatives in sending a letter to Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan urging him to bring more fairness to struggling
students by establishing clear standards of eligibility for "undue
hardship" discharge of federal student loans in bankruptcy. These
standards would benefit the most vulnerable borrowers by bringing
consistency to the manner in which the Department of Education's
contractors handle undue hardship claims.
Because federal law currently treats student loan debt as
"non-dischargable" in bankruptcy, mountains of student debt can follow
borrowers around for a lifetime-even if they are unable to pay it off.
The law does allow certain borrowers to discharge the debt if they can
prove an "undue hardship," but that path is too often blocked by
unscrupulous contractors working for the Department of Education who
use aggressive tactics to unfairly fight against these types of
discharge in court, even when they are clearly needed by the borrower.
The New York Times ran a story
about some of these aggressive tactics and how they hurt American
families earlier this year.
While the federal government should do all it can to fairly collect on
student loan debts owed by borrowers, it is not sensible or
cost-effective for the Department of Education or its contractors to
engage in lengthy legal challenges and appeals against bankrupt student
loan borrowers who have demonstrated a clear and legitimate inability
to repay their loans.
I have also introduced a bill
to repeal some changes made to the bankruptcy code in 2005 so
that private student loan debt is treated the same as other private
debts during bankruptcy. People who seek higher education to better
their futures should not be dissuaded from doing so by the threat of
financial ruin. The bankruptcy system should work as a safety net that
allows people to get the education they want with the assurance that,
should their finances come under strain by layoffs, accidents, or other
unforeseen life events, they will be protected. This bill takes a
modest but important step in achieving that goal.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's
Loan Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move
to a new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is
this great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our
housing market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA
Loan Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around
and, along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require
a down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Find Jobs
First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden recently announced the
launch of a new integrated employment tool to connect veterans and
service members with employers, and to help translate military skills
into the civilian workforce. The Veterans Employment Center
, an integrated, online tool connecting
veterans, transitioning service members and their spouses with both
public and private-sector employers, is the result of an interagency
effort to improve, simplify and consolidate the current array of
employment resources for veterans. Additionally, this will provide one
comprehensive database of resumes for employers who are seeking to
leverage the skills and talents of veterans, service members, and their
spouses. A video tutorial on how to use the Veterans Employment Center
can be viewed here
.
As always, I remain.

Yesterday,
I
was

to
be
at
the
grand
opening
of
the

a

of
the
continuing
mission

The

have
now

the
28
new

along
with
68

community.
The
Fairway

project
was
made
possible
by
the
federal
Low

Those

will
not

transform
the
physical

of
this
public

community
but
it
will
positively
impact
the
lives
of
the
Fairway

residents.
Affordable
housing
is
an
extremely
important
and
vital

for
the
City
of
Memphis.
Even
though
the
economy
is
slowly
climbing

many
Memphians
are
still
struggling

including
Republican

Ryan,
are
trying

Jackson
Elementary
School
Career
Day
Yesterday
was
career
day
at
Jackson
Elementary
School,
and
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
several
classes
about
why
I
chose
public
service
and
my
role
as
the
Ninth
District&#8217;s
Congressman.
With
many
of
Jackson
Elementary&#8217;s
fifth
graders
having
recently
learned
about
our
federal
government,
I
was
glad
to
be
able
to
talk
to
them
and
answer
questions
about
how
the
legislative
branch
works.
Supporting
Memphis
Families
and
Workers
I
received
an
&#8220;A&#8221;
grade&#8212;the
highest
grade
awarded
to
any
member
of
the
Tennessee
Congressional
Delegation&#8212;from
the
United
Food
&amp;
Commercial
Workers
International
Union
(UFCW)
for
my
votes
over
the
last
year
to
improve
the
lives
of
workers
and
their
families.
The
UFCW
is
made
up
of
more
than
1.3
million
people
working
primarily
in
grocery
and
retail
stores,
and
in
the
food
processing
and
meat
packing
industries.
It
is
an
honor
to
be
recognized
for
my
efforts
to
give
working
Memphians
and
their
families
a
fair
shot
at
a
better
life.
Workers&#8217;
rights
must
be
protected
and
all
Americans
who
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rules
should
be
able
to
lead
a
long
and
happy
life,
earn
a
fair

livable
wage,
keep
a
roof
over
their

heads,
and
put
food
on

Helping
Maintain
and
Preserve
African-American
Cemeteries
Earlier
this
afternoon,
I
spoke
at
the
8th
annual
&#8220;Memorial
in
May&#8221;
cemetery
preservation
conference
at
Rhodes
College,
put
together
by
the
Preservation
of
African
American
Cemeteries
(PAAC)
organization.
In
2009,
I
was
part
of
a
Congressional
hearing
with
Congressman
Bobby
Rush
of
Illinois
to
look
into
the
Burr
Oak
Cemetery
scandal,
where
employees
had
been
charged
with
digging
up
more
than
200
graves
and
reselling
the
plots.
The
cemetery
was
the
final
resting
place
for
lynching
victim
Emmett
Till,
legendary
blues
singers
Dinah
Washington
and
Willie
Dixon
and
thousands
of
others,
and
it
is
one
of
the
Chicago
area's
most
storied
black
cemeteries.
Our
hearing
produced
the
Bereaved
Consumers
Protection
Act,
which
I
cosponsored
in
2010,
which
would
force
cemetery
directors
to
bolster
their
record
keeping
and
make
those
records
available
to
federal,
state
and
local
officials.
It
would
also
create
a
kind
of
consumer
Bill
of
Rights
for
cemeteries,
prohibiting
directors
from
misleading
customers
about
the
prices
of
funeral
goods
and
services,
and
clarifying
contracts
for
burial
plots,
entombments
and
inurnments.
But
just
this
January,
Galilee
Memorial
Gardens
in
Memphis
was
shut
down
because
of
allegations
that
the
workers
allegedly
stacked
bodies
and
buried
corpses
outside
of
the
cemetery.
In
an
effort
to
prevent
this
from
happening
again,
I
have
also
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
of
the
Funeral
Rule
Improvement
Act
of
2014,
would
expand
regulations
on
cemeteries
and
subject
owners
to
up
to
$10,000
in
penalties
if
they
violate
the
rules.
Cemeteries
are
the
final
resting
place
and
marker
for
each
life.
It
is
the
place
loved
ones
gather
to
visit,
remember,
embrace
and
celebrate
those
who
have
passed
and
those
who
are
part
of
one&#8217;s
ancestry.
These
irreplaceable
cultural
resources
tell
the
real
stories
of
our
history;
yet,
they
are
neglected,
lost
and
essentially
forgotten&#8212;but
they
should
not
be.The
desecration
of
bodies
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
occur.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
ensure
cemeteries
are
respected.
Fighting
for
Struggling
Students
This
morning,
I
joined
U.S.
Senator
Dick
Durbin
and
several
other
Senators
and
Representatives
in
sending
a
letter
to
Secretary
of
Education
Arne
Duncan
urging
him
to
bring
more
fairness
to
struggling
students
by
establishing
clear
standards
of
eligibility
for
&#8220;undue
hardship&#8221;
discharge
of
federal
student
loans
in
bankruptcy.
These
standards
would
benefit
the
most
vulnerable
borrowers
by
bringing
consistency
to
the
manner
in
which
the
Department
of
Education&#8217;s
contractors
handle
undue
hardship
claims.
Because
federal
law
currently
treats
student
loan
debt
as
&#8220;non-dischargable&#8221;
in
bankruptcy,
mountains
of
student
debt
can
follow
borrowers
around
for
a
lifetime&#8212;even
if
they
are
unable
to
pay
it
off.
The
law
does
allow
certain
borrowers
to
discharge
the
debt
if
they
can
prove
an
&#8220;undue
hardship,&#8221;
but
that
path
is
too
often
blocked
by
unscrupulous
contractors
working
for
the
Department
of
Education
who
use
aggressive
tactics
to
unfairly
fight
against
these
types
of
discharge
in
court,
even
when
they
are
clearly
needed
by
the
borrower.
The
New
York
Times
ran
a
story
about
some
of
these
aggressive
tactics
and
how
they
hurt
American
families
earlier
this
year.
While
the
federal
government
should
do
all
it
can
to
fairly
collect
on
student
loan
debts
owed
by
borrowers,
it
is
not
sensible
or
cost-effective
for
the
Department
of
Education
or
its
contractors
to
engage
in
lengthy
legal
challenges
and
appeals
against
bankrupt
student
loan
borrowers
who
have
demonstrated
a
clear
and
legitimate
inability
to
repay
their
loans.
I
have
also
introduced
a
bill
to
repeal
some
changes
made
to
the
bankruptcy
code
in
2005
so
that
private
student
loan
debt
is
treated
the
same
as
other
private
debts
during
bankruptcy.
People
who
seek
higher
education
to
better
their
futures
should
not
be
dissuaded
from
doing
so
by
the
threat
of
financial
ruin.
The
bankruptcy
system
should
work
as
a
safety
net
that
allows
people
to
get
the
education
they
want
with
the
assurance
that,
should
their
finances
come
under
strain
by
layoffs,
accidents,
or
other
unforeseen
life
events,
they
will
be
protected.
This
bill
takes
a
modest
but
important
step
in
achieving
that
goal.
Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
