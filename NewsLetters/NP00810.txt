Dear David,
This weekend I completed my second tour of all of Missouri's 114
counties and the city of St. Louis. Since joining the United States
Senate, I've made more than 1,000 stops visiting Missourians all over the
state.
I've learned a great deal by hearing about the issues
that matter most to Missourians in every corner of our state. From
lagging job growth to executive overreach, burdensome regulations, and
broken ObamaCare promises, those I serve give the best advice about how
to fix the problems they face. I'll keep working hard to take your
common sense back to Washington.
