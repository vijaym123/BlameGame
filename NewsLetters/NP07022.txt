The Affordable Care Act requires that all businesses with more than 50 full-time employees provide health insurance to their employees or pay a fee.
I supported the Hire More Heroes Act,
H.R. 3474 , to exempt veterans who already receive health insurance through the Veterans Affairs Department or reservists covered under TRICARE from being counted toward the number of employees that triggers the employer mandate under the ACA.
This is a win-win: veterans are able to find work after serving our nation, and our businesses are able to hire them without facing a penalty under the healthcare law.
Yours in service,
Randy
