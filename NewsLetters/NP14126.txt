Dear Friend,
The United States is home to some 28 million small businesses. Locally owned businesses help tell the uniquely American story of rural communities in our Eighth Congressional District. Many times these businesses become cornerstones and landmarks in small towns, and are proudly passed down from one generation to the next. They represent what can be achieved when an entire family works together to provide a good or service for their community.
Saturday, November 30th is Small Business Saturday. On this day, shoppers across the country are encouraged to show their support for locally owned small businesses. With the Christmas season fast approaching, Small Business Saturday is a perfect opportunity to buy local gifts for family and friends while supporting the entrepreneurs that are the lifeblood of rural Missouri.
Small businesses truly are the engine for job creation in our nation. Through my own experiences and by talking to small business owners across our District, I also know that nothing kills jobs faster than a Washington regulation. Too often federal agencies impose rules without talking to those who will be forced to live with them. As your representative in Congress, I am working to give small business owners and job creators some relief from onerous regulations. Small businesses are responsible for over half of the jobs created in the United States. At a time when our economy is still weak, Washington bureaucrats should not be implementing burdensome new regulations on America&#39;s job creators.
On Small Business Saturday we all have the opportunity to be an advocate for locally-owned small businesses. Entrepreneurial ventures and small business are the backbone of the American economy, not only across Missouri&#39;s Eighth District but throughout our entire country. In fact, small businesses are responsible for 57% of the private sector workforce in the United States. I hope you will join me on November 30th, Small Business Saturday, to show support for locally owned businesses and the families who make them run.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
