Dear Friend,
I Was Not Elected to Grow Government
On Thursday the House of Representatives passed the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2013, which would increase spending and federal taxes. I voted
against the bill.
I was not elected to grow government. I was not elected to increase
spending. I was not elected to raise taxes. This bill did all that. It
also punished the western states by reducing, permanently, mineral
royalties on federal lands. It also has "promises" of some reforms that
kick in 10 years from now. I'm sorry folks, but history shows these
long-term, kick-the-can-down-the-road reforms never get implemented.
Never.
I understand why my Republican colleagues voted for it. It was a
compromise, and with compromise you can't get everything you want. My
colleagues didn't want budget battles next year. I get that. But hear
me on this: we have compromised our way to $17 trillion in debt. This
spending problem did not happen overnight. It has grown for decades,
and it grows because of bills just like the one that passed Thursday
night.
Fighting for Those Who Protect Us
On Monday afternoon I attended the grand opening of the Northern
Arizona Veterans Resource Center in Prescott. It is very important that
we not only remember our veterans, but also take care of them. They
fought to protect this country; it is now our turn to fight for them.
It is my hope that this new center will provide much-needed help to the
area's veterans.
(Rep. Gosar speaking at the grand opening, December 10, 2013)
Listening to You
On Monday night I spoke to the Highway 69 Republicans. I always take
the opportunity to listen to my constituents so that I may better
represent them. We spoke about all the hot topics, including the
federal budget, ObamaCare, and immigration.
(Rep. Gosar addressing the Highway 69 Republicans, December 10, 2013)
Merry Christmas
I had the pleasure of taking my daughter Elly to the White House
Christmas party on Tuesday. I always love spending time with my family,
but I particularly like it when they visit me in Washington. It makes
that city a little less dreary.
(Rep. Gosar and his daughter Elly, December 10, 2013)
Touring Yuma's Farms
Last Saturday I was in Yuma and toured local winter-vegetable farms.
These farms are very important to both the local and national economy,
producing about 90 percent of the country's winter vegetables.

ObamaCare Malady of the Week
1 in 5: the number of employers, according to a Duke University poll,
who say they will hire fewer employees because of ObamaCare's employer
mandate. Click HERE

Did You Know?
Fort Mohave was a fort constructed in 1859 to provide fortification in
the Mohave War. A city eventually grew around the fort and is now known
as Fort Mohave, Arizona.

Dear
Friend,
I
Was
Not
Elected
to
Grow
Government
On
Thursday
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013,
which
would
increase
spending
and
federal
taxes.
I
voted
against
the bill.
I
was
not
elected
to
grow
government.
I
was
not
elected
to
increase
spending.
I
was
not
elected
to
raise
taxes.
This
bill
did
all
that.
It
also
punished
the
western
states
by
reducing,
permanently,
mineral
royalties
on
federal
lands.
It
also
has
"promises"
of
some
reforms
that
kick
in
10
years
from
now.
I'm
sorry
folks,
but
history
shows
these
long-term,
kick-the-can-down-the-road
reforms
never
get
implemented.
Never.
I
understand
why
my
Republican
colleagues
voted
for
it.
It
was
a
compromise,
and
with
compromise
you
can't
get everything
you
want.
My
colleagues
didn't
want
budget
battles
next
year.
I
get
that.
But
hear
me
on
this:
we
have
compromised
our
way
to
$17
trillion
in
debt.
This
spending
problem
did
not
happen
overnight.
It
has
grown
for
decades,
and
it
grows
because
of
bills
just
like
the
one
that
passed
Thursday
night.

It

They

it
is
now
our
turn
to
fight
for
them.
It
is
my
hope
that
this
new
center
will provide
much-needed help
to
the
area's
veterans.

Merry
Christmas
I
had
the
pleasure of
taking
my

Elly

Tuesday.
I
always
love

I
particularly

It

I

about
90
