Pension Fix for Retired Veterans Passes House and Senate, Mobile Office
Hours for February, Week in Texas Traveling District
Dear Friend,
This past week another miracle happened in Congress - Republicans and
Democrats came together for the fourth time in a row to support a
pension fix for retired veterans. Voting in favor of this bill was a no
brainer for me, as a son of a World War II veteran. Here's a wrap up of
the our week in DC.
Veterans Pension Fix Passes House and Senate
I supported the "Repealing the Reduction in the Cost of Living
Adjustment (COLA) for Retired Members of the Armed Services" bill that
passed the House Tuesday night. This bill repeals the cut to the COLA
for working-age retired veterans. Members of our Armed Forces,
including our veterans, deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. This
fix allows for working-age retired veterans to receive the benefits
they earned and deserve, including any increases in COLA. As a son of a
World War II veteran, I honor my commitment to veterans and their
families. The bill also passed the Senate on Wednesday.
Mobile Office Hours for February
Engaging with constituents and addressing their issues is important to
me. This month, our field representatives will be visiting 10 counties
in
the 23rd District of Texas. Our field staff is always accessible to
constituents because I take the job of addressing the needs of those I
represent seriously.
We routinely make efforts to go out and visit
communities.
I invite those facing an issue with a federal agency or
department to meet with my staff at our mobile office locations. I take
great pride in listening to the community and working for them. To see
where field representatives will be this month, click here
.
Castroville "23 in 1 Series"
I spoke on the House floor about Castroville - where Texas meets
France. It is one of the settlements founded by Henri Castro in 1844.
Castroville, a small community of 2,680 people, is about 25 miles west
of San Antonio. It is a great place to enjoy, unwind and relax. Click
here
to watch my remarks on the House floor.
Tax Filing Assistance Available
Today, staff in El Paso and San Antonio held tax assistance workshops
where constituents filed their 2013 Federal Tax Returns free of charge.
If you, or someone you know, need help filing your federal tax returns,
please contact my offices for assistance. Click here
for the telephone numbers and addresses.
Remember, deadline to file an individual tax return is April 15. You
can also visit www.IRS.gov
for more information.
Week in Texas Traveling District
I'll be traveling throughout the 23rd District of Texas this week. I'll
be visiting San Antonio, El Paso, and a lot of great places in between
with emphasis on communities in West Texas.
As always, I'll be meeting
with constituents to talk about issues important to them. Make sure to
follow me on Facebook
and Twitter
as I provide daily updates.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below.
I've never been a
big fan of politics, so doing things that help people is my favorite
part of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
