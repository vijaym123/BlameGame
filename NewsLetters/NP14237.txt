Dear Friends,
We pause today to reflect on the sacrifices of our nation's Veterans,
who put their lives at risk to protect our freedoms at home and abroad.
>From the advances of Nazi Germany to the shores of Korea and Vietnam,
to Desert Storm, Iraq and Afghanistan, these brave men and women
answered the call to protect our nation and the world from the evil
forces who wish to do harm.
To those who serve, thank you for your
courage, your strength, and your sacrifice to your country and family.
For those who have fallen, let us never forget their sacrifices which
we will forever be indebted.
I encourage everyone to thank a Veteran, not just today, but every day.
Seek out opportunities in the community to serve.
Find a way to
participate in an Honor Flight to our nation's Capitol.
We will never
be capable of fully repaying these men and women for their service, and
they command tremendous respect for the sacrifices they have made.
Lastly, if you are a Veteran seeking help or access to your benefits, I
am here to serve you.
Please contact my office to see how I can help
you receive the benefits you earned and any assistance you may require.
Thank you for your service, and may God Bless.
Blessings and Liberty,
Jeff Duncan
Member of Congress
