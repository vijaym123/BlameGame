Captiol Update
Congressman Cook Applauds Capture of Suspected Benghazi Terrorist
Today, Congressman Paul Cook released the following statement regarding
the apprehension of Ahmed Abu Khatallah, the terrorist accused of
playing a key role in the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi,
Libya on September 11, 2012:
"After nearly two years, America has finally arrested one of the key
terrorists responsible for the Benghazi attack. Khatallah must be
thoroughly questioned to gain intelligence about terrorist plots as
well as information about any other terrorists involved in this attack.
Afterward, he must face justice. There are still many questions that
need answers and other terrorists who must be brought to justice, but
this is the first step toward providing justice for the victims of
Benghazi."
Congressman Cook's Statement on the Situation in Iraq
"Given the sacrifices made by American service members over the past
decade, I'm deeply concerned by the steady advance of Al-Qaeda
militants in Iraq. Unfortunately, the Obama administration's reckless
policy has abandoned the victories our troops bled for and allowed
Al-Qaeda forces in Iraq to go from the edge of defeat to being poised
to capture Baghdad.
"There's no easy solution at this point. My first concern is for the
security of Americans working in Iraq. We can't afford to have another
Benghazi. We need a solid plan to protect or evacuate Americans in
Iraq, but beyond that I don't support putting more of our troops in
harm's way. We need an independent Iraq that's responsible for their
own destiny and security, but unfortunately the President has left us
with no good options to make this happen."
Tax Relief for America's Small Businesses
Last week, Congressman Cook voted for two bills that will foster small
businesses growth, H.R. 4457, the America's Small Business Tax Relief
Act of 2014, and H.R. 4453, the Permanent S Corporation Built-In Gains
Recognition Period Act of 2014. Both bills adjust the tax code to ease
the tax burden on America's small businesses.
The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act will help small businesses
by allowing them to deduct investments in new equipment and property in
the year they are purchased. This mitigates the effects of a crippling
corporate tax rate that pushes them to move jobs overseas. The S
Corporation Permanent Tax Relief Act helps businesses by synchronizing
the tax code to correspond with a standard five-year business plan.
Both measures bring much needed certainty to small and medium sized
businesses, allowing them to focus on creating jobs and reenergizing
the economy.
Cook said, "The best thing Washington can do to promote prosperity is
to get out of the way. Providing assurance that taxes won't change
allows businesses to grow and hire. Every dollar businesses send to
Washington is one dollar they can't use to invest in equipment, hire a
new employee, or increase wages.
"Pro-growth policies like this are the best way to build an America
that works. For people outside of Washington who are risking everything
to pursue their dream of running a small business, common sense
policies like these are a necessity. Entrepreneurship is a core
American value, and it is essential that we do all we can to encourage
prosperity."
No more federal funding for Governor Brown's crazy train
Last week, Cook voted to deny any funds for the California High Speed
Rail project. This project, which was sold to California taxpayers as a
$30 billion project, has tripled to over $90 billion due to deceitful
cost projections, lawsuits, and regulatory delays.
Cook said, "With soaring budget deficits and decaying infrastructure,
we have no business wasting taxpayer dollars on this boondoggle. This
train is on a fast track to nowhere, and this vote will ensure that
taxpayers aren't forced to keep paying the fare.
"The high speed rail project would create an expensive under-used
transit line with ticket prices most middle class folks can't afford.
If you're going to invest taxpayer dollars in transportation, that
money needs to go to our roadways and bridges first and foremost, which
are inadequate and unsafe in many areas. It's time to get real about
transportation spending and build only what makes sense. This high
speed rail makes no sense."

Veterans Corner
Vets housing program hits the ground running thanks to passage of
proposition 41
On any given night roughly 16,000 veterans in California have no place
to call home; they sleep in parks, under bridges, in their cars, in
emergency shelters or on a friend's couch. Now, thanks to the voters'
approval of Proposition 41 and the partnership of three state agencies,
more veterans will have access to permanent, safe and affordable
housing. The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet), the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and
the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) also announced today
three stakeholder meetings to be held in July around the state to help
inform implementation of the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention
Program.
"While California is home to nearly two million veterans, the largest
veteran population in the nation, we also hold the distinction of
having the largest homeless veteran population in the country," said
Peter J. Gravett, Secretary of CalVet.
"With this new program and the
funding approved by the voters we can finally help these veterans
finish their journey home."

&#8220;After

There

I&#8217;m

Unfortunately,
the

for
the

We

I
don&#8217;t

We

Tax

Congressman

voted
for
two
bills
that

small

growth,
H.R.
4457,
the
America&#8217;s
Small

Tax

2014,
and
H.R.
4453,
the
Permanent
S
Corporation
Built-In
Gains
Recognition
Period
Act
of
2014.
Both
bills
adjust
the
tax
code
to
ease
the
tax
burden
on
America&#8217;s
small
businesses.
The
America&#8217;s
Small
Business
Tax
Relief
Act
will
help
small
businesses
by
allowing
them
to
deduct
investments
in
new
equipment

property
in
the
year
they
are
purchased.
This
mitigates
the
effects
of
a
crippling
corporate
tax
rate
that
pushes
them
to
move
jobs
overseas.
The
S
Corporation
Permanent
Tax
Relief
Act
helps
businesses
by
synchronizing
the
tax
code
to
correspond
with
a
standard
five-year
business

Both
measures
bring
much
needed
certainty
to
small

medium
sized
businesses,
allowing
them
to
focus
on
creating
jobs
and
reenergizing
the
economy.
Cook
said,
&#8220;The
best
thing
Washington
can
do
to
promote
prosperity
is
to
get
out
of
the
way.
Providing
assurance
that
taxes
won&#8217;t
change
allows
businesses
to
grow
and
hire.
Every
dollar
businesses
send
to
Washington
is
one
dollar
they
can&#8217;t
use
to
invest
in
equipment,
hire
a
new
employee,
or
increase
wages.
&#8220;Pro-growth
policies
like
this
are
the
best
way
to
build
an
America
that
works.
For
people
outside
of
Washington
who
are
risking
everything
to
pursue
their
dream
of
running
a
small
business,
common
sense
policies
like
these
are
a

Entrepreneurship
is
a
core
American

and
it
is
essential
that
we
do
all

This

is
on
a

and this
vote
will
ensure
that taxpayers aren&#8217;t

&#8220;The

rail
project
would
create
an
