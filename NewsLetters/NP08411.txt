Dear
Friends,
70 years ago today, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the
Servicemens Readjustment Act
of 1944, or, as you and I know it
today, the G.I. Bill.
Passing
the G.I. Bill is one of the smartest
things Congress has ever done. The
legislation sent millions of
returning WWII veterans who never
dreamed they could afford the costs
of higher education to our
nations colleges and
universities, and helped usher in an
unprecedented period of continued
economic expansion in the 20th
Century.
Since 1944, roughly 20 million
Americans have taken advantage of the
GI Bills education and
training benefits. Im proud to
count myself as one of them. When I
returned home after three tours of
duty in the U.S. Navy during the
Vietnam War, the G.I. Bill helped me
afford the cost of getting my MBA at
the University of Delaware.
Todays service members and
veterans returning from the conflicts
in Iraq and Afghanistan are now able
to take advantage of the Post-9/11
G.I. Bill. As with previous
generations, this new and improved
G.I. Bill is doing a lot of good,
helping our military men and women
meet their educational and
professional goals. However,
theres still room for
improvement.
We need
make sure that service members and
veterans are learning the skills they
need to succeed in the civilian
workforce and that theyre
graduating without incurring
unnecessary debt. Ive held
multiple hearings and introduced
legislation designed to make sure
veterans arent targeted by bad
actors, and I will continue to make
that a priority in this Congress.
Today,
the 70-year anniversary, is a
milestone for our military men and
women and our nation. Let us
celebrate what this piece of
legislation has done for our military
servicemen in the past and present,
and continue striving to do better
for our veterans and service members
in the future.
With my best regards,
Stay Connected with
