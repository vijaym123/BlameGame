Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram has been terrorizing Nigeria and
surrounding African countries for years. Last month, they kidnapped
300 Christian school girls and have been holding more than 270 captive.
President Obama has authorized security forces to assist the Nigerian
government in the rescue of the kidnapped girls, and last Friday
Leader Cantor said the House stands ready to assist in bringing the girls
home. Do you think
the U.S. should help Nigeria rescue the kidnapped girls? Yes. No. I
would rather not say.
