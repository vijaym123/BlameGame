Dear Friend &ndash;
Each year I have the privilege of nominating a limited number of young people to attend our nation's military academies. The honor of attending a service academy comes with a commitment to serve in the military after graduation.
If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about U.S. Military Academies, please come by an informational session at my district office this Wednesday.
Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are all welcome to attend!
What: Military Academy Info Night
Date: Wednesday, October 8, 2014
Time: 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm
