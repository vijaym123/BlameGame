What I Have Been Reading
Entire NC town lights up for the holidays
Fox and Friends
Last week the Gaston County town of McAdenville was featured on the Fox News morning show Fox and Friends.
For those who have never visited, every December the entire town of McAdenville is covered in Christmas lights, earning it the nickname Christmas Town USA.
The town has kept the tradition alive every year since 1956 and it is great to see it gaining some national publicity.
Cost Of Items In '12 Days of Christmas' Tops $114,000
National Public Radio
Every December I thoroughly enjoy this piece from the Associated Press on how much it would cost to purchase everything mentioned in "The Twelve Days of Christmas" song.
