Response to President Obama's Immigration
Proposal
11/21/14
Following President Obama's speech
detailing his immigration proposal, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement:
President Obamas actions are not only unlawful, they are emblematic of
this administrations increasingly blatant disregard and disrespect for
the American people, especially to every immigrant who has come to
this country legally. The President himself, on twenty two separate
occasions, has told the American people that he does not have the
authority to take the type of unilateral actions hes now pursuing. But just
like his promise that if you like your health insurance plan you can
keep it, he has misled us once
again.
President Obama's immigration plan amounts to one
thing, plain and simple, executive amnesty for millions of people living
illegally in America. The truth is that President Obama remains the
greatest obstacle to immigration reform by treating our broken immigration
system as a political
opportunity.
Changes and revisions to our immigration system are
needed to make our nation more secure and more competitive in the economy
of the world. However, the American people voted for a bipartisan
government and they expect Congress to be their voice in the immigration
reform process. Working with Congress is not optional, the
Constitution makes it mandatory.
In the coming days, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the
House to find any and every avenue provided to stop President Obama
from continuing to ignore the will of the American people and
circumvent the Constitution. I have already called for the House Appropriations
Committee to include language, in all relevant appropriations
legislation for the next fiscal year, prohibiting the use of funds to
implement the Presidents new amnesty
policies.
I, like the President, made an oath to uphold the
Constitution. The difference is that I have every intention to
continue to keep that promise."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
