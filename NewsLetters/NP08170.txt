Friend,
This week, the Supreme Court ruled that the religious beliefs of employers trump the rights of a woman to access the birth control of her choice.
You and I agree that the ruling is outrageous - which is why our campaign has seen a surge of engagement over the last few days.
People are taking action and supporting our campaign so that we can continue fighting to keep politics out of the exam room.
Following the Hobby Lobby ruling, I penned an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee with Dr. Jeanne Conry, past president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
This decision is bad policy and bad medicine - click here to read more .
By allowing an employer&#39;s personal values to trump an employee&#39;s right to health care, the beliefs of the few are trumping the health of the many.
This is unacceptable, and I will continue to push back.
If you missed it, earlier this year I joined Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California to protest on the steps of the Supreme Court -

And, if you agree with our position, you can support our campaign after watching.
Thank you for staying involved and for paying attention to this important issue. The court has no place in the exam room - as a Member of Congress, I will fight every day to keep medical decisions in the hands of a woman and her doctor.
Thanks again.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - With your help, I&#39;m fighting back.
