DISTRICT
January 6, 2015
Dear
Friend,
I want to thank the residents of the Third
District for giving me the privilege of representing you in Congress. The
Third District remains one of the most inventive, diverse and
influential regions in Massachusetts. From Fitchburg to Lawrence, Lowell to
Marlborough, this District has a long tradition of service and a legacy
of innovation
these are the cornerstones of our history and the
foundation upon which we will continue to build our
future.
For the past seven years, it has been an honor to serve on behalf of the
remarkable individuals and families that make up our neighborhoods;
the entrepreneurs, employees and employers at businesses small and
large who drive our economic growth; and the local organizations and
leaders working every day to better our communities. I look forward to
remaining an engaged and accessible partner as we look to tackle the
challenges facing the state and the nation.
The
114 th
United States Congress, which was sworn in today, will require
cooperation and compromise to enact serious legislation that addresses
issues like job growth, tax reform and comprehensive immigration reform
all of which are key to the countrys
prosperity.
Congress will need to remain focused on the challenges that are instrumental
to help women succeed and in turn, improve the lives of Americas
middle class families. That means tackling issues such as affordable
childcare, equal pay for equal work, access to health care, raising the
minimum wage, providing earned sick leave and more. When the
114 th
Congress begins, it will include 101 women legislators, a record
number, and as history has shown, when more women are involved in the
process of change, more of the issues that affect women and families
as a whole are addressed. I am committed to working with all my
colleagues - men and women, Republicans and Democrats - to grow fairness and
opportunity for middle class families.
We can boost our
economy and jobs by supporting a Make it in America agenda, focused
on creating the best conditions for American businesses to
manufacture, innovate, and create jobs right here in the U.S. The small
innovative companies unique to Massachusetts have incredible job creating
potential in myriad industries, from clean energy to health
care.
I will also remain focused on addressing climate change and
promoting clean energy initiatives in my work on the Natural Resources
Committee, as well as look to continue seeking ways to preserve the Third
Districts National Parks and natural treasures, such as the wide
network of rivers.
Throughout my time in Congress, I have
worked in a bipartisan effort to make historic changes to the way the
military deals with the issue of sexual assault, including the first major
changes to the role of a military commander and providing survivors
with new resources and protections. There is still much more to do and
in my senior role on the House Armed Services Committee, I intend to
continue my work on this critical issue. Also in this role, I will
continue pursuing legislation that provides servicemembers with modern
resources that ensure their safety and success, as well as provisions to
increase support for veterans in critical areas like health care and
mental health.
There is still much that needs to be done
in order to improve the quality of the lives of the people I am so
honored to represent and the lives of countless people like them across
our state and nation. It will require cooperation and determined action
out of the 114 th
Congress
not the partisan theatrics and
gridlock of recent years. I believe we can find common ground and from
there we can find fair, sustainable, and commonsense solutions to the
challenges we face.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
