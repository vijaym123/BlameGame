Forbes Statement on Administrations Announcement of Executive Amnesty
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) issued the below statement following the Presidents announcement tonight that he will take executive action on immigration:
We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants, but we also define ourselves as a nation built on the rule of law. The Presidents announcement tonight not only bypasses Congress, it bypasses the Constitution of the United States.
I stand in strong support of the House Judiciary Committee in its use of every tool at its disposal to fight the Administrations unilateral action defying the American people, their elected representatives, and the Supreme Law of the Land.
