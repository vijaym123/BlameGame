Dear Friend,
Thanksgiving is a uniquely
American tradition and as we gather with our loved ones this week, let us
pause a moment to count among our blessings the common bond we share
across this country.
In a time where too much focus is placed on
things that divide us as a nation, we should remember this week to give
thanks for what brings us together.
Today, as many
across the world struggle with war, famine, and disease, may we never
take for granted the shared foundation we have in America; to discuss
ideas without violence, practice religion without persecution, and
live in a democracy without interruption.
This holiday, I am
grateful for the blessings of family, friends, neighbors and
colleagues.
I am grateful for our state and country.
I am thankful
for the continued opportunity to serve others.
And I am
appreciative that through this job, I have had the privilege of meeting, and
working with, thousands of Utahns - dedicated volunteers, mentors, and
leaders whose daily work also deserves our thanks.
From my family to yours, best wishes for a happy
Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
