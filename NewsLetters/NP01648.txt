Iran's Nuclear
Program
The president and his team are touting ongoing negotiations
with Iran over its nuclear program. We ought to be wary of any deal or
framework that merely puts Irans nuclear program on hiatus
particularly when Iran continues a public posture of outright hostility
toward our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel, and U.S. interests
in the region. The administration seems irresponsibly eager to lift
sanctions and is putting an unhealthy level of trust in Iran to abide by
inspections and enforcement. Over the next several weeks my
colleagues and I will be keeping a close watch on these negotiations. Many
believe this is the genesis of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East -
something that would further destabilize the region and the world. One
thing is for sure, Congress must be given a chance to review any
final agreement that comes to the
table.
March Jobs Report
Last
week's jobs report reflects a continuing trend of an alarmingly small
workforce participation rate and economic stagnation. The balanced budget
that the House recently passed would hold government accountable,
encourage real job growth and a thriving workforce. The President ought to
realize that working families are the answer, not bigger government.

Back Home In Georgias Sixth
District
I had the pleasure of meeting with Emily Matson &amp;
Kristina Twitty from the Georgia Life Alliance at my District Office. A
great group of folks who have made it their mission to protect the lives
of unborn and orphaned children
I am proud to stand with
them.
Also, I had a tremendous time visiting
with the students in Kell High School's SIFMA Stock Market Game-Capitol
Hill Challenge. Some really great questions and sharp students kept me
on my toes!
