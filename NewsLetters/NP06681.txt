Things just went from bad to worse:
-- first, Boehner came to Colona to raise money for our opponent, Bobby Schilling.
-- then, a right-wing Super PAC launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting Cheri.
-- now, Schilling&rsquo;s piling on with a MASSIVE television ad buy. We don&rsquo;t know what to do.
Our ad buy deadline is tonight, but we&rsquo;re still coming up short of our goal.
If we can hit $582 by midnight, we can get back on track -- and fight the GOP lies. If not, Cheri&rsquo;s first re-election campaign could be in serious trouble.
David, the choice is yours.
