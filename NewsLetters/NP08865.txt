Dear Friends,
Here is a quick look at some of my activies from the month of May.
District Update
Youth Summit & Job Expo Draws Huge Response
I was proud to welcome nearly 1,000 young people from the Chicago area
who attended the 2nd Congressional District Youth Summit and Job Expo
on May 31st at Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy (pictured
above). Representatives from more than 50 companies and agencies,
including Nike, Walmart and CVS, were on-hand to accept applications
for summer job openings and internships. The event offered workshops on
interview skills, resume writing, financial responsibility and building
positive work habits.
Homewood-Flossmoor High School
North Building Dedication
I attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony (pictured above) on May 27th and
was greatly impressed with the interior's modern and uplifting
atmosphere. I spoke about the importance of having quality education
opportunities in the Second District to help young people be prepared
for college and future employment opportunities. The district's latest
investment means more opportunities for sports activities and exercise
to keep our young people healthy and competitive. Remarkably, the
School District offers 35 sports, has 75 teams and 90 clubs and
activities.
Support Grows for Pullman National Park Proposal
I recently met with a delegation of local community leaders who came to
Washington, DC (pictured above) to urge Congress to support a bill that
I introduced to create the Pullman National Historical Park. A national
park would preserve this unique community and create a tourist
destination that would boost the local economy and attract new jobs to
the area. I will keep you informed of the progress of the bill, which
is being co-sponsored in the Senate by Senators Mark Kirk and Richard
Durbin.
Carver Military Academy Graduation
I was honored to speak at the Carver Military Academy graduation this
year (pictured above). Each year, Carver produces students who go on to
be outstanding leaders in the community. There will be many challenges
ahead, but having a good, well-rounded education is vital to being
competitive in a changing economy.
Legislative Update
National Defense Authorization Act Amendment:
Bring Back our Girls
I, like many people around the world, was outraged to learn the news
that nearly 300 young Nigerian girls had been kidnapped on their way to
school. Victimizing innocent children for perverse political purposes
should not be tolerated anywhere in the world. Girls everywhere should
have access to a good education and not live in fear of persecution for
educating themselves. That's why I submitted an amendment to the
National Defense Authorization Act that would help rescue these girls.
Every year Congress passes a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
that directs the Department of Defense on budgeting and expenditures.
My amendment requires the Departments of Defense and State to report to
Congress on the status of the kidnapped girls as well as to provide
background on the U.S. search and rescue effort in Nigeria. The
amendment also requires that the two departments provide Congress with
a threat assessment of the Boko Haram terrorist group and that they
submit recommendations on how the U.S. and Nigerian governments can
work together to rescue the kidnapped girls and help protect other
girls from a similar fate.
The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, including my amendment,
passed the House and will now be considered in the Senate.
Intelligence Authorization Act Amendment:
National Security & Intelligence
As a nation, we face a diverse array of threats. Our security depends
on having an intelligence community that is equally diverse. Currently,
less than a quarter of the Central Intelligence Agency's employees are
minorities. That's why I offered an amendment to H.R. 4681 for the
Intelligence Authorization Act aimed at preparing students at
predominately black colleges and universities for careers in national
security and intelligence. My bipartisan amendment allows the Director
of National Intelligence to provide grants to predominantly black
institutions so that they can offer advanced foreign language
education, study abroad, and cultural immersion programs to increase
diversity in the national security and intelligence community.
The 2014 & 2015 Intelligence Authorization Act, including my amendment,
passed the House and will now be considered in the Senate.

Dear
Friends,
Here
is
a
quick
look
at
some
of
my
activies
from
the
month
of
May.
District
Update
Youth
Summit &amp;
Job
Expo
Draws
Huge
Response
I
was
proud
to
welcome
nearly
1,000
young
people
from
the
Chicago
area
who
attended
the
2nd
Congressional
District
Youth
Summit
and
Job
Expo
on
May
31st
at
Gwendolyn
Brooks
College
Preparatory
Academy
(pictured
above).
Representatives
from
more
than
50
companies
and
agencies,
including
Nike,
Walmart
and
CVS,
were
on-hand
to
accept
applications
for
summer
job
openings
and
internships.
The
event
offered
workshops
on
interview
skills,
resume
writing,
financial
responsibility
and
building
positive
work
habits.
Homewood-Flossmoor
High
School
North
Building
Dedication
I attended
the
ribbon-cutting
ceremony
(pictured
above)
on
May
27th
and
was
greatly
impressed
with
the
interior&#8217;s
modern
and
uplifting
atmosphere.
I
spoke
about
the
importance
of
having
quality
education
opportunities
in
the
Second
District
to
help
young
people
be
prepared
for
college
and
future
employment
opportunities.
The
district&#8217;s
latest
investment
means
more
opportunities
for
sports
activities
and
exercise
to
keep
our
young
people
healthy
and competitive.
Remarkably,
the
School
District
offers
35
sports,
has
75
teams
and
90
clubs
and
activities.
Support
Grows
for
Pullman
National
Park
Proposal
I
recently
met
with
a
delegation
of
local
community
leaders
who
came
to
Washington,
DC
(pictured
above)
to
urge
Congress
to
support
a
bill
that
I
introduced
to
create
the
Pullman
National
Historical
Park.
A
national
park
would
preserve
this
unique
community
and
create
a
tourist
destination
that
would
boost
the
local
economy
and
attract
new
jobs
to
the
area.
I
will
keep
you
informed
of
the
progress
of
the
bill,
which
is
being
co-sponsored
in
the
Senate
by
Senators Mark
Kirk
and
Richard
Durbin.
Carver
Military
Academy
Graduation
I was
honored
to
speak
at
the
Carver
Military
Academy
graduation
this
year
(pictured
above).
Each
year,
Carver
produces
students
who
go
on
to
be
outstanding
leaders
in
the
community.
There
will
be
many
challenges
ahead,
but
having
a
good,
well-rounded
education
is
vital
to
being
competitive
in
a
changing
economy.
Legislative
Update
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
Amendment: Bring
Back
our
Girls
I,
like
many
people
around
the
world,
was
outraged
to
learn
the
news
that
nearly
300
young
Nigerian
girls
had
been
kidnapped
on
their
way
to
school.
Victimizing
innocent
children
for
perverse
political
purposes
should
not
be
tolerated
anywhere
in
the
world.
Girls
everywhere
should
have
access
to
a
good
education
and
not
live
in
fear
of
persecution
for
educating
themselves.
That's
why
I
submitted
an
amendment
to
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
that
would
help
rescue
these
girls.
Every
year
Congress
passes
a
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
that
directs
the
Department
of
Defense
on
budgeting
and
expenditures.
My
amendment
requires
the
Departments
of
Defense
and
State
to
report
to
Congress
on
the
status
of
the
kidnapped
girls
as
well
as
to
provide
background
on
the
U.S.
search
and
rescue
effort
in
Nigeria.
The
amendment
also
requires
that
the
two
departments
provide
Congress
with
a
threat
assessment
of
the
Boko
Haram
terrorist
group
and
that
they
submit
recommendations
on
how
the
U.S.
and
Nigerian
governments
can
work
together
to
rescue
the
kidnapped
girls
and
help
protect
other
girls
from
a
similar
fate.
The
2015
National
Defense
Authorization
Act,
including
my
amendment,
passed
the
House
and
will
now
be
considered
in
the
Senate.
Intelligence
Authorization
Act
Amendment: National
Security
&amp;
Intelligence
As
a
nation,
we
face
a
diverse
array
of
threats.
Our
security
depends
on
having
an
intelligence
community
that
is
equally
diverse.
Currently,
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency&#8217;s
employees
are
minorities.
That&#8217;s
why
I
offered
an
amendment
to
H.R.
4681
for
the
Intelligence
Authorization
Act
aimed
at
preparing
students
at
predominately
black
colleges
and
universities
for
careers
in
national
security
and
intelligence.
My
bipartisan
amendment
allows
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence
to
provide
grants
to
predominantly
black
institutions
so
that
they
can
offer
advanced
foreign
language
education, study
abroad,
and
cultural
immersion
programs
to
increase
diversity
in
the
national
security
and
intelligence
community.
The
2014
&amp;
2015
Intelligence
Authorization
Act,
including
my
amendment,
passed
the
House
and
will
now
be
considered
in
the
Senate.
