Judge's Boarding Pass
Feb. 9 - Feb. 13
Click here to watch video
Its time for the
boarding pass and Im ready to get back to Texas, since its freezing
up here in D.C. today.
We started off the week by passing
something dear to Texans,
H.R. 810 , a bill to reauthorize NASA. This bill
was passed by a voice vote. Its an important bill to us Texans. NASA
has been a part of our economy for my
lifetime.
On
Wednesday, the House passed
S. 1 , the
Keystone XL Pipeline Approval
Act ,
by a vote of 270-152. (See
Roll Call #75 )
S. 1 is the Senate
approved bill to build the Keystone Pipeline. We can now send this to the
Presidents desk. The President has said that he is going to veto this
bill, but we will see. If he does, he will be vetoing 42,000
jobs.
On Thursday, my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate
gathered together to call for the passage of my bill, the
Department
of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.
The bill funds the Department of
Homeland Security for 2015 which includes $39.7 billion in
discretionary funding to keep Americans safe. The bill also includes language
that prohibits DHS from implementing the Presidents overreaching
executive action on amnesty.

I will be
back in D.C. on Tuesday, February 24th. Make sure to

legislation we will be voting on next week in
session.
