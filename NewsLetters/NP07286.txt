Dear Friend,
Each day I have the privilege of
representing you in the U.S. Congress and it is a responsibility I take
seriously. I am honored to be your Congressman.
I work for you and
believe the best way to serve the people of the 6th District is to
talk to you directly. Over the next few weeks, I will be holding a series
of town hall meetings ( Click here for details or find the complete list of times and locations
below ). The floor will be yours and you will guide the
conversation. The goal is to let you know what is going on in the Nations
Capital, but most importantly I want to answer your questions and
listen to your concerns.
