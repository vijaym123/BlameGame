Easter Message from Congressman Scott Perry
Today, we join our fellow Christians around the world in celebrating Easter. This Holy Day is a specific time to reflect on Jesus' sacrifice for each of us and celebrate the triumph of the Resurrection and His gift of grace. Its a time for renewed hope amidst challenge, and to ponder the common values that unite us -- compassion and treating others as we wish to be treated.
As we embrace our loved ones and give thanks for our blessings, we wish all who celebrate with us a blessed Easter.
Respectfully,
Scott Perry
