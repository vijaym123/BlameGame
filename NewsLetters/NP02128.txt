Dear Friends,
Last month, I had the wonderful opportunity to host my 14th Annual U.S.
Service Academy Information Night, my favorite night of the year. More
than 200 Delaware middle and high school students, along with their
families, teachers and school counselors, came to the event to learn
more about the application process for our nations first-rate service
academies.
Every year, members of Congress nominate young men and women for the
opportunity to be appointed for acceptance into the Air Force Academy,
the Merchant Marine Academy, the Military Academy and the Naval
Academy. Students accepted into these programs are given a unique
opportunity to obtain an excellent education, serve their country and
gain valuable leadership skills that will guide them in their future.
Knowing the impact military service had on my life, I take this
opportunity very seriously. As a former Naval Flight Officer and
retired U.S. Navy Captain, I appreciate how the benefits of military
and public service shape one's future. Although I didnt have the honor
of attending a service academy, I learned the value of combining an
education with military service while I was in the ROTC program at The
Ohio State University.
The application process to be one of my nominees for appointment to a
U.S. Service Academy opens TODAY, March 15, 2015. The application
deadline is October 15th, 2015.
At this years annual Service Academy Night, we heard from an
impressive young Delawarean named Anderson Camp, who earned one of my
nominations last year and is set to start at the Naval Academy in
Annapolis this year. Anderson talked about his experience navigating
the nomination process and offered some valuable advice for anyone
considering a service academy. Watch an excerpt of his remarks here
.
The academies seek future leaders like Anderson who possess good moral
character, a commendable academic record, medical and physical fitness,
the desire to serve and the motivation to lead. For a list of specific
requirements for nomination, please visit my website
.
I urge young Delawareans to consider this option and consider applying
to multiple service academies. Interested students can access the
online application by visiting my website here
. For more information regarding the application process, contact
Laura Wisler, my Kent County director, at (302)-674-3308 or
academy@carper.senate.gov.

Dear
Friends,
Last

my

More

200
Delaware
middle
and
high
school
students,
along
with
their
families,
teachers
and
school
counselors,
came
to
the
event
to
learn
more
about
the
application
process
for
our
nation&#146;s
first-rate
service
academies.
Every
year,
members
of
Congress
nominate
young
men
and
women
for
the
opportunity
to
be
appointed
for
acceptance
into
the
Air
Force
Academy,
the
Merchant
Marine
Academy,
the
Military
Academy
and
the
Naval
Academy.
Students

these
programs
are
given
a
unique
opportunity
to
obtain
an
excellent
education,

and
gain
valuable
leadership

guide

Knowing
the
impact
military
service
had
on
my
life,
I
take
this
opportunity
very
seriously.
As
a
former
Naval
Flight
Officer
and
retired
U.S.
Navy
Captain,
I
appreciate
how
the
benefits
of
military
and
public
service
shape
one's
future.
Although
I
didn&#146;t
have
the
honor
of
attending
a
service
academy,
I
learned
the
value
of
combining
an
education
with
military
service
while
I
was
in
the
ROTC
program
at
The
Ohio
State
University.
The
application
process
