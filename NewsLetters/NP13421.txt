15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
As the year winds down and we gather around the dining room table with our loved ones during the holidays, its a good time to reflect on what weve accomplished and our goals for the new year.
Throughout this past year, I
hosted town hall meetings ,
telephone town hall meeting s ,
sent out regular e-newsletters , and
have responded to thousands of constituents who have contacted me . I have
held meetings
all across the district, and
toured businesses ,
universities, a military base, manufacturing facilities, and research centers
to find out how government helps or hurts them and what can be done.
My office has
assisted hundreds of Florida families with federal agencies . Are you having problems with the Small Business Administration or need help obtaining your Social Security, Disability, or Veterans benefits? We are here to help.
I have
introduced bills to serve our Veterans, fix our health care system, save taxpayer dollars, meet our agricultural workforce needs, protect people from identity theft and allow homeowners to create a disaster savings account to mitigate damages to homes caused by natural disasters .
I will continue to work hard on your behalf.
As always,
please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office . I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
