Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Congressional Art Competition Will Feature Public Display At EIU
Glimpse of the Past, an ink drawing by Kelsi Haller of Teutopolis High
School, was the 2013 winner.
I am pleased to announce my office is now accepting entries for the
2014 Congressional Art Competition. The contest is open to high school
students in the 15th Congressional District, and entries are due by
April 17.
This is an annual competition. The winning artwork from my district
gets to hang in Washington, DC, for nearly a year. Thousands of staff
and visitors will see the piece.
Acceptable mediums include: paintings, drawings, collages, prints,
photographs, computer-generated art, and mixed media. Artwork must be
two-dimensional, no larger than 28 inches by 28 inches by 4 inches,
including the frame, cannot weigh more than 15 pounds, and is required
to be original in content.
This year, we will be hosting a public display of the entries at the
Tarble Arts Center at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston on
April 27. Members of the Coles County Arts Council will assist in the
judging. Entries may be delivered to any of my district offices prior
to the April 17 deadline.
The winning artist is invited to participate in a ceremony in our
nation's capital. Southwest Airlines will fly the winner and a guest to
Washington for free.
Details are on my website
. For more information, contact my
Danville office at (217) 446-0664.
Heritage Foundation Report Reveals Cost Of EPA Climate Regulations
Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have spoken out
against the Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for new and
existing power plants since details began to emerge in recent months.
The rules, in effect, would ban any new power generating facilities
from using coal and put existing coal-fired plants on the path to quick
extinction.
Just how devastating will the EPA regulations be? A new report from the
Heritage Foundation indicates that by the end of 2023, nearly 600,000
jobs will be lost, and a family of four's income will drop by $1,200
per year.
In addition, between 2015-2038, aggregate gross domestic
product will decrease by $2.23 trillion. Read the full report online
.
In an attempt to bring common sense to the EPA rules, on Thursday the
House approved H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability
Act
,
229-183, with my support. The bipartisan legislation would protect an
affordable and diverse electricity portfolio by providing a reasonable
alternative to the EPA's greenhouse gas rules for power plants. The
bill, which moves to the Senate, requires EPA standards to be based on
proven technologies.
House Takes Action To Bring Relief From High Home Heating Costs
With median household income lower today than it was in 2000, the major
increases in home heating costs are hitting particularly hard. In
addition to the Electricity Security and Affordability Act mentioned
above, the House last week passed two other pieces of legislation to
provide relief to the American people:
The Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development (RAPID)
Act, H.R. 2641
. It
would expedite federal approval of construction projects, including
hundreds involving coal, wind, nuclear, and natural gas, that will
create more abundant energy supplies.
The Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT)
Act of 2014, H.R. 4076
. It
would make it easier to transport propane to areas with shortages.
Federal Communications Commission Abandons Chilling News Study
I joined Energy and Commerce Committee leaders in welcoming the overdue
announcement by the Federal Communications Commission that it was
scrapping its Critical Information Needs (CIN) study, which would have
included interviewing journalists and other news professionals about
their decision-making processes.
The committee first questioned the FCC about the controversial study
last December. The CIN would be a direct affront to the First Amendment
and could have been used to promote a revival of the so-called Fairness
Doctrine, which was neither fair nor constitutional.
The FCC certainly has more important matters before it, including
bandwidth allocation and E-9-1-1 enhancement.
House Passes Measure To Allow Consumers To 'Unlock' Cell Phones
If you have ever wanted to change your cell phone company but keep your
current phone, you have probably been dismayed to learn a new
definition of the word "locked." Most cell phones are locked to one
wireless carrier, meaning they will only work on that company's
network. Under a 2012 Library of Congress rule, unlocking a phone so
that it can be used on another cellular network is illegal.
I, and a majority of House members, believe that should be changed,
which is why we recently approved H.R. 1123, the Unlocking Consumer
Choice and Wireless Competition Act
. The
measure, which was prompted by an online petition to the White House,
now moves to the Senate.
Announcement
Transportation Infrastructure Grants: $600 million in funding is
available from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fiscal Year 2014
National Infrastructure Investments program. Funding will be awarded on
a
competitive basis for projects that will have a significant impact on
the nation, a metropolitan area, or a region. Up to $35 million of the
$600 million may be awarded for planning grants. The deadline to apply
is April 28, 2014. More information is at ww.dot.gov/TIGER

the
major
increases
in
home

costs
are
hitting particularly

to the

last
