Rubio, Bipartisan Coalition
IntroduceLegislation To Prevent
Sexual Assaults On College Campuses
In
a
press conference Thursday , Marco was
among a bipartisan group of 10 senators
who introduced a strengthened version of
the
Campus Accountability and Safety
Act . With added input from survivors,
students, colleges and universities, law
enforcement and advocates, the bill
wouldflip the current incentives of
a broken system toprovide
realaccountabilityand
transparency from higher education
institutions for sexual assaults
occurring on college campuses. The
legislation would also professionalize
the response to, and reporting of, sexual
assaults that occur on campuses in order
to increase prosecutions, better protect
and empower students, while also
respecting the rights of the accused.
The legislation would secure landmark
reforms for how colleges and universities
address and report incidents of sexual
assault that occur on their campuses. It
incorporates feedback from key
stakeholders to strengthen how student
surveys are conducted and strengthens
newlyrequiredtraining
standards. The provisions safeguard both
survivors and accused students. It
extends the amount of time survivors have
to file a case with the Department of
Education, and sets new notification
requirements for both survivors and
accused students involved in the campus
disciplinary process.
Combatting sexual assaults on
college campuses is fundamental to the
goal of ensuring that all Americans
have access to higher education in the
21st century,
said Senator Rubio . Too
many lives are ruined by a failure to
deal with campus sexual assault crimes
efficiently, fairly and consistently.
By requiring more information to be
made available to students and parents,
stronger partnerships between schools
and law enforcement, and more tools to
help victims achieve justice and begin
healing, I believe this legislation
will turn the tide against campus
sexual assault.

Rubio Addresses Veterans Health Care
Policy Summit
On Thursday, Marco addressed a
veterans health care policy summit hosted
by the Concerned Veterans for
Americas (CVA)
Fixing
Veterans Health Care Taskforce , which
released its findings and recommendations
on the best ways to deliver quality,
timely care to our nations
veterans.
Last year, Marco was the lead Senate
sponsor of the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014 , which was signed into law and
gives VA secretaries authority to fire or
demote VA Senior Executive Service (SES)
or equivalent employees based on
performance. An excerpt of his address is
below:
Rubio: Throughout our
history, they have given us everything.
When they return home, they deserve the
same from us. Paying lip service to
veterans is always in vogue, but the
true measure of public service on this
issue
quite frankly, on any
issue
is the willingness to
make tough decisions and endorse bold
reforms. Nothing less will suffice.
Nothing less will honor our veterans.
This plan deserves the attention of
everyone who owes something to our
nations veterans, and that
happens to be every single one of
us.

Ahead Of Second Round Of U.S.-Cuba
Talks, Rubio Comments On Arrest Of Over
200 Dissidents
In light of the second round of
U.S.-Cuba normalization talks that are
set to begin later this week, Marco
issued the following statement regarding
the recent arrest of over 200 dissidents
in Cuba:
As the next round of
U.S.-Cuba normalization talks begins
later this week, U.S. officials are so
desperate to open a U.S. embassy in
Havana, that theyre forging
ahead despite a new wave of repression
that has jailed over 200 Cuban
democracy activists in the past two
weeks. Just this weekend, the Castro
dictatorship increased its repression,
harassment and incarceration of over
100 peaceful demonstrators and
supporters of the Ladies in White.
Its clear there is zero intent
on behalf of the Castro dictatorship to
engage in a genuine conversation that
centers around bringing freedom to the
islands residents.
In addition, the recent
congressional delegation that visited
Cuba sent worrying signals to the
regime that human rights are, in fact,
negotiable. By staying in a
regime-controlled hotel that was
confiscated twice in its history, these
U.S. officials sent a worrying message
that the many legal claims the U.S. has
against the Castro regime are not a
priority for U.S. lawmakers. Even worse
about this trip is how the members of
Congress capitulated to the
regimes terms for this trip by
not meeting with dissidents and human
rights activists. These are not
insignificant actions, because the
regime interprets them as signs that
U.S. policy makers are not truly
interested in the democratic
aspirations and human rights of the
Cuban people.
As the U.S. negotiators come
face-to-face with Cubas
negotiators later this week, the
administration must insist that any
future negotiations place democracy,
human rights, free expression and the
free will of the Cuban people to choose
their own leaders through multi-party
elections as the highest priority
before any more concessions are made to
the regime.
On Tuesday, Marco commemorated the
19
th
anniversary of the Brothers
To The Rescue shootdown .
Rubio Urges President Obama To
Expedite Congressional Gold Medal For
The Borinqueneers
On Tuesday, Marco urged President
Obama to expedite the printing and
engraving of the Congressional Gold Medal
for the Armys 65th Infantry
Regiment, also known as the
Borinqueneers.
Given the age of many Borinqueneers,
Marco wrote
a
letter to President Obama
calling on
him to ensure that each member of the
65th Infantry Regiment receive their
Congressional Gold Medal immediately.
Four Borinqueneers from Florida have
passed away since the President signed a
bill into law awarding them with a
Congressional Gold Medal in June
2014.
The Borinqueneers fought hard
for our nation and, given their age,
many of them are concerned they will
never see the Congressional Gold Medal.
In fact, four Borinqueneers from
Florida have passed away since June 10,
2014, when you signed the legislation
honoring all Borinqueneers into
law,
Rubio wrote . Therefore, I
respectfully ask for your assistance in
expediting the printing and engraving
of the Congressional Gold Medal to
honor the most deserving men of the
65th Infantry Regiment, the
Borinqueneers.
The men who composed this
unit served through World War I, World
War II and the Korean War. In fact, the
unit boasts 10 Distinguished Service
Crosses, over 250 Silver Stars, more
than 600 Bronze Stars and nearly 3,000
Purple Hearts,
added Rubio . They have
served our country courageously and
with distinction, and now we must
ensure that they all receive their
Congressional Gold Medal
immediately.
