This is just&hellip; shameful.
Congress must pass a spending bill to keep our government running before tomorrow at midnight.
But House Republicans are once again undermining the process by jamming in provisions for their special interest backers. In the middle of the night, they slipped in a provision that would allow big banks to gamble with money insured by taxpayers. It&rsquo;s opening the door for another taxpayer-funded bailout of big banks.
Republicans were hoping this would go unnoticed. We can&rsquo;t let that happen. David -- Sign your name right now to demand Boehner remove these provisions gutting Wall Street Reform &gt;&gt;
The Republicans want to saddle middle class families with the burden of Wall Street&rsquo;s failures. We need to raise our voices and say:
we&rsquo;re not going to stand for it!
