Wicker Raises Concerns About Looming
Defense Cuts
Congress, White House Should
Address
Sequestration in a Responsible
Way
One of the biggest challenges facing our military
today is the return of sequestration on October 1 of this year.
These meat-ax defense cuts
which have been limited for two years
under the "Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013"
threaten to impair our armed
forces' ability to respond to emerging threats around the world.
They were a last-ditch effort to reduce federal spending, which is
desperately needed, but are indiscriminate rather than strategic.
The Navy is already down
to its fewest ships since World War I, and the Air Force is smaller
than it has been since it was established in 1947.
Now is not the
time to ask our service members to shoulder more sacrifices because of
America's debt problem.
Rising Debt &amp; Military
Strength
The onus is on the
White House and Congress to reach an agreement that addresses the real
drivers of our country's debt.
At the very least, we should provide
military leaders with the flexibility to mitigate the cuts.
Otherwise, we jeopardize the capacity of our troops to fulfill their
missions and remain prepared for unforeseen contingencies.
I am
hopeful that the budget resolution produced by the House and Senate this
year will offer these
reforms.
As a member of both the Senate Armed Services and Budget
committees, I will be actively involved in efforts to protect our service
members while putting America on a sustainable financial path.
Retired
Marine Corps General Jim Mattis offered a profound warning to the
Armed Services Committee late last month.
He said, "No nation in
history has maintained its military power if it failed to keep its
fiscal house in order."
Addressing America's debt problem is crucial
to protecting our national security interests.
It should not,
however, require a draconian approach that guts our defense
capabilities.
Warning From New Defense
Secretary
Dr. Ashton Carter discussed the
consequences of sequestration during his confirmation hearing earlier this
month.
The new Secretary of Defense told the Armed Services
Committee that sequester "conveys a misleadingly diminished picture of our
power in the eyes of friends and foes alike."
He also reiterated
the need for less wasteful spending and more
accountability.
As Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I
asked Dr. Carter specifically about sequestration's impact on the Navy
and Marine Corps.
He responded that sequestration could cause
both services to "become smaller, less ready, and less modern," not to
mention the negative impact on our vibrant shipbuilding industrial
base.
These services are
crucial to maintaining a forward presence in volatile parts of the world,
in addition to advancing the Administration's pivot to the Asia-Pacific
region.
Amphibious ships, in particular, are versatile and
responsive components of our maritime strategy, but they take time to
build and require a long-term investment.
The current budget
situation fails to offer this certainty to military planners, disrupting
efforts to safeguard the future viability of our
forces.
Fighting the Islamic
State
Solving America's budget challenges is made more difficult by global
unrest, from an increasingly aggressive Russia to horrific violence
in the Middle East.
Not only does Congress play an important role
in providing oversight of the defense budget, but it also approves
any authorization for the use of military force.
The President
recently submitted such an authorization request regarding the fight
against the Islamic State.
This provides us an opportunity to begin
a serious debate on a strong and appropriate allied response to
ISIS.
These terrorists pose a
real and formidable threat to our national security interests.
I
look forward to working with my colleagues, military leaders, and the
Administration on a plan that engages our allies in the Arab world to
eliminate this evil.
