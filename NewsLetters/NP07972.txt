The annual commemoration of the Liberation of Guam and the Battle for the Northern Mariana Islands was held at Arlington National Cemetery today. Guam First Lady Christine Calvo, Guam Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo, and I laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in the solemn ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Marianas Campaign in World War II.

Airman First Class Walter P. Wesley, Jr. served as the flag bearer for this years Wreath Laying ceremony. A1C Wesley is a former Saipan resident and Saipan Southern High School student. He is currently stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland serving on the 779th Aerospace and Operational Physiology Training Flight.
Congress authorizes increases in job training funds
The Northern Marianas will soon get additional help to bring U.S. workers into the labor force. The House passed H.R.803 , the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which authorizes a 17 percent increase in job training program funding over the next six years. The bill passed by a vote of 415-6 this week; and now goes to the President for signature. In addition to the jump in training funds, H.R.803
is designed to give Governors and Workforce Investment Boards greater flexibility to use the money to meet local job needs. Another important change from the current Workforce Investment Act, or WIA, which the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act now replaces are new benchmarks to ensure that those who get training emerge with the skills and certifications they can use to get jobs. The bill also focuses more of the funding set aside for youth under the age of 24 to those who are out of school. As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which had jurisdiction over this bill, I am generally satisfied with the positive impact it will have on our job training efforts in the Northern Marianas.

Committee approves bills to help college students
The House Education and the Workforce Committee marked up a series of higher education bills this week aimed at helping students and their families make better informed decisions about the costs and benefits of attending college. The three bipartisan bills all passed by voice vote. Each targets a different area of higher education policy.
*
H.R. 4984, Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act . To address the problem of growing student debt, this bill will provide better financial counseling for students before they sign up for loans. It is important that students make well-informed decisions about how to finance their education and how much debt they can afford to take on.
*
H.R. 4983, Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act . To assess whether a given college has a good track record graduating students with the skills they need to get jobs, H.R. 4983 creates a new College Dashboard tool. The dashboard will provide helpful information about colleges including their enrollment numbers, completion rates, the net cost of attendance, average student loan debt and repayment rates, and a schools use of adjunct faculty.
*
H.R. 3136, Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act . To help find ways to reduce the costs of higher education, H.R. 3136 authorizes projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing credit for competence. The bill requires annual evaluation of each project to determine program quality and will track the progress of participating students towards earning a degree.
Each of these bills can help college students and their families. But the bills only nibble around the edges of the larger questions of making higher education more available to all Americans and tackling skyrocketing tuition costs. What is really needed to combat these issues is a full reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. With little legislative time remaining in this Congress, however, HEA reauthorization appears more and more unlikely.

Garapan Public Market nears opening -- Some great photos of the ready-to-open Garapan Public Market appeared in the press this week. The ribbon-cutting for the facility is expected very soon. The Public Market has been long in the making and many people deserve credit for bringing the concept to reality. Your congressional office played a role, too, by obtaining $200,000 in congressionally directed funding
an earmark
in 2010 specifically to cover the cost of the Garapan Public Market. Photo credit Marianas Variety.
House approves 15% increase for Weatherization Assistance Program in FY15
The Weatherization Assistance Program in the Northern Marianas has helped homeowners improve the seals around windows and doors and make other changes that can lower CUC bills. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives agreed to increase funding for the program in the Northern Marianas and nationwide by 15 percent, as part of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015. And the bill continues funding for the State Energy Program at $50 million, the same as in fiscal 2014. SEP, too, helps homeowners cut their electricity bills by becoming more energy efficient.
