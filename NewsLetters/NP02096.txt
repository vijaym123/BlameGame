A Balanced Budget for a Stronger
America:
Ive had many titles before I came to Congress, mom,
CPA, State Treasurer - and in all of those situations Ive always had to
balance the budget.
Thats why Im proud that House
Republicans this week rolled out a budget that will balance within the
budget window
something that the president has been incapable of
doing. His budget never ever balances and he can never point to a time
in history where he will stop spending more of the taxpayers money than
he takes in.
There is no doubt we have a lot of challenges
ahead of us, but our plan to help make America more secure, cut
waste, boost our economy, and get this balanced budget in place is a good
first step.

remarks on the budget at this weeks GOP leadership press
conference.
Honoring our Ag Community for National Ag
Day:
Having grown up on a dairy farm and seeing how hard my
parents worked 7 days a week 365 days a year, I know just how important the
agriculture industry is to Kansas. Our farmers and ranchers produce
the safest and most abundant food supply in the world and I urge
all Kansans and all Americans to thank a farmer this week. Im proud to
be a Kansas farm girl, proud to be from an Ag state, and immensely
proud to represent so many incredible farmers and ranchers in
Congress.
It was also great
to have the Kansas Farm Bureau in DC this week and to hear even more
about how important the Ag industry is in Kansas and what we can do as
lawmakers to continue to support and protect our farmers.
Supporting
Hospitals around Kansas:
I had a great meeting with
Adele Ducharme of St. Lukes Cushing Hospital in Leavenworth. Adele
told me about some of the specific issues hospitals in Kansas are facing
and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress to ensure folks
back home receive the healthcare they need and deserve.
Listening to our Soybean Growers:
Everyone knows
the importance of soybeans to the Kansas economy. Meeting with the
Kansas Soybean Association this week was a great chance to hear more
about the current state of the industry and what we can do in Congress to
support soybean growers.
Talking
Healthcare Costs with LeadingAge Kansas:
It was good to
have a productive discussion with LeadingAge Kansas about our ongoing
efforts to repeal the Medicare Therapy Caps as well as some of the other
issues currently facing hospitals in Eastern Kansas.
Sharing Kansas with the World:
I also enjoyed
meeting with three high school exchange students from all over the world
who stopped by my office to share their American experiences with me.
The girls are participating in programs sponsored by the State
Department and are spending a total of 10 months living and studying in
Eastern Kansas. We wish them the best of luck for their time in our nation
and great state!
