David --
Each day is bringing us closer and closer to this year&rsquo;s budget deadline, and some Congressional Republicans are sitting on their hands refusing to act.
Despite the devastating costs of last year&rsquo;s government shutdown, many House Republicans are actually threatening another shutdown.
Cheri won&rsquo;t stand for it. If you agree we must deliver a message to the right-wing to stop their dangerous political games, sign our petition: Stand with Cheri today and sign our petition to tell Republicans: No More Government Shutdowns &gt;&gt;
David, Illinois families and families across America cannot afford another shutdown.
That&rsquo;s why Cheri&rsquo;s joining Democratic leaders across the country to avoid another devastating government shutdown.
