Congressman Perry to Hold Town Meeting in Stewartstown Next Week
To ensure his constituents are able to share their concerns regarding issues before the United States Congress and the federal government, U.S. Representative Scott Perry (PA-4) will host a town meeting next week. The meeting will be held from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, February 18 at the Eureka Volunteer Fire and Ambulance Company, 82 North Main St., Stewartstown.
Constituents will be updated by Rep. Perry on issues currently facing Congress, including the federal budget, job creation and homeland and national security. Afterwards, Rep. Perry will welcome questions.
For me effectively to represent my constituents in Congress, I regularly need
and seek - their feedback on the issues facing our country, Perry said.
This town meeting continues Rep. Perrys active efforts to solicit constituent feedback. Hes met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted regular in-person town and tele-town meetings throughout the 4th Congressional District, and aggressively utilizes social media to interact with the citizens he serves. More than 15,000 constituents have signed up for regular updates via Congressman Perrys e-newsletter, Facebook or Twitter pages. Social media venues allow him to solicit constituent feedback and provide information on the issues before Congress, while also saving taxpayer resources.
Future town meetings will be announced shortly. Residents unable to attend such meetings in person are encouraged to contact Congressman Perry and his staff at any of the offices, or via Perry.House.Gov, where they may sign up for e-mail updates and for his new Facebook, Twitter and You Tube pages.
