In response to the continued actions that threaten Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, the United States imposed
new sanctions
on Russia earlier this week.
The Department of the Treasury is imposing sanctions on seven Russian government officials, who will be subject to an asset freeze and a U.S. visa ban, and seventeen companies linked to Putins inner circle, which will be subject to an asset freeze.
In addition, the Departments of Commerce and State have announced a tightened policy to deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russias military capabilities.
