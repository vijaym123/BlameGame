URGENT: MIDNIGHT DEADLINE Hillary Clinton is asking for your help to rescue Democrats in deadlocked races. Donate $5 before our final end of month deadline.
David -- we finally have some GREAT news:
FOX NEWS POLL: "The Race for Congress tightens" Democrat 45%
Republicans 44%
Our hard work is paying off -- the race for Congress is a dead-heat!
Here are the details: the percentage of Democrats who are &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; interested in this election has skyrocketed. That&rsquo;s exactly what we were hoping for!
Typically in midterm elections, Republicans are more tuned in. But this poll shows that in the last two weeks, Democrats have narrowed the enthusiasm gap with Republicans. By how much? A whopping 11 points!
Now, we need to rev up our get-out-the-vote program, pull off a last-minute comeback, and shock the world!
