Dear Friends,
The House is currently considering Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that gives Congress the power to set the objectives for any trade agreement the executive branch may negotiate in the next several years. It requires those agreements to be made public at least 60 days before they are signed. Congress would still have final voting approval on any proposed agreement. Some groups seem to have confused this bill that authorizes negotiations with specific trade agreements that have not yet been reached.
Two points to keep in mind: Trade is very important to our part of Texas. About 25 percent of the pork, 50 percent of the wheat, 90 percent of the cotton, and 90 percent of the harvested sorghum produced in our congressional district is sold overseas. Many other kinds of businesses depend heavily on overseas sales as well.
Secondly, China is busily working to be a dominant power
militarily and economically. They aim to write the rules for international affairs in a way that benefits them. And they may well be successful if the U.S. continues to sit on the sidelines. We need trade agreements with American rules to hold other countries accountable to our standards and to sell American products and services to the world on a level playing field. We have to get in the game.
Unfortunately, Rep. Nancy Pelosi has led most House Democrats to oppose trade negotiating authority. I hope that they will reconsider their position in order to help create jobs and also to enhance our nations security.
