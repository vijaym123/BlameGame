As your Representative in Congress, I value your thoughts and opinions
on the key issues affecting our country and community. In fact, I can't
do my job properly without them.
As we move into the summer months, my colleagues and I in the 113th
Congress have less than seven months to work on a wide range of
important matters. I hope you will take a moment to let me know how you
feel on this issue:
Should Congress pass legislation that bans civilians from buying
weapons with high-capacity magazines?*
Yes - Weapons with high-capacity magazines serve no sporting or
self-defense purpose
Maybe - Only assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines should
be banned
No - Congress should never restrict gun ownership rights
Not sure
