The Navy and the Army Are Facing Debilitating Cuts
The U.S. Navy, just 283 vessels, seems poised to shrink even further as sea-power investments are deferred in the name of savings.
Your editorial
"Obama's Shrinking Army"
(March 1) makes clear the many dangers associated with the administration's decision to reduce the U.S. Army to its smallest size since World War II. History shows us the inherent danger in reductions of this size, particularly as the international environment, from Ukraine to the South China Sea, becomes increasingly unstable. Yet the negative implications of the president's defense reductions extend far beyond the Army.
The U.S. Navy, today numbering just 283 vessels, seems poised to shrink even further as sea-power investments are regularly deferred in the name of savings. Despite Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's insistence that the Navy must grow to "support the global demands for naval presence," he proceeded to announce further cuts to the Navy's size and strength, including removing 11 cruisers from the fleet and canceling the planned procurement of 20 relatively inexpensive littoral combat ships. The administration also appears ready to reduce our aircraft-carrier fleet by forgoing needed maintenance on the USS George Washington, shortening her service life and stretching the demands on our carrier force. Alongside these cuts, in key classes of ships, including attack submarines and amphibious ships, the Navy will experience continued requirement shortfalls in the coming years.
If Chinese and Russian boldness in recent years is any indication, the world is watching our decisions and calculating its response. I am reminded of the late Congressman Carl Vinson's maxim that, "The most expensive thing in the world is a cheap Army and Navy."
