and/or added via amendment during the Wednesday, May 7th all-day House
Armed Services Committee mark-up
session.
"The annual
mark-up and appropriations process is where I have the opportunity to
showcase my priorities in the House Armed Services Committee. I am
extremely pleased that Military Construction will be fully funded in
Colorado Springs. Tens of millions of dollars will be spent in the local
economy that will assist the job market and the areas surrounding Fort
Carson and Peterson. By identifying cost savings to the taxpayer and
focusing on our Missile Defense network, I reaffirm my commitments that
I have always shown in Congress. I will remain dedicated to fiscal
responsibility and a strong national defense."
