Dear
Friends,
We are under attack.
Nearly every day, we hear
about criminals from around
the world targeting our
nations critical
infrastructure and sensitive
information through
cyberattacks. That is why
its so important that
our nation and government
focus on securing our online
communications and systems so
that consumers, businesses,
and the government can be
prepared for these
attacks.
To help meet this challenge,
earlier this week I held a
hearing in the Homeland
Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee on
how
the government and private
sector can partner to address
cyber threats . I also
plan to hold a hearing next
week focusing on
how
government and business can
collaborate to protect
consumers , like you, when
our best efforts fail and a
data breach occurs, like the
recent breaches at Target and
Neiman Marcus that affected
so many of us.
While Congress has an
important role to play in
enhancing our nations
cybersecurity efforts,
legislation alone is not
enough. Government, business,
and academia must work
together to find a solution
to these problems. Our nation
needs a workforce with the
technical knowledge and
skills necessary to protect
our vulnerable digital
systems. Here in Delaware,
programs like the
Cybersecurity Initiative at
the University of Delaware
are leading the way in
educating and training our
future cybersecurity leaders.
I hope other universities
take UDs lead and
begin offering similar
programs to fill demand in
this growing field.
Cybersecurity affects all
of us, so I want to hear your
views on this critical issue.
You can reach out about this,
or anything else, through
