Happy Mothers Day
I would like to wish every mother out there a very happy Mothers Day. Without our mothers we of course wouldnt be here, but without our good mothers many of us wouldnt be where we are today. I had a great mother
a great supporter, one that was very strong and took care of me when I was young, which was a very big and difficult job.
Mothers, including my two daughters, play an important part in our society
more important than people realize. The ability to love, take care of and nurture, and discipline our young
as you have all been able to do
to raise productive citizens for the state of Alaska and this nation is crucially important. Again, I wish all mothers out there a very joyful and happy day as you spend time with your loved ones.
Husbands and fathers, please remember to wish these wonderful women a happy Mothers Day, they are the ones who brought our children onto this earth. God Bless you all and again happy Mothers Day.
