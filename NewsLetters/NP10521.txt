Dear
Fellow Earthlings,
Next Tuesday, April 22, is
one of my favorite days of
the year: Earth Day. On
this day, people around the
world come together to
appreciate the gifts of the
environment, and to remind
each other of the importance
of preserving our planet for
future generations.
One of the simplest ways I
like to show my appreciation
for our planet year-round is
by recycling. As
co-chair of the Senate
Recycling Caucus, I am always
looking for new ways to
promote recycling across the
country. Especially in
a small state like Delaware,
where landfill space is
scarce, its important
to think outside the
cardboard box when it comes
to recycling items we use
every day. Im
sure many of you, like me,
have old electronic devices
in your home that
youre not sure what
you should do with.
This Earth Day, I
encourage all of you to join
me in gathering up old
electronics you no longer use
and taking them to an
electronic recycling
site near you. You can
check out my
website
for tips on where to find a
collection point in your
area, how to prepare your
devices for recycling, and
more.
I also hope you will join
me in stopping by the
Delaware Solid Waste
Authoritys Electronic
Goods Recycling Event on
Saturday, April 19. The
event takes place from 8 AM
until 2PM at Barley Mill
Plaza in Wilmington. I know
Im looking forward to
cleaning out some space in my
house and dropping off some
of my old electronics for
recycling. Recycling is
one way that we can work
together to reduce the waste
in Delawares landfills
and help keep our environment
clean for generations to
come.
As always, I look forward
to hearing from you on this,
or any other topic, through
email
or by contacting me on
