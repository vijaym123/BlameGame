Dear Friend,
Right now, all across Massachusetts, families are buying school supplies and getting ready for the fall. The money these families are spending will give their kids the tools they need to succeed when it counts.
Our campaign is also investing in the fall -- but so are the big oil Koch brothers. They&rsquo;ve placed multi-million dollar ad buys in races all around the country, and there&rsquo;s no telling where they&rsquo;ll spend their billions next. There&rsquo;s too much at stake in this year&rsquo;s elections, and we have to be prepared for anything. Help us reach our $55,000 August goal by making a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5

Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I know it might seem like the Kochs don&rsquo;t have much to do with back-to-school spending, but that&rsquo;s only because their shadowy network continues to elude the national media. Their group, Americans for Prosperity, is one of the leading proponents behind the nationwide campaign to gut our public schools and to force teachers and students alike to pay more out-of-pocket costs.
When you have as much money as the Koch brothers, you can afford to have your groups playing the long game to defund public schools and purchase airtime in the short-run to buy the Senate. The only way to beat them is to organize from the grassroots up. We&rsquo;re on track for victory in November, but a single check from the Koch brothers could swing the momentum of this race overnight. Keep our campaign going strong by getting us $5 closer to our $55,000 goal.
Thanks.
Ed
