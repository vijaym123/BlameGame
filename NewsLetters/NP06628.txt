Griffith Labor Day Statement
Monday, September 1, 2014
Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA) issued the following statement honoring American workers:
On Labor Day, we take time to honor Americas working men and women and the extraordinary work ethic that the people of our nation are well-known for possessing.
From educators to coal miners, farmers to medical professionals, bankers to welders, and more, American workers are the best in the world.
Our people take pride in their work, produce high-quality goods and top-rate services, and work diligently to provide for their families and those in their communities.
My gratitude to all who have worked so hard to see that America is resilient and strong.
I wish you a safe and happy Labor Day with family, friends, and community.
