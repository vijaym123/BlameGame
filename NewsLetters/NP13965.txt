Dear Friends,
Sea level rise is one of the most serious consequences of climate change and it will have a profound effect on San Mateo County which has more people and property at risk from the rising sea than any other Bay Area county.
Please join San Mateo County Supervisor Dave Pine, Assemblyman Rich Gordon and me to hear from federal, state and local experts to learn about the magnitude of the challenge we face and the options and strategies that are available to plan for and adapt to this new reality.
Our keynote speaker will be John Englander, nationally acclaimed author of &ldquo; High Tide on Main Street .&rdquo; Find a full list of
