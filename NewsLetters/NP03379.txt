President Should Focus on Pro-Growth
Ideas in
State of the Union Address
Stagnant Wages
Leave Americans
Wondering, 'Where Is the
Recovery?'
In the weeks
leading up to his State of the Union address, President Obama has been busy
defending his policies with speeches across the country.
Recent
upticks in economic numbers provide a few positive statistics for the
President to talk about, but many Americans agree that a full
recovery has yet to be achieved.
Simply put, they still feel left
behind.
Doing More With
Less
For one, wages have flat-lined.
The
latest jobs report reveals that wage growth remains alarmingly sluggish,
with average hourly earnings dropping in December.
Over the past
year, the gauge rose a mere 1.7 percent
barely above the inflation
rate.
As food, utility, and health-care costs continue to rise,
working Americans and their families are forced to do more with less.
The news about wages signals
a more fragile economy than the jobs report might suggest at first
glance.
In fact, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has expressed
concerns that stagnant wage growth points to "weaker labor market
conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate."
Instead of joining a robust, highly skilled workforce, many
Americans are settling for low-wage work and part-time hours just to pay the
bills.
At the same time, job creators are dealing with the
financial burdens of the Obama Administration's health-care mandates and
regulatory overreach, rather than expanding their businesses and hiring.
One of the most troubling statistics is the labor force
participation rate, which indicates that the United States currently has the
smallest workforce in 36 years.
Boosting Job
Creation
With the economy in need of big
improvements, the new Republican majority in Congress has made quick
work of bringing job-creating ideas to the table.
Since the
114th Congress convened earlier this month, more than 200 bills have been
introduced, such as approving the Keystone XL pipeline and repealing
some of the most harmful aspects of the President's health-care
law.
Part of the solution is
getting red tape out of the way.
One of the new bills I have
cosponsored would help boost economic growth by targeting job-killing
regulations.
The "Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act,"
authored by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), would require federal agencies to
assess the costs and benefits of the rules they propose.
The
Environmental Protection Agency, for example, would have to identify the
economic burdens of its regulations on power plants and farm streams.
The bill would help ensure that a rule's impact on the American
people and the U.S. economy is part of bureaucrats' decision-making
process.
Finding Common
Ground
Republican lawmakers are ready to send bills to the
White House for the President's signature.
The State of the
Union address on January 20 should provide some insight into whether
President Obama is willing to work with Congress on practical solutions.
So far, his early veto threats on bipartisan legislation suggest
more confrontation than cooperation.
In a divided government, it will take both political
parties to produce results and a lasting recovery.
Ronald Reagan and
Bill Clinton recognized this during their times in office, choosing to
work with Congress to pass bold reforms.
President Obama now has
the opportunity to do the same.
