This week, following the horrific acts of terrorism that rocked France last week, leaders from around the world gathered at a Unity Rally in Paris, France, to express solidarity in the fight against the growing threat of terrorism. Approximately 1.5 million people, including over 40 world leaders, ranging from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, joined the march this past Sunday.
Attorney General Eric Holder
was present in Paris
over the weekend for counter-terrorism discussions. He did not, however, attend the rally. Instead, the most visible American official present at the march was U.S. Ambassador to France, Jane Hartley. In response, the Administration has faced heavy criticism over the decision not to send a senior official to
Sundays rally .
In a press briefing today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the absence was due to security concerns, as well as the fact that the White House did not want President Obamas presence to disrupt the gathering. He added, though, that, I think its fair to say we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there.
Question of the week :
Should the United States have had a higher level of representation at Sundays Paris rally for unity?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
