Dear Friends,
Congress is out of
session this week for the district work period, so I've been traveling
across West Virginia and meeting with small business owners, local
leaders, and university educators and students.
In the Northern Panhandle, I visited
Eagle Manufacturing in Wellsburg. Eagle Manufacturing has adapted to
new technologies and market demands, helping it succeed as a major
employer in Brooke County for more than 100 years. I also visited West
Liberty University and met with members of the Weirton Area Chamber of
Commerce.
In
North Central West Virginia, I visited one of the region's major
employers, Pratt &amp; Whitney. I also met with leaders at NASA's Independent
Verification &amp; Validation center in Fairmont (pictured above),
which partners with colleges to provide internships and hands-on
experience for students.
And in
Huntington, I met with Marshall University President Stephen Kopp to
hear his thoughts on higher education. I also saw Marshall's Forensic
Science Center (pictured above) and learned how the center works with law
enforcement to advance forensic technology and
research.
BLACK LUNG ASSISTANCE
In 2013, West
Virginia received more than $1.4 million in federal assistance to help
treat 8,500 miners affected by black lung disease. However, a new
U.S. Health and Human Services decision would arbitrarily cap grants for
black lung assistance at $900,000, which would greatly affect the
state of West Virginia's ability to help miners.
I have asked
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to reverse this arbitrary decision and
to instead award grant money based on the need for services, not caps.
I hope she will see that assistance should be distributed based on
need, not bureaucratic measures.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as
always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
Moore Capito
