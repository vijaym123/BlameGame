November 27, 2013
D e ar Friends,
At this time of the year, it
is important to remember the less fortunate. There are too many
Americans
including 3.2 million New Yorkers
who cannot afford to put food
on their tables.
It is with these
Americans in mind that I have strongly opposed cuts to the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). I am honored that Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi chose to name me as a conferee for the Federal
Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act, more commonly known as the Farm
Bill. I am especially pleased to have this opportunity to underscore to
my colleagues the importance of SNAP benefits. In 2012 alone, SNAP
allowed 4 million Americans to rise above the poverty line, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau. I intend to do all that I can in my capacity as
a conferee to restore the harsh cuts to SNAP included in the Houses
version of the Farm Bill. If you would like to read my opening remarks
at the first meeting of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, please
visit this link:
http://engel.house.gov/latest-news1/engel-remarks-following-first-meeting-of-farm-bill-conference-committee/.
With recent cuts reducing the SNAP benefits
to a meager $1.40 per meal, I invite the people of New Yorks 16th
District to join me in recognizing those who work to help our neighbors in
need. Local soup kitchens, food shelters, and several food drives
have been organized by the people of the 16th District. Now is a time for
people to come together and few activities are more unifying than
sharing. If you would like to find a location close to your home that is
accepting donations, you can visit the Food Bank for Westchester
website at http://foodbankforwestchester.org/, or the Food Bank for New
York City website at http://www.foodbanknyc.org/.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
