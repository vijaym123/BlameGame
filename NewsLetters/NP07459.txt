I'm just... disgusted.
In a few moments, Barack Obama will become the first President -- ever -- to be sued by Congress.
Boehner is clearly trying to get his chance to drag the President's good name through the mud.
I&rsquo;m tired of it. I&rsquo;m fed up. And I&rsquo;m ready to fight back.
David, I know you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action yet. But there has NEVER been a more critical time than right now to support the President.
