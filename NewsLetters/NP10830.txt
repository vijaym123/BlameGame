Friends,
This week,
the House passed a bill I cosponsored to restore the 40 hour work week . It's called the Save American Workers Act.
We had to pass this because,
under Obamacare, the definition of "full time employee" was set at 30 hours per week . Hudson Institute research on the impact of this policy shows that
2.6 million
Americans are at risk of losing hours and pay.
Why? Businesses that cant afford Obamacares health insurance requirements for full-time workers or the noncompliance fine will (or have already) cut workers hours below 30 per week, creating a group sometimes called the 29ers.
Simply put,
that means less money for rent, gas and groceries for families in Georgia
and across the country. Many have already suffered this fate under the health care law.
The full time work standard in American has long been 40 hours. The new 30-hour standard under Obamacare prompted one of my colleagues to point out that the definition of
a full time job in leisurely France is even 35 hours-- a policy set in place by a leftist coalition that included socialists and communists.
President Obama often talks about giving the American people a raise, so I urge him to support repealing his harmful policy so we can return billions of dollars to workers wallets today.
How much of a raise would my bill provide?
The Congressional Budget Office reported that it would increase cash wages by $75 billion and cut taxes by $63 billion.
