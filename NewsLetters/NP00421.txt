David, we'll be blunt: Cheri's the most vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
The press, Boehner,
everyone
-- they&rsquo;re all watching to see if we have what it takes to win another tough election in 2016. They&rsquo;re looking for any sign of weakness.
To show our strength, we&rsquo;ve set an aggressive online goal for May.

Cheri's running for re-election to give the middle class a fair shot.
But our work isn&rsquo;t finished. If we&rsquo;re going to keep fighting to grow the middle class and protect Medicare and Social Security we can&rsquo;t back down now.
David, we're asking -- please donate $5 or more today: http://act.cheribustos.com/donate
Thanks for not backing down,
