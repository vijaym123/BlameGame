ISSUES
LEGISLATION
June 14, 2015
Dear
David,
This past
week in Washington, DC was a busy one. On Thursday, the House
prioritized funding a strong military by passing
H.R. 2685, the FY16 Department of Defense Appropriations
Act , which includes a 2.3% pay raise for our troops while remaining
within budget caps. The House also passed
H.R. 2577, the 2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations
Act, and I joined with Rep. Jeff Denham in passing an
amendment to H.R. 2577 that would prohibit any further federal funding
of Californias high speed rail proposal. The measure specifically
prohibits so-called tapered matching, in which the state spends
federal funds without concurrently providing the required state matching
funds. Despite years of broken deadlines and the hundreds of millions
spent on consultants and PR firms as well as a just-for-show
groundbreaking, Californias high speed rail project is no closer to being built
than it was seven years ago, and it is time to hit the brakes. To learn
more,

are some recent highlights from DC and around our district. To stay in
touch with me throughout the week and to share your thoughts with me,

me via my

Sincerely,
This past week, the House passed H.R. 2289,
the Commodity End User Relief
Act , with a vote of 246-171. This measure would reauthorize and improve
the operations at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The bill contains a number of provisions, including protections for
end-users, such as ranchers, farmers, manufacturers, and public utilities
against burdensome and costly regulatory policies under Dodd-Frank.
Also included in the bill was my Public Power Risk Management Act, which
passed with the full support of the House last year. There are over
2,000 publicly-owned utilities across the country, including one in
Redding, who were placed at a major disadvantage to private companies
under Dodd-Frank rules limiting their ability to negotiate with swap
deals. This bill levels the playing field permanently and ensures that 47
million customers will not see their rates increase due to arbitrary
regulatory policies.

their graduating class
trip.
Rep. LaMalfa meets with Chris and Candace
Gallion to discuss the problems veterans face when returning home to
their communities and how programs, such as the Farm Credit Council's
Homegrown by Heroes, can assist our veterans who are or would like to
start farming and ranching in our rural areas across the country.
Chris and Candace Gallion are northern

Rep.
LaMalfa meets with Steve Grossman of Sierra Nevada Brewing and Tom
McCormick of the California Craft Brewers Association to discuss the
Small BREW Act , which lowers federal
taxes on craft beer production, particularly for very small breweries, and
allows brewers to put money back into their businesses, hire more
workers, and purchase new equipment.
Rep. LaMalfa
congratulates
Tyler Younkers of Red Bluff
on his appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy,
Andrew Klassen of Chico on his appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, and
Kevin Williams of Yreka

this form of filmmaking is difficult for amateur videographers, and by
