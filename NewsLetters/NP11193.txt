Putting Strategic Need Front and Center in
National Security Budget Decisions
When it comes to national security, budget decisions must be made based
on strategic need, not on how many dollars the Administration thinks
should be cut to fund its own priorities. That's the firm message I
passed along to top Pentagon and military officials in two recent
Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearings on the fiscal year 2015
Department of Defense and United States Navy budget requests.
On March 13, I pressed Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey to
maintain a robust United States Navy fleet as they presented the fiscal
year 2015 Defense Department budget request to the Subcommittee. Video

Cheifs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey on March 13.
Two weeks later on March 25, I carried a similar message regarding
fleet and air squadrons to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Chief
Naval Officer Jonathan Greenert on the Navy's budget request for the
coming year. Video link: http://tinyurl.com/lu7foyq
Talking with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and CNO, Admiral Jonathan
Greenert on March 25.
We only need consider the Ukraine or North Korea to be reminded that
the world is full of threats that must be managed to the best of our
ability. To me, that requires maintaining LCS production levels,
preventing the removal of 11 cruisers from the fleet, and making sure
P-8 Poseidons,
E-2D Hawkeyes, submarines, and all other assets are at
the levels we need to accomplish Navy and joint missions for decades to
come.
New CDC Autism Stats Underscore Need for ABLE Act
The increase in the prevalence of autism in children announced by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday further
underscored the need for Congress to take up and pass the Achieving and
Better Life Experience Act (ABLE Act - H.R. 647, S. 313).
One in sixty-eight children have been identified as having autism
spectrum disorder - a 30% increase from a 2012 CDC estimate. Those
living with autism, Down syndrome, and other disabilities face enormous
financial difficulties, yet they cannot benefit from the same
IRS-sanctioned tools that other Americans enjoy in planning for their
future.
The ABLE Act opens the door for them to live their lives to their
highest potential by making tax-free savings accounts available to
cover qualified expenses in areas such as education, housing, medical,
and transportation. The legislation has earned the support of more than
half of the United States Congress (350 House co-sponsors and 69 Senate
co-sponsors) and more than 100 local, state, and national disability
advocacy organizations.
ABLE is about leveling the playing field for all those who live with
disabilities, and the time is now to turn this legislation into law.

The
