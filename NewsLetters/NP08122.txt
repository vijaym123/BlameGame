2014 MARCH FOR MARRIAGE
This month, thousands of Americans across the country united
in Washington, D.C. to march in support of traditional marriage between one man
and one woman.
At a time when many are seeking to redefine marriage and
denounce its virtues, I am extremely grateful for those who continue to
dedicate their time and efforts to protecting this sacred institution.
I
remain committed to standing with you in fighting to uphold traditional
marriage.
LANDMARK VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
In a landmark decision for religious freedom, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of family-owned businesses, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby finding that the Obamacare HHS contraceptive mandate is a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
This Supreme Court ruling will allow Americans to continue to live and work according to their beliefs without fear of punishment by the government.
The HHS contraceptive mandate would have wrongfully forced family-owned businesses to participate in the distribution of potentially life-terminating drugs and devices.
Moreover, it would have imposed severe fines on business owners who chose to follow their religious beliefs or conscience, jeopardizing the viability of many Americans businesses and livelihoods.
No family should be forced to choose between following their faith and submitting to unlawful government mandates. I am extremely pleased with this ruling and grateful that the Supreme Court reaffirmed our religious liberties.
Freedom of religion is a bedrock principle of our nation guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution.
We must continue fighting to ensure that these rights remain protected for all Americans.
