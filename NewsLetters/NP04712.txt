Promise of Democracy Still Strong
25 Years
After Berlin Wall's Collapse
Challenges
Remain to Confront Expansionist
Russia
The fall of the Berlin Wall remains one of the most
iconic moments of the 20th century.
For nearly 30 years, the wall
represented the great divide between communism and democracy.
On Nov. 9, 1989, the announcement that East Germans could travel to
West Germany set into motion the wall's demolition.
By 1991, the
Soviet Union had collapsed, and the Cold War was
over.
The road to democracy has not been easy for many
post-communist republics, where corruption and authoritarianism are
still a threat to freedoms.
But the end of Soviet rule ushered in
momentous reforms
reshaping political systems, promoting free
markets, and giving once-oppressed people a voice in their future.
Had it not been for the extraordinary leadership and courage of Ronald
Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II, the world might look
very different today.
Moscow's Power
Grabs
Russia's aggression in recent years
has led many to believe that the Kremlin is trying to rebuild the
Soviet empire.
Domestically, President Vladimir Putin has overseen
an increasingly repressive and undemocratic regime, where opposition
groups are punished and human rights are ignored.
On the world
stage, he has twice defied the sovereignty of neighboring states,
invading Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine earlier this year.
Accompanied by
sharp anti-American rhetoric, the power grabs have seriously strained
Moscow's already fragile relations with the
West.
Obama's
Failed 'Reset'
It
is disappointing that President Obama's misguided concessions and
promises have helped enable Putin's ambitions.
In 2009, he and
then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pursued a fruitless "reset" in
bilateral relations despite warnings that Russia could not be trusted to
keep its commitments.
Over the past five years, tensions between
Russia and the United States have escalated rather than improved.
Putin has spared no opportunity to rebuke America
either by
defending the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria or harboring U.S.
fugitive Edward Snowden.
Earlier this year, Obama Administration officials confirmed that Russia
had violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a pivotal
Cold War pact signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to limit both countries' arsenals.
Officials say Russia's
illegal testing of prohibited missiles began as early as 2008, making
the President's later "reset" and push for a New START Treaty look
ill-advised and nave at best.
I have
raised concerns about the Administration's knowledge of Russia's
potential treaty violations, asserting that Congress should be made aware
of this information when debating arms control treaties like New START.
Along with Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), I offered an amendment
to the National Defense Authorization Act that would require the
Department of Defense to inform Congress about any significant cases of
foreign noncompliance.
Ukraine Looks to the
West
Russia's military
intervention in Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea are the latest in a
litany of bold moves that America and our NATO allies cannot ignore.
Political leadership and willpower
like that of Reagan and
Thatcher
are necessary to hold strongmen like Putin accountable and
defend liberty in the world.
At the least, the United States and our
allies should provide Ukraine with the arms and supplies to defend
against Russian aggression.
Russia may object to the eastward
expansion of NATO's influence into former Soviet satellites, but its
encroachment has also reinvigorated the cause of freedom.
Ukraine's
parliamentary elections this month, for example, resulted in
overwhelming wins for pro-Western parties.
Twenty-five years after the fall
of the Berlin Wall, the strength of democracy continues to
endure.
