Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I hope you are enjoying a safe and happy holiday season! It is hard to
believe 2013 is coming to a close. In many ways, this was one of the
most challenging years of my life, but it was also one of the most
rewarding.
This year, we have hosted town hall meetings and Meet Your Congressman
events in all 19 counties of the Sixth District, responded to over
50,000 letters from folks throughout the district, hosted over a dozen
telephone-style town halls in the district, successfully resolved over
1,300 problems with the federal government brought to my office by
Kentuckians, and guided more than 1,000 of our citizens on tours of the
U.S. Capitol. Providing top-notch constituent service is the most
important part of my job as your Representative and I will continue to
work just as hard as we move into 2014.
I wish all the best for you and your loved ones in 2014, and I humbly
thank you again for the privilege to serve.
Cheering on the CATS!
Yesterday, Carol and I were proud to cheer our Cats on to victory
against the Louisville Cardinals! What an amazing game and incredible
atmosphere at Rupp! As I told the Lexington Herald-Leader
, I haven't missed a UK vs. U of L basketball game
either in person or on TV since Jim Master hit the buzzer-beater shot
to send the original Dream Game into overtime in the 1983 NCAA
tournament.
Way to go, Cats!!!
The Greatest Gift: Kentucky Troops Home for the Holidays
A little less than a year ago, I had the opportunity to speak to the
men and women of the Kentucky National Guard 149th Vertical
Construction Company before they deployed to Afghanistan. This past
Sunday, I was humbled to take part in their welcome home ceremony.
It was unbelievable to witness the reunion of families just in time for
Christmas. Thank you to these men and women whose service and
dedication reflect great credit upon themselves, their families and the
Commonwealth of Kentucky.

amazing welcome home ceremony

On Friday morning, I was glad to sit down with WKYT's Bill Bryant as a
guest on his show, Kentucky Newsmakers.
We had a great discussion
about how to best address the biggest challenges facing Kentuckians and
our nation.

Signature Industry Spotlight: Fighting Administration's Anti-Coal
Policies
During a House Financial Services Committee hearing on December 11, I
questioned Treasury Secretary Jack Lew about the Obama Administration's
policy guidance for the World Bank and the Export-Import Bank, which
discourages the sale of American coal overseas.
The respective missions of the World Bank and the Export-Import Bank
are to help grow the economies of developing countries and to support
American exporters in reaching new markets.
And yet, as part of this Administration's efforts to prevent the
mining, burning, and now even the exporting of domestic coal, these
organizations are being told to enforce greenhouse gas regulations
internationally - a recipe for hurting the world's poor and cutting off
markets for job-creating American export industries.
As I said to Secretary Lew, "If the goal truly is to deliver energy
diversity and opportunities to impoverished nations, we ought to
consider true energy diversity, which would include a portfolio of
coal-fired power."
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will share my weekly newsletter
with your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website
, Facebook
and Twitter

home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
Sincerely,

Signature

During
a
House
Financial

on
December
11,
I
questioned
Treasury
Secretary
Jack
Lew
about
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
policy
guidance
for
the
World
Bank
and
the
Export-Import
Bank,
which
discourages
the
sale
of
American

The
respective
missions
of
the
World

and
the
Export-Import
Bank
are
to
help
grow
the
economies
of
developing
countries
and
to
support
American
exporters
in
reaching
new
markets.
And
yet,
as
part
of
this
Administration&#8217;s
efforts
to
prevent
the
mining,
burning,
and
now
even
the
exporting
of
domestic

these

&#8211;
a

for
hurting
the

American
export
