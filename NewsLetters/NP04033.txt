Congressman Lamborn Supports the
Preventing Executive Overreach
Act
12/4/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 5759, the Preventing
Executive Overreach on Immigration Act. This bill states
that, except within strict
limits, the President does not have the
authority to exempt categories of people unlawfully present in the U.S.
from removal or to defer that removal. H.R. 5759 will apply to
President Obamas recently announced executive actions and any future ones
that also attempt to circumvent the law. The bill passed by a vote of
219 to 197.
"President Obama's actions are unlawful
and emblematic of his blatant disregard for the American people and our
system of government. I supported this bill because we must do
everything in our power to combat amnesty for illegal immigrants. H.R. 5759
is an important first step that reaffirms that unlawful executive
actions must not be allowed to carry the force of law. I, like the
President, made an oath to uphold the Constitution. The difference is
that I have every intention to continue to keep that
promise."

Background Information from the House Judiciary
Committee
On November 20, 2014, President Obama gave a speech to the nation in
which he outlined his intent to ignore immigration law violations of
certain categories of people
unlawful aliens who have been here for
more than five years and have U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident
children in the country
and grant them the affirmative immigration
benefits of work authorization and legal presence.
He also expanded the Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals (DACA) program, to remove the age cap by which applicants
previously had to apply and to change the eligible entry date from 2007 to
2010.
The President is alleging
prosecutorial discretion as authority for his
actions.
HR 5759 demonstrates that the Presidents actions are not
acceptable uses of prosecutorial discretion and that they violate Article
I Section 8 and Article II Section 3 of the Constitution.
It
further states that the Presidents actions are without constitutional
or statutory basis.
The bill provides for
necessary exceptional humanitarian and law enforcement
exceptions.
The effective date of the bill coincides
with the Presidents speech of November 20, and applies to all new and
previously denied requests for exemptions from and deferrals of removal
from the United States, as well as any related work
authorization.
