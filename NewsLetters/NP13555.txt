Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Christmas Parades in the 10th
Following votes last week, I traveled back to North Carolina to take part in a couple of Christmas parades in the 10th District.
On Friday the great folks in Bessemer City invited me to attend their annual Christmas parade.
Among those in attendance were Bessemer City Police Chief Tom Ellis, Gaston County Sheriff Alan Cloninger, and Bessemer City Mayor Becky Smith.
Below you can see some photos from the parade.
Then Saturday I had the honor of serving as the Grand Marshal for the annual Denver Christmas Parade.
Below you can see photos from the Denver parade.
Thanks to both Bessemer City and Denver for having me last weekend!
Kids First Research Act of 2013
On Tuesday of this week I joined with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass H.R. 2019, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act of 2013.
This legislation, which I cosponsored, would increase the pediatric research budget at the National Institutes of Health by ending federal funding for party nominating conventions.
You can see the roll call for the vote
here .
Earlier this year, I spoke on the House floor about H.R. 2019 and Brett Gosnell.
Brett was a Hickory native who passed away at the age of 20 from a rare muscle cancer.
For the last seven years, I have had the honor of participating in a charity bike ride in his honor called Brett's Ride that raised money for pediatric cancer research.
My hope is that this legislation would help save the lives of great kids like Brett.

Secretary Lew Testifies at Financial Services Comm.
This past Thursday the House Financial Services Committee heard testimony from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew during his annual appearance before the committee.
During my five minutes of questions I asked Secretary Lew about whether the Obama Administration seriously considered minting a $1 trillion coin to avoid the debt ceiling.
I also took some time to ask him about the Volcker Rule, a regulation finalized this week that prevents banks from taking part in proprietary trading.
You can view my exchange with Secretary Lew by clicking the image below:
What I Have Been Reading
Lie of the Year: 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep it'
PolitiFact.com
While I doubt this comes as a surprise to the hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians who had their insurance policies cancelled because of Obamacare, this week PolitiFact.com named President Obama's infamous "if you like your plan, you can keep it" claim its Lie of the Year.
Politifact; a non-partisan, Pulitizer Prize-winning project run by the Tampa Bay Times; outlines President Obama's broken promise that has hurt so many of my constituents.
Belmont Abbey, Hobby Lobby fight in Supreme Court deserves support
Gaston Gazette
One of the particularly objectionable parts of Obamacare are its attack on religious institutions.
By forcing these religous groups to go against their conscience and offer abortion coverage in healthcare plans, this Administration is violating one of our most basic freedoms.
I agree with this Gaston Gazette editorial supporting Belmont Abbey and Hobby Lobby's Supreme Court challenge to this portion of the law.
Wicked Weed turns one
Mountain Xpress
As Asheville continues to grow into its title of Beer City USA more breweries are opening throughout the area.
One of those newest breweries, Wicked Weed, is about to celebrate the one year anniversary of its opening.
Wicked Weed is one of my favorite Asheville restaurants and I enjoyed this story on its one year anniversary from Mountain Xpress.
