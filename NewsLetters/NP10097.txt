Allowing competition among accreditation boards is vital to promote
innovation in higher education
Educational institutions in
the United States have long relied on a peer-reviewed accreditation
process to ensure the quality of the instruction students receive.
Without the stamp of approval of a qualified accreditation board, colleges
and universities lack the credibility necessary to attract students
and raise the money necessary to operate.
This arrangement
means that accreditors wield a tremendous amount of power over
colleges and universities, thereby creating a system with tremendous
potential for abuse.
Our higher education system
and especially
the federal policies that govern access to it
is
failing the
two-thirds of Americans who never get a B.A., and the large minority
of Americans who never set foot on a college
campus.
Those Americans need access to skills that current colleges arent
teaching, at prices that four-year residential institutions cant
afford, on timelines the academic calendar cant accommodate. And the lower
a students income, the greater the need.
This is why I
introduced the
Higher Education Reform and
Opportunity Act
to allow states to enact their own accreditation standards,
instead of relying exclusively on the iron triangle of regional
accreditation organizations, the schools and federal
bureaucrats.
