Dear Friends,
I&#8217;d like to thank the employees of the Dinuba Best Buy distribution center for hosting me this week. We had a good discussion about tax policy and about potential trade
agreements that would improve the Valley economy. I also sat for a community coffee event with Dinuba residents, with whom I discussed water, the California gas tax, and other issues.
Separately, I want to wish you and your families a Happy Halloween.
Sincerely ,
Devin Nunes
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
