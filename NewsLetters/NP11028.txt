Dear Friends,
There has been a lot going on in Washington
during the last week.
Last week, President
Obama signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act into
law.
This law will limit the rate at which the cost of flood insurance
premiums can rise and will provide rebates to homeowners who already
paid significantly increased premiums.
You can read more about
the impact of this legislation in
27east.com's
coverage .
Tuesday, we marked National Medal
of Honor Day, a chance for us all to reflect on those who have
received our Nation's highest military honor.
You can read my thoughts
on it and learn the stories of two recipients from the First
Congressional District in my
guest blog
in Dan's
Papers.
On Thursday, several of my colleagues and
I introduced legislation that would limit the ability of e-cigarette
manufacturers to use advertising that targets children and
teens.
You can find more information about the legislation in
Hampton.com's story .
Finally,
this week a discharge petition was filed to try to force a vote in the
House on immigration reform.
Comprehensive immigration reform is one of the most important economic issues
facing our nation today. By fixing our broken immigration system we can
secure our borders , unite families,
address issues with labor supply, and create an earned pathway to
citizenship. On Long Island, this means that our high-tech and agricultural
industries can attract the talent and workforce they need to
thrive.
The time is now.
As always, if
there is anything my office can do to be of assistance please do not
hesitate to reach out.
Have a great
weekend!
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
First District
of New York
