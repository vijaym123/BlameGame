Ron Honored at Mexican
Fiesta
Sen. Johnson was invited to
attend the Mexican Fiesta opening ceremonies on Aug. 22 in Milwaukee. He
was presented with an award for his work with the Hispanic community.
Sen. Johnsons state office has been instrumental in providing
assistance with obtaining visas for the visiting artisans whose yearly
participation at Mexican Fiesta is a driving force in providing educational
scholarships for Hispanic youth across
Wisconsin.
Ron thanks the Mexican Fiesta
team for their hard work and dedication to Mexican youths in
Wisconsin.
