Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
It was an honor to participate in the National Prayer Breakfast this
week in Washington, D.C. with my own pastor, Steve Lee.
Keystone XL Pipeline
The State Department issued a final report late last week that is good
news for the Keystone XL Pipeline and confirms the pipeline project
poses little environmental risk.
The President is running out of excuses to delay approving the northern
leg of this project that would bring good jobs to America. For over
five years the Administration has delayed and stalled this major
private-sector investment in our economy, in job creation and in
reducing our dependency on foreign oil. Enough is enough.
I continue to call on the President to permit the northern leg of the
Keystone Pipeline.
EPA Overreach
On Wednesday night, I had the opportunity to speak on the House floor
about how EPA regulations have personally affected my family, and that
Congress should work hard to ensure the American people are not
adversely affected by regulations from Washington bureaucrats.

District Art Competition
This week I announced the deadline for entries in the 2014
Congressional Art Competition is April 1, 2014. The Congressional Art
Competition gives our many talented high school students in the Second
District a chance to compete to have their original artwork displayed
for a year in the U.S. Capitol.
New for the competition this year is all entries must be Oklahoma
themed. We have so much in Oklahoma to inspire talented artists - from
our diverse cultures to our beautiful landscapes and wildlife. I
believe that this theme will showcase our great state.
All entries are due to the Muskogee office at 431 W. Broadway, by close
of business on April 1, 2014. Details on contest regulations can be
found on my website at mullin.house.gov, listed under the "Services"
section. Also, anyone seeking additional information should contact
Vivian Loving in my Muskogee district office at (918) 687-2533.
Last year there were 217 entries in the contest from 18 different
schools throughout the Second District. The overall winner in 2013 was
Brooke Hunter from Tahlequah High School. Hunter won the opportunity to
have her artwork displayed at the Capitol and a ticket from Southwest
Airlines to fly to Washington, D.C.
Hunter said seeing her artwork on display at the Capitol over the
summer was an amazing experience.
"It made me feel like I was part of something bigger and it encouraged
me to really further my pursuit of art," she said.
The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an
opportunity for Members of Congress to encourage and recognize artistic
talent in their district. The competition is open to all high school
students (9th - 12th grades) in District 2. Entries can include:
paintings, drawings, collages, prints, mixed media, photography or
computer-generated art.
