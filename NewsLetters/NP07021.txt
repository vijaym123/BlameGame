&ldquo;This is unconstitutional what the President is trying to do with this rule [to curb carbon emissions]. This is a perfect reason of why we need to kick Harry Reid out of control of the U.S. Senate.&rdquo; -- Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips, 7/29/14
Dear Friend, Let me set the stage and introduce the players:
In the last week of July, the EPA convened a series of hearings focused on the President&rsquo;s proposal to limit carbon emissions.
The EPA is, of course, the Environmental Protection Agency. &ldquo;AFP&rdquo; is Americans for Prosperity, the big oil Koch brothers&rsquo; front group that&rsquo;s spending millions on elections across the country. And then there&rsquo;s me.
Thousands of people gathered to voice their opinions at the EPA hearings.
But AFP&rsquo;s Tim Phillips was one of the few people who wanted to turn the reality of climate change into a political game.
And once he was done, he went back to spending the Kochs&rsquo; millions in an attempt to take over the Senate. These are the priorities of the Koch brothers&rsquo; Americans for Prosperity
-- they want to pretend climate change doesn&rsquo;t exist and take over the Senate by any means necessary.
I need your help to fight them. Can you contribute $5 toward our $55,000 goal for August?

Or donate another amount.
The big oil Koch brothers will stop at nothing to deny the reality of climate change. They know that meaningful action on this issue will hurt their bottom line, and that&rsquo;s all that matters to them.
But for Massachusetts citizens living in coastal areas, climate change is very real. For midwestern farmers suffering through harsher droughts, and for firefighters battling bigger wildfires out west, there&rsquo;s nothing hypothetical about climate change. We cannot allow the Koch brothers&rsquo; Americans for Prosperity to buy the Senate this year. Help me keep fighting with a $5 contribution.
Part of me hopes that Tim Phillips and AFP keep showing their true colors. But an even bigger part of me hopes that they don&rsquo;t prevent us from taking action before it&rsquo;s too late.
Thanks for standing with me.
