Local Civic
Leader Honored on MLK Day
Westmoreland Community Leaders Host Prayer Breakfast
Murphy Discusses Affordable Prescription
Medications at Local Pharmacy
Opening
Local Civic Leader Honored on MLK
Day
Dorothy Price has been a driving force behind the
Bridgeville Civic
League and is
the daughter of
founder
John D.
Wilson
At
the Bridgeville Civic League's annual Martin Luther King Jr. program on
Monday, Congressman Tim Murphy presented a congressional
proclamation honoring Dorothy Price for her decades of service to the community
with the Civic League.
The
event was held at the Bethany Presbyterian Church in Bridgeville, where
Murphy, who was invited to speak, surprised Dorothy with the
honor.
Dorothy thanked
the roughly 100 people in attendance for
the surprise and all those who worked in creating the Bridgeville
Civic League. For more than 60 years the League has raises funds for
scholarship, and provided assistance to the elderly, local hospitals,
community food and clothing
banks.
The Bridgeville Civic League was founded by Dorothys
father, the late John D. Wilson with the mission to link all generations,
races and religious denominations in a spirit of cooperation through
programs and events that will improve the communities in which we
live.
Westmoreland Community Leaders Host Prayer
Breakfast
For the past 39 years,
leaders in government, business, education and labor have come together
once a year at the Westmoreland County Prayer
Breakfast.
On Friday morning, Congressman Murphy again
joined hundreds in attendance at the 2013 Prayer Breakfast during which
spiritual readings and messages of hope and communion were delivered.
It is known as an event offering a unique opportunity to gather in a
forum where participants can build upon the strengths that unite the
community as residents, elected officials, employers, educators, and
workers.
Individuals from all
faiths participated to recognize and reaffirm the responsibilities and
privileges deriving from the principle of One nation, under God. In
addition, a number of students from every school district in
Westmoreland County were present as a way to underscore the importance of unity
for tomorrows leaders.
Hosted by the Westmoreland County Chamber of Commerce and Westmoreland
County Community College, the Prayer Breakfast began in 1976 by the Rev.
Dr. Kenneth P. Rutter.

Murphy Discusses Affordable Prescription Medications at Local Pharmacy
Opening
L to R: Matt Berry,
Great Lakes Regional Manager, Rep. Murphy, Selma Tansey, Executive
Director of Washington Communities Human Services ,Inc., State Senator Tim
Solobay, Kevin Nipar, Pharmacy
Manager.
Since 1968, the
Washington Communities Mental Health/Mental Retardation Center has been
"Here to Care" and this week Congressman Tim Murphy was at the Center to
participate in the grand opening of Genoa Pharmacy in Washington,
PA.
Following the ceremony, during
which Rep. Murphy spoke, he met with employees to discuss policy
issues relating to prescription drugs.
Murphy, who founded the Congressional Doctors Caucus, authored
the Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Act, which was signed into
law last year. The new law
sets up a process to clear the
backlog of thousands of generic drug applications awaiting FDA review and
to speed up factory inspections. The Murphy bill moves the FDA toward
inspecting all factories - both domestic and foreign - with the same
rigor and frequency.
Real
reform of the nations healthcare system begins with quality and
affordability. Life-saving drugs can't help patients if the cost puts them
out of reach. With this new law, the FDA finally has a system in place
to thoroughly inspect all factories and bring more generics safely to
market, said Rep. Murphy
Generic medications are estimated to save healthcare consumers $100
billion annually and with increased access to generics, seniors
on Medicare save an average of $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses
annually.
