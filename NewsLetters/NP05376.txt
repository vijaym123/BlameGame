Bera-Ose House race among most expensive nationally
This is alarming.
Republican outside groups are spending more to defeat Ami than any candidate in the entire country -- almost $10 MILLION.
You can be sure every dollar is going towards vicious attack ads distorting Ami&#39;s record.
And with California voters ALREADY casting their ballots, we can&rsquo;t wait to close the gap. We have to get out the facts.

We KNOW that our message is superior to Doug Ose&#39;s -- but unfortunately that won&#39;t mean much if he and his outsider friends are able to drown out our message with their money.
Message or money -- which will win?
It&#39;s up to you. There&rsquo;s no time to lose.
