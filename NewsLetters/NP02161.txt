Dear Friend,
Later this month, the Affordable Care Act will celebrate its fifth anniversary.
In anticipation of this milestone, the Department of Health and Human Services released new figures outlining the ACA&rsquo;s success since it was first enacted in 2010.
According to the data, 16.4 million previously uninsured people are now insured under the Affordable Care Act.
The uninsured rate is even lower in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage compared to those that have not.
Today&rsquo;s news shows that the Affordable Care Act is working for American and Hoosier families and that businesses and taxpayers are living better because of it.
If you or your family has any questions regarding the Affordable Health Care Act please feel free to contact my office at (317) 927-4212.
INSIDE SCOOP: Helping Hoosiers Over the years, my office has become the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; location for Hoosiers who need help navigating the federal bureaucracy. Recently, Tammie called my office needing help with a debt issue she was experiencing with the Department of Treasury.
My office determined that a portion of her refund was being withheld because of laws that are no longer on the books.
Within days of coming to my office, Tammie was granted a reimbursement in the amount of $1,175.
Tammie said if it was not for my office she would not have known that a reimbursement was possible.
