Supporting Community Health
Centers
3/20/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn received the 2015
Distinguished Community Health Advocate Award from the National
Association of Community Health Centers. The award reads "In appreciation for
your service during the Second Session of the 113th Congress and for
your support of America's Health Centers and the millions of people they
serve."
Community Health
Centers (CHC) provide access to cost-effective, high quality primary and
preventative care to Coloradans. The Colorado Community Health Network
(CCHN) represents Colorado's 18 CHC's that together are the backbone of
primary healthcare safety-net in Colorado. Since its inception in
1982, CHN has made significant strides in ensuring that Colorado's
low-income working families and individuals have access to affordable,
efficient, high quality primary
healthcare.
Thank you to Pam McManus, David Pump, Marjorie Noleen,
and Darvi Rahaman from Peak Vista Community Health Centers, Morgan
Honea from the Colorado Regional Health Information Organization, and
Polly Anderson from the Colorado Community Health Network for meeting
with Congressman Lamborn and taking part in the
presentation.
"I am humbled and honored to
receive this award from the team at Peak Vista Community Health
Centers. I will continue working hard to support the mission and efforts
of Community Health Centers."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
