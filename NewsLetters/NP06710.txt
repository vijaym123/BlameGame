Dear
Friends,
Last week it was a privilege to honor two veterans, Tech. Robert Bohm,
who served our nation in World War II, and my Congressional
colleague, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, who served our nation in both the Korean
and Vietnam Wars. Both men served honorably and took risks that most
Americans would never imagine they would have to face, all in the name
of liberty and democracy.
I re-dedicated the Sam Johnson
Fitness Center, which I named for Sam, at the Homestead Air Reserve Base
located in my district. Sam is a public servant who has dedicated his
life to our nation since his time in the Air Force during the Korean
and Vietnam Wars. Sam endured severe privation for our country as a
prisoner of war (POW) for over 7 years in Vietnam. His unquestioned
dedication to our great nation is a powerful example for all Americans of
the lengths our countrymen will go to in order to ensure we live in
freedom.
I was also honored to present a Purple Heart
medal to Tech. Robert C. Bohm, who served our nation in World War II.
Robert, a 93 year old veteran, was a part of several battles in Europe
during World War II and helped maintain communications and ensured
they continued to function during multiple battles. After so many years
where paperwork granting him a Purple Heart was thought to be lost,
Tech. Bohm finally received the formal recognition he
deserves.
Both Robert Bohm and Sam Johnson are examples of veterans who
sacrificed much for our country and our freedom. My husband, Dexter, is a
Vietnam veteran who was wounded in combat, and my step-son, Doug, and
daughter-in-law, Lindsay, served our country in Iraq and Lindsay also
served in Afghanistan. I know that all our veterans deserve the utmost
care and respect and I will continue to work to ensure this is the
unquestioned standard for our heroes.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
