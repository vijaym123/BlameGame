Committee Vote on My Endangered Species Reform
With the recent threatened listing
of the Lesser Prairie Chicken, the announcement that
environmental activists are suing
to make the listing even stricter,
and growing complaints about federal government overreach on private
and public lands, it's never been more important to reform the
Endangered Species Act (ESA).
As you know, I've introduced two bills
that would make the ESA more transparent and accountable to landowners
and local governments.
H.R. 4284, the ESA Improvement Act
, empowers states to protect and
restore species and prevent listings by requiring the federal
government to involve them in the process before a listing is proposed.
And H.R. 4317, the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and
Recovery Act
, requires the government to
provide states with the data they are using to justify their listing
decisions.
Additionally, it requires FWS to consider scientific data
submitted by state and local governments before making a determination.
I'm really pleased that this Wednesday
, I
expect that the Natural Resources Committee will be voting on H.R.
4317, the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery
Act.
So far, I've gotten a lot of positive feedback, and I'm eager to
see the bill passed out of committee and brought to the House floor.
I'll keep doing everything I can to protect your rights and make the
ESA work better for species, landowners, farmers, and ranchers.
Appropriations Begins
This week, we'll begin voting
on the first of the 12 annual
appropriations bills on the House floor.
If you think of the federal
budget as the blueprint for how we spend money-how much will go towards
defense, how much will go towards veterans assistance, and so on-then
the appropriations bills are like the individual checks that fund each
government department and all of their programs.
There are 12 annual
appropriations bills that break down our total spending by category and
lay out the specifics on how much funding a program will receive.
On Wednesday, we'll begin debate on two appropriations bills: the
Legislative branch, and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies.
The appropriations bill for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
saves
money on construction projects while increasing funds for veterans.
The bill that funds the Legislative Branch
freezes
pay for Members of Congress and continues the savings Republicans have
been putting in place since 2011.
All told, funding for the House of
Representatives has been reduced by 14% since Republicans took majority
control of the House.
I'm glad we're taking the time to fully debate these bills, because
that will help us identify savings and ways to improve efficiency.
I'll
keep you posted on important amendments that are included in these
bills, and I'll let you know as other appropriations bills come to the
floor.
Action Item: Commemorating the National Day of Prayer
I'll join millions of Americans in prayer this Thursday as we
commemorate the important role faith has played in our nation's past.
The National Day of Prayer is a great reminder for us to continue
seeking God's strength and wisdom to solve our nation's challenges as
well as our own.
I've signed on as a cosponsor of a resolution
recognizing the importance of this day
.
And the other 364 days a year, I'm
working with the Congressional Prayer Caucus to protect religious
liberty and preserve our nation's rich spiritual heritage.
My faith is
very important to me, so I'm looking forward to taking part in this
nationwide event with all Americans of faith.
I hope you'll join me.

News
from
Representative
Randy
Neugebauer April
28,
2014
Committee
Vote
on
My
Endangered
Species
Reform
With
the
recent
threatened
listing
of
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken,
the
announcement
that
environmental
activists
are
suing
to
make
the
listing
even
stricter,
and
growing
complaints
about
federal
government
overreach
on
private
and
public
lands,
it&#8217;s
never
been
more
important
to
reform
the
Endangered
Species
Act
(ESA).
As
you
know,
I&#8217;ve
introduced
two
bills
that
would
make
the
ESA
more
transparent
and
accountable
to
landowners
and
local
governments.
H.R.
4284,
the
ESA
Improvement
Act ,
empowers
states
to
protect
and
restore
species
and
prevent
listings
by
requiring
the
federal
government
to
involve
them
in
the
process
before
a
listing
is
proposed. And
H.R.
4317,
the
State,
Tribal,
and
Local
Species
Transparency
and
Recovery
Act ,
requires
the
government
to
provide
states
with
the
data
they
are
using
to
justify
their
listing
decisions.
Additionally,
it
requires
FWS
to
consider
scientific
data
submitted
by
state
and
local
governments
before
making
a
determination.
I&#8217;m
really
pleased
that
this
Wednesday ,
I
expect
that
the
Natural
Resources
Committee
will
be
voting
on
H.R.
4317,
the
State,
Tribal,
and
Local
Species
Transparency
and
Recovery
Act.
So
far,
I&#8217;ve
gotten
a
lot
of
positive
feedback,
and
I&#8217;m
eager
to
see
the
bill
passed
out
of
committee
and
brought
to
the
House
floor.
I&#8217;ll
keep
doing
everything
I
can
to
protect
your
rights
and
make
the
ESA
work
better
for
species,
landowners,
farmers,
and
ranchers.
Appropriations
Begins
This
week,
we&#8217;ll
begin
voting
on
the
first
of
the
12 annual
appropriations
bills
on
the
House
floor.
If
you
think
of
the
federal
budget
as
the
blueprint
for
how
we
spend
money&#8212;how
much
will
go
towards
defense,
how
much
will
go
towards
veterans
assistance,
and
so
on&#8212;then
the
appropriations
bills
are
like
the
individual
checks
that
fund
each
government
department
and
all
of
their
programs.
There
are
12
annual
appropriations
bills
that
break
down
our
total
spending
by
category
and
lay
out
the
specifics
on
how
much
funding
a
program
will
receive.
On
Wednesday,
we&#8217;ll
begin
debate
on
two
appropriations
bills:
the
Legislative
branch,
and
Military
Construction,
Veterans
Affairs,
and
Related
Agencies.
The
appropriations
bill
for
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
saves
money
on
construction
projects
while
increasing
funds
for
veterans.
The
bill
that
funds
the
L egislative
B ranch
freezes
pay
for
Members
of
Congress
and
continues
the
savings
Republicans
have
been
putting
in
place
since
2011.
All
told,
funding
for
the
House
of
Representatives
has
been
reduced
by
14%
since
Republicans
took
majority
control
of
the
House.
I&#8217;m
glad
we&#8217;re
taking
the
time
to
fully
debate
these
bills,
because
that
will
help
us
identify
savings
and
ways
to
improve
efficiency.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
posted
on
important
amendments
that
are
included
in
these
bills,
and
I&#8217;ll
let
you
know
as
other
appropriations
bills
come
to
the
floor.
Action
Item:
Commemorating
the
National
Day
of
Prayer
I&#8217;ll

millions
of
Americans

this
Thursday
as
we
commemorate
the
important
role
faith
has
played
in
our
nation&#8217;s
past.
The
National
Day
of
Prayer
is
a
great
reminder
for
us
to
continue
seeking
God&#8217;s
strength
and
wisdom
to
solve
our
nation&#8217;s
challenges
as
well
as
our

spiritual
heritage.
My

me,

I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
taking
part
in
this
nationwide

with
all
Americans

faith.
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
