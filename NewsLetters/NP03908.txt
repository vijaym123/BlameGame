Join my December Tele-Townhall
I would like to thank
everyone who has taken time to engage with me this year.
I have met
with tens of thousands of Utahns in tele-townhalls, live townhalls, and
in meetings across the state.
Members of my staff have also
maintained an open dialogue with countless others through email, phone
calls, and meetings in Utah and DC.
All of this interaction
provides crucial feedback that enables me to better represent you as your
senator.
On
December 10 at 7:00 p.m.
MT , I will be holding my
final tele-townhall of the
year .
I invite you to sign up to join this event and become
part of the great discussion I am having with Utahns about how
we can fix broken government
and end the opportunity
crisis that is trapping Americans in poverty, creating insecurity in the
middle class and unfairly benefiting those who rig the system in their
favor at the expense of everyone else.
In addition to these
issues, I will be engaged in debates in Washington this week about
funding the military, funding the government and fighting executive
overreach.
As the next chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, I
am also getting things in place to help this committee play an
influential role in the upcoming Republican-controlled Senate.
I would
love to have your feedback on these issues.
