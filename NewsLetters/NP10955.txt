Friend,
Thank you so much! Because of your amazing support, we surpassed our online fundraising goal by more than $6,000. That means you gave almost DOUBLE the amount we expected. (That&#39;ll teach outsiders to underestimate you!)
I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to me that you have that kind of faith in me and our campaign. This race is going to be incredibly tough, and just like our last campaign it will come down-to-the-wire. The only way I&#39;ll be able to continue my work in Congress is with your help -- and after yesterday, I really like our odds.
Thank you. Today and always, I am incredibly grateful.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
