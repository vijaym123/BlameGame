We have GREAT NEWS! (you're going to want to see this) A new Fox News Poll shows a SHOCKING surge for Democrats
Why the huge jump? Democratic enthusiasm has jumped by 11 points in the last 2 weeks.
That means we can beat Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans all over the map -- even in red states like West Virginia, Nebraska and Arkansas!!!
This is a HUGE opportunity: We can't pass this up!
If we can bring in 11,OOO donations today, we can expand our get-out-the-vote operation in time for Election Day.
Can you chip in $5 or more to help us get-out-the vote (and SHOCK the Republicans on Election Day)?
