If Boehner has his way, we might as well kiss all hope goodbye for the remainder of President Obama&rsquo;s term.
Case in point: this week, Boehner is planning a vote to sue the President. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step.
Make no mistake: these Tea Party Republicans are obsessed with tearing down President Obama, not making progress for the middle class. David, this is it. It&rsquo;s time to go all in defending President Obama.
