Next Step in IRS
Investigation Should be Independent Special Counsel
On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted to inappropriately
targeting conservative groups for &ldquo;extra scrutiny&rdquo; in connection with their applications for tax-exempt status.
President Obama denounced
this behavior as &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo; He pledged that the Administration would &ldquo;find out exactly what
happened&rdquo; and would make sure wrongdoers were &ldquo;held fully accountable.&rdquo; In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee just days
later, Attorney General Eric Holder promised that &ldquo;this will not be about parties&hellip;this will not be about ideological
persuasions&hellip;[and] anyone who has broken the law will be held accountable.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, that appears to be where the Administration&rsquo;s commitment to pursuing this investigation ended. Conservative groups have stated
that they have yet to be interviewed by Department of Justice investigators more than a year after the allegations came to light.
Additionally, the
Administration has sought to undermine the investigation at every opportunity.
Attorney General Holder even appointed a loyal donor of President
Obama&rsquo;s campaign to spearhead the investigation of the IRS&rsquo;s political targeting scandal.
There&rsquo;s a clear conflict of interest in the current sham of an investigation.
In a continued effort to seek
accountability, the House of Representatives recently approved a
resolution
calling on Attorney General Holder to appoint a Special
Counsel to investigate the IRS&rsquo;s targeting. The resolution passed the House by a vote of 250-168, including the support of 26 Democrats.
The American people and the groups who were targeted deserve to know who ordered the IRS targeting, when
the targeting was ordered, and why. Under the circumstances, this Administration cannot credibly investigate this matter. It is time for the Attorney
General to appoint an independent, professional Special Counsel to get to the bottom of this.

ICE Prison Break
The Center for Immigration Studies recently obtained a
document
that shows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens in deportation proceedings in Fiscal Year 2013. Among them, the 36,000 had nearly 88,000
convictions, including 16,070 drunk or drugged driving convictions, 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping
convictions, and 193 homicide convictions.
Regardless of one&rsquo;s position on the larger immigration reform question, it&rsquo;s incredibly alarming
that tens of thousands of convicted criminal aliens &ndash; including hundreds of murderers, kidnappers, and rapists &ndash; who were processed for
deportation are being freed into our communities by the Administration.
The truth is that most could be detained by immigration enforcement
authorities if the Administration had the will to do so. These criminals should be locked up, not roaming our streets.
Over a month ago, the House Judiciary Committee requested that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provide
information about criminal aliens identified by federal authorities and released into our communities but our questions have gone unanswered. The
Committee plans to hold an oversight hearing on DHS in the coming weeks. I certainly have some questions for Secretary Johnson, and I hope he will
come clean and provide the Committee with answers.
Update:
The d eadline for the
House App Contest
has been extended to May 31st! High School students only have a couple of weeks remaining to enter.
