First Quarter Economic Report
On Friday, it was widely reported that our economy shrank last
quarter by 0.7%. After more than six years of President Obamas higher
taxes and regulatory schemes, we have an economy that remains weak
and plagued with uncertainty. And all his administration is proposing is
more of the same
more taxes and more government-made barriers to
growth and opportunity. This new normal is unacceptable.
That is why we need the President to work with this
Congress that has put forth a balanced budget and pro-growth policies that
will spur desperately needed growth.
Obama's Out-of-Control
EPA
The Obama Administration is at it again
expanding
Washingtons regulatory power at the expense of families and
businesses.
The latest outrageous scheme from the
EPA regarding water regulations is an obvious abuse of authority and a
direct threat to the individual and economic freedom of the American
people. This no longer just effects hard working farmers and business
owners; this rule could effectively harm anyone who owns a
backyard.
That is why the House voted in a bipartisan
manner earlier this month to halt this egregious action by the
Administration.
Read more about this new rule in this
Wall Street Journal
story.
