Dear Friends,
Last week I had
the privilege of honoring the bravery, service and sacrifice of the
members of the National Guard 169th MEDEVAC unit on its successful
mission in Afghanistan at a ceremony in Concord. From their bases in
Afghanistan, the unit performed 471 lifesaving missions and carried 527
patients to receive medical care. Members of the 169th received numerous
awards while deployed including Bronze Stars, Air Medals, Army
Accommodation Medals, Combat Action Badges and Combat Medical
Badges.
The men and women of the 169th epitomize the best qualities of our
military and we cannot thank them enough for all they have done for
our country. I know I speak for all of New Hampshire when I extend my
humble appreciation to each and every one of them, as well as to all of
our additional men and women serving in uniform and their
families.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
