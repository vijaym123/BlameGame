Dear Neighbor,
I
will be hosting my 6th annual Open Season Workshop this
Saturday, November 15, at 10:00 am at the Fairfax County Government
Center
to help federal employees and retirees navigate through the
many changes in the 2015 Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans,
dental and vision insurance programs, and flexible spending accounts.
The Government Center is located at 12000 Government Center Parkway,
Fairfax, VA.
This year, Open Season runs from November 10
through December 8.
Our program will include a panel
presentation by FEHB plan experts, including a representative from OPM.
Following the panel, representatives from various health care plans
offered under FEHB will be on hand to answer any specific questions you
may have.
I encourage every federal employee and retiree, as
well as survivor and former spouse annuitants to make sure they
review their FEHB plan coverage and other benefits before Open Season ends
on December 8.
Any Federal employees, retirees, and annuitants
who have questions or want to make sure that they have the coverage
they need and want under the FEHB plans are welcome to attend my Open
Season Workshop this Saturday.
This year's workshop will
feature:
10:00 am
11:00 am
Panel Discussion
featuring experts on FEHB programs and available health plan
options
Hosted in the Board of Supervisors
Auditorium
11:00

1:00 pm
Representatives of various FEHB health plans and Medicare will be available to
provide information and answer questions concerning plan offerings for
2015

employees seeking further information about FEHB plans can visit OPMs
FEHB Open Season website at:

detailed information about FEHB plans, dental insurance, vision
insurance, and flexible spending accounts for federal employees and
dependents.
The site also provides links to frequently asked questions
and other information that federal employees and retirees might need

coverage.
