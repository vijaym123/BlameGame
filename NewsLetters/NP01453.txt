Stop Tax Cuts For Billionaires
Dear Friend,
This week, by voting to repeal the Estate Tax, Republicans once again chose the interests of the wealthiest Americans over the well-being of the entire country. Only 0.2% of Americans are eligible for the tax, yet 100% benefit from the vital revenue it brings in. As many people continue to struggle economically, the last thing we need is another tax cut for billionaires.
My Floor Speech Against Repeal:
Getting Closer to Cuba:
Last weekend, I was proud to witness President Barack Obama's historic meeting with President Raul Castro of Cuba at the Summit of the Americas. The meeting was the first time our two nations' leaders have sat down in over 50 years and moved us one step closer to ending our outdated Cold War policies. I will continue to push Congress to pass my Free Trade With Cuba Act, so that both countries can enjoy the benefits of cultural and economic exchange.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
