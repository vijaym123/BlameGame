Dear Friend,
I wanted
to send you a quick reminder to encourage you to participate in the
Great ShakeOut earthquake drill, which takes place tomorrow, October 16
at 10:16 a.m. local time.
More than 30 percent of
Californians live within 30 miles of a fault line, and with several major
quakes each year, everyone should know what to do when the ground starts
shaking.
FEMA-recommended procedure is to drop to the
ground, cover yourself with a sturdy shelter like a table or desk, and
hold on to it until the quake has subsided. The more practice you have
doing this, the better.
To learn more about how to
participate or register your involvement, visit
http://shakeout.org/california/ . Additional tips for preparing for
earthquakes can also be found at
www.ready.gov/earthquakes .
Please forward this message to your friends
and family to encourage them to take part!
