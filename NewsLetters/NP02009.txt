Dear Friend,
Funding for education is more than a line item on a budget
its an
investment in a brighter future for our kids and a down payment on a
more competitive workforce in the global marketplace. But last week,
Arizonans learned that their kids were being targeted on two fronts, as
state-level and Congressional Republicans both took shots at funding for
our schools.
On Capitol Hill, the GOP is trying to
undermine the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), landmark
legislation that helps ensure every child, regardless of background or
circumstance, has an opportunity to learn and reach their full potential.
Theyre removing federal standards for students in our schools and ending
requirements for schools to demonstrate growth. Instead of viewing
failing students as the greatest challenge for our education system to
overcome, this bill leaves them behind and absolves federal
responsibility to help them succeed.
Not to be
outdone in their own assault on education, Governor Ducey and the
Republican state legislature struck a weekend budget deal in the dead of
night that guts $100 million from public universities, and zeroes funding
for Pima, Maricopa and Pinal County community colleges out completely.
It extracts further from non-classroom funding
money that would
otherwise pay for librarians, counselors and speech
therapists.
When I learned about these cuts, I
hit the road to hear directly from parents, teachers, students and
faculty. After visiting eight schools throughout our district, it is clear
that concern over these cuts is palpable.The educators who work every
day to open new doors for our kids deserve better than to have their
budgets slashed. Republicans arent just failing to set benchmarks for
our kids
theyre actively working against them. I will continue
fighting these efforts both at home and in DC, and you have my word that
any effort to undermine our education systems will never have my
support.
Peace,
Ral
