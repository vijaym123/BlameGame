Dear Friend, The Koch brothers have committed to spend $290 million this year. What are they hoping to buy with all that money?
For starters, they&rsquo;d like to buy a Senate that will deny the reality of climate change -- and they know that as the co-author of the only comprehensive climate change bill to ever pass either chamber of Congress, I won&rsquo;t fall in line with the deniers. They&rsquo;d also like to buy a Senate that will block clean energy reforms, so their Big Oil bottom lines don&rsquo;t take a hit -- and they know I&rsquo;m fighting for a clean energy revolution. The Kochs have said they want to spend $290 million this year, but they haven&rsquo;t said where all that money is going. We need to stay strong in case they come after us -- chip in $5 toward our $25,000 pre-primary filing deadline goal.

What else is on the Koch brothers&rsquo; wish list? The Keystone XL pipeline, for one. They&rsquo;re one of the biggest lease holders in the Alberta tar sands, and they know that I&rsquo;ve been battling to keep America from becoming a pass-through for one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. The Koch brothers believe that if they spend enough money, they can buy whatever they want. We&rsquo;re going to tell them, &ldquo;Not here, not in Massachusetts&rdquo; -- give $5 to show our grassroots strength.
Truth be told, no one knows exactly how many millions the Koch brothers will spend between now and November. But our campaign is taking no chances and taking nothing for granted -- and with the support of people like you, we&rsquo;ll stand up and keep fighting, no matter what they might throw at us.
Thank you.
