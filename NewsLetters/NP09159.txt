Sunday, June 1st marks the beginning of the 2014 Hurricane Season. As
Floridians, we are all too familiar with these natural disasters and
the affect they are capable of having. But if we take the appropriate
steps to protect our homes and our families, we can reduce that effect
on our communities in the long run. Check out the "Hurricane Safety"
section of my website for a
supply checklist (In English
and in Spanish
), which contains suggested items for a
hurricane kit and provides important phone numbers. Make sure to post
this list in a central location in your home, so that it is visible to
each member of your family.
This week in Washington, the United States House of Representatives
voted on a number of bills, including H.R. 4587, the Venezuelan
Democracy and Human Rights Protection Act. This bill imposes sanctions,
including denying visas and blocking financial transactions, to the
members of Maduro's regime who have committed egregious human rights
abuses. For the last 15 years, the Venezuelan people have experienced
the corruption and brutality of the Chavez-Maduro dictatorship, and
within the last 3 months, it has escalated to serious acts of violence
and aggression towards students and others who were peacefully
protesting. We stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people as they
struggle to regain democracy and freedom from the Venezuelan regime.
With the recent resignation of the Department of Veterans Affairs
Secretary Eric Shinseki, we can move forward to providing better care
for our veterans. The horror stories that we've heard of abuse of power
and mismanagement by certain individuals at the VA are absolutely
unacceptable. The best and the bravest of our country must be treated
with the highest quality of care, and any person who stands in the way
of that care must be held accountable. We owe it to the courageous men
and women who served our country to do everything we can to prevent
these issues from happening again.

Warm Regards,
Mario Diaz-Balart
