Dear
Friend,
I've heard from a lot of Northeast Georgians who are
outraged about what President Obama is doing with his executive action on
immigration.
Executive action granting
amnesty to millions of illegals is President Obama taking out his anger
on the American people for rejecting his agenda through the due
process of elections two weeks ago. Hes had six years to work with
Congress, two of those years with his party in total control of Washington,
on constructive, compassionate, and fair immigration reform.
His singular action defies all three of those
principles.
Those who are in the
United States illegally should be deeply concerned about the presidents
intentions.
So many immigrants come to this country from places
where the rule of law and the will of the people are defied.
That
President Obama has taken it upon himself to do the same thing with
his executive order should be as troubling to them as it is for the
millions of law-abiding citizens who have trusted this man to uphold the
Constitution.
The majority of the
Peoples House will fight this because it is wrong. It is political
retribution under the false guise of compassion, and it is yet another abuse
of power the branch of government closest to the people will have to
resolve.
To make sure I've heard your
views on this, please feel free to e-mail me
here .
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
