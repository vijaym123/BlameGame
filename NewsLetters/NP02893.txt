100% Record of Support for Faith,
Family, and Freedom
2/12/15
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council for
his leadership and perfect 100% voting record in defense of faith,
family, and freedom.
We thank these Members of Congress for consistently voting to defend
and advance faith, family and freedom. These True Blue Members have
voted to delay Obamacare, protect the unborn, and stand for religious
liberty. FRC and the thousands of families that we represent applaud
these Members for their unwavering commitment to faith, family and
freedom.'
- Family Research Council Action President Tony
Perkins.
Our country so desperately needs lawmakers and elected officials who
will stand up for the moral issues that are shaping our society.
These leaders have helped preserve life, protect religious liberties and
promote families, and for this, we thank
them."
