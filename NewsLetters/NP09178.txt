This week the House passed legislation that funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as several of the nations science programs (CJS). The legislation included two amendments that I proposed, which were included to the bill without any opposition.
The overall bill continues efforts in the U.S. House to spend taxpayer dollars wisely, eliminate wasteful spending, and prioritize programs critical to our safety and economic competitiveness. As a result, the bill saves nearly $400 million from last years appropriations, while still funding critical programs to combat gangs and human trafficking, strengthen cybersecurity, and prevent violence against women.
One of my amendments prohibited funding for NASAs Advanced Food Technology Project. This project has been cited as a source of waste for several years, starting with NASAs use of taxpayer money to develop space pizza and hundreds of other recipes for a mission to Mars. The second amendment would prohibit funding to be used to design, implement, administer, or carry out the U.S. Global Climate Research Program National Climate Assessment and the United Nations Agenda 21.
Since NASA has no plans to undertake a mission to Mars, we are simply driving up our debt unnecessarily by funding programs such as this. Though the overall legislation was not perfect, I believe this bill made significant strides to rein in unnecessary and inefficient government spending and prioritized important programs to prevent human trafficking and violence against women.
This week I also had the opportunity to speak on the House floor about the VA accountability and backlog scandal. Although I believe that Sec. Shinsekis resignation was an important and necessary step, this should not be viewed as the ultimate solution to the problems within the VA.

The stated VA goal is a 14-day wait for first-time primary care appointments. The falsified data reported last year by Phoenix Health Care System showed veterans waited an average of 24 days for their first primary care appointment. The recent Inspector General report found that veterans actually waited on average 115 days for their first primary care appointment with approximately 84 percent waiting more than 14 days. Put another way, the VA management at Phoenix Health Care System met 16% of its wait time goal and still received bonuses. This is completely unacceptable.
Thats why I was proud to cosponsor and vote for Chairman Millers VA Accountability Act last week, but it is a shame that it takes an act of Congress to fire somebody in the federal government for not doing his or her job. For more information on what the House is doing to reform the VA, click here:
