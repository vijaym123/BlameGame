Blaine's Bulletin
For far too long, its been the same old song and dance in Washington. The House of Representatives has remained committed in passing targeted pieces of legislation that will grow the economy while Harry Reids Senate remains steadfast in its efforts to not bring anything to the floor for debate, let alone a vote. And with over 40 House-passed, straight-forward, job creating bills sitting in the Senate hopper, it is incredible that politics cannot be put aside for the betterment of our nation.
This week, the House sent the Senate two packages of bills that are designed to foster job creation and promote a common-sense energy plan to lower costs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Both packages contain over a dozen bills which have all passed the House in the 113 th
Congress. The purpose of this is to call on the Senate to remind them the House will not waiver in its commitment while they continue to sit idle.
Each week, whether Im meeting with constituents in Washington or traveling the 3 rd
Congressional District, I have had many of you tell me how important the bills that are in this jobs package are to you. For example, the
Save American Workers Act , which would repeal the 30-hour definition of full-time employment created by the presidents health-care law, is one bill that comes to mind. Far too many small business owners and employees have spoken to me about how this provision in the health-care law will cause hours to be cut and full time jobs to become part-time.
In keeping with the theme in the Houses efforts to reduce burdensome and costly federal regulations that cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity, the
Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
(REINS)
Act , would ensure that Congress votes on all new major rules before they can be enforced. Right now, the unelected bureaucrats of the Obama Administration are burying Americans in red-tape. These sweeping rules have a major impact on the livelihoods of countless Missourians, yet the representatives of the people cannot stop them. This must change if we are serious about growing our economy and creating jobs.
In addition, with the average price of a gallon of gas in Missouri hovering over $3.15, we must enact policies that keep more money in your pockets rather than leave it at the gas pump. Thats why in the energy package of bills, included was the
Lowering Gas Prices to Fuel an America that Works Act . This bill would remove federal government barriers that block production of U.S. energy sources offshore and expands onshore American energy production by streamlining government red-tape and regulations.
Lastly, I have long been a proponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and now that the president has waited over 2,100 days to act on this, I am pleased the House is continuing to apply pressure by voting on the
Northern Route Approval Act
which would allow construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
We all know the phrase that it takes two to tango. The House of Representatives have been ready to move the country in the right direction for months yet, under Harry Reids leadership, the Senate will not move from the corner of the room. It is time to get our nation moving forward and Americans back to work and so that every American can get ahead, not just get by.
