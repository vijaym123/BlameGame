Dear Neighbors,
Reflecting back on my first year in Congress, I am most grateful for
those things that make the Tenth District special. In particular are
the vibrancy of our communities and the commitment and dedication of
nearly everyone I meet to making our communities stronger. Whether at
Blue Ribbon schools, award-winning libraries or the Navy's largest
training station, I have been overwhelmed by the people I meet, the
stories they tell and the dreams they work to make real every day.
I attended a naturalization ceremony and watched new citizens take the
Pledge of Allegiance. I visited a community organization where recent
immigrants, many working multiple jobs while raising young families,
still found time to take classes and learn English. At a Jobs Fair I
hosted, promising candidates made useful connections with potential
employers and learned valuable strategies to find work.
Some of the most meaningful experiences have come in my exchanges with
students across the district, filling me with profound hope and
confidence in the future.
Local mayors and I sat down at a roundtable I organized to promote
collaboration and cooperation across the federal, state and local
lines. I sat down with police chiefs, and I listened to the stories of
gun violence victims, gun owners and community leaders to develop a
strategy to reduce gun violence. At a local Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative site, I joined advocates and community members to discuss
how we can further protect the Great Lakes, a critically important
environmental and economic resource.
Last Spring, I launched my "Brad at Your Business" initiative to hear
directly from business owners, managers and employees. Since taking
office, I've visited more than 50 companies, and I've seen firsthand
the ingenuity, drive and vision that make the Tenth District an ideal
place to start and grow a business.
Perhaps most important, my casework team took on 625 cases, ranging
from emergency visas to VA claims and Social Security benefits
adjustments. To date, we've closed 550 of those cases and are bringing
in new ones every day. We've hosted neighborhood office hours in every
corner of the district to make these services even more accessible to
people, going directly to where they work and live. When Tenth District
families have visited Washington, my office has assisted more than
1,200 constituents with tours and other travel information.
In 12 months, there have been countless events in the
community, capturing the breadth and beauty of what the Tenth District
has to offer. I toured the Botanic Gardens in Glencoe. Blessed the
fleet at Waukegan Harbor. Adopted a beach in Highland Park. Celebrated
graduation with Navy cadets in North Chicago. Hosted an interfaith
clergy breakfast in Northbrook. Highlighted STEM education in Grayslake.
Saw the future of American manufacturing in Wheeling. and much, much
more.
Meanwhile in Congress, I have sought to focus on the priorities of the
Tenth District. Growing jobs and the economy has been my top priority
from day one, which is why I introduced bills to bridge the skills gap,
expand On-the-Job training and help veterans become small business
owners. I have also advocated for strengthening the U.S.-Israel
relationship and ensuring Israel's security in a very dangerous
neighborhood. It was a proud moment when the Israel Qualitative
Military Edge Enhancement Act, which I introduced with Doug Collins of
Georgia, passed the House unanimously.
All the while, your voices have guided me; I've responded to 55,686
letters and email correspondences. This community input has been
invaluable when considering bills and legislative action.
Looking ahead, I remain optimistic for our future despite the
challenges we face. In Congress, I will continue to work to break
through the gridlock and move our country forward. Please know my door
is always open, and I will keep listening to your thoughts and
concerns. Working together, I know we can achieve the progress the
Tenth District deserves.
Thanks for a great year.
Sincerely,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
Reflecting
back
on
my
first
year
in
Congress,
I
am
most
grateful
for
those
things
that
make
the
Tenth
District
special.
In
particular
are the
vibrancy
of
our
communities
and
the
commitment
and
dedication
of
nearly
everyone
I
meet
to
making
our
communities
stronger.
Whether
at
Blue
Ribbon
schools,
award-winning
libraries
or
the
Navy&#8217;s
largest
training
station,
I
have
been
overwhelmed
by
the
people
I
meet,
the
stories
they
tell
and
the
dreams
they
work
to
make
real
every
day.
I
attended
a
naturalization
ceremony
and
watched
new
citizens
take
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance.
I
visited
a
community
organization
where
recent

many

promising

and

to

Some

with

with

Working

I

Thanks
for
