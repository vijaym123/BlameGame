Congressman Lamborn
Supports the 2015 National Defense Authorization
Act
12/4/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a strong House
majority in supporting the passage of the 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act by a bipartisan vote of 300 to 119. As a senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Lamborn played a key role
in crafting the legislation and the final bill features numerous
examples of his input:
Lamborn Influence on the FY2015
NDAA
Incorporates language originally authored by Rep. Lamborn
regarding C-130 aircraft and the 302 nd /52 nd
airlift wing
at Peterson requiring a certification from the Secretary of the Air
Force that the MAFFS mission will not be negatively impacted before any
aircraft can be removed (Secs. 138 &amp;
140).
Incorporates language
calling for an analysis of a
new Joint DOD-VA Clinic in Northern El Paso County. As our military and
veterans populations continue to grow, military medical care will
become an even greater priority for our region. This amendment directs the
Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs to investigate
the possibility of a new clinic.
Includes $6
million to modernize Air Force ejection seats, a project that Lamborn has
been working on all year.
Fully funds military
construction projects in Colorado Springs
($109.2M).
Includes a requirement for the Treasury Department to list all
companies and persons violating Iran sanctions (Sec.
1270).
Requires ongoing reports on Irans nuclear program (Sec. 1271),
something which Lamborn has strongly advocated
for.
Includes language offered by Lamborn amendment to enhance the ability
of the Air Force Academy athletic programs to accept donations (Sec.
554).
Review and report of suicide prevent efforts
in SOCOM (Sec. 582).
Independent assessment of
mental health challenges facing SOCOM (Sec.
586).
$24M
increase for SOCOM embedded mental health
providers.
Fully funds Israeli missile defense
programs.
Requires DOD to develop an acquisition strategy for health care
professional staffing (Sec. 725).
Establishes a pilot
program for acquiring commercial satellite communication services (Sec.
1605).
"I recognize that, as with most omnibus bills, there were some elements
of this legislation that are disappointing. For instance, some
military pharmacy copays will increase by three dollars for one year.
However it is important to remember that generic prescriptions received
through the mail will have no copay increases. This is an outcome House
Republicans fought hard for. The White House and Senate wanted to double
and triple all copays for an indefinite amount of time. Furthermore,
I was disappointed by the lack of a larger pay raise and by changes to
the Base Allowance for Housing.
I understand that some
people are disappointed by some of the provisions of this bill, but
having a completed NDAA, that has fully moved through the Congressional
budget process, is a good thing for our military. It allows them to
shape their decisions and plan their actions with budgetary certainty. I
am confident that this bill will allow our military to continue to be
the most capable, flexible, and effective force on the face of the
earth."
