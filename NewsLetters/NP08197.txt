Hi
there,
I want to wish you and
your friends and family a
safe and happy Fourth of July
tomorrow, as we celebrate our
nations 238 years of
independence. The
Fourth of July is a day when
we come together as Americans
to celebrate our
nations birthday
with parades,
barbeques, baseball games
and, of course, fireworks!
But during this day of joyous
celebrations, I also urge you
to take a moment and think
about our armed forces and
the great sacrifices they
made for our nation. Our men
and women in uniform, past
and present, have risked
their lives so that we can
celebrate our freedom and
independence year after year,
and for that, let's give them
our unwavering gratitude.
I wish everyone a happy,
fun, and safe Fourth of
July!
