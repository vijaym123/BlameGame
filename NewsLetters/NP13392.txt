Protecting Emergency
Unemployment Compensation
Dear Friend,
As 2013 draws to a close, our nation's economy continues to show signs
of improvement but our recovery from the recent recession is still not
complete. Far too many of the hardworking Pennsylvanians who lost their
jobs due to the economic downturn have been unable to find work.
That is why it is important that Congress acts as quickly as possible
to extend the unemployment insurance benefits that are set to expire at
the end of this month. On Dec. 28th, more than 73,000 Pennsylvanians
who are struggling to find work stand to lose this critical economic
lifeline that helps those who have been out of work for at least 27
weeks.
It is unacceptable that Congress failed to extend emergency
unemployment compensation before adjourning for the year. I am urging
my House colleagues to pass legislation (H.R. 3546) that I am
co-sponsoring to extend these benefits through 2014. I will keep
fighting to make sure this issue is addressed as soon as Congress
returns in January so that we help Pennsylvanians who are looking for
work, protect existing jobs and strengthen our economy.
What Are Your Thoughts?
As we celebrate this holiday season and the coming of the New Year, I
want you to know it is my honor and privilege to represent the 13th
Congressional District. Over the past year, I have heard from tens of
thousands of you on the many issues we're facing. I am committed to
ensuring we grow our economy, strengthen our middle class, and meet our
obligations to our seniors, our children and our future. It remains my
top priority to keep in touch with you to hear your thoughts as we
debate the issues confronting our nation. Please email me to let me
know what your priorities are for the year ahead.
I wish you and your family a happy, safe and prosperous New Year.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
As
2013
draws
to
a
close,
our
nation's
economy
continues
to
show
signs
of
improvement
but
our
recovery
from
the
recent
recession
is
still
not
complete.
Far
too
many
of
the
hardworking
Pennsylvanians
who
lost
their
jobs
due
to
the
economic
downturn
have
been
unable
to
find
work.
That
is
why
it
is
important
that
Congress
acts
as
quickly
as
possible
to
extend
the
unemployment
insurance
benefits
that
are
set
to
expire
at
the
end
of
this
month.
On
Dec.
28th,
more
than
73,000
Pennsylvanians
who
are
struggling
to
find
work
stand
to
lose
this
critical
economic
lifeline
that
helps
those
who
have
been
out
of
work
for
at
least
27
weeks.
It
is
unacceptable
that
Congress
failed
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
compensation
before
adjourning
for
the
year.
I
am
urging
my
House
colleagues
to
pass
legislation
(H.R.
3546)
that
I
am
co-sponsoring
to
extend
these
benefits
through
2014.
I
will
keep
fighting
to
make
sure
this
issue
is
addressed
as
soon
as
Congress
returns
in
January
so
that
we
help
Pennsylvanians
who
are
looking
for
work,
protect
existing
jobs
and
strengthen
our
economy.
What
Are
Your
Thoughts?
As
we
celebrate
this
holiday
season
and
the
coming
of
the
New
Year,
I
want
you
to
know
it
is
my
honor
and
privilege
to
represent
the
13th
Congressional
District.
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
heard
from
tens
of
thousands
of
you
on
the
many
issues
we're
facing.
I
am
committed
to
ensuring
we
grow
our
economy,
strengthen
our
middle
class,
and
meet
our
obligations
to
our
seniors,
our
children
and
our
future.
It
remains
my
top
priority
to
keep
in
touch
with
you
to
hear
your
thoughts
as
we
debate
the
issues
confronting
our
nation.
Please
email
me
to
let
me
know
what
your
priorities
are
for
the
year
ahead.
I
wish
you
and
your
family
a
happy,
safe
and
prosperous
New
Year.
