Hello--
The devastation that I witnessed when Sens. Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker as well as Rep. Alan Nunnelee and I surveyed storm damage with local and state officials was overwhelming.
Twenty-three counties have reported damage. At least 1,200 homes were destroyed, with roughly 2,500 total homes impacted. Eighty-seven businesses were demolished. And tragically, 14 of our fellow Mississippians
daughters and sons, wives and husbands, mothers and fathers
have been confirmed dead.
My heart breaks for the families who experienced loss of life and property. I remain steadfast in my commitment to heal our communities.
I applaud the presidents swift approval of Gov. Phil Bryants request for disaster assistance. This action unlocks resources for families, businesses, and entire communities that have been distressed by these storms. The current declaration provides help to Itawamba, Lee, Lowndes, Madison, Rankin, Wayne, and Winston counties. But ongoing damage assessments may lead to an expansion of recovery aid.
Individuals and business owners impacted by this weeks severe weather are encouraged to report damage to emergency officials by visiting

Mississippians have once again demonstrated heroic resilience in the face of adversity. As we continue to rebuild, restore, and renew our communities, I will exercise all of my authority to provide federal assistance.
God Bless,
