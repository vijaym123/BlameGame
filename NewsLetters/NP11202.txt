Dear Friend,
This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases regarding
the HHS Mandate. I joined my colleagues on the House Floor
and in a press conference
to stand up for our First Amendment rights. Our nation was
founded on the principle of Freedom of Religion and we must never waver
in defending this liberty.
Hot Dish Competition
Recently all 10 members of the Minnesota Delegation got together for the
fourth annual congressional hot dish competition. I participated in the
competition with a dish called the "Polar Vortex-Mex Hot Dish." It was a
nontraditional take on the classic tater tot hot dish, featuring a spicy
mix of beef, pork and chorizo. Click here
for the recipe.
I thought it would be my year, but Rep. Tim Walz walked away the
champion
for the second year in a
row. The competition is always great, bipartisan fun and an opportunity
for us to appreciate a little taste of home. For more pictures, visit my
Flickr page here
