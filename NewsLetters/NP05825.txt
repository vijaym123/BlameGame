TRIPLE MATCH: Paint the South Blue&rsquo;s FINAL quarterly deadline is in 5 hours.
It&rsquo;s our FINAL chance to replace Tea Party Republicans with strong Democratic women.
Pitch in &gt;&gt;
Friend -- Every Democrat on the planet has been emailing you.
Why? Hillary Clinton explained just how crucial this moment is: &ldquo;Six strong Democratic women candidates have a chance to save the Senate... The next 5 hours will decide whether we can mobilize enough voters to win these close races, or if we&rsquo;ll hand the Senate over to the Tea Party.&rdquo;
You MUST decide by the FINAL quarterly deadline at midnight:
Will you help Democratic women END McConnell&rsquo;s takeover chances,
or will you let the Republicans swoop in and win?
5 HOUR TRIPLE-MATCH: This is your LAST shot left to fund our voter mobilization efforts. Will you pitch in before the deadline at midnight?
