Dear Neighbor,
Its hard to
believe Thanksgiving is already here. As we roll out the ingredients for our
pumpkin and pecan pies, deep-fry our turkey and make time for
football, we also pause to reflect on all that we are thankful for: our
family, friends, food on our table, roofs over our heads and good
health.
We live in the greatest state in a free country. There is much to
be thankful for this season, especially our heroes who fight overseas
for our liberties and their families who celebrate this holiday with
an empty seat at the table. Wishing you and your families a very Happy
Thanksgiving!
Heres a quick update on a
few important developments that I wanted to be sure you knew
about:
Combatting Human
Trafficking
Last week, I introduced the
bipartisan
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (H.R.
3530) . There are 3 different groups of people in the crime of human
trafficking: the buyer, the trafficker and the victim. This bill aggressively
targets and penalizes the buyers and traffickers individually and
ensures that human trafficking victims are never treated as criminals.
The bill creates a new revenue stream (not taxpayer dollars) to help
victims by adding a fine to criminals convicted of trafficking, sexual
abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography. Its time to put an
end to this despicable crime that occurs in our own backyards and put
the criminals where they belong: jail.

House and Senate
Standing up for
U.S. and Israeli Interests
Over the weekend, the Administration announced that it had reached a
deal with Iran. This is a bum deal for those who want peace in the
region and the world. It's concerning that the U.S. is allowing Tehran to
continue enrich uranium- a key element in moving towards a nuclear
weapon and something that even the soft UN condemned. This is reminiscent
of the Chamberlain mistake of appeasement with the Nazis by promising
"peace in our time". This deal will not stop the Iranians' quest for
nuclear weapons. This past summer, I voted for stronger sanctions and
the House passed my amendment to hold Iranian government officials
individually accountable.
Sending
110,400 Cards to our Troops
Recently, I held my 7 th
annual Christmas Cards for Troops
drive. Students and teachers from schools within the Congressional District
and many area organizations helped make this drive a huge success
our biggest year yet
with 110,400 heartwarming Christmas and holiday
cards for our troops! Thank you to everyone who participated to thank
a hero this holiday season.
