Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
This afternoon, the Senate passed the bipartisan Workforce Innovation
and Opportunity Act. While the unemployment rate has steadily
declined since the recession, and more than nine million private sector jobs
have been created, too many Americans are still unemployed or lack the
tools necessary to compete for todays jobs. That is why this
legislation, which updates and streamlines our nations job training and
local workforce development programs, is so vital.
The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will help improve training and
educational opportunities for those Americans looking for a job or to
advance their careers. It will also help businesses grow, and strengthen
local economies across the country.
Tens of thousands of
Nevadans have benefited from the job training, placement, and educational
programs funded by the Workforce Investment Act. Many found their first
job, some were able to re-enter the workforce, and others took
advantage of programs to improve their skills and get a promotion. For
nearly all, it meant a paycheck or more money to help support their
families.
The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is also an
example of how the Senate can, and should function. It shows how
Congress can operate when both sides are willing to compromise and work in
good faith to craft legislation that helps improve the lives of
Americans.
