Friends,
As part of the most recent Congressional District Work Week, I had a
full schedule of travel throughout Alabama's Second Congressional
District. These travel weeks allow me to directly interact with the
people I represent and listen firsthand to their concerns.
We started out Tuesday morning with a trip to Samson High School in
Geneva County. I met the teachers and administrators, and had the treat
of visiting with students from the senior government class to discuss
civic leadership. I was impressed by the informed questions from
students on current events, including the situation in Ukraine.
Every American should be concerned about Russia's actions and what it
means internationally. Vladamir Putin is bullying an entire region of
the world, and we have to be willing to stand up to him. I support
President Obama's decision to levy sanctions on Russian leaders, but I'm
not sure we have gone far enough. The United States must rally our NATO
allies and bring our combined pressure to bear. No matter what, we have
to be willing to back up our rhetoric with actions, and it's time for
President Obama to show he can do that.
On Wednesday, I traveled to Dothan to meet with Mayor Mike Schmitz and
officials from the Dothan Area Chamber of Commerce about several
economic development projects in the area. Chamber President Matt
Parker and his team do an outstanding job for Dothan, and I appreciate
them keeping me informed about various prospects in the area and ways
that I can be of help.
>From Dothan we took Highway 84 to Enterprise for a meeting with the
Republican Women of Coffee County. We had a great discussion about a
number of important issues including ongoing problems with the
healthcare law. I've heard from many constituents who have had their
health plans cancelled, premiums increase, or choice of doctor
restricted - all after President Obama repeatedly promised that none of
that would happen.
It's not fair, and people are understandably angry about it. ObamaCare
can't be fixed through small tweaks or executive orders. But, it's not
enough just to say we want to repeal Obamacare. We have to come behind
it with a plan that makes sense.
A group of smart lawmakers in the House are working on this right now,
including several who are doctors. I believe it will be our job to
explain our conservative healthcare alternative to the American people.
On Thursday, I was honored to be on post at Fort Rucker for the Change
of Command Ceremony. As you may know, General Kevin Mangum recently was
promoted and reassigned after serving two years as post commander. The
new commanding general at Fort Rucker is Brigadier General Michael
Lundy. I can't say enough about General Mangum and the leadership he
has shown at Fort Rucker during an especially difficult time. His
impressive promotion speaks for itself. It was a pleasure to meet
General Lundy, and I am confident he will serve with distinction as the
new post commander. Fort Rucker is a special post with a uniquely
valuable mission for the U.S. Army, and I will continue to do all I can
to make sure our Armed Forces have the resources they need to protect
this country.
We wrapped up our travel with a visit to the Civil Air Patrol
headquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base. It was very informative to see
firsthand the work the Civil Air Patrol does on a variety of important
missions. We are fortunate to have the National Civil Air Patrol
headquartered in Montgomery, and I look forward to maintaining our
strong relationship. I appreciate Chief Operating Officer Don Rowland
and his staff for the great hospitality.
The Week Ahead
This week, the House will be back in session with the conflict in
Ukraine to likely dominate the headlines. On Friday, House leaders
introduced a new aid package
that, unlike the Senate
aid bill, does not cut defense spending to prop up the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). I will be closely monitoring the debate on Ukraine
aid as it moves forward.
In addition to possible consideration of a Ukraine aid bill, the House
is expected to consider:
*	H.R. 4275
, the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act;
*	H.R. 2823
, Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in
America; and
*	H.R. 1459
, Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments
Act.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in Washington. As always, please
don't hesitate to contact my office
if you have any questions or if we can be of help to
you.

Friends,
As
part
of
the
most
recent
Congressional
District
Work
Week,
I
had
a
full
schedule
of
travel
throughout
Alabama&#8217;s
Second
Congressional
District.
These
travel
weeks
allow
me
to
directly
interact
with
the
people
I
represent
and
listen
firsthand
to
their
concerns.
We
started

Tuesday

with
a

to
Samson

in
Geneva

I

the

and

and

class
to
discuss
civic
leadership.
I
was
impressed
by
the
informed
questions
from
students
on
current

including
the
situation
in
Ukraine.
Every
American
should
be
concerned
about
Russia&#8217;s
actions
and
what
it
means
internationally.
Vladamir
Putin
is
bullying
an
entire
region
of
the
world,
and
we
have
to
be
willing
to
stand
up
to
him.
I
support
President
Obama&#8217;s
decision
to
levy
sanctions
on
Russian
leaders,
but
I&#8217;m
not
sure
we
have
gone
far
enough.
The
United
States
must
rally
our
NATO
allies
and
bring
our
combined
pressure
to
bear.
No
matter
what,
we
have
to
be
willing
to
back
up
our
rhetoric
with
actions,
and
it&#8217;s
time
for
President
Obama
to
show
he
can
do
that.
On
Wednesday,
I
traveled
to
Dothan
to
meet
with
Mayor
Mike
Schmitz
and
officials
from
the
Dothan
Area
Chamber
of
Commerce
about
several
economic
development
projects
in
the
area.
Chamber
President
Matt
Parker
and
his
team
do
an
outstanding
job
for
Dothan,
and
I
appreciate
them
keeping
me
informed
about
various
prospects
in
the
area
and
ways
that
I
can
be
of
help.
From
Dothan
we
took
Highway
84
to
Enterprise
for
a
meeting
with
the
Republican
Women
of
Coffee
County.
We
had
a
great
discussion
about
a
number
of
important
issues
including
ongoing
problems
with
the
healthcare
law.
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
constituents
who
have
had
their
health
plans
cancelled,
premiums
increase,
or
choice
of
doctor
restricted
&#8211;
all
after
President
Obama
repeatedly
promised
that
none
of
that
would
happen.
It&#8217;s
not
fair,
and
people
are
understandably
angry
about
it.
ObamaCare
can&#8217;t
be
fixed
through
small
tweaks
or
executive
orders.
But,
it&#8217;s
not
enough
just
to
say
we
want
to
repeal
Obamacare.
We
have
to
come
behind
it
with
a
plan
that
makes
sense.
A
group
of
smart
lawmakers
in
the
House
are
working
on
this
right
now,
including
several
who
are
doctors.
I
believe
it
will
be
our
job
to
explain
our
conservative
healthcare
alternative
to
the
American
people.
On
Thursday,
I
was
honored
to
be
on
post
at
Fort
Rucker
for
the
Change
of
Command
Ceremony.
As
you
may
know,
General
Kevin
Mangum
recently
was
promoted
and
reassigned
after
serving
two
years
as
post
commander.
The
new
commanding
general
at
Fort
Rucker
is
Brigadier
General
Michael
Lundy.
I
can't
say
enough
about
General
Mangum
and
the
leadership
he
has
shown
at
Fort
Rucker
during
an
especially
difficult
time.
His
impressive
promotion
speaks
for
itself.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
General
Lundy,
and
I
am
confident
he
will
serve
with
distinction
as
the
new
post
commander.
Fort
Rucker
is
a
special
post
with
a
uniquely
valuable
mission
for
the
U.S.
Army,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
all
I
can
to
make
sure
our
Armed
Forces
have
the
resources
they
need
to
protect
this
country.
We
wrapped
up
our
travel
with
a
visit
to
the
Civil
Air
Patrol
headquarters
at
Maxwell
Air
Force
Base.
It
was
very

Civil
Air

a

of
important

We
are
fortunate
to
have
the
National
Civil
Air

headquartered
in
Montgomery,
and
I
look
forward
to
maintaining
our
strong

I

Chief
Operating
Officer
Don
Rowland
and
his
staff
for
the
great
hospitality.
