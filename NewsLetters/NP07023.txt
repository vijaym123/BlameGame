David, President Obama emailed you earlier and asked if he could count on your support. Here&rsquo;s why:
Republican groups like the Kochs are outspending us 2-to-1 right now.
Boehner&rsquo;s National Republicans just launched a $3O,OOO,OOO.OO ad blitz against Democrats.
Our mid-month deadline is in just 48 hours.
If we keep getting outspent like this:
BOEHNER WINS.
To turn this around, we have to hit our deadline goal. And that means we need 32,215 more grassroots donations. Can the President count on your help right now?
