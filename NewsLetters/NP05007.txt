The election is exactly TEN days away. Here&rsquo;s where we stand:
Yesterday, Cheri was named one of the MOST vulnerable Democrats in the country.
Boehner&rsquo;s on Illinois T.V. with a staggering $4,8OO,OOO.OO in deceptive ads.
Karl Rove&rsquo;s dark money group is going ALL IN to smear Cheri&rsquo;s record.
As of 2pm, we&rsquo;re still $1,980 short of reaching our goal. If we fall short, our chances of keeping Illinois&rsquo; 17th district out of Tea Party control could face a serious setback. David, please -- can we count on your support before tonight&rsquo;s pre-election deadline?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Now or never,
