Dear Neighbor,
One
of the things I value most about public service is the opportunity to
meet and interact with the people I serve. Whether it is visiting
local civic association meetings, holding public town hall meetings and
issues forums, attending various local fairs and festivals in our area,
worshipping at our churches, mosques, synoguges and temples, or just
traveling around the district, I appreciate the opportunity to
interact with each of you and hear your thoughts and concerns. It is
fundamental to our democracy and my ability to serve in
Congress.
On
July 28th at 8:00 pm
I will hold
my 21 st
telephone town hall meeting since coming to Congress. This
is a great opportunity for me to hear directly from you about your
views on the 113 th
Congress and issues facing our
nation.
At 8 pm, tens of thousands of constituents from Virginias
11 th
District will be called to participate in the hour-long
meeting.
However, if you want to guarantee you get called and
have an opportunity to participate in this telephone town hall, you
can sign up by visiting the website at:
http://connolly.house.gov/sign-up-for-a-telephone-town-hall/
Since January 2009, more than 300,000 11 th
District
residents have participated in one of these calls.
Many constituents
have said they enjoy this convenient format since they can participate
from their home or cell phone and have the freedom to stay on the
call as long as they like. This format also allows more participants to
ask a question directly.
And for those who are unable to pose
their question during the call, they will have the option of leaving a
message and receiving a response.
If you cannot particiapte
in this telephone townhall you can still share your thoughts via email
by visiting my website at
Connolly.house.gov , or
Twitter (@GerryConnolly)
and
Facebook .
I value your thoughts and opinions and hope you will be able to
join us
July 28th at 8:00 pm .
Sincerely,
Gerald E. Connolly
Member of
Congress
11th District of Virginia
P.S.,
Another way I try to communicate with constituents is through periodic
