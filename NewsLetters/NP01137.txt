Lamborn
and Graham Introduce US-Israel Anti-Tunnel Legislation as Amendment to
NDAA
4/29/15
Today Representatives Doug Lamborn
(R-CO) and Gwen Graham (D-FL) incorporated their two similar bills,
H.R. 1349, the US-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act, and H.R.
1649, the Partnering to Detect and Defeat Tunnels Act, as an amendment
to the 2016 National Defense Authorization
Act.
The amendment will
authorize research and development of an anti-tunneling defense system
to protect Israel from terrorist attacks. The amendment, which
combines language from H.R. 1349 and H.R. 1649, is similar to the 2011
legislative authorization for the highly successful Iron Dome Anti-Missile
Defense System, which has stopped more than 1,200 rockets from hitting
Israel.
Tunnels are an age-old threat that have re-emerged in a very
dangerous way, said Rep. Lamborn. We know that if Hamas has used tunnels
in successful terrorist attacks, it is only a matter of time before
terrorists elsewhere use tunnels as well. Tunnels are a threat to
American bases and embassies around the world, and are already a serious
threat on our own southern border. For all these reasons, it only makes
sense to partner with Israel, like we have done on missile defense, to
learn with them about how to defend against
tunnels.
Rep. Graham added,
Our closest ally in the Middle East
Israel
lives under the
constant threat of terrorist attacks from underground tunnels. The US-Israel
Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act will launch an unprecedented new
initiative to protect Israel from this dangerous menace. To secure
peace, we must first help Israel secure their state from attacks. Iron
Dome has saved countless civilian lives, and an anti-tunneling defense
shield will save countless
more.
The terrorist group, Hamas, has spent
nearly $100 million to construct tunnels for smuggling weapons, money and
supplies into Gaza, as well as launching terrorist attacks within
Israels borders.
In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad
Shalit through a tunnel and held him for five years, and in the summer
2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas, Israel Defense Forces
discovered 32 tunnels, 14 of which crossed directly into
Israel.
The bipartisan
legislation is endorsed by AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee. In addition to helping Israel secure its borders, the
anti-tunneling defense technology discovered in this joint project could also
be used to protect American military bases and our nations borders
with Mexico and
Canada.
This bill, which authorizes research, development
and test activities between the United States and Israel in order to
better detect and destroy these tunnels, will help both the United States
and Israel defend against future threats emanating from tunnels,
AIPACs directors of government affairs wrote in an endorsement letter.
This bill promotes real cooperation and cost-sharing between
Washington and Jerusalem on this key
challenge.
