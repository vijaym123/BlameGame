Peter Takes on FDA
Regulators: Back Off Our Cheese
Good news
for Vermonts cheese makers and cheese lovers:
Responding to
pressure from Peter, FDA deputy commissioner Mike Taylor
sent Peter a letter
last week officially backing
down from his agencys intent to ban the use of wood in the cheese
aging process.
The letter follows a June 17 phone call between Peter
and Commissioner Taylor.
Had FDA moved forward with its
misguided plan, cheese makers in Vermont and around the country would have
been required to replace wood shelving at a cost of millions.
You
can watch WPTZs report on the controversy
here.
Peter joined with
Vermont cheese makers in Waterbury to discuss how the FDA plan would harm
their businesses.
The House Gets It!
Second Welch Energy Efficiency Bill
Moving Through Congress
The House passed
Peters bipartisan legislation to encourage schools administrators to
make cost-saving energy efficiency upgrades.
The bill is
modeled after Vermonts school-based energy efficiency efforts. Read more
about Peters progress in Congress on energy efficiency

The House is catching on: energy efficiency is a win for
jobs, the environment and saving money.
Reducing Border Crossing Delays
Peter has been working closely with the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) agency to reduce delays in crossing the
Canadian border.
The federal NEXUS program allows qualified enrollees
expedited border crossing -- but Vermont applicants have to travel to
Champlain, NY for a required screening interview.
At
Peters request, the agency recently held four mobile enrollment centers
in Montpelier, Burlington, St. Albans and Derby Line to make it
convenient for Vermonters to sign-up for a program.
And at Peters
urging, CBP also announced
extended
hours
for Nexus cardholders at the Highgate Springs border crossing.

Peter signs up for NEXUS
program that allows for faster processing at the border.
