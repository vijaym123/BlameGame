Rep. Bob Goodlatte
TUNE IN SUNDAY @ 10AM ON FOX NEWS
I'll be live on
&quot;Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo&quot;
on Fox News at 10AM to discuss the situation with ISIS and the War on Terror.
It's Time for Congress to End the Ethanol Mandate
Some have called it a &ldquo;well-intentioned flop&rdquo; while others say it&rsquo;s an
anti-competitive government mandate, but whatever you call the ethanol mandate, or Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), it&rsquo;s clear this policy has
caused many negative consequences for American consumers.
The ethanol mandate is a true &ldquo;kitchen table&rdquo; issue. This unworkable
policy impacts every American family trying to make financial decisions. From food costs to wear and tear on the family car or lawnmower, the RFS
means added costs and less money for other purchases. It certainly impacts the cost of doing business for many, but it&rsquo;s the consumers who
ultimately shoulder the costs of this broken policy. This is one of the concerns I consistently hear from folks in the Sixth District whether they run
a restaurant, farm for a living, have seen an engine ruined by ethanol, or have noticed an increase in their grocery bills.
This week, I introduced the
RFS Elimination Act
and the
RFS Reform Act
to help
curb the harmful effects of this federal mandate.
Read
more about these bills in my weekly column.
Honoring a
Local Hero
On Friday, I had the
honor of presenting Wesley Hillman with the Congressional Gold Medal for his service to the United States as a member of the Civil Air Patrol during
World War II. His career in aviation is well-known in the Roanoke community. I am grateful to know Mr. Hillman and to have had the opportunity to see
him receive this long-deserved recognition.
Read more about the
medal ceremony and Mr. Hillman's story here.
Big Brothers Big Sisters in Washington
This week, Nick from Roanoke spent the day in Washington with Big Brothers Big Sisters
Southwest Virginia. It was great to show him the Capitol!
This Week in Congress
*I introduced H.R. 9, the
Innovation
Act , a bipartisan patent reform bill, which passed the House with overwhelming support in 2013.
*The
House voted to fully repeal Obamacare . The President&rsquo;s health care law is not working to improve the
affordability or availability of health care in this country.
*President Obama
released his budget
for Fiscal Year 2016, which never balances.
We have the opportunity, and responsibility, to tackle the nation&rsquo;s debt
head on &ndash; to ignore that is to deny future generations the brightest outlook possible.
