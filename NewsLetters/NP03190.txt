David,
I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about running for office over the past few years.
One of the biggest lessons I&rsquo;ve learned is that no two elections are the same, especially in this post- Citizens United
world.
I wish we could take a break from all these emails- but with conservative billionaires like the Koch brothers set to spend record amounts in 2016, we must stay focused and prepare early. David, can I count on you to help us start the year strong? You can use this link to make a donation: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
Remember, any amount goes a long way.
Thanks for all you do,
Cheri
