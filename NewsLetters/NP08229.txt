Dear Friend, The Tea Party embodies what I call the &ldquo;Republican Paradox&rdquo;: Republicans hate government, but they have to run for office to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t work.
And once they&rsquo;re elected, they do everything in their power to prove that government doesn&rsquo;t work, instead of actually trying to solve problems.
Since these ideologues took control of the House, we&rsquo;ve seen a deadlocked Congress in which even the most common sense and bipartisan measures are defeated by a zealous minority. And this fall, the Tea Party needs only six seats to take control of the Senate, too. I need your help to keep Massachusetts out of their hands -- can you give $5 or more before our FEC filing deadline?

What would a Tea Party Senate look like? Think of a Senate in which Ted Cruz is in charge. Think of a Senate that ends Medicare as we know it.
Think of a Senate that sees fit to play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States -- a Senate that sees the bedrock of the American economy as a political bargaining chip. We cannot allow the Tea Party to win control of the Senate -- chip in $5 to get us closer to $36,000 before the FEC deadline on the 30th.
I served in the House when the Tea Party took control, and I watched as the normal workings of the American government shuddered to a halt.
The Tea Party has done enough damage to our nation. This year, in this election, we are going to fight back -- and
with your help , we are going to win.
Thanks for your support.
