Aloha David,
Tax season can be a stressful time for many families, especially if you bought a new home, had a baby or got married last year. With the April 15th deadline just around the corner, I wanted to make sure you knew about some of the options available to help you file your Federal taxes this year.
Here are a few resources to help get you started :
File your taxes for free.
If you earn an income below $58,000, you are eligible to use free file software. If your income is above $58,000, you can use FreeFile fillable forms. More information can be found
here .
Free tax return preparation.
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program is available for people who make $52,000 or less and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program is available for those 60 years and older. More information can be found
here .
The Earned Income Tax Credit.
The EITC is for people who work and earn less than $51,567.
You can find out if you are eligible for the EITC by using the EITC Assistant on the IRS&rsquo; website, which can be found
here .
