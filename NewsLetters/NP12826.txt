Locals Should
Have the First Say
Dear Friends,
Having lived in, worked in, and represented the great state of Wyoming, I can tell: no-one cares more about a place than the people who live there.
The locals are the ones who understand, work for, and love the place in which they live.
That is why I support legislation and processes that involve local people and where the federal government is made to listen to the locals concerns or thoughts regarding the place where they live.
And this is why I support the Northern Nevada Land Conservation and Economic Development Act, because it is a group of bills drafted by Nevadans concerning land in Nevada for the people of Nevada.
This is a good precedent for how the federal government should work: listen to the local people first.
As I continue to work for and represent you, please
contact me
and tell me your concerns or comments about the issues that you value. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you!
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
