Lamborn Negotiating House and Senate Defense Bill
Differences
9/18/14
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn helped start
negotiations on differences in House and Senate National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) language for 2015. House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Buck McKeon (CA-25) hand-picked Congressman Lamborn to serve as a
negotiator due to his expertise and knowledge on defense legislative
matters and seniority on the
committee.
"Thank you to Chairman McKeon
for this opportunity to serve as an Informal Conferee. I will use my
position to advocate for increased defense spending, pushing back against
calls for base closures, and strong space and missile defense
spending."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
