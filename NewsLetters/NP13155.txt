House Passes Measure to Protect Personal Information within New ObamaCare Website
Bill seeks to increase security, transparency &amp; protection of personal information as concerns mount over the security
of the new health care website
Jan 10, 2014
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) today praised that U.S. House of Representatives passage of the
Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act (H.R.3811) which will require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to notify individuals if their personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed through an ObamaCare exchange.
This notification
must occur no later than two business days after discovery by HHS.
Miller said:
&#8220;As technology grows, our nation is faced with an increasing number of data breach cases where millions of Americans&#8217; personal
and financial information is compromised.
It has become vitally important for us to scrutinize the protection of personal information, especially in the wake of the launch of the new ObamaCare website, an online health care exchange that, was admittedly,
lacking in a full security control assessment before the website went live on October 1st of last year.
To date the health exchanges are still not fully built, only adding to the security concerns.
&#8220;It is incumbent upon the Congress to work to strengthen our laws and ensure that the American people&#8217;s personal information
is provided the strongest security protections possible.
The House acted today to pass a legislative measure aimed at strengthening the security requirements within the new health care website, as well as require prompt notifications to individuals in the
event of a breach involving their personal information.
Any delay in heightening the security standards of the health care website is unacceptable.
The Administration must step up to the plate and work with the Congress to provide the American people with
the certainties they deserve.&#8221;
