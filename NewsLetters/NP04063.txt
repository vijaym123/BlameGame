WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week, I
had the opportunity to
pay
tribute to Marions Donuts from the House
Floor .
Marion Ramsey and her donut shop became part of my daily routine
thirty-five years ago, and I
have brought
my
boys there since birth. It was nostalgic for all three of them to join me
on Marions last day of business Sunday, November 30th for old times
sake and wish Marion a happy retirement. Her customers will be
forever grateful for our time together!
After passing 21 bills under suspension of the
rules on Monday and Tuesday, the House considered and passed the Tax
Increase Prevention Act ( H.R. 5771 ) on Wednesday. H.R. 5771 extends a number
of tax relief provisions in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that either
expired at the end of 2013 or during 2014 for one year. Specifically,
this legislation extends eight provisions for individuals including
the deductibility of state and local sales taxes and the extension of
tax-free distributions from individual retirement plans for charitable
purposes. Moreover, H.R. 5771 extends 30 business-related provisions,
including the research and development tax credit, bonus depreciation,
and increased section 179 expensing. Finally, H.R. 5771 extends 11
energy-related provisions and two provisions relating to multiemployer
defined benefit pension plans. I applaud the certainty that this bill
provides hardworking taxpayers across the country and hope it paves the
way for a complete overhaul of our broken tax system that simplifies
and lowers taxes, allowing Americans to keep and invest more of their
hard-earned money, expand their businesses, create jobs, and help grow
our economy.
The House
also passed the ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) Act of
2014 ( H.R.
647 )
on Wednesday. H.R. 647 allows states the option to establish an ABLE
program, under which eligible individuals with disabilities may
establish an ABLE account, allowing for allows individuals with disabilities
to work and live independently without losing access to Medicaid and
Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
On Thursday, the House passed
the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act ( H.R. 5759 ). The
measure prohibits the executive branch from exempting from removal or
deferring removal of categories of aliens who are unlawfully present
whether by executive order, regulation, or any other means. The bill
prohibits also the executive branch from treating such aliens as if they were
lawfully present or had a lawful immigration status, or granting them
work authorization. The effective date is November 20, 2014, and
applies to requests submitted for work authorization or exemption from, or
deferral of, removal.
Finally, the House concurred in
the
Senate Amendment to H.R.
3979 , the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal
year (FY) 2015, by a vote of 300-119. The NDAA authorizes and
prioritizes funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other select
national security programs within the Department of Energy for FY 2015
consistent with the House budget, H.Con.Res. 96, which passed with 219
Republican votes on April 10, 2014. Finally, this legislation contains a
bipartisan, bicameral package of public land provisions that was
negotiated by the Chairmen and Ranking Members or the House and Senate
Natural Resources Committees. A summary of that package can be
found
here .
America is at war, and as our country faces
continued uncertainty, it is Congresss job to ensure that those who protect
us
from these threats
our men and women in uniform
at least
have certainty from Congress. Providing for the security of our nation
is one of our most important responsibilities, and I thank Chairman
McKeon of the House Armed Services Committee for his terrific
leadership, which resulted in another successful year and the bipartisan passage
of the fifty-third consecutive NDAA. I am proud to have supported
it.
Next week,
in addition to suspensions, the House will consider the California
Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 5781). The House is also
expected to consider legislation to address the upcoming expiration of the
current Continuing Resolution (CR), as well as legislation on the
expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.
Finally, Id like to close out this
weeks From the Front by thanking all of the Arkansans who visited my
office while in Washington this week, including Rebecca Hedges from
Rogers, my friends from the Arkansas and Missouri Railroad and the
Northwest Regional Housing Authority. Great to see you! Safe travels
home.
From the
Front...
