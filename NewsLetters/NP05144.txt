Honoring American Legion Day
On September 16th of each year, we honor and pay tribute to the nation's largest wartime veterans service organization, the American Legion. It was on this date in history in 1919 that the American Legion was first chartered by Congress. I had the pleasure of submitting a statement into the Congressional Record honoring American Legion Day on behalf of the Wesley Lee Farley American Legion Post 583 and American Legions nationwide.
