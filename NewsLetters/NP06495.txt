HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

Change in law doubles funds for NMI sexual assault program - Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act. Coincident with that milestone, funds have been awarded to the Northern Mariana Islands Criminal Justice Planning Agency, reflecting for the first time the change in funding I had included when VAWA was reauthorized last year . CJPA is receiving $44,679, double the previous grant amount, for its Sexual Assault Services Program. Our nation and our community have made strides in confronting the problem of violence against women, since VAWA became law in 1994. But more remains to do. It's a problem that requires the constant attention of individuals, families, and community organizations. Here in Congress I will do my part by working to strengthen the laws that protect people from violence and maintain or increase funding for Sexual Assault Services, STOP, Transitional Housing, and other federal programs that help those who have been victimized.

AmeriCorps service members in the Northern Marianas joined 600 mainland counterparts on a live webcast at 2:00 a.m. this morning to reaffirm the AmeriCorps pledge to "Get Things Done." Have they ever! NMI AmeriCorps members logged over 35,000 hours of service, tutoring 683 of their fellow students, and 81% of those tutored have made gains in reading. Congratulations on your dedication to service and getting things done in the NMI.
AmeriCorps continues to serve the Marianas - This year, again, our Public School System is the grantee for the AmeriCorps program in the Northern Marianas. Notice went out on September 5 that PSS was receiving $371,147. The money will support 60 AmeriCorps service members, student tutors within PSS, all of whom will be eligible at the end of their term of service to receive the Segal Education Award to use towards college tuition. Today also marks the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps itself. The program was reauthorized in 2009 in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act , of which I was an original cosponsor . The 2009 Act made the Northern Marianas eligible for Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and authorized us to participate in all of the programs of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, including the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, the Foster Grandparent Program, the Senior Companion Program, and Youth Build.

The Northern Marianas gets more federal funding per person than the Virgin Islands or Guam, when Social Security and military spending are taken out of the comparison.
Comparing federal dollars to "other territories" is not the goal - A recent article in the Marianas Variety asks the question: which U.S. territories get more federal spending? I added my thoughts in a letter to the editor , pointing out that Guam gets $500 million in Defense Department spending every year - a level of military activity many of us would not want in the Northern Marianas. The Virgin Islands gets $200 million more in Social Security spending than we do because most people in the NMI never paid into Social Security. Setting those differences aside the Northern Marianas gets more per person from the federal government than Guam or the Virgin Islands. See the chart, above. The question I always ask, however, is how we compare, not to "other territories," but to the rest of the United States. That's how I read Article VII of our Covenant - we should be "part of the American economic community" - and that's my goal for the Northern Marianas: parity with U.S. states.
More funding for the Northern Marianas - In addition to the award for AmeriCorps and the Sexual Assault Services Program, a number of other grants were announced for the Commonwealth or entities in the NMI this week:
$1,579,292 for Lower Base Industrial Park Sewer System Improvements - The Economic Development Administration awarded the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation $1,579,292 for Lower Base Industrial Park Sewer System Improvements. This EDA investment supports the construction of sewer system improvements for the redevelopment of the Lower Base Industrial Park on Saipan. The project supports economic diversification and resilience and the anticipated outcome would be that 75 jobs will be retained. Congratulations to CUC.
$49,146 for State Justice Statistics Program - The Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs awarded the NMI Criminal Justice Planning Agency $49,146 for the State Justice Statistics Program. Funds will be used to expand data collection capacity and analytic capabilities and pay for a Statistical Analyst, who will be responsible for administering the grant. Data obtained will be posted to the Statistical Analysis Center website to inform the public about current crime trends and patterns. Congratulations to CJPA.
$219,017 for Legal Assistance for Victims - The Department of Justice, Office on Violence against Women, awarded Micronesian Legal Services Corporation and its collaborative partner, Karidat Social Services, $219,017 for Legal Assistance for Victims. With the funds MLSC and Karidat will provide assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, who are involved in legal proceedings as a result of the violence. This program is highly competitive. So special congratulations to MLSC and Karidat for their effective grant application!
$10,033 Student Loan Repayment grant for public defenders and prosecutors - The Criminal Justice Planning Agency was awarded $10,033 to assist local, state, and federal public defenders and prosecutors pay down their student loans. The John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program provides assistance to public defenders and local and state prosecutors, who commit to three years continued employment in their positions. CJPA is now responsible for outreach, education, and solicitation of applications from eligible beneficiaries. CJPA is also charged with allocating the funds equally between prosecutors and public defenders, and with prioritizing those attorneys, who have the least ability to repay their loans. Congratulations to CJPA.

U.S. Selective Service System Director Lawrence G. Romo and Associate Director for Operations Mariano C. Campos, Jr. briefed me this week on Selective Service activities in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Selective Service System is an independent government agency that keeps a record of those potentially subject to military conscription. Most men living in the U.S. ages 18 through 25 are required by law to register and may be denied student aid or other federal benefits if not registered. Registration is quick and easy online , by mail, or on a Federal Student Financial Aid application form. For assistance visit your congressional district office on Rota, Tinian, or Saipan. And for more information, go to https://www.sss.gov/default.htm.
Supporting statehood for Americans who pay taxes - Improved political status is a concern for many Americans living in non-state areas of our country - none more so than those in the District of Columbia, who pay federal taxes but have no vote on how their taxes are spent. I support the principles of popular self-determination and full representation, and for that reason signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 292, a bill authorizing statehood for the District of Columbia . I became co-sponsor number 101, thus breaking the previous record of 100 co-sponsors for a DC statehood bill. On Monday, September 15, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing on the Senate companion bill, S. 132 . Committee proceedings are generally live-streamed
for those of you interested in following this debate.

With full military honors, PFC Bernard Gavrin was laid to rest today at Arlington National Cemetery. PFC Gavrin was reported missing in action in 1944 during the Battle of Saipan and his remains were discovered last year by the Kuentai Group, a nonprofit Japanese organization dedicated to the recovery of Japanese soldiers killed in war. Genetic testing by the U.S. Defense Department's Joint Prisoner of War Missing in Action Accounting Command confirmed the remains to be those of PFC Gavrin. I paid my respects to David Rogers, Gavrin's nephew and the only living relative to have known the soldier personally, and to other members of the family at the services today.
Working group seeking ideas for Monument Visitor Center - The Marianas Trench Monument Advisory Council Visitor Center Working Group wants to hear your ideas on a future visitor center in the Northern Mariana Islands. Listening sessions beginning at 6 p.m. will be held on Tinian, September 16 at the Fleming Hotel, on Saipan, September 17 at American Memorial Park, and on Rota, September 22 at the Mayor's conference room. The Monument Advisory Council formed its Visitor Center Working Group, with representatives from the Northern Marianas, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Coast Guard, a year ago to develop recommendations regarding the type, purpose, location, and potential funding sources for a Monument Visitor Center in the Northern Marianas .
White House establishes Pacific Island Task Force - The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI) , in collaboration with the Office of Insular Affairs at the Department of the Interior, launched a Pacific Island Task Force
this week as an interagency effort to address crosscutting issues in the Pacific Islands. WHIAAPI convened a regional summit in Guam
in April and several representatives from the Northern Mariana Islands attended. The new Task Force was created to ensure follow up on the recommendations gathered at that summit. In May 2015, WHIAAPI will host an Administration-wide conference in Washington, DC where federal agencies will highlight the progress they have made. The Task Force aims to engage agency officials to increase opportunity and access to federal programs, with a specific focus on supporting non-governmental organizations in the region as well as develop local capacity building and technical assistance support. The group is comprised of officials from the agencies represented at the summit and members of the President's Advisory Commission on AAPIs.
