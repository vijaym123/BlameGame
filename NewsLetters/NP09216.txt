Congressman: VA Scandal is an 'Emergency'
Benishek tries to save ROTC programs
Dear Friends,
Last week was another busy week in Washington, from working to hold the
Department of Veterans' Affairs accountable, to passing legislation
that will ensure the ports and harbors in Northern Michigan are
properly maintained.
It was great being back in Michigan over the Memorial Day holiday to
honor the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending
our nation. I hope everyone took a moment to remember those who have
defended our freedom.
Sincerely,
Dr. Benishek Demands Accountability From VA
With all that has been going on with the Department of Veterans'
Affairs, we need to ensure that real change will occur moving forward.
This week we passed the "Department of Veterans' Affairs Management
Accountability Act of 2014" in the House by a 390 to 33 margin.
President Obama has allowed the VA leadership to operate without
accountability. Veterans are dying, the time for excuses has passed.
The time for taking action to fix these problems is now.

depends on the ability to transport goods and services around the
lakes. The ability to ensure smooth navigation of the Great Lakes is
vital to our region, providing billions of dollars in economic impact
annually as well as sustaining numerous jobs in the area.
