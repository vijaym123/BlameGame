Dear Friend,
One of the most common questions I receive is about
whether I agree that we need to label GMOs, or genetically modified
food.
Simple answer
yes.
But I wanted
to respond as part of my Ask Adam video series and flesh out my
answer a little more.
One constituent
James, a Silver Lake
resident
recently wrote an email to me: Please take a stand against
industry-supported legislation that would preempt state GMO labeling laws
and instead, support the rights of consumers like myself to know if
their food has been genetically
engineered.
Im a strong
proponent of labeling GMOs
its a consumers right to be fully informed
about the choices they make regarding the food they eat and thats why I
cosponsored the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act. This
legislation would require clear labeling of all genetically modified
foods sold in stores. Unfortunately, corporate food manufacturers are
spending millions of dollars to combat efforts to require clear labeling
of GMOs for consumers.
GMOs are becoming increasingly
common on our grocery store shelves and it should not be a mystery to
consumers whether or not these products are genetically engineered. Our
citizens have a right to know what they are feeding their families.
