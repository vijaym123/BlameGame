Dear friends,
The President appeared on a popular millennial website this week to
garner support for his healthcare law. While the President comes across
as being pretty "cool", his policies for millenials are not very cool
at all: getting out of college with big debt isn't cool, living in your
parent's basement isn't cool, having a college degree but working for
minimum wage isn't cool, and the NSA spying on you isn't cool.
This week I co-hosted a "millennial meet-up"
with several dozen
Conservative millenials. We discussed the issues they care about and
how Republicans can do a better job of engaging their generation. I
talked about that meeting on Fox & Friends. Click on the image below to
watch my interview:
War on Seniors: The Democrats' "war on seniors" is also decidedly not
cool. This week, the House passed H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and
Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, by a vote of
238-181. If the SGR, commonly referred to as the "Doc-fix", is not
addressed by March 31st, Medicare providers face a 24% cut to their
reimbursement rate. This could be detrimental to their ability to
provide seniors medical care. The Bill that my House colleagues and I
passed this week would permanently prevent that cut from happening and
we found a way to pay-for it. I discussed the "Doc-fix" on the Floor of
the House. Click on the image to watch my remarks:

Rice Lake. Whether you are a job seeker or a job creator, please

Thanks for taking the time to read this week's update. As always,
please continue to share your thoughts and ideas for how I may better
serve you in Congress. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friends,
The
President
appeared
on
a
popular
millennial
website
this
week
to
garner
support
for
his
healthcare
law.
While
the
President
comes
across
as
being
pretty
&#8220;cool&#8221;,
his
policies
for
millenials
are
not
very
cool
at
all:
getting
out
of
college
with
big
debt
isn&#8217;t
cool,
living
in
your
parent&#8217;s
basement
isn&#8217;t
cool,
having
a
college
degree
but
working
for
minimum
wage
isn&#8217;t
cool,
and
the
NSA
spying
on
you
isn&#8217;t
cool.
This
week
I
co-hosted
a
&#8220;millennial
meet-up&#8221;
with
several
dozen
Conservative
millenials.
We
discussed
the
issues
they
care
about
and
how
Republicans
can
do
a
better
job
of
engaging
their
generation.
I
talked
about
that
meeting
on

War
on
Seniors:
The
Democrats&#8217;
&#8220;war
on

is
also
decidedly
not

This
week,
the
House
passed
H.R.
4015 ,
the
SGR
Repeal
and
Medicare
Provider
Payment
Modernization
Act
of
2014 ,
by
a
vote
of
238-181.
If
the
SGR,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
&#8220;Doc-fix&#8221;,
is
not
addressed
by
March
31 st ,
Medicare
providers
face
a
24%
cut
to
their
reimbursement
rate.
This
could
be
detrimental
to
their
ability
to
provide
seniors
medical

that
my

colleagues
and
I
passed
this

would
