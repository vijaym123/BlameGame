I'm disappointed.
I was just updated on the status of President Obama's call-to-action. It's not good.
My team doesn't know what else to do. They've tried everything.
That's why I am coming directly to you.
And I&rsquo;ll be blunt: If we can&rsquo;t answer President Obama's plea, Boehner's ad blitz will steamroll us.
So David, chip in today if you can. We&rsquo;re nearly out of time. This could not be more important. All Donations to this Email Matched Today Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
