Dear David,
This is a
special invitation to join my town hall meeting at
the Association of Poinciana Villages in Kissimmee, June
16 th
at 6:30 p.m.
Well be talking about issues important
to you, like paycheck fairness and raising the minimum wage for all
workers.
Nearly half of all workers in our
economy are women, and forty percent of working women are the primary
breadwinners in their families. However, women are underpaid for their
work and on average, earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men.
As a result of the wage gap, women working full-time in Florida will
lose a combined $17.3 billion annually. [1]
The
gender wage gap is something that should concern us all. In order to
address this, I co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would close
loopholes that allow pay discrimination to continue. Its time to
ensure equal pay for equal
work .
Everyone deserves a fair shot at the American Dream, but that has become
nearly impossible for the 30 million minimum wage workers in America.
No person working forty hours a week should be living below
the poverty line, which is why Ive introduced legislation to raise
the minimum wage to $10.50 an hour. My bill would also raise the
minimum wage for tipped employees, who are vastly underpaid for their
work.
Men and women working as servers in the restaurant
industry, for example, experience three times the poverty rate of the
nations workforce as a whole.
Raising
the minimum wage for all workers will create a better life for
thousands of Floridians, and boost our
economy.
Are you a minimum wage worker? Are you concerned about
paycheck fairness? What other issues are impacting you, your family, or your
neighbors? Please, stop by our meeting on Monday, June 16 th
at 6:30 p.m. and share your story. Im looking forward to seeing
you.
Sincerely,
P.S. Please
