Greetings,
Today, we celebrate the blessings of a people dedicated to liberty.
Our forefathers fled religious prosecution to pursue the freedom of conscience in the New World, a bedrock principle we must continue to protect.
As the pilgrims in their November 1620 Mayflower Compact, their very first governing framework, wrote: &ldquo; solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation.&rdquo;
A year later they thanked God for his providence, their first harvest, and a new land of opportunity. It was the nation&rsquo;s very first Thanksgiving.
Despite the many trials they faced, they expressed gratitude for the opportunity to live freely.
President Calvin Coolidge reminded us nearly a century ago: &ldquo;We have been a most favored people. We ought to be a most generous people. We have been a most blessed people. We ought to be a most thankful people.&rdquo;
And, we are.
This Thanksgiving, Heidi and I wish you and your family the very best, and may God continue to bless the Great State of Texas and the United States of America.
All the best,
Ted Cruz
