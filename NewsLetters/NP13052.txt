The case:
The Little Sisters of the Poor object, due to their religious beliefs, to providing access to abortifacients. They have stated that doing so
directly, or signing a form authorizing a third party to act in their place, would violate their conscience. The Obama Administration argues that it would not. Who should decide?
Much is at stake in how that question is answered. In a
recent update on the case , US News &amp; World Report offers a poignant reminder: If the nuns lose this battle rooted in fidelity to conscience, so does America.
