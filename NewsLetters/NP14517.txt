Dear Friend,
Tomorrow, we will recognize
Veterans Day.
Veterans Day is an opportunity to express
gratitude to real-life heroes like U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Sean Adams of
Gainesville, who lost his legs, left thumb, and a finger in an IED
explosion in Afghanistan.
I could list thousands of Georgia
veterans, each with his or her unique story of service and courage. Each
deserves our thanks every day of the year.
In the U.S. Air
Force Reserve, I had the privilege of coming along side our nations
finest during their times of need at Balad Air Base in Iraq. As a
chaplain, I ministered to those who bore the wounds of battle. Every day, I
was inspired by the courage and determination of soldiers who,
despite pain and suffering, could not wait to return to the field in the
service of their country.
The veterans I have been
honored to meet and work with have inspired my desire to see our nation
keep every promise it makes to our men and women in uniform. Veterans
should never have reason to doubt their countrys commitment to them. Im
glad that the high priority of veterans care remains one of the few
places of bipartisan agreement in Washington, and I will continue
working with others to protect the promise of healthcare, education, and
other vital veterans benefits.
Please do not let this week
in which we remember those who served pass without thanking at least
one veteran. Whether the individual is your father, sister, child,
grandparent, friend, or a complete stranger, I guarantee that your
gratitude will touch their heart. Saying thanks is a simple, meaningful
step toward repaying our veterans the great debt they are
owed.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
