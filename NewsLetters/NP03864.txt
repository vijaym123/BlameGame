Dear David,
Last week
marked a big step for families and workers in Missouri and across our
nation. Over the weekend, the Senate
passed
the
bipartisan and bicameral "Revitalize American Manufacturing and
Innovation Act," which I
introduced
with U.S. Senator
Sherrod Brown (Ohio) as part of the appropriations omnibus
bill.
In Missouri, we're fortunate to be home to world-class research
institutions, universities, suppliers, manufacturers, and corporations
which are ideally situated to propel us forward in advanced
manufacturing. Nearly
10 percent
of our state's workforce is
employed in manufacturing, and aerospace and transportation equipment
are the two largest advanced manufacturing sectors in
Missouri.
This common-sense, bipartisan jobs bill would not only boost
manufacturing and create jobs in Missouri and across our nation, but by
supporting innovation and manufacturing in America, it will help us
compete in a growing global economy.
I'm pleased this
bill is headed to President Obama's desk, and I urge the president to
sign it into law immediately. I look forward to building on this success
in the new Congress and working with my colleagues to pass policies
that encourage more economic opportunity and jump-start good-paying
jobs for workers in Missouri and nationwide.
As always, I
invite you to join the conversation online by sharing your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter ,
and on
Instagram .
Sincere
regards,
