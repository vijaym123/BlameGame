Capitol Update
A Message from Congressman Cook on Jobs
Every American out of work faces a potential personal and family
crisis. That's why I remain committed to creating jobs, putting people
back to work, and expanding the economy. I voted in support of the
"Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013" (REINS
Act). The REINS Act prevents federal agencies from issuing these
costly, complex, and ineffective regulations by requiring approval from
Congress. I've also supported the "Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting
Reform Act," which speeds up the process of creating pipelines just
like the Keystone Pipeline, to take advantage of America's natural gas
boom. This will create tens of thousands of American jobs and a major
boost to the economy, bringing us closer to energy independence.
Less take-home pay, higher health care costs, and more broken promises
are not what hardworking Americans deserve. They deserve real reform,
which is why I support and voted for H.R. 2009, the "Keep the IRS Off
Your Health Care Act." This legislation prohibits the Internal Revenue
Service from implementing the president's health care law, which is
hurting American families and making it harder for small businesses to
hire.
I continue to fight to create educational opportunities for all. As a
former educator it is of great importance to me to make sure students
can receive the education they need and deserve. Through the Bipartisan
Student Loan Certainty Act, I've worked to make student loans more
affordable by tying interest rates to today's low market rates, making
paying for college easier for students and families and fairer for
taxpayers.
Last but not least, America's veterans deserve programs that promote
economic opportunity and ensure our nation's veterans have the tools
they need to find jobs. That's why I voted for the Veterans Economic
Opportunity Act.
The bills I discussed are just a few of dozens of bills that my
colleagues and I in the House have passed that now sit on Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid's desk awaiting action in the United States
Senate. I will continue to work on important job-producing legislation
in the coming year and will remain focused on getting our economy
moving again.
Fighting for Veterans' COLA
Congressman Cook joined his colleague Rep. William Enyart in expressing
serious concern regarding the reduction of the cost of living
adjustment (COLA) in military retiree pay by one percent beginning in
2015. In a letter sent to House Armed Services leadership, Congressman
Cook urged the restoration of benefits to all military retirees in next
year's National Defense Authorization Act. Below is an excerpt of the
letter he wrote:
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Child Protection Enhancement Act of 2014
Congressman Cook has signed on as an original cosponsor to H.R. 3923,
the "Child Protection Enhancement Act of 2014." This legislation would
provide child welfare agencies with access to the FBI's national
criminal information databases to conduct background checks for
accelerated foster care placement.
Said Cook, "One of my primary concerns with foster care is ensuring
that children be placed into a safe environment. There is currently no
internal system where an official can conduct a background check into
potential families.
"There are over 420,000 children in the foster care system, and 30,000
of them exit the system every year without finding a permanent family.
Currently, agencies can't access criminal databases for use in foster
care placement. This delays placement and hurts children who suffer
from extended waiting periods due to bureaucratic hurdles. America's
children deserve better.
"This bill fixes the problem by allowing agencies to access the
information they need to conduct federal background checks for
expedited foster care placement. The worst thing we can do is put a
child in an unsafe home with a known criminal. My priority is to ensure
the safety of these children and give them a real chance for a
successful future."
Congressman Cook is a member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster
Youth. This caucus provides a forum for Members of Congress to discuss
and develop policies to strengthen the child welfare system and improve
the overall well-being of youth and families.
District Update

Park, Thursday January 30 beginning at 4:30 PM. Congressman Cook's

Capitol
Update
A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
on
Jobs
Every
American
out
of
work
faces
a
potential
personal
and
family
crisis.
That's
why
I
remain
committed
to
creating
jobs,
putting
people
back
to
work,
and
expanding
the
economy.
I
voted
in
support
of
the
&#8220;Regulations
from
the
Executive
in
Need
of

Act
of
2013&#8221;

Act).
The
REINS
Act
prevents
federal
agencies
from
issuing
these
costly,
complex,
and
ineffective
regulations
by
requiring
approval
from
Congress.
I&#8217;ve
also
supported
the
&#8220;Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Permitting
Reform
Act,&#8221;
which
speeds
up
the
process
of
creating
pipelines
just
like
the
Keystone
Pipeline,
to
take
advantage
of
America&#8217;s
natural
gas
boom. This
will
create
tens
of
thousands
of
American
jobs
and
a
major
boost
to
the
economy,
bringing
us
closer
to
energy
independence.
Less
take-home
pay,
higher
health
care
costs,
and
more
broken
promises
are
not
what
hardworking
Americans
deserve.
They
deserve
real

This

which
is
hurting
American
families
and
making
it

for
small

I
continue
to

for

As
a

it
is
of
great
importance
to
me
to
make

I&#8217;ve

Last

America&#8217;s

that
promote
economic

and
ensure
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
have
the

That&#8217;s
why
I
voted
for
the
Veterans
Economic
Opportunity
Act.
The
bills
I
discussed
are
just
a
few
of
dozens
of
bills
that
my
colleagues
and
I
in
the

have
passed
that
now
sit
on
Senate
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
desk
awaiting
action
in
the
United

I
will

COLA
Congressman

joined
his
colleague
Rep.
William
Enyart
in

the
reduction
of
the
cost
of
living

in
military
retiree
pay
by
one
percent
beginning
in
2015.
In
a
letter
sent
to
House
Armed
Services
leadership,
Congressman
Cook
urged
the
restoration
of
benefits
to
all
military
retirees
in
next
year&#8217;s
National
Defense
Authorization
Act. Below
is
an
excerpt
of
the
letter
he
wrote:
Congressman
Cook
Cosponsors
Child
Protection
Enhancement
Act
of
2014
Congressman
Cook
has
signed
on
as
an
original
cosponsor
to
H.R.
3923,
the
&#8220;Child
Protection
Enhancement
Act
of
2014.&#8221;
This
legislation
would
provide
child
welfare
agencies
with
access
to
the
FBI&#8217;s
national
criminal
information
databases
to
conduct
background
checks
for
accelerated
foster
care
placement.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;One
of
my
primary
concerns
with
foster
care
is
ensuring
that
children
be
placed
into
a
safe
environment.
There
is
currently
no
internal
system
where
an
official
can
conduct
a
background
check
into
potential
families.
"There
are
over
420,000
children
in
the
foster
care
system,
and
30,000
of
them
exit
the
system
every
year
without
finding
a
permanent
family.
Currently,
agencies
can&#8217;t
access
criminal
databases
for
use
in
foster
care
placement.
This
delays
placement
and
hurts
children
who
suffer
from
extended
waiting
periods
due
to
bureaucratic
hurdles.
America&#8217;s
children
deserve
better.
&#8220;This
bill
fixes
the
problem
by
allowing
agencies
to
access
the
information
they
need
to
conduct
federal
background
checks
for
expedited
foster
care
placement.
The
worst
thing
we
can
do
is
put
a
child
in
an
unsafe
home
with
a
known
criminal.
My
priority
is
to
ensure
the
safety
of
these
children
and
give
them
a
real
chance
for
a
successful
future.&#8221;
