Dear Friends,
The 12th District is home to some of the bravest men and women in our military.
Every day, folks from very different walks of life put themselves in
harms way to protect the freedoms that you and I enjoy.
Not just today, but every day, we should thank our service members for the sacrifices they make on our behalf.
Im especially grateful to be spending this day with service members in our region.
From our troops at the VA in Augusta to the men and women recovering at our facilities in Laurens County, weve got a lot of brave Americans that need our help right here at home.
This year, after years of hard work, we were able to open an outpatient VA clinic in Statesboro to make it easier for our veterans to get the care they need.
Often times, it was too difficult for them to make the long trek for a simple doctors appointment.
This new facility is using state-of-the-art technology to get them answers to common medical questions.
Im proud to have worked with folks at every level of government to bring this facility to the folks who need it.
In Congress, there are debates going on regarding nearly every issue, but our standing obligation is to provide for the men and women whove given this country the best years of their lives.
I hope youll join me in thanking these service members and their families for all theyve done for us.
You can participate in a Veterans Day activity in our district or simply send a note to the folks who are housed in one of our facilities.
Ill be spending my day visiting with veterans in our district, and as Im traveling, if we happen to cross paths, please dont hesitate to say hello.
And as always, please dont hesitate to contact me if I can be of any help.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
