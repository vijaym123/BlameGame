------- Original Message ------- Here&rsquo;s the bad (okay, AWFUL) news:
Ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling is pounding the Illinois airwaves with a brutally dishonest ad smearing Cheri&rsquo;s record. Here&rsquo;s the good (okay, AMAZING) news:
National news outlets including
USA Today
just reported that Schilling&rsquo;s ad is &ldquo;shamefully misleading&rdquo; and that Cheri&rsquo;s &ldquo;being hammered for doing the right thing.&rdquo; Here the bottom line:
We&rsquo;ve got to get the facts out to Illinois voters
-- before the lies take hold.
Otherwise, we might never recover.
