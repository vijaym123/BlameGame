National Small Business
Week
This week marks the
51st annual National Small Business Week, which is a time to celebrate
the contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being of
America.
North Missouri, like the rest of the nation, depends on the
strength of our middle class families that rely on small businesses
to put food on the table.
Small businesses afford us the Missouri
way of life, and its something worth fighting for.
People are surprised to learn that 7 out of 10
new jobs come from small businesses. These companies are the backbone
of our economy and the communities they serve. However, these
businesses and their employees are facing a barrage of regulations making it
difficult to create new jobs and economic growth across the
country.
Whether its trying to regulate
farm dust or restricting our home heating options - it is more clear
than ever that our federal government is out on control.
If we
want businesses to do better, if we want farmers to do better, and if we
want the majority of Americans to be prosperous then we need to get
the government off our backs and out of our pocketbooks.
During Small Business Week, I am conducting
a
Small Business &amp; Middle Class Relief
Forum
with area business leaders in several Sixth District communities. The
question and answer events will feature discussion on ways to provide
relief from overbearing government regulations which are burdening our
small businesses, farmers, and families.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
