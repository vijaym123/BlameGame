Jeb Bush&rsquo;s latest target? Our seniors.
This week, he announced a plan to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70. That&rsquo;s UNACCEPTABLE.
And Jeb isn&rsquo;t alone. Many Republican presidential candidates are promising to GUT Social Security as part of their platform. We can't let that happen.
