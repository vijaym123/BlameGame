Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving! Carol, the girls and I
celebrated with family and friends, giving thanks for our blessings,
volunteering to help those in need, and reflecting on the history and
meaning of this special holiday.
While we celebrate Thanksgiving Day by pausing to give thanks for all
our blessings and for our great nation, there is no way to fully
express our gratitude to the men and women of our Armed Forces who
celebrated Thanksgiving far away from their families while serving
America.
We are also so thankful for all those who have served our country, kept
us safe, and promoted freedom around the world, and for those who gave
their lives in defense of this country, never to be forgotten. It is
because of their sacrifice that Americans were able to gather around
the table this year to celebrate Thanksgiving with their family,
friends and loved ones.
I remain thankful and humbled by the privilege to serve the people of
central and eastern Kentucky in Congress. I will continue to listen to
you and fight for commonsense policies that promote economic growth so
we can get our economy back on track, our financial house in order and
Kentuckians back to work.
Promoting Our Signature Bourbon Industry
On Monday, the Sixth District hosted Lithuanian Ambassador Zygimantas
Pavilionis and a delegation of Lithuanian officials. I am pleased that
Ambassador Pavilionis accepted my invitation to visit Kentucky and our
world-famous Kentucky Bourbon Trail in order to learn more about our
signature bourbon industry.
It is important that we foster and grow these types of trade
relationships in order to promote all of Kentucky's signature
industries. Thank you to the Ambassador and his guests for supporting a
strong relationship between Kentucky and the great people of Lithuania,
to the distilleries who showed the Ambassador how our bourbon is made,
and to Commerce Lexington for their help in organizing the day.
Casework Corner - Helping A Hero
This Thanksgiving, among the many things for which I am thankful is the
ability to help Kentuckians who are struggling. This week, a Fayette
County veteran's mother called to thank my office for our help in
securing the correct treatment for her son. This brave veteran suffers
from extreme Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and reached out to
our office looking for help with the Veterans Administration (VA). His
mother felt that he was not receiving the right type of treatments and
was simply slipping through the cracks of the system. One of her
biggest concerns was that she was afraid her son could potentially
become suicidal.
After working closely with the vet and his mother, we were able to
facilitate a productive conversation with the VA patient advocate,
which resulted in the veteran now seeing a new physician who is better
qualified to treat PTSD and most importantly, ensure that he receives
the correct treatment he more than deserves.
His mother told us that she believes the VA would've let this go
unnoticed if it weren't for our actions, and she strongly believes she
has her son with her for the holidays because we were able to raise
this case with the VA.
If you or anyone you know is having trouble navigating the federal
government bureaucracy, my office is ready to help
. Whenever we can be of
service, or if you have questions or comments about our federal
government, please contact my offices or visit us during our monthly
office hours in your county
.
Furthermore, I encourage veterans and active service members in the
Sixth District of Kentucky to get involved with my Veterans Coalition
so we can continue to
work together to help members of the military, their family, and
friends.

Around the District
This week I visited the Community Action Council's facility in
Lexington. It was great to tour the facility, meet the children and
members of the staff, and learn about their mission and all they do for
families in central Kentucky. I was also glad to be able to deliver
news that our efforts to assist were successful, helping the CAC
continue to deliver their much needed services. Thanks to the CAC for
all the hard work and steadfast dedication to our community!
On Monday, I enjoyed meeting the folks at Citizens Guaranty Bank, a
small Irvine bank that really makes a difference in its community.
I had a great discussion about rural healthcare issues with the
dedicated Marcum and Wallace Memorial Hospital employees in Irvine.
What a warm reception from the Veteran residents at Irvine
Rehabilitation Center in Estill County. I was honored to present the
facility with a United States flag.
While in Estill County, I was very honored to meet one of the Sixth
District's newest residents, Mr. Jacob Westra, a World War II Veteran
who was part of the Omaha Normandy Beach Invasion, and thank this
member of the "greatest generation" for his service and sacrifice.
Thanks to University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto and the folks
at the UK Center for Applied Energy Research for an informative tour of
their facilities and an update on their program's research efforts that
focus on the optimal use of Kentucky coal and our nation's energy
resources.
I was also glad to visit the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and
appreciate hearing their perspective on ways we can make our signature
equine industry even better.
And on Wednesday, I enjoyed my visit to UPS in Lexington just before
their busy season begins!
Saturday evening, I was honored to present the winning Big Blue Crush
Blood Drive trophy to the University of Kentucky at the football game!
Way to go, #BBN! Kentuckians won the challenge for the fourth year in a
row, giving over 3,600 blood donations benefitting the Big Blue Crush!
Most importantly, the blood drive will help ensure that patients in
both Kentucky and Tennessee have enough blood available for needed
transfusions throughout the holiday season. Thanks to everyone who
participated, and to the folks at the Kentucky Blood Center for their
hard work and dedication to saving lives.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and also feel free to forward my weekly
newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.

Dear

I
hope
you

While

by

there
is
no

to
fully
express
our

to
the
men

women
of
our
Armed
Forces
who
celebrated
Thanksgiving
far
away
from
their
families
while
serving
America.
We
are
also
so
thankful
for
all
those
who
have
served
our

kept

freedom
around
the

and
for

Helping
A
Hero
This
Thanksgiving,
among
the
many
things
for
which
I
am
thankful
is
the
ability to
help
Kentuckians
who
are
struggling.
This
week,
a
Fayette
County
veteran&#8217;s
mother
called
to
thank
my
office
for
our
help
in
securing
the
correct
treatment
for
her
son.
This
brave
veteran
suffers
from
extreme
Post
Traumatic
Stress
Disorder
(PTSD)
and
reached
out
to
our
office
looking
for
help
with
the
Veterans
Administration
(VA).
His
mother
felt
that
he
was
not
receiving
the
right
type
of
treatments
and
was
simply
slipping
through
the
cracks
of
the
system.
One
of
her
biggest
concerns
was
that
she
was
afraid
her
son
could
potentially
become
suicidal.
After
working
closely
with
the
vet
and
his
mother,
we
were
able
to
facilitate
a
productive
conversation
with
the
VA
patient
advocate,
which
resulted
in
the
veteran
now
seeing
a
new
physician
who
is
better
qualified
to
treat
PTSD
and
most
importantly,
ensure
that
he
receives
the
correct
treatment
he
more
than
deserves.
His
mother
told
us
that
she
believes
the
VA
would&#8217;ve
let
this
go
unnoticed
if
it
weren&#8217;t
for
our
actions,
and
she
strongly
believes
she
has
her
son
with
her
for
the
holidays
because
we
were
able
to raise
this
case
with
the
VA.
If
you
or
anyone
you
know
is
having
trouble
navigating
the
federal
government
bureaucracy,
my
office
is
ready
to
help .
Whenever
we
can
be
of
service,
or
if
you
have
questions
or
comments
about
our
federal
government,
please
contact
my
offices
or
visit
us
during
our
monthly
office
hours
in
your
county .
Furthermore,
I
encourage
veterans
and
active
service
members
in
the
Sixth
District
of
Kentucky
to
get
involved
with
my
Veterans
Coalition
so
we
can
continue
to
work
together
to
help
members
of
the
military,
their
family,
and
friends.

the

This
week
I
visited
the
Community
Action
Council's
facility
in
Lexington.
It
was
great
to
tour
the
facility,
meet
the
children
and
members
of
the
staff,
and
learn
about
their
mission
and
all
they
do
for
families
in
central
Kentucky.
I
was
also
glad
to
be
able
to
deliver
news
that
our
efforts
to
assist
were
successful,
helping
the
CAC
continue
to
deliver
their
much
needed
services. Thanks
to
the
CAC
for
all
the
hard
work
and
steadfast
dedication
to
our
community!
On
Monday,
I
enjoyed
meeting
the
folks
at
Citizens
Guaranty
Bank,
a
small
Irvine
bank
that
really
makes
a
difference
in
its
community.
I
had
a
great
discussion
about
rural
healthcare
issues
with
the
dedicated
Marcum
and
Wallace
Memorial
Hospital
employees
in
Irvine.
What
a
warm

from
the
Veteran
residents
at
Irvine
Rehabilitation
Center
in
Estill
County.
I
was
honored
to
present
the
facility
with
a
United
States
flag.
While
in
Estill
County,
I
was
very
honored
to
meet
one
of
the
Sixth

newest
residents,
Mr.
Jacob
Westra,
a
World
War

Veteran
who
was
part
of
the
Omaha
Normandy
Beach
Invasion, and
thank
this
member
of
the
"greatest

for
his
service
and
sacrifice.
Thanks
to
University
of
Kentucky
President
Eli
Capilouto
and
the
folks
at
the
UK
Center
for

Research
for
an

I
was
also

Kentucky

Commission
and
appreciate
hearing
their
perspective
on
ways
we
can
make
our

And
on
Wednesday,
I
enjoyed
my
visit
to
UPS
in
Lexington
just
before
their
busy
season
begins!
Saturday
evening,
I
was
honored
to
present
the
winning
Big
Blue
Crush
Blood

to
the
University

the

game!
Way
