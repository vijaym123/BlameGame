Supreme Court Stands Up for the Rule of
Law
6/26/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement on two Supreme Court decisions. First, the Supreme
Court ruled unanimously in the
NLRB v. Noel Canning
case that
President Obama made illegal recess appointments to the National Labor
Relations Board in January 2012. The Supreme Court stated that the
Senate was not truly in a recess when the appointments were made;
thereby overruling the President's assertion that he had made legal recess
appointments. Second, in what was also a unanimous opinion, the Supreme
Court struck down a Massachusetts law that set a 35-foot buffer zone
around abortion clinics, saying it violates the First Amendment.
Today the
Supreme
Court delivered a victory for the Rule of Law and affirmed Freedom of
Speech.
The unanimous decision in the NLRB v. Noel Canning
decision rejected President Obamas clear abuse of his constitutional
authority.
In light of the Obama Administrations unlawful use of
the recess appointment authority, many of the rulings by the NLRB could
potentially be overturned after todays decision. I applaud the
Supreme Court for this ruling, and also for the similarly unanimous decision
in McCullen v. Coakley. These decisions are big wins for the First
Amendment.
The law in Massachusetts setting a 35-foot buffer
around abortion clinics was clearly a law designed by pro-abortion
legislators to suppress the free speech rights of pro-life advocates. These
steps by the Supreme Court are a much needed correction to this
President's pattern of going beyond the
law.
