Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
I hope everyone is enjoying 2014. I wish all of our northern brethren
the best of luck in getting through what appears to be a brutal winter.
As the new year kicks off in Congress, I thought it would be helpful to
provide this overview of the work of the House Committees on Oversight
& Government Reform, Judiciary and Foreign Affairs (the committees on
which I serve) during 2013.
I am highlighting some of the work of the full committees as well as
the various subcommittees to which I am assigned, which are: Economic
Growth, Job Creation & Regulatory Affairs (OGR); Federal Workforce,
Postal Service & the Census (OGR); the Constitution & Civil Courts
(Judiciary);Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet(Judiciary);
the Middle East & North Africa (Foreign Affairs); and the Western
Hemisphere (Foreign Affairs).
Committee on Oversight & Government Reform
1.
Government Waste and Fraud. Most Americans recognize that
government wastes taxpayer dollars, but the extent of the waste and
serial mismanagement of the bureaucracy is truly eye-opening. At
various points in the year, the Committee uncovered evidence of : (i)
the improper use of taxpayer money to finance lavish conferences for
government employees; (ii) the large number of programs that are
duplicative of other existing programs; (iii) the failure of government
to implement recommendations of department inspector generals designed
to curtail the waste of taxpayer dollars; (iv) the waste of hundreds of
millions of dollars by the Department Energy to finance
government-picked private companies; and (v) the wasting of hundreds of
millions of dollars to design a health care website that did not work.
2.
The 9/11/2012 terror attack in Benghazi. The Committee heard
riveting testimony from State Department officials who were in Libya
during the 9/11/2012 attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi. The
testimony established that the attack was a pre-planned act of
terrorism, that the security in Benghazi leading up to the attack was
grossly inadequate, that military assets were not effectively
marshalled in support of Americans on the ground, that the attacks were
not the result of a spontaneous demonstration caused by reaction to a
video critical of Islam, and that the Obama administration misled the
American people in the aftermath of the attacks.
3.
The IRS. The admission by IRS officials that the agency
improperly targeted conservative groups prompted a much needed
examination into what is clearly a broken institution. While the Obama
administration initially conceded that misuse of the government's
taxing power is a serious threat to freedom, the administration's
position now seems to be that the admitted IRS misconduct is simply a
"phony" scandal. This posture has resulted in the Committee getting
stonewalled and exactly zero individuals held accountable for the
illicit targeting. In addition to targeting Americans based on their
political beliefs, the Committee demonstrated that: (i) the IRS
hectored citizens about their religious beliefs, even asking citizens
to list the "content" of their prayers in applications for tax
exemptions; (ii) the IRS spent millions of dollars in taxpayer money to
pay for posh hotel rooms and expensive conferences, including spending
thousands of dollars making a Star Trek parody video for one of the
conferences; (iii) an IRS official diverted millions of dollars in
lucrative government contracts to a friend (the IRS official pled the
Fifth Amendment rather than answer the Committee's questions); and (iv)
the IRS has a vast amount of power and discretion to police the
American health care system under the 2010 ObamaCare law.
4.
ObamaCare. The Committee conducted full spectrum oversight of
the launch, implementation and consequences of ObamaCare. Areas of
inquiry included: (i) the administration's reckless decision to launch
HealthCare.Gov without adequate security controls or system testing;
(ii) the problematic implementation of the program writ large; (iii)
the strong link between the IRS and the ObamaCare bureaucracy; (iv) how
ObamaCare is fueling increases in insurance premiums; (v) ObamaCare's
effect on access to affordable health insurance in rural communities;
and (vi) the deceptions used to justify passage of ObamaCare, such as
the false promise that Americans would be able to keep their plans.
5.
Governmental Failures.
Government programs often times fail to
achieve their stated objective and can even make the problems they seek
to address even worse.
As the Vice-Chairman of the Economic Growth
Subcommittee of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I
initiated a hearing to explore the negative effects that legislation
like the Dodd-Frank banking regulation bill have had on small,
community banks.
Dodd-Frank was supposedly created to rein in the
excesses of large investment banks.
Instead, the bill has hit smaller
banks hardest, because they don't have the army of lawyers necessary to
navigate the maze of onerous new regulations it imposes.
During the
hearing, we heard testimony from a St. Augustine community banker and
others regarding the negative effects of this act on small banks, and
the small businesses, and individuals they lend to.
The committee has
also examined mismanagement and wasteful conference spending at the
Department of Veterans Affairs as well as investigations in to green
energy boondoggles such as the over $500 million loan by the Department
of Energy to now bankrupt Fisker Automotive.
Committee on the Judiciary
1.
Oversight of Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of
Justice. Attorney General Holder testified before the Committee about a
broad range of subjects related to the DOJ, including the Fast and
Furious scandal, the investigation into the Benghazi suspects, the
targeting of journalists for prosecution, and the IRS targeting
scandal. In response to Attorney General Holder's misleading testimony,
the Committee issued a report
that highlighted the inconsistencies
in Holder's testimony. By my lights, Holder was not honest with the
Committee and has consistently placed the political interests of the
administration above the pursuit of justice. Because of this, I called
on Holder to resign from office and believe that he is an impediment to
the reform of government and accountability in the executive branch.
2.
The President's duty to Take Care that the Laws be Faithfully
Executed. The Committee examined President Obama's decisions to
suspend, delay and disregard key provisions of federal law, most
conspicuously with respect to his own health care law. The President
cannot simply pick and choose which provisions of the law to enforce
and which to ignore. The Constitution vests Congress with the power to
make laws; if the President does not like a particular provision of
law, the proper remedy is to seek a legislative change to that
provision, not to simply ignore it.
3.
Oversight of the National Security Apparatus. The Committee
examined the constitutionality of using drones against U.S. targets,
the use of FISA authorities to collect foreign intelligence, and the
scope of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which is being used to justify
the bulk collection of telephone records. I expect the House to
consider legislative reforms in this area during 2014.
4.
Litigation abuses. The Committee highlighted (i) the costs
associated with excessive litigation and the effect those costs have on
American economic competitiveness, (ii) examples of abusive litigation
practices, and (iii) how bogus patent infringement claims are used by
so-called "patent trolls" to extort settlement payments. These hearings
yielded two bills - both of which passed the full House - that will
help protect against frivolous claims and the costs such claims impose.
5.
Immigration and border security. The Committee passed four bills
dealing with immigration: (i) a bill establishing an E-Verify system to
ensure a legal workforce; (ii) a bill authorizing state and local law
enforcement to engage in interior enforcement of laws against illegal
immigration; (iii) a bill abolishing the so-called "diversity" visa
lottery and converting those visas to merit-based visas for
high-skilled workers in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics; (iv) and a bill reforming the program for agricultural
guest workers. The Committee also examined the numerous and substantial
flaws in the 1,200 page Gang of 8 bill passed by the Senate, the
government's failure to institute a functional entry-exit visa system,
and the abuse of asylum claims by those entering the country illegally.
Committee on Foreign Affairs
1.
Civil War in Syria. The terrible conflict in Syria pits the
dictatorship of Basar al-Assad (backed by Hezbollah and Iran) against
"rebels" that include Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups as well as
fighters affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Committee heard
from Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel,
and General Martin Dempsey about the administration's plan to strike
the Assad regime in response to Assad's use of poison gas. The
administration failed to outline a clear objective and a plan to
achieve that objective; because of this, support for the mission in
Congress collapsed.
2.
Iran, nuclear weapons and terrorism. The Committee examined the
pursuit of nuclear weapons by the Iranian regime, the interim agreement
pursued by the Obama administration with Iran, and the Iranian regime's
sponsorship of terrorism around the world. The Committee also inquired
into the views and disposition of the new Iranian President, Hassan
Rouhani, who was characterized as a "moderate" by the elite media in
the United States but who, on closer inspection, is a loyal follower of
Ayatollah Khomenei and seeks the destruction of Israel and the United
States. Finally, the Committee examined the case of Pastor Saeed
Abedini, a U.S. citizen, who has been unjustly detained by the Iranian
government due to the fact that he converted from Islam to
Christianity.
3.
Rogue Regimes: North Korea and Cuba. Nearly 25 years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, these two Stalinist countries continue to
repress their people and finance their regimes through criminal
conduct. North Korea is a totalitarian society that oppresses its
people and denies them basic individual freedoms. The regime finances
its oppression through a number of illicit avenues - avenues that the
Committee is seeking to shut down via legislation. The Castro brothers
have ruled Cuba for decades in accordance with Marxist principles that
have long been discredited. They continue to oppress their own people
and are currently unjustly detaining American contractor Alan Gross.
4.
Terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa. The Committee
heard testimony about the proliferation of terrorism and Islamist
fighters throughout the region. This includes post-Gaddafi Libya, which
gave rise to the Benghazi terror attack on 9/11/2012, as well as other
areas of North Africa, such as Mali. The conflict in Syria has served
as a magnet for Al Qaeda-aligned jihadists and Muslim
Brotherhood-affiliated fighters. Iraq has seen a huge resurgence in Al
Qaeda fighters, especially in places like Fallujah and Ramadi. Of
course, terror attacks continue to be launched against Israel by Hamas
in the Gaza Strip.
5.
Iraq and Afghanistan.
The Committee examined the political and
military environments in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This included several
hearings and meetings with administration officials and outside
representatives on the way forward in Afghanistan as well as the
current status of U.S.-Afghanistan bilateral security agreement
negotiations. The situation in Afghanistan is tenuous and the status of
our troops there post-2014 is unknown due to disagreements with Afghan
President Karzai. The continued breakout of violence and lack of
control in territories in Iraq to a resurgent Al-Qaeda has the
potential to degrade further and place US interests and security in
question as well as the stability of the entire region.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
I
hope
everyone
is
enjoying
2014. I
wish
all
of
our
northern
brethren
the
best
of
luck
in
getting
through
what
appears
to
be
a
brutal
winter. As
the
new
year
kicks
off
in
Congress,
I
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
provide
this
overview
of
the
work
of
the
House
Committees
on
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform,
Judiciary
and
Foreign
Affairs
(the
committees
on
which
I
serve)
during
2013.
I
am
highlighting
some
of
the
work
of
the
full
committees
as
well
as
the
various
subcommittees
to
which
I
am

which
are:

Committee
on
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform
1.
Government
Waste
and
Fraud . Most
Americans
recognize
that
government
wastes
taxpayer
dollars,
but
the
extent
of
the
waste
and
serial
mismanagement
of
the
bureaucracy
is
truly
eye-opening. At
various
points
in
the
year,
the
Committee
uncovered
evidence
of
:
(i)
the
improper
use
of
taxpayer
money
to
finance
lavish
conferences
for
government
employees;
(ii)
the
large
number
of
programs
that
are
duplicative
of
other
existing
programs;
(iii)
the
failure
of
government
to
implement
recommendations
of
department
inspector
generals
designed
to
curtail
the
waste
of
taxpayer
dollars;
(iv)
the
waste
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
by
the
Department
Energy
to
finance
government-picked
private
companies;
and
(v)
the
wasting
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
design
a
health
care
website
that
did
not
work.
2.
The
9/11/2012
terror
attack
in
Benghazi . The
Committee
heard
riveting
testimony
from
State
Department
officials
who
were
in
Libya
during
the
9/11/2012
attack
on
U.S.
facilities
in
Benghazi. The
testimony
established
that
the
attack
was
a
pre-planned
act
of
terrorism,
that
the
security
in
Benghazi
leading
up
to
the
attack
was
grossly
inadequate,
that
military
assets
were
not
effectively
marshalled
in
support
of
Americans
on
the
ground,
that
the
attacks
were
not
the
result
of
a
spontaneous
demonstration
caused
by
reaction
to
a
video
critical
of
Islam,
and
that
the
Obama
administration
misled
the
American
people
in
the
aftermath
of
the
attacks.
3.
The
IRS . The
admission
by
IRS
officials
that
the
agency
improperly
targeted
conservative
groups
prompted
a
much
needed
examination
into
what
is
clearly
a
broken
institution. While
the
Obama
administration
initially
conceded
that
misuse
of
the
government&#8217;s
taxing
power
is
a
serious
threat
to
freedom,
the
administration&#8217;s
position
now
seems
to
be
that
the
admitted
IRS
misconduct
is
simply
a
&#8220;phony&#8221;
scandal. This
posture
has
resulted
in
the
Committee
getting
stonewalled
and
exactly
zero
individuals
held
accountable
for
the
illicit
targeting. In
addition
to
targeting
Americans
based
on
their
political
beliefs,
the
Committee
demonstrated
that:
(i)
the
IRS
hectored
citizens
about
their
religious
beliefs,
even
asking
citizens
to
list
the
&#8220;content&#8221;
of
their
prayers
in
applications
for
tax
exemptions;
(ii)
the
IRS
spent
millions
of
dollars
in
taxpayer
money
to
pay
for
posh
hotel
rooms
and
expensive
conferences,
including
spending
thousands
of
dollars
making
a
Star
Trek
parody
video
for
one
of
the
conferences;
(iii)
an
IRS
official
diverted
millions
of
dollars
in
lucrative
government
contracts
to
a
friend
(the
IRS
official
pled
the
Fifth
Amendment
rather
than
answer
the
Committee&#8217;s
questions);
and
(iv)
the
IRS
has
a
vast
amount
of
power
and
discretion
to
police
the
American
health
care
system
under
the
2010
ObamaCare
law.
4.
ObamaCare . The
Committee
conducted
full
spectrum
oversight
of
the
launch,
implementation
and
consequences
of
ObamaCare. Areas
of
inquiry
included:
(i)
the
administration&#8217;s
reckless
decision
to
launch
HealthCare.Gov
without
adequate
security
controls
or
system
testing;
(ii)
the
problematic
implementation
of
the
program
writ
large;
(iii)
the
strong
link
between
the
IRS
and
the
ObamaCare
bureaucracy;
(iv)
how
ObamaCare
is
fueling
increases
in
insurance
premiums;
(v)
ObamaCare&#8217;s
effect
on
access
to
affordable
health
insurance
in
rural
communities;
and
(vi)
the
deceptions
used
to
justify
passage
of
ObamaCare,
such
as
the
false
promise
that
Americans
would
be
able
to
keep
their
plans.
5.
Governmental
Failures .
Government
programs
often
times
fail
to
achieve
their
stated
objective
and
can
even
make
the
problems
they
seek
to
address
even
worse.
As
the
Vice-Chairman
of
the
Economic
Growth
Subcommittee
of
the
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee,
I
initiated
a
hearing
to
explore
the
negative
effects
that
legislation
like
the
Dodd-Frank
banking
regulation
bill
have
had
on
small,
community
banks.
Dodd-Frank
was
supposedly
created
to
rein
in
the
excesses
of
large
investment
banks.
Instead,
the
bill
has
hit
smaller
banks
hardest,
because
they
don&#8217;t
have
the
army
of
lawyers
necessary
to
navigate
the
maze
of
onerous
new
regulations
it
imposes.
During
the
hearing,
we
heard
testimony
from
a
St.
Augustine
community
banker
and
others
regarding
the
negative
effects
of
this
act
on
small
banks,
and
the
small
businesses,
and
individuals
they
lend
to.
The
committee
has
also
examined
mismanagement
and
wasteful
conference
spending
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
as
well
as
investigations
in
to
green
energy
boondoggles
such
as
the
over
$500
million
loan
by
the
Department
of
Energy
to
now
bankrupt
Fisker
Automotive.
Committee
on
the
Judiciary
1.
Oversight
of
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
and
the
Department
of
Justice . Attorney
General
Holder
testified
before
the
Committee
about
a
broad
range
of
subjects
related
to
the
DOJ,
including
the
Fast
and
Furious
scandal,
the
investigation
into
the
Benghazi
suspects,
the
targeting
of
journalists
for
prosecution,
and
the
IRS
targeting
scandal. In
response
to
Attorney
General
Holder&#8217;s
misleading
testimony,
the
Committee
issued
a
report
that
highlighted
the
inconsistencies
in
Holder&#8217;s
testimony. By
my
lights,
Holder
was
not
honest
with
the
Committee
and
has
consistently
placed
the
political
interests
of
the
administration
above
the
pursuit
of
justice. Because
of
this,
I
called
on
Holder
to
resign
from
office
and
believe
that
he
is
an
impediment
to
the
reform
of
government
and
accountability
in
the
executive
branch.
2.
The
President&#8217;s
duty
to
Take
Care
that
the
Laws
be
Faithfully
Executed . The
Committee
examined
President
Obama&#8217;s
decisions
to
suspend,
delay
and
disregard
key
provisions
of
federal
law,
most
conspicuously
with
respect
to
his
own
health
care
law. The
President
cannot
simply
pick
and
choose
which
provisions
of
the
law
to
enforce
and
which
to
ignore. The
Constitution
vests
Congress
with
the
power
to
make
laws;
if
the
President
does
not
like
a
particular
provision
of
law,
the
proper
remedy
is
to
seek
a
legislative
change
to
that
provision,
not
to
simply
ignore
it.
3.
Oversight
of
the
National
Security
Apparatus . The
Committee
examined
the
constitutionality
of
using
drones
against
U.S.
targets,
the
use
of
FISA
authorities
to
collect
foreign
intelligence,
and
the
scope
of
Section
215
of
the
PATRIOT
Act,
which
is
being
used
to
justify
the
bulk
collection
of
telephone
records. I
expect
the
House
to
consider
legislative
reforms
in
this
area
during
2014.
4.
Litigation
abuses . The
Committee
highlighted
(i)
the
costs
associated
with
excessive
litigation
and
the
effect
those
costs
have
on
American
economic
competitiveness,
(ii)
examples
of
abusive
litigation
practices,
and
(iii)
how
bogus
patent
infringement
claims
are
used
by
so-called
&#8220;patent
trolls&#8221;
to
extort
settlement
payments. These
hearings
yielded
two
bills
&#8211;
both
of
which
passed
the
full
House
&#8211;
that
will
help
protect
against
frivolous
claims
and
the
costs
such
claims
impose.
5.
Immigration
and
border
security . The
Committee
passed
four
bills
dealing
with
immigration:
(i)
a
bill
establishing
an
E-Verify
system
to
ensure
a
legal
workforce;
(ii)
a
bill
authorizing
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
engage
in
interior
enforcement
of
laws
against
illegal
immigration;
(iii)
a
bill
abolishing
the
so-called
&#8220;diversity&#8221;
visa
lottery
and
converting
those
visas
to
merit-based
visas
for
high-skilled
workers
in
science,
technology,
engineering
and
mathematics;
(iv)
and
a
bill
reforming
the
program
for
agricultural
guest
workers. The
Committee
also
examined
the
numerous
and
substantial
flaws
in
the
1,200
page
Gang
of
8
bill
passed
by
the
Senate,
the
government&#8217;s
failure
to
institute
a
functional
entry-exit
visa
system,
and
the
abuse
of
asylum
claims
by
those
entering
the
country
illegally.
Committee
on
Foreign
Affairs
1.
Civil
War
in
Syria . The
terrible
conflict
in
Syria
pits
the
dictatorship
of
Basar
al-Assad
(backed
by
Hezbollah
and
Iran)
against
&#8220;rebels&#8221;
that
include
Al
Qaeda-affiliated
terrorist
groups
as
well
as
fighters
affiliated
with
the
Muslim
Brotherhood. The
Committee
heard
from
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry,
Secretary
of
Defense
Chuck
Hagel,
and
General
Martin
Dempsey
about
the
administration&#8217;s
plan
to
strike
the
Assad
regime
in
response
to
Assad&#8217;s
use
of
poison
gas. The
administration
failed
to
outline
a
clear
objective
and
a
plan
to
achieve
that
objective;
because
of
this,
support
for
the
mission
in
Congress
collapsed.
2.
Iran,
nuclear
weapons
and
terrorism . The
Committee
examined
the
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
by
the
Iranian
regime,
the
interim
agreement
pursued
by
the
Obama
administration
with
Iran,
and
the
Iranian
regime&#8217;s
sponsorship
of
terrorism
around
the
world. The
Committee
also
inquired
into
the
views
and
disposition
of
the
new
Iranian
President,
Hassan
Rouhani,
who
was
characterized
as
a
&#8220;moderate&#8221;
by
the
elite
media
in
the
United
States
but
who,
on
closer
inspection,
is
a
loyal
follower
of
Ayatollah
Khomenei
and
seeks
the
destruction
of
Israel
and
the
United
States. Finally,
the
Committee
examined
the
case
of
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini,
a
U.S.
citizen,
who
has
been
unjustly
detained
by
the
Iranian
government
due
to
the
fact
that
he
converted
from
Islam
to
Christianity.
3.
Rogue
Regimes:
North
Korea
and
Cuba . Nearly
25
years
after
the
fall
of
the
Berlin
Wall,
these
two
Stalinist
countries
continue
to
repress
their
people
and
finance
their
regimes
through
criminal
conduct. North
Korea
is
a
totalitarian
society
that
oppresses
its
people
and
denies
them
basic
individual
freedoms. The
regime
finances
its
oppression
through
a
number
of
illicit
avenues
&#8211;
avenues
that
the
Committee
is
seeking
to
shut
down
via
legislation. The
Castro
brothers
have
ruled
Cuba
for
decades
in
accordance
with
Marxist
principles
that
have
long
been
discredited. They
continue
to
oppress
their
own
people
and
are
currently
unjustly
detaining
American
contractor
Alan
Gross.
4.
Terrorism
in
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa . The
Committee
heard
testimony
about
the
proliferation
of
terrorism
and
Islamist
fighters
throughout
the
region. This
includes
post-Gaddafi
Libya,
which
gave
rise
to
the
Benghazi
terror
attack
on
9/11/2012,
as
well
as
other
areas
of
North
Africa,
such
as
Mali. The
conflict
in
Syria
has
served
as
a
magnet
for
Al
Qaeda-aligned
jihadists
and
Muslim
Brotherhood-affiliated
fighters. Iraq
has
seen
a
huge
resurgence
in
Al
Qaeda
fighters,
especially
in
places
like
Fallujah
and
Ramadi. Of
course,
terror
attacks
continue
to
be
launched
against
Israel
by
Hamas
in
the
Gaza
Strip.
5.
Iraq
and
Afghanistan .
The
Committee
examined
the
political
and
military
environments
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan.
This
included
several
hearings
and
meetings
with
administration
officials
and
outside
representatives
on
the
way
forward
in
Afghanistan
as
well
as
the
current
status
of
U.S.-Afghanistan
bilateral
security
agreement
negotiations.
The
situation
in
Afghanistan
is
tenuous
and
the
status
of
our
troops
there
post-2014
is
unknown
due
to
disagreements
with
Afghan
President
Karzai.
The
continued
breakout
of
violence
and
lack
of
control
in
territories
in
Iraq
to
a
resurgent
Al-Qaeda
has
the
potential
to
degrade
further
and
place
US
interests
and
security
in
question
as
well
as
the
stability
of
the
entire
region.
