Friends,
Congress has passed its first balanced budget
since 2001. Over the past 5 years, Senate
Democrats have only passed one budget. Under our
new Republican leadership, the Senate was able to
achieve this goal within just 100 days.

YouTube)
This is a momentous occasionfor those of
us who believe in a constitutional, limited
government. This budget will balance in 10 years
without raising taxes on hardworking Utah
families, and without sacrificing our strong
national defense at a time when we need it more
than ever.
I still believe that a balanced budget
amendment, like the one I introduced in February,
is the best way to bring the cultural change of
fiscal discipline to Washington. I have
introduced seven balanced budget amendments in my
term of service, and Ronald Reagan once
introduced me at an event as Mr. Balanced
Budget.
Nevertheless, I believe this budget takes us
in the right direction. The real, lasting
solutions weve passed in this short time
show that Congress is back in the business of
responsible governance.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
