Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Just What The Doctor Ordered
At the invitation of Dr. Renee Adams, right, I spoke to the
Lawrenceville Rotary Club during a swing through the eastern part of my
district Thursday.
FEMA Rejection Letters Not Necessarily The End Of The Line
Illinois tornado survivors who registered for federal disaster
assistance may receive letters from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency that say they are ineligible for help. They can, however, turn
what appears to be a no into a yes.
Officials with agencies providing assistance to victims of last month's
storms address the crowd Thursday at a town hall meeting my staff
attended in Brookport that was organized by Acting Mayor Tom Souders.
Any constituents having questions or concerns about federal aid are
welcome to contact my office.
Survivors can ask FEMA to review their applications again if they
appeal the agency's decision within 60 days of receiving their letters.
FEMA cannot duplicate assistance that comes from insurance benefits or
other government sources, but FEMA's initial determination of
ineligibility may change if private insurance or other government
assistance is not enough to cover all the eligible damage.
Applicants should read their letters carefully because they provide
explanations of what steps need to be taken to change the status of
their request for assistance. Survivors can ask for another review to
appeal the amount or type of help provided or any other decision about
federal disaster assistance. Many issues can be resolved if applicants
follow up with updated information or documentation.
If applicants have any questions about appealing, they should call
800-621-FEMA (3362) or go online to FEMA.gov/Help-After-Disaster
. For the latest information on Illinois' recovery
from the November 17 storms, visit FEMA.gov/Disaster/4157
.
Car Damage: Anyone who had a car damaged or destroyed in counties
affected by the November 17 severe weather may be eligible for FEMA
assistance. Those who may be eligible include not just residents of the
designated counties, but also those who were working or visiting in
those areas and had damage to their vehicles during the tornadoes.
Registration can be done online at DisasterAssistance.gov
, by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362) or with a smartphone or
tablet at m.fema.gov.
Recovery Center Updates: FEMA has closed the Rantoul Disaster Recovery
Center, and the Brookport Disaster Recovery Center will no longer be
open on Sundays. The Brookport location's normal hours will be 8 a.m.
to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Holiday hours are 8 a.m. to noon on
Tuesday, December 24 and 12:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thursday, December 26.
The center will be closed on Christmas Day.
Local Government Aid Request: Illinois Governor Pat Quinn on Thursday
requested federal aid to help local governments in nine counties
recover from the November 17 storms. Counties included in the request
are Champaign, Douglas, Grundy, Massac, Tazewell, Vermilion,
Washington, Wayne and Woodford. I am joining the state's Congressional
delegation in asking the federal government for quick approval. If the
request is granted, local governments could receive reimbursement for
75 percent of eligible disaster-related costs, such as overtime, debris
removal and repair and replacement of damaged public property.
Legislation Introduced To Counter Growing Threat of 'Superbugs'
I have joined a bipartisan group of House Members as cosponsors of the
Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013
,
introduced by Congressmen Phil Gingrey, M.D. (R, Georgia-11) and Gene
Green (D, Texas-29). The legislation is a successor to the GAIN Act,
which was signed into law last year.
The ADAPT Act advances drug development in order to combat the growing
public health threat of "superbugs," which the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) warned of earlier this year.
Members recognized the need to get more life-saving antibiotics
available to the public and helped accomplish that goal by getting the
GAIN Act included in law. GAIN 2.0 looks to build on the successes we
have already seen as a result of our previous efforts by providing an
expedited pathway at the Food and Drug Administration for approval of
certain antibiotics while at the same time gathering valuable
information on the resistance of these drugs and how they are being
used.
Said Dr. Gingrey, "Since the GAIN Act was signed into law, it has
played an important role in restoring antibiotic development. The ADAPT
Act is an important next step in the effort to fight antimicrobial
resistance, and I'm grateful for Congressman Green's and my other
colleagues' efforts on this legislation. As a physician for more than
30 years, I understand the critical need for life-saving medical
treatments. The ADAPT Act provides incentives for investment and
innovation and is another step forward in developing treatments for
patients with antibiotic-resistant infections."
Announcements
Another Obamacare Surprise: Holiday surprises have sadly become routine
for the self-proclaimed "most transparent administration in history."
As we approach the Christmas holiday, the Obama Administration quietly
announced Thursday yet another major change
to its
signature health care law. A "hardship exemption" from the mandate to
purchase qualified insurance plans will be given to certain groups of
people who have had their current plans canceled because of Obamacare
regulations.
Energy Outlook: This past week, the Energy Information Administration
released its Annual Energy
Outlook. The agency forecasts that domestic supplies of oil and natural
gas will continue to increase as a result of advanced drilling
technologies, leading to reduced U.S. energy imports and the potential
for expanded U.S. energy exports. EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski
stated, "Growing domestic hydrocarbon production is also reducing our
net dependence on imported oil and benefiting the U.S. economy as
natural-gas-intensive industries boost their output."

Local
Government
Aid
Request :
Illinois
Governor
Pat
Quinn
on
Thursday
requested
federal
aid
to
help
local
governments
in
nine counties
recover
from
the
November
17
storms.
Counties
included
in
the
request
are
Champaign,
Douglas,
Grundy,
Massac,
Tazewell,
Vermilion,
Washington,
Wayne
and
Woodford.
I
am
joining
the state's
Congressional
delegation
in
asking
the
federal
government
for
quick
approval. If
the
request
is
granted,
local
governments
could
receive
reimbursement
for
75
percent
of
eligible

Legislation
Introduced
To
Counter
Growing
Threat
of
'Superbugs'
I
have joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
House
Members
as
cosponsors
of the
Antibiotic
Development
to
Advance
Patient
Treatment
(ADAPT)
Act
of
2013 ,
introduced
by
Congressmen
Phil
Gingrey,
M.D.
(R,
Georgia-11)
and
Gene
Green
(D,
Texas-29).
The
legislation
is
a
successor
to
the
GAIN
Act,
which
was signed
into
law
last
year.
The
ADAPT
Act
advances
drug
development
in
order
to
combat
the
growing
public
health
threat
of
&#8220;superbugs,&#8221;
which
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
warned
of
earlier
this
year.
Members
recognized
the
need
to
get
more
life-saving
antibiotics
available
to
the
public
and
helped
accomplish
that
goal
by
getting
the
GAIN
Act
included
in
law.
GAIN
2.0
looks
to
build
on
the
successes
we
have
already
seen
as
a
result
of
our
previous
efforts
by
providing
an
expedited
pathway
at
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
approval
of
certain
antibiotics
while
at
the
same
time
gathering
valuable
information
on
the
resistance
of
these
drugs
and
how
they
are
being
used.
Said
Dr. Gingrey,
"Since
the
GAIN
Act
was
signed
into
law,
it
has
played
an
important
role
in
restoring
antibiotic
development.
The
ADAPT
Act
is
an
important
next
step
in
the
effort
to
fight
antimicrobial
resistance,
and
I&#8217;m
grateful
for
Congressman
Green&#8217;s
and
my
other
colleagues&#8217;
efforts
on
this
legislation.
As
a
physician
for
more
than
30
years,
I
understand
the
critical
need
for
life-saving
medical
treatments.
The
ADAPT
Act
provides
incentives
for
investment
and
innovation
and
is
another
step
forward
in
developing
treatments
for
patients
with
antibiotic-resistant
infections.&#8221;
