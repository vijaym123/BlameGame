Friends,
Winston Churchill
once said,
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and
so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth
lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest
hour!
Churchill delivered these remarks at a time of great
uncertainty and apparent danger to the United States, the United Kingdom, and
other freedom loving democracies. He delivered a passionate plea to
his people in the face of immense risk to rally them around a cause he
knew to be noble and
just.
Today, however, this type of courageous
leadership by statesmen is
missing.
Over the past several years,
the world has operated in a leadership vacuum as a result of a
feckless foreign policy on behalf of the Obama Administration. Weve watched
as the Administration has taken a hands-off approach and bought into
the narrative that the world is a safer place. The facts simply do not
support that conclusion and
America cannot afford to take
that risk.
As the Washington Post Editorial Boardhardly a
frequent critic of the Presidentrecently stated, President Obama
has led a foreign policy based more on how he thinks the world should
operate than on
reality.
Escalating tensions in Eastern Europe, the
continued enrichment of uranium by rogue states like Iran and North Korea, a
civil war that has killed over 100,000 in Syria and tested the
veracity of the Presidents so-called red line, the splintering of core
Al-Qaeda into regional affiliates that have become increasingly
radicalized, a terrorist attack on our embassy in Benghazi which led to the
murder of four brave Americans including our Ambassador, escalation of
violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continued efforts of rising
economies to expand their military capabilities and push out their
boundaries leave little doubt that
America and her allies around
the world continue to face dangerous
times.
The events of
the past several weeks are the direct culmination of President Obamas
failed management of global affairs that has continuously undermined
our allies and emboldened our
enemies.
Russias invasion of
Ukraine is a clear breach of international law and completely
unacceptable. The United States must take swift action to provide financial
support for Ukraine to bolster their economy and transitional government
against the punitive actions by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Furthermore, the U.S. should send a clear message to Putin that
his brazen violation of Ukraines sovereignty will be met with a strong
response from the West that will cripple their economy and diminish
their standing in the
world.
The credibility of Americas
leadership is on the line.
While no one is beating the
drums of war and advocating that President Obama send in the Marines,
he must use the tools at his disposal and act swiftly and decisively
to reassert American power and raise the pressure on Vladimir
Putin.
Make no mistake, the United States is still the greatest country on
Earth and the worlds leading superpower.
But, if we do
fail to show strength, then similar actions by Iran, Russia, and
other authoritarian regimes around the globe will only spread and our
allies will continue to question our commitment to being the worlds
leading force for peace and stability.
At that point, it will hardly
be our finest
hour.
Until next
week,
Richard
