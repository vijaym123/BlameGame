Challenging the EPA over CTS Delays and
Negligence
On Wednesday, I challenged the Deputy
Administrator, Bob Perciasepe, of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) over the agency's incompetence handling the CTS spill in
Asheville. For more than two decades, this site has posed potentially
serious health risks to residents in the surrounding area. I will
continue to demand the EPA do its job and clean up this site once and for
all. You can watch a clip of my questioning

Discussing EPA Mismanagement on Fox News
with Greta Van Susteren
I went on Fox News'
On the Record with
Greta Van Susteren
to discuss complete mismanagement at the EPA.
This enormous federal bureaucracy is currently allowing waste,
fraud, and potentially criminal misconduct by its employees--and no one has
been fired. The American taxpayers who fund the EPA deserve better.

Meeting with WWII Veterans at the Navy
Memorial
At the Navy Memorial in Washington,
D.C.
With WWII Veterans who came to D.C. with Honor
Air.
Last weekend, Debbie and I greeted
WWII veterans who flew into D.C. with Honor Air to see the memorials
honoring their sacrifice. These brave men and women are American
heroes and I am grateful for their service.
Congressional Shoot-Out: Republicans Win,
Again!
This week, I
participated in the annual Congressional Shoot-Out. Debbie and I had a
great time with some of my Capitol Hill colleagues at Prince George's
County Trap and Skeet. Team Republicans once again beat out the
Democrats on the shooting range. On a more serious note: I know how
important protecting 2nd Amendment rights is to my constituents. I will
continue to support and fight for your right to keep and bear
arms.
Standing Up for Farmers, Brewers, and
Consumers
I recently published an op-ed in the
Hendersonville Times-News explaining my opposition to a proposed Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) rule that would hurt farmers, brewers, and
consumers in Western North Carolina. To the FDA, I say if were going
to regulate, lets not regulate just for regulations sake. You
can read my full op-ed
