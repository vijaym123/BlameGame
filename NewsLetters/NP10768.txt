Dear friend,
Following yesterday's event at
Franklin Regional High School, our community is coming together to help
one another, demonstrating our shared commitment to thrive in the face
of adversity. Part of that effort is finding the best methods to talk
about it within our families.
The National Child Traumatic
Stress Network, a research organization at Allegheny General Hospital
focused on child violence and trauma, has also put together useful
information at
Responding to a School Crisis .
This site has very useful background for educators, parents, and
community members.
Over the past two days, Ive been sharing
tips and guidance
on how to approach this topic
with students and children. As well, the National Institute of Mental
Health has helpful information that Ive included
below.
While we dont know all of the details at this point, what we do know is
that if we identify kids at risk, get to them early, help them with
medication and counseling, we can make a world of difference. Ill share
more about what Im working on in Congress, like my
Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act , in tomorrows
weekly email newsletter. Until then, if my office can be of assistance,
please do not hesitate to call me on (412)
344-5583.
Sincerely,
Tim Murphy
Member of

What Can Parents
Do To Help?
After
violence or disaster, parents and family members should identify and
address their own feelings
this will allow them to help others. Explain
to children what happened and let them
know:
You love
them
The event was not their
fault
You will do your best to take care of
them
Its okay for them to feel
upset.
Do:
Allow children to
cry
Allow
sadness
Let children talk about
feelings
Let them write about
feelings
Let them draw
pictures about the event or their
feelings.
Don't:
Expect children to be brave or
tough
Make children discuss the event
before they are ready
Get
angry if children show strong emotions
Get upset if they begin bedwetting, acting out, or
thumbsucking.
Other
tips:
If
children have trouble sleeping give them extra attention, let them sleep
with a light on, or let them sleep in your room (for a short
time).
Try to keep normal
routines, for example, reading bedtime stories, eating dinner together,
watching TV together, reading books, exercising, or playing games. If you
cant keep normal routines, make new ones
together.
Help children feel in control when possible
by letting them choose meals, pick out clothes, or make some decisions
for themselves.
