Congressman
Steve Stockman
Representing the
36th District
May 05, 2014
Stockman cautiously optimistic about Gowdy selection as Benghazi
committee chair
WASHINGTON
Congressman Steve Stockman released the following statement Monday
afternoon regarding the selection of Congressman Trey Gowdy to chair the
Select Committee to investigate the Obama administrations response to
and handling of the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on Americans in
Benghazi, Libya:
Congratulations to Mr. Gowdy.
This
is the first step toward finding the truth and securing justice for
the victims in Benghazi.
We must hold accountable those who
ignored four Americans call for help and the White Houses efforts to
cover up their fatal failure.
Justice demands a full
investigation. The Select Committee will have full subpoena powers past
committees did not have.
That is important because there will
be tremendous pressure on Benghazi committee members to whitewash the
truth.
The Obama administration will do everything it can to
obstruct investigators.
The Obama administration openly defied
past subpoenas.
They have withheld emails in defiance of Congress.
They have tampered with talking points and other evidence.
Every member of the Select Committee must be prepared to use the full
force of law in the pursuit of truth.
This is just the
first step towards finding the truth and securing justice.
Unless citizens increase the pressure on members of Congress throughout the
process, political maneuvering and open defiance will thwart the
Select Committee.
I am confident Mr. Gowdy will not let 2016
politics deny justice for Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and
Tyrone Woods.
You and I must stand with him every step of the
way.
