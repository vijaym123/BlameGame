Lamborn Secures Full Funding for UCCS-Army Reserve Cyber Security
Partnership Program
4/29/15
Congressman Lamborn worked in the
House Armed Services Committee to add $6 million to the Army Reserve
budget in the National Defense Authorization Act for the new
cybersecurity partnership program. The University of Colorado Colorado Springs
and five other nationally recognized universities have partnered with
the U.S. Army Reserve to create the new Cybersecurity Public Private
Partnership program (Cyber P3). The $6 million secured by Congressman
Lamborn provides full funding for this program in its inaugural year of
operation.
"It is fantastic news for an innovative and forward thinking
local project to be recognized at the national level. I was at the
kick-off for this program back in February and am extremely impressed with
the Cyber P3 program. When we look over the horizon and see the upcoming
projected shortfalls of experienced cyber security professionals, it
is heartening to know that two top flight organizations will be
partnering to help address this pressing problem facing our national
security. Thank you to UCCS Senior Vice Chancellor Martin Wood and retired
Army Lieutenant General Ed Anderson for their hard work and dedication
to this vitally important effort."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
