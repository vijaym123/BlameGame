Dear Fellow Coloradan,
VIDEO:
Calling on Congress to Pass Common-Sense Student Loan Refinancing Bill
I held a press conference at the U.S. Capitol to highlight how the Bank on Students Act would restore opportunity for thousands of Coloradans with student loan debt and strengthen our state's economy.
Watch video.

Student Debt Drags Down Colorado's Graduates, Economy
Read the op-ed I wrote for the Aurora Sentinel about the drag student loan debt places on Colorado's economy and the need for Congress to pass my bill to help Coloradans tackle their student loan debt.
Read my op-ed.
Colorado is winning the global economic race thanks to our college graduates, who have the drive, skills and expertise to keep our state at the forefront of the 21st century's innovation economy. But with the price of education rising faster than ever, student loan debt is dragging down their financial health and hindering our economy's ability to grow.
The average student loan debt for Colorado's recent college graduates is $24,540, with more than half of Colorado's college students carrying some amount of debt. This explosion of student loan debt, though, extends far beyond recent graduates. According to U.S. Department of Education estimates, more than 760,000 Coloradans carry student loan debt, some with interest rates as high as 14 percent.
What would you do if you weren't weighed down by student loan debt?
We need a multi-pronged approach to address the rising cost of higher education, but Congress can act now on behalf of millions of borrowers nationwide struggling to pay off their loans. That's why I joined my colleagues to introduce the
Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act . My common-sense bill would give borrowers the option to refinance their loans at this year's low rates: 3.86 percent for undergraduates and 5.41 percent for graduate students, which would allow Coloradans to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their student loan repayments.
Every dollar we save Coloradans is money they can invest in their futures, their families and our local economies. By empowering Coloradans to refinance their student loan debt, we are helping them start small businesses, put down payments on homes and bolster our state's economy.
If you'd save money by refinancing your student loans, please share your story and call on Congress to #BankOnStudents.
Unfortunately, a minority of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate prevented Congress from even debating my common-sense and deficit-reducing plan. But I am not giving up, and I need your help to tell Congress that obstructing my bill does nothing to invest in tomorrow's leaders, strengthen the middle class or boost our economy.
Please join me in calling on our nation's leaders to take action instead of playing partisan games.
Warm regards,
Offices
