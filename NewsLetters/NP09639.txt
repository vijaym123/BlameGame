LEGISLATION
Dear
David,
It is an
honor and pleasure to represent you in the U.S. House of
Representatives. My office has special
constituent services ,
meant just to serve you.
If you are planning on visiting Washington, D.C., my office can
book tours
for you and your group. By
clicking the photo above, you can view a range of options
everything
from tours of the Capitol Building and the White House to the Pentagon.
There is also additional information on monuments, museums,
transportation options, and other places of interest.
I can also
provide
assistance with a federal agency .
The federal
government is bogged down by red tape. Although I have worked
throughout my tenure in Congress to reduce the burdens federal agencies place
on my constituents, much of it persists. You do not have to deal with
a federal agency alone
I have a team of caseworkers who are experts
in dealing with these agencies, and they are here to assist
you.
If you know a veteran who needs assistance getting benefits from
the VA, my office can help; or, if you need assistance collecting your
disability or Social Security payments, my office can help. If you or
someone you know is dealing with a federal agency, dont do it alone
let my office help. Click the link or photo above to find out more
about casework.
My office also provides
service academy
nominations . Each year, I have the privilege of nominating a limited
number of students to four of the five service academies. Electing to
attend a service academy is a choice to receive a fantastic education and
serve your country. I wish the best to all those who pursue that
path. You can find information and frequently asked questions about a
service academy nomination on my website by clicking the link or photo
above.
I want to be accessible to my constituents. I regularly
hold town hall meetings, so my constituents can directly ask me
questions. You can
email me any time
with your
comments, questions, or concerns. I hold events in Florida for my
constituents, like my recent
Senior Fair on May 12 , or
Veterans Fair on May 17 . If you would like to be
in regular contact with me, sign up for my e-newsletter
on my website.
If you have suggestions on how to better
serve my constituents, please do not hesitate to contact me with your
suggestions. I want to hear from you!
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress
