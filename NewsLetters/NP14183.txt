Update from Senator Bob Corker

Obama Administrations Health Care Fix May Have Problematic
Consequences
Senator Corker made the following
statement on Thursday in reaction to President Obama announcing
administrative changes to his health care law.
Im glad President
Obama is attempting to make good on a promise he made repeatedly to the
American people, but it only offers temporary relief. Those who have
received cancellation notices will likely receive them again a year
from now, said Corker. So while this administrative action will provide
some needed, temporary relief to a number of Americans, the
fundamental problems with Obamacare go far beyond a broken website and
cancellation notices. Because of the way the law is constructed, this fix may
even cause other problematic consequences.
In an interview
on WKIM Newstalk 98.9s Talk Memphis radio show prior to the
presidents announcement, Corker discussed a number of problems Tennesseans
are facing due to Obamacare.
Tennesseans and Americans all
across this country [are under] tremendous emotional distress as
their policies have been canceled. They cannot get on the exchange to buy
a new one, but even when they do, in many cases, they are realizing
the cost of what they are having to purchase is far more than they ever
anticipated, said Corker.
Losing
coverage:
M illions
of
Americans who buy their own health insurance are being informed that
their policies will no longer be offered because they do not meet
Obamacare standards.
Enrollment obstacles:
Last
week, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services,
announced
that only 106,185 people
have signed up or selected health care plans through Obamacare as of
November 2, 2013, with only 922 in the state of Tennessee.
Unappealing products:
Less than 10%
of people who were able to access the federal exchange have actually
selected a plan, raising questions about whether or not the actual
products offered are acceptable to those seeking a new
plan.
Increased costs:
According to a recent
Manhattan Institute study , individuals in Tennessee will, on
average, see the following premium increases in the exchanges:
Age 27
Women: 19% increase
Men: 69% increase
Age 40
Women: 6% increase
Men: 39% increase
Age
64
Women: 36% increase
Men: 28% increase

Honoring
Our Nations Veterans
Senator Corker made
the following statement in honor of Veterans Day, Monday, November
11.
It is humbling to be in the presence of our nations
veterans and active duty service members, and I feel like the best way I can
honor their service and their families sacrifices is to wake up
every day working to solve the big problems facing our nation to ensure
the continued greatness of the country they have fought to protect,
said Corker.
Over the past year, Corkers office, working in
partnership with members of the Tennessee congressional delegation,
local officials and veterans service organizations, organized a series of
Rally Point events to provide veterans and their families with a
one-stop shop to access local resources. Close to 1,500 Tennesseans have
attended Rally Point events in Knoxville, Cookeville, Jackson,
Gallatin and Chattanooga.

Don't Deal Away Leverage
in Iran Negotiations
In an
appearance
on NBCs Meet the Press last Sunday, November 10,
Senator Corker, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee,
raised concerns about the Obama administration potentially dealing away
U.S. leverage in negotiations with Iran by prematurely lifting
sanctions as part of a partial agreement that does not halt Irans path to a
nuclear weapon.

The [U.N.]
security council resolutions call for a complete stoppage [of Irans
enrichment activities]so you can imagine that Congress -- that put these
sanctions in place with the administration kicking and screaming all the
way, pushing back against these sanctions -- [is] very concerned that
were going to deal away the leverage that we have where we finally
have Iran willing to sit down and talk about these issues, said
Corker.
A partial agreement leads us down the same path we went
down with North Korea, where just to get people to act rightyou
continue to reduce sanctions. So, again, a lot of concerns about the
approach. A lot of us want to see it resolved diplomatically. We know the
sanctions got us here, and were worried were dealing away our
leverage.

away' leverage over Iran
