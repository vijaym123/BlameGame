2014 Congressional Art Competition and House App Challenge
Dear Friend,
Each year, I have the privilege of hosting the Congressional Art Competition for eligible high school students in the 53 rd
District.
This year, I am pleased to announce that my office is also participating in the inaugural House App Challenge.
Details for each competition are below.
These competitions are excellent opportunities for local students to showcase their tech and art skills, but I need your help spreading the word to high school students, teachers, and administrators.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone you think might be interested.
As always, do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions about these contests or any federal issue.
Warm Regards,
2014 House App Challenge
This competition is a nationwide event that allows high school students from across the country to compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or app, for mobile, tablet, or computer devices.
Interested students will also have an opportunity to participate in free workshops to learn how to create apps.
The winning student will receive the honor of being a 53 rd
Congressional District STEM App Champion and have their app displayed on Capitol Hill.
Contest closes Wednesday, April 30, 2014 at 5:30pm
