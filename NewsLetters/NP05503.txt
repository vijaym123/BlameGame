There&rsquo;s nothing left to say.
We&rsquo;ve already told you we came up short on our fundraising goal last night.
We&rsquo;ve already told you the triple-match has been extended until 11:59PM tonight.
We&rsquo;ve already told you this is our last chance to turn things around. David, what else can we say?
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
We still need 6 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in this election. We're pleading, David. Can you step up in the final hours?
1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: We&rsquo;ll triple-match your support if you donate today: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
