Dear David,
What Matters Most to
You?
Each year, Congress considers hundreds of pieces of
legislation focusing on a wide variety of issues. I want to know which
issue matters most to you! Pick from one of the options below, and let me
know. After the results are in, I will pick the top 5 issues as
selected by all of you, my constituents, and tell you about my work in these
areas over the next few weeks.
Tell me what issue is most important to
you! Select One Health
Care Veterans' Affairs Education Immigration Disaster Preparedness Jobs
and the Economy Other Consumer Protection Travel and
Tourism Waste, Fraud, and
Abuse *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my newsletter. If you are having trouble, click here.
As always, the concerns of my
constituents drive my work in DC. I value the opinion of all my
constituents in the 12 th
District. Knowing what matters most to
you helps me best represent you.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
