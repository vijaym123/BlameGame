Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Introducing Legislation to Lift the Oil Export Ban
This week, I announced the introduction of H.R 2369, the Energy Supply and Distribution Act of 2015, which will lift the oil export ban. The 40 year ban on oil exports is out of date and out of touch with Americas thriving energy industry. At the time the ban was introduced, it served a purpose
to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of the 1970s. Today, the ban has outlived that purpose and has become an antiquated policy that is now only harming Americans.
We have an abundance of oil here in the U.S., and lifting the oil export ban will create jobs, spur economic growth, and strengthen our national security interests. I look forward to working with my many colleagues who support this legislation to ensure that we are no longer stuck in the 1970s when it comes time to our nations energy policy. H.R. 2369 is the companion legislation for Senator Lisa Murkowskis bill to lift the oil export ban, S. 1312.
Giving Back to Service Members
Wednesday, I took part in a USO event to assemble care packages for deployed servicemembers. As a member of the USO Congressional Caucus, I really enjoy events like this that give us a chance to remind our men and women in the military that we are thinking about them and praying for them as they sacrifice so much to protect our nation.
Celebrating 24 Years
On Monday, Suzanne and I will celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. Here's a throwback picture from our wedding day! I am so thankful to Suzanne for all the love and support she's given me over the years. I truly would not be where I am today without her.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
