The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads: The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. While others may disagree,
the plain language of this Amendment guarantees the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.
While no one condones the purchase and use of guns by felons or other high-risk individuals to perpetrate any crime, we must not improperly hamper the right of law-abiding citizens to bear or purchase arms, or infringe upon rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
I will continue to be a strong supporter of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Yours in service,
Randy
