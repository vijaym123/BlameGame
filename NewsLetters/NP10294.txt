Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to share some of the things I've been working
on over the last couple of weeks.
Unemployment Insurance
A few weeks ago, after months of debate, the Senate passed a much
needed bill that would extend unemployment insurance to millions of
Americans. On April 9, I joined 132 of my colleagues in the House to
urge Speaker Boehner to bring the Senate-passed bill to the House floor
for a vote.
Since the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired on
December 28, more than 2.3 million Americans, including more than half
a million Californians, have lost their unemployment insurance. On
average, every eight seconds the House delays a vote on this bill,
another jobseeker is cut off from the program. For many American
families, unemployment benefits are the difference between having a
roof over their heads or sleeping on the street; having food to feed
their kids or skipping dinner; seeing a doctor or living with chronic
illness. These families cannot wait. You can count on me to continue to
do all I can to get unemployment insurance passed in the House and on
the President's desk for signature.

General Motors & the Motor Vehicle Safety Act
Rep. Waxman joins those affected by GM's faulty ignition switches at a
press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.
On February 7, General Motors (GM) officially began a recall of 2.6
million vehicles manufactured between the years 2003 and 2007 for
having faulty ignition switches. This defect was linked to at least 31
crashes and 13 deaths.
On April 1, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee
Oversight and Investigations held a hearing to question GM Chief
Executive Officer Mary T. Barra and Acting Administrator of the
National Highway Transportation David Friedman about evidence that GM
knew about this safety defect for years before it acted. On the same
day, I introduced H.R. 4364, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 2014
, which
would require greater transparency, accountability and safety.

investigation, click here

Newly Released Climate Change Report & Bicameral Task Force Actions
Click here to watch the video summary of the latest IPCC report
At the end of last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) released one of its most sobering reports. In the report, the
IPCC warned that while climate change is already having sweeping
effects around the world, the problem is likely to grow substantially
worse unless greenhouse emissions are brought under control. A short
video summarizing the findings of the report can be found here
.
In our continued effort to draw attention to the current and future
impacts on climate change, the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change,
which I co-chair with Senator Whitehouse, hosted a roundtable
discussion in the Capitol with representatives from five major
corporations who are committed to taking action. Each of the companies
has joined the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy
(BICEP) Climate Declaration, a coalition of businesses aimed at helping
legislatures address climate change.

2014 Congressional High School Art Competition
Rep. Waxman and 1st place Winner Ihwa Cho from Palos Verdes High School
pose with winning art entry, Through the Looking Glass.
This month I was delighted to host a reception for the 2014
Congressional High School Art Competition, which was established by
Congress as a part of the Artistic Discovery Program.
This year proved to be a very close competition as my office received
some truly remarkable artwork from eight different high schools in the
33rd Congressional district. Our distinguished panel of judges included
Kim Kovacs, Executive Director, Federal Relations at UCLA, Peter
DeMaria, member of the Manhattan Beach Cultural Arts Commission and
Professor of Architecture at the CSULB School of Design, and Han
Dai-Yu, Associate Professor of Studio Arts at LMU.
Congratulations to this year's winners:
1st place - Ihwa Choi, 11th grade at Palos Verdes High School
2nd place - Joseph Lee, 11th grade at West High School
3rd place - Sarah Doo, 11th grade at Rancho Del Mar High School
Honorable Mention - Cathy Lee, 11th grade at South High School
Thank you to all of the students, art teachers, and families who
participated in this year's event as well as the Manhattan Beach
Creative Arts Center and the City of Manhattan Beach for making this
possible. To view this year's entries, click here

8 Million Americans
#8Million Americans have signed up for health coverage
Lastly, I wanted to take a moment and highlight an important milestone.
After many decades of struggle and the tireless efforts of so many,
millions more Americans have finally gained the security of health
insurance coverage. Eight million Americans have signed up for private
health coverage through the marketplaces. They join three million young
adults who have been able to remain on their parents' plans until age
26 and millions more who are obtaining new coverage for themselves and
their families through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). While there
is still a tremendous amount of work to be done to implement the
Affordable Care Act and build on its progress, I am proud that the law
has made healthcare a right, not a privilege, for all Americans.

A

the

a

that
would
extend

on

28,
more

Lastly,
I
wanted
