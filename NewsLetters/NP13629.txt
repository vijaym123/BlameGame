Bipartisan
Budget Agreement
Dear Friend,
I am pleased to report that last week,
for the first time in five years, Congress
agreed upon a federal budget. The House of
Representatives passed the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2013 by a vote count of
332-94.
Fifth District Virginians know that we
need to put an end to the reckless
government spending in Washington that has
brought us to a $17 trillion debt. Since
coming to Congress, addressing the
crippling national deficit and debt has
been my top priority. While we have
successfully implemented some spending
reforms, such as eliminating earmarks and
reducing spending for two consecutive years
for the first time in nearly 60 years, we
have not been able to make additional
progress on our deficits and debt because
of the Senate's failure to even attempt
passing a budget in recent years.
After years of Senate unwillingness to
act on budget policy, I am encouraged by
the fact that we have stopped the pattern
of handing over our congressional budgetary
authority to the executive branch and
exercised our constitutional duty to
establish the spending priorities for our
great nation. This budget plan reduces our
long-term deficit without raising taxes. We
have exchanged one-time cuts for long-term
spending reforms that are not only good
deficit reduction policy, but will also
secure our military readiness by giving our
troops the resources they need to defend
our nation.
This budget plan is not a solution to
our debt crisis, but it is a step in the
right direction. I look forward to
continuing to fight for true spending
reform and for policies that will balance
our budget and guarantee a brighter future
for all Virginians and Americans.
