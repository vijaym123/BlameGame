ICYMI - Poliquin Supports
Federal Reserve Subpoena :
Last week, Congressman Poliquin
issued a release stating his support of
the subpoena issued by
the House Financial Services Committee, on which he sits, to the U.S.
Federal Reserve. America's central bank has refused to provide the
Committee responsible for its oversight with documentation regarding the
leak of market-sensitive inside information to an outside private
entity.
"I am very concerned about our nation's central bank seemingly
resistant to turn over important documents to this oversight
Committee that would help determine who and how confidential inside
information was unlawfully released to an outside party. Such a breach could
have given one group of investors an unfair and illegal advantage over
the general public regarding their stock and bond investments."
