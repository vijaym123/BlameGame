Dear Friend,
There was a lot happening in Washington this week while
you, your family, and mine were dealing with the incredibly severe
weather in Georgia. Of all the coverage I saw on national news and keeping
track locally, one very good theme emerged. Georgians are fantastic
about helping each other--showing generosity and our famous hospitality
when the going gets tough.
Here's looking forward to a much
warmer weekend!
Since so many were snowed in Tuesday night, I
know a lot of folks watched the State of the Union.
Here's how I felt
about the
speech.
As always, let me know your thoughts
here.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
Standing for
Life
This week
the House passed H.R.
7 , the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.
Congressman Collins shared his family's personal
experience with the issue of abortion. Click above

what the Washington Times had to
say
about it as well.
