In 2014, under the Presidents healthcare law, a health insurance tax, amounting to over
$100 billion
will be imposed on health insurance companies, a burden which will ultimately be shouldered by small businesses and consumers.
As a result, the private sector may be forced to shed approximately
146,000 to 262,000 jobs
by 2022, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, with over half of those losses negatively impacting small businesses.
Healthcare cannot come at an unacceptable cost to our business community. That is why I cosponsored
H.R. 763 , which repeals the health insurance tax and protects small businesses and American entreprenuers across the country.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS I will
continue my fight
to entirely defund and defeat this economically unfeasible law.
