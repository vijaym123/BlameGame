[Flood 3 (2) (2)]
2002 Roseau Flood
This week the City of Roseau received long-awaited news that the Army Corps of Engineers 2014 Work Plan will include the final piece of federal funding for their flood diversion project. Since the devastating flood in 2002, community leaders in Roseau have worked tirelessly to get a project in place that would protect their community from flooding events. Throughout the process, Mayor Jeff Pelowski, Community Development Director Todd Peterson, and many other community leaders have shown tremendous leadership in their efforts to ensure that their community would have flood protection. I am so pleased that this project is on track for completion.

I met with Dr. Cindy Firkins-Smith, the President-elect of the Minnesota Medical Association and a Willmar physician, and Dr. Douglas Wood, a Trustee of the Minnesota Medical Association who practices at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. We discussed the perils of not replacing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) on public programs beneficiaries and rural communities, as well as the need for better diabetes prevention programs. Replacing the SGR is a top priority for this Congress and I will continue to work with Minnesota providers to find the right solution for Minnesota.
House Passes Bill Extending Emergency Propane Exemption
[cid:image015.jpg@01CF3A00.D73EECB0]
Supplies of propane and home heating fuel remain tight, and this week I was glad to see Congress take action. On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed legislation that provides a guaranteed extension of the U.S. Department of Transportation's emergency declarations for the purpose of transporting propane and home heating fuels until May 31, 2014.
This guaranteed emergency exemption will allow us to continue to ship propane and heating fuels quickly and efficiently to make sure it gets to the folks who need it most in these tough times. It also provides the certainty needed to address transportation and distribution of these critical heating fuels during the ongoing crisis. I am very concerned about the difficulties that the spike in propane fuel costs have caused for homeowners and businesses across the 7th District, and that's why I joined my Midwestern colleagues in calling for public hearings to fully investigate all resources available to moderate propane supply and relieve skyrocketing prices.
