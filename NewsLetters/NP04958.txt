David --
We know it sometimes feels like we only send you bad news. So here&rsquo;s the good news:
we&rsquo;re just 5 days away from the Election and the momentum is on our side.
Nearly 30,000 people have chipped in to our grassroots campaign. Key groups, including Planned Parenthood and Sierra Club, have backed our campaign. And we&rsquo;re fighting for the issues we care about from defending Medicare to protecting a woman&rsquo;s right to choose. Can you commit to help us Get Out The Vote in the last 5 days so Brad can keep fighting for us in Congress?
Latest polls show our race in a dead-heat.
The only way to get over the finish line is to keep fighting. And because of your support, that&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re doing.
This week, we have knocked on more than 20,000 doors and talked to more than 9,000 voters at the doors and on the phones.
Last night, you helped us top our fundraising deadline goal and push back against the huge amount of outside Republican money that&rsquo;s been dumped in against us.
Thank you so much for all your help. Now, it&rsquo;s time to knock some doors, make some phone calls, and go win this election!
