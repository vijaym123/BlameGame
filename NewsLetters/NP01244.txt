Rubio, Kirk Comment On Iran's
Charges Against Washington Post
Reporter
In response to
charges
by Iran
against
The Washington Post
reporter,
Jason Rezaian, Marco and Senator Mark
Kirk (R-IL) urged President Obama to
demand the release of Rezaian and all
other Americans wrongfully imprisoned in
Iran before finalizing a nuclear
deal.
Rubio and Kirk: It appears
that Mr. Rezaian is being persecuted
because of his profession as a reporter
and his American citizenship. Freedom
of press is a right that should be
guaranteed to all individuals
regardless of their nationality. We
urge the Iranian government to
immediately and unconditionally release
Mr. Rezaian.
This case is just the latest
example of the true nature of the
Iranian regime. The Obama
Administration should demand Mr.
Rezaians immediate release along
with all other Americans wrongfully
imprisoned in Iran prior to concluding
a nuclear deal with this brutal
regime.
In
March
2015
, Marco and Kirk led a group of 19
senators in urging the Obama
Administration to demand the
unconditional release of Rezaian and
other American citizens unjustly
imprisoned in Iran.
Rubio Opposes Lynch Nomination For
Attorney General
Marco took a stand in defense of the
Constitution and voted no on Loretta
Lynchs nomination to be U.S.
attorney general.
You can read an excerpt of his
statement below and the full statement
here .
Rubio: I opposed Loretta
Lynchs nomination because of her
failure to identify any limit on the
presidents ability to ignore the
laws passed by Congress as well as her
obvious enthusiasm for civil asset
forfeiture, which can deprive innocent
people of their property rights without
due process. The president has every
right to appoint nominees who support
his policies, but I could not support
Ms. Lynch because of every indication
she has given that she will put her
support of the presidents
policies ahead of her support of the
Constitution of the United States.
I regret that Ms. Lynch
failed to demonstrate that, if
confirmed, she would be willing to tell
the president that there are some
things that he simply does not have the
constitutional power to do. Because she
failed to demonstrate that she would be
willing to draw a line where
appropriate, I voted against her
confirmation.
Rubio: Americans Spend 114 Days Of
The Year Working For The Government,
And That's Unacceptable
On Friday, the 114
th
day of the year, Marco
wrote an op-ed marking Tax Freedom Day,
the first day of the year people have
earned enough to pay their full annual
tax burden. As of Friday, Americans have
earned a combined $4.8 trillion in income
since January 1st
the exact
amount of state, local and federal taxes
we will owe for 2015.
Read an excerpt of the op-ed below and
the full version
here .
Rubio: On this Tax Freedom
Day, we see the way our current tax
system clouds our American Dreams and
reduces the incentives to pursue them.
By establishing a modern tax system
that lowers rates, empowers our people,
and still meets the needs of a limited
but effective government, we can
restore fairness to our tax system and
promote a growing, opportunity-rich
economy for all our people.
Rubio, Senate Commemorate 25th
Anniversary Of Hubble Telescope
Launch
On the 25th anniversary of the Hubble
Space Telescope launch, the Senate passed
Marcos resolution,
S
Res 149 , recognizing the importance
and inspiration of the Hubble Space
Telescope.
The resolution congratulated the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) on the 25th
anniversary of the launch; recognized the
scientists, crew, engineers and staff who
contributed to its success; noted the
significance of the discoveries and
contributions to science Hubble has made
as well as the subsequent innovations
that were derived from the data it
collected; and acknowledged that the
Hubble Space Telescope has captured
images from - and answered questions
about - space and has inspired
generations of young people to go into
the fields of science, technology,
engineering, mathematics and
research.
Marco also wrote an op-ed in
Florida
Today
celebrating Hubbles
achievements and looking forward to a new
American century with the American people
at the helm of discovery. Read an excerpt
below and the full op-ed
here .
Rubio: The images Hubble has
captured in its 25 years are many
things
inspiring, humbling,
even startling. But they are also a
stirring call to action
a
challenge to keep discovering, keep
launching, keep dreaming.
In this century, America will
look to the planets in our solar system
and to the stars beyond, and humankind
will look to our people to lead the
way. Hubble has helped our eyes touch
the far reaches of space. With American
innovation in the century and centuries
ahead, perhaps our boots will touch it
next.
Constituent Casework Corner
Patricia, a resident of Dade City, was
denied Social Security Disability even
though she has many medical conditions
that would warrant it. Senator
Rubios staff sent an inquiry,
including evidence of her conditions, to
the Social Security Administration and an
expedited hearing was scheduled. After a
review of all the information, a judge
granted her Social Security
Disability.

Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA):
The VA announced on 4/24/15
that it is expanding the Veterans Choice
program by measuring the 40-mile distance
from a VA medical facility using driving
distance vice a straight line
distance. It is also using the
fastest route for calculations for
beneficiary travel instead of the
shortest distance. Both are
effective immediately. The change
in the Choice program is expected to
double the number of veterans eligible to
use the Choice card.
