Dear Friend,
Massachusetts&rsquo; most popular political party is &ldquo;Unenrolled&rdquo; and has been for some time. These are the independent voters we need to persuade to vote for Democrats this year. When unenrolled voters break for Democrats, we win. When they pull the lever for Republicans, we lose.
Unenrolled voters are the political center of gravity here in the Commonwealth, and we have to compete for every single one of their ballots. Our GOTV teams are working hard to persuade unenrolled voters to support us on Election Day. You can support our efforts by contributing $5 -- or more, if you can.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
There&rsquo;s not much time left before the polls close in Massachusetts. We have work to do. Let&rsquo;s get it done.
Thank you.
Ed
