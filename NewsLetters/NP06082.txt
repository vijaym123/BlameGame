Health Subcommittee Top Among House Panels
Last year, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee that I lead had more bills signed into law than any of the other 86 subcommittees in the House. That record of success has continued into this year too. The average number of signed laws per all Committees (full committees counted as subs) is 1.9. This means that Health passed nearly 6 times more bills that were signed into law than any other committee. The average number of signed laws per Subcommittees only (bills passed by full committees not included) is 1.1. This means that Health passed 10 times more bills that were signed into law than any other subcommittee.
At the West Lampeter Fair
This week, I attended the West Lampeter Community Fair at the invitation of Victoria Herr, student and member of FFA (formerly Future Farmers of America.) Victoria is the Pennsylvania State FFA Secretary for 2014-15 and was showing two hogs at the fair. I was glad to attend and meet Victoria to talk about the next generation of agriculture in our area. Farming is at the heart of the 16th District and will continue to be essential to our culture and local economy. It is always wonderful to meet young people who are thinking innovatively about the industry.
Contempt Charges Against Attorney General Will Continue
While Attorney General Eric Holder is resigning, there continue to be many remaining unanswered questions about his actions. Under his leadership, the Department of Justice has stalled for years in presenting documents critical to the botched gun-selling scheme known as Fast and Furious. We still have few answers about if the department will prosecute Lois Lerner or any other IRS officials who abused their positions of power. The Attorney General will remain in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions despite his resignation.
A Broken System of Border Control
This week, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants released into the United States have refused to show up for scheduled appointments. Only 30 percent of those released ever showed up for a meeting with agents to determine whether they can stay in the U.S. Clearly, the honor system is not working. We need an effective system for letting people legally come to the U.S. Right now, we have chaos and the Obama administration seems uninterested in upholding the law.
Op-ed of the Week: Our Budget Problems Havent Disappeared
Ignoring a problem never makes it go away. Dirty dishes in the sink dont clean themselves. Procrastinating on a paper for school doesnt get it written. Lawns dont get mowed on their own.
