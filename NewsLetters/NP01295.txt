Dear Friend,
It has been a busy week in
Washington as we have begun the markup process on the 2016 NDAA.
Starting in the Strategic Forces and Emerging Threats and Capabilities
Subcommittees, we have begun to identify our national security priorities
for the next fiscal year. As always, I have been intimately involved in
this process with amendments added and other ideas included in the
underlying bill.
I also grilled
VA officials on the failure of bloated construction projects, like the
forthcoming hospital in Aurora, chaired a hearing of my Energy and
Mineral Resources Subcommittee discussing offshore energy, and
participated in an important Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearing on nuclear
forces. I also voted to eliminate the punishing burden of the death
tax.
Please let me know if you
require any assistance with a federal government agency by contacting my
local office at (719) 520-0055.
I am honored to
serve as your Representative in
Washington.
Sincerely,
2016
NDAA
Last week,
the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and the Subcommittee on Emerging
Threats and Capabilities released their legislative proposals for
the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA).
I successfully added an
amendment during the Strategic Forces Subcommittee preliminary markup which
will prohibit the DOD from relying on Chinese and Russian weather
satellites over CENTCOM, which the Pentagon had been
considering.
Please

HERE
to watch the amendment being
added
I specifically
authored or advocated for a number of provisions which were incorporated
into the underlying bill including the
following:
-
Language establishing a major
force program for space, which was recommended by the Rumsfeld Space
Commission, and will help promote a strong space
budget.
-
Language supporting better
ways for the DOD to purchase commercial satellite
communications.
-
Language fixing
the launch provisions affecting United Launch
Alliance.
-
Language prohibiting any
integration of US or NATO missile defenses with Russian missile
defenses.
-
Language
requested by USAFA standardizing how they name
facilities.
From my leadership position in the
two Subcommittees, I support the following additions to the
NDAA:
Strategic
Forces Markups (courtesy of House Armed Services Committee
Communications)
Space
In light
of the growing foreign threats, the mark prioritizes national security
space by creating a new major force program category for space, and
establishes the steps to strengthen national security space
stewardship, leadership, management, and organization within the Department of
Defense;
Authorizes the
Committees priority of a new U.S. space propulsion capability to end
U.S. reliance on Russian rocket engines by
2019;
Sends the Air Force back to the drawing board
on the next-generation weather satellite system by withholding all
funding for the program until it is redesigned to guarantee warfighter
requirements are met;
Drives smarter, more cost-effective acquisition in milsatcom space programs
through new pilot approaches, streamlined acquisition, and
establishing proper accountability through centralized management in the
Department of Defense to save taxpayer
dollars;
Establishes new approaches to get better and more
timely intelligence directly into the hands of
warfighters.
Nuclear Weapons
Authorizes and sets priorities within the NNSA Defense Nuclear
Nonproliferation program and prohibits funding for NNSA threat reduction
activities in Russia;.

Russias actions with respect to deployment of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian

system;
Directs the

the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, to accelerate the development
of this advanced capability to boost homeland defense
capability;
Would require the
modification of the Aegis Ashore site in Romania, and the planned site in
Poland, to provide enhanced Anti-Air Warfare capability for defense of the
sites from regional threats, including against cruise missiles from
Russia;
Requires the
relocation of the Sea-based X-band Radar to a site on the East Coast by
2020, and, directs immediate work on site design and other study and
process work to homeport such radar on the East Coast, while ensuring the

Hawaii.

ELIMINATING
TAXES
The estate tax (or "death tax") often
prevents family businesses from being passed to the next generation.
This hurts families and our economy. That's why I just voted to repeal
the estate tax.
STANDING WITH
ISRAEL
Congratulations to the people of
Israel on their 67th Yom Haatzmaut (Independence Day). For
sixty-seven years our lips murmur The Lord has done great things for them
(Psalm, 126:2). It is an honor to support, and contribute my humble share
to this ongoing modern miracle. May you go from strength to strength
(Psalm, 84:7) and remain a beacon of freedom, justice, democracy and
hope.
STRENGTHENING OUR CYBERSECURITY
EFFORTS
I supported two
pieces of legislation designed to shore up our nation's defenses
against cyber attacks. H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act
improves efforts to stop cyber attacks by amending the National Security
Act to allow two-way sharing between the private sector and entities
within the federal government. This bill also provides additional
privacy protections and explicitly prohibits surveillance. H.R. 1731,
the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015
encourages voluntary data sharing regarding cyber threats between the public
and private sectors.
SCENES FROM
WASHINGTON DC
Along with my colleague Congressman
Trent Franks and alongside the National Defense Industrial Association, I
co-hosted Missile Defense Day on the Hill. This event highlights the
vitally important role that missile defense plays in protecting
America and our allies.
Thank
you to members of Colorado 4-H for stopping by my
office.
It
was great to meet with Lt Col Shelly Kalkowski, USAF (Ret) and Sharon
Devaney, two of the Colorado leaders of Military Officers Association
of America. We discussed how we can work together to support our men
and women in uniform and their families.
I had a great
conversation in my office with Major General Edwards, the Adjutant General
of the Colorado National Guard. Every day the citizen soldiers of the
Colorado Guard are keeping our nation secure and our communities around
the state safe.
