Cuba and America:
A New Era
In 1961, the United States shuttered its embassy in Cuba, breaking off
diplomatic relations as Fidel Castro imposed a repressive communist
regime, embraced the Soviet Union, and expropriated private property.
Strict travel restrictions were imposed, and President Kennedy
instituted an embargo on trade and financial transactions.
Fifty-four
years later, our country is on the verge of recognizing Cuba and
opening a formal embassy in Havana.
Along with two of my Senate colleagues, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona
and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, I recently had the opportunity to
travel to Cuba to meet with high-level government officials, Cardinal
Ortega of the Catholic Church, Cuban entrepreneurs, members of the
Havana community, including scientists and the operators of a website,
and ambassadors representing other nations in Cuba.
It was a
fascinating trip that has made me better informed about the changing
and challenging relationship between our two countries.
We met with Cuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz Canel,
who has been designated as President Raul Castros successor when the
Cuban President retires in 2018.
The fact that the President is chosen
by the regime is a reminder that while Cuba is changing and the Vice
President represents a younger generation more open to economic and
social reforms, Cuba remains a one-party state where serious political
challenges are not tolerated.
Vice President Diaz Canel spoke of the economic reforms that are
allowing limited private ownership of businesses such as restaurants
and barber shops.
In particular, the private restaurants known as
paladars have boomed, featuring better food and service than the
state-run enterprises.
I had an excellent Cuban meal of black beans
and rice, fried banana chips, and slow-roasted glazed pork at one of
the privately run paladars.
Cuban families are converting their homes to
restaurants and are eagerly embracing the opportunity to build a better
life and to escape the grinding poverty that is pervasive despite a
high literacy rate that in freer countries would equate to a higher
standard of living.
Some of the paladars are financed by loans or
gifts from Cuban-American relatives.
Cuba faces shortages of many foods, including potatoes, and has no
dairy industry so that the imported milk is either powdered or boxed.
Ration books provide milk for children only up to age 7.
With the
exception of the ubiquitous bananas and guavas, fruit and vegetables
are hard to come by, although the private restaurants seemed more
resourceful in obtaining them.
In my meetings with Cuban officials regarding the potential for
increased trade, I pointed out that Maine would be an excellent source
of seed potatoes, blueberries, and other foods given our thriving
agricultural sector.
During other meetings with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and
Northern American Affairs Director Josefina Vidal, we discussed the
significant progress being made toward opening both a U.S. embassy in
Havana and a Cuban embassy in Washington as well as eliminating current
travel restrictions.
I favor lifting the travel restrictions on
Americans who wish to go to Cuba, believing that the more exposure
Cubans have to Americans, the more Cuban officials will be pressured to
provide new freedoms to their people.
I also believe that our
government should be very hesitant about imposing restrictions on our
citizens right to travel, a basic freedom, except to war zones or
under other exceptional circumstances.
Like the Cuban negotiator Josefina Vidal, our chief negotiator is also
a talented woman, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
Affairs Roberta Jacobson.
One of her chief aides is from Maine:
Daniel Erikson, an author of a book on Cuba and State Department expert
who briefed me prior to my trip.
Cuba is in desperate need of investment.
Havana is a beautiful
historic city with extraordinary architecture, lovely parks, and
magnificent churches, but is marred by crumbling buildings, a
deteriorating infrastructure, and an unsanitary water supply.
While central parts of the city and Old Havana have been maintained
or restored to the days of the citys past glory, one has only to
travel down virtually any side street to see abject poverty and piles
of rubble as buildings literally fall down onto the streets.
Facing that reality, the Cuban government is now encouraging foreign
investment.
During a meeting with Deborah Rivas Saavedra, the Director
of Investments, and two of her colleagues, I asked how the Cuban
government could expect the American hospitality industry to invest
when they would be prohibited from owning the land on which they would
build a resort and would be in fear of their hotel being seized should
it become successful.
The Director replied that investors would be
granted a 99-year lease, and that the new economic reforms would
protect foreign investors.
Certainly, the possibility of a successful tourism industry looms large
for Cuba should these guarantees become a reality.
Cuba is, after all,
only 90 miles from Florida, and in addition to historic Havana,
features pristine beaches in other parts of the island, I am told.
Perhaps the most interesting person with whom we met was Cardinal Jaime
Lucas Ortega y Alamino.
A highly intelligent, charming, and ebullient
man, Cardinal Ortega
played a key role in the negotiations between the Cuban and
American governments that led to the exchange of Alan Gross, a U.S. AID
subcontractor who had been wrongfully imprisoned for five years, and a
Cuban national, who had been working for the United States and had been
in prison for 20 years, for three Cuban spies imprisoned in the United
States.
His detailed and fascinating story of the negotiations, which
involved the intervention of Pope Francis, had all the intrigue of a
spy novel.
Cardinal Ortega has been criticized by both the Communist government
and by some in the Cuban dissident community.
He clearly has to walk a
fine line, but his advocacy has led to the release of political
prisoners and to greater religious freedom for the Cuban people.
Along with the U.S. chief of mission, I attended mass at the Cathedral
in Havana, and the Cardinal made a point of welcoming us from the
pulpit and devoted a large part of his sermon, in both Spanish and
English, to the Popes hope for a better relationship between our two
countries.
Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had heavily
subsidized the Cuban economy, the Catholic Church has played a major
role in attempting to ease the plight of the poorest Cubans.
I met
with a Cuban citizen before my trip, and he urged me to bring small
sizes of toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and other toiletries, all in short
supply and too expensive for the poor to purchase.
My staffer and I
did so and gave them to the Church to distribute.
At the request of the Cuban government, I also had a separate meeting
with three physicians who have developed what appears to be a
breakthrough treatment for curing serious leg and foot ulcers that can
lead to amputations in older individuals with diabetes.
(Clearly, the
Cubans had done their research on me and knew that I have chaired the
Diabetes Caucus in the Senate for many years.)
Largely because of the
embargo and despite partnering with a French firm, these physicians are
encountering difficulties in securing U.S. government permission to
conduct clinical trials in the United States with the possibility of
commercializing their new pharmaceutical treatment.
If this treatment is as promising as the doctors portrayed, trade
barriers should not be allowed to prevent it from benefitting Americans
whose diabetes puts them at risk of losing a leg or a foot.
I left Cuba hopeful that our two countries can move forward to a
constructive new relationship that will prompt Cuba to modernize and
provide more freedoms to its citizens.
Economic and social reforms
should pave the way to a better life for the Cuban people, including
eventually a freer political future.
In my judgment, a more normal
diplomatic relationship between two countries only 90 miles from one
another is the right direction for our nation to pursue, while ever
mindful that we will be dealing with a one-party government determined
to hold on to its power.

Cuba

A

and
President

Fifty-four

our
country
is
on
the
verge
of
recognizing
Cuba
and
opening
a
formal
embassy
in
Havana.
Along
with
two
of
my
Senate
colleagues,
Senator
Jeff

of
Arizona
and
Senator
Pat
Roberts
of
Kansas,
I
recently
had
the
opportunity
to
travel
to
Cuba
to
meet
with
high-level
government
officials,
Cardinal
Ortega
of
the
Catholic
Church,
Cuban
entrepreneurs,
members
of
the
Havana
community,
including
scientists
and
the
operators
of
a
website,
and
ambassadors
representing
other
nations
in
Cuba.
It
was
a
fascinating
trip
that
has
made
me
better
informed
about
the
changing
and
challenging
relationship
between
our
two
countries.
We
met
with
Cuban
First
Vice
President
Miguel
Diaz
Canel,
who
has
been
designated
as
President
Raul
Castro&#146;s
successor
when
the
Cuban
President
retires
in
2018.
The
fact
that
the
President
is
chosen
by
the
regime
is
a
reminder
that
while
Cuba
is
changing
and
the
Vice
President
represents
a
younger
generation
more
open
to
economic
and
social
reforms,
Cuba
remains
a
one-party
state
where
serious
political
challenges
are
not
tolerated.
Vice
President
Diaz
Canel
spoke
of
the
economic
reforms
that
are
allowing
limited
private
ownership
of
businesses
such
as
restaurants
and
barber
shops.
In
particular,
the
private
restaurants
known
as
&#147;paladars&#148;
have
boomed,
featuring
better
food
and
service
than
the
state-run
enterprises.
I
had
an
excellent
Cuban
meal
of
black
beans
and
rice,
fried
banana
chips,
and
slow-roasted
glazed
pork
at
one
of
the
privately
run
paladars.
Cuban
families
are
converting
their
homes
to
restaurants
and
are
eagerly
embracing
the
opportunity
to
build
a
better
life
and
to
escape
the
grinding
poverty
that
is
pervasive
despite
a
high
literacy
rate
that
in
freer
countries
would
equate
to
a
higher
standard
of
living.
Some
of
the
paladars
are
financed
by
loans
or
gifts
from
Cuban-American
relatives.
Cuba
faces
shortages
of
many
foods,
including
potatoes,
and
has
no
dairy
industry
so
that
the
imported
milk
is
either
powdered

Ration
books
provide
milk
for
children
only
up

and

and

are
hard
to
come

although
the
private

seemed

In
my
meetings
with
Cuban
officials
regarding
the
potential
for
increased
trade,
I
pointed
out
that
Maine
would
be
an
excellent
source
of
seed
potatoes,
blueberries,
and
other
foods
given
our
thriving
agricultural
sector.
During
other
meetings
with
Cuban
Foreign
Minister
Bruno
Rodriguez
and
Northern
American
Affairs
Director
Josefina
Vidal,
we
discussed
the
significant
progress
being
made
toward
opening
both
a
U.S.
embassy
in
Havana
and
a
Cuban
embassy
in
Washington
as
well
as
eliminating
current
travel
restrictions.
I
favor
lifting
the
travel
restrictions
on
Americans
who
wish
to
go
to
Cuba,
believing
that
the
more
exposure
Cubans
have
to
Americans,
the
more
Cuban
officials
will
be
pressured
to
provide
new
freedoms
to
their
people.
I
also
believe
that
our
government
should
be
very
hesitant
about
imposing
restrictions
on
our
citizens&#146;
right
to
travel,
a
basic
freedom,
except
to
war
zones
or
under
other
exceptional
circumstances.
Like
the
Cuban
negotiator
Josefina
Vidal,
our
chief
negotiator
is
also
a
talented
woman,
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
for
Western
Hemisphere
Affairs
Roberta
Jacobson.
One
of
her
chief
aides
is
from
Maine:
Daniel
Erikson,
an
author
of
a
book
on
Cuba
and
State
Department
expert
who
briefed
me
prior
to
my
trip.
Cuba
is
in
desperate
need
of
investment.
Havana
is
a
beautiful
historic
city
with
extraordinary
architecture,
lovely
parks,
and
magnificent
churches,
but
is
marred
by
crumbling
buildings,
a
deteriorating
infrastructure,
and
an
unsanitary
water
supply.
While
central
parts
of
the
city
and
&#147;Old
Havana&#148;
have
been
maintained
or
restored
to
the
days
of
the
city&#146;s
past
glory,
one
has
only
to
travel
down
virtually
any
side
street
to
see
abject
poverty
and
piles
of
rubble
as
buildings
literally
fall
down
onto
the
streets.
Facing
that
reality,
the
Cuban
government
is
now
encouraging
foreign
investment.
During
a
meeting
with
Deborah
Rivas
Saavedra,
the
Director
of
Investments,
and
two
of
her
colleagues,
I
asked
how
the
Cuban
government
could
expect
the
American
hospitality
industry
to
invest
when
they
would
be
prohibited
from
owning
the
land
on
which
they
would
build
a
resort
and
would
be
in
fear
of
their
hotel
being
seized
should
it
become
successful.
The
Director
replied
that
investors
would
be
granted
a
99-year
lease,
and
that
the
new
economic
reforms
would
protect
foreign
investors.
Certainly,
the
possibility
of
a
successful
tourism
industry
looms
large
for
Cuba
should
these
guarantees
become
a
reality.
Cuba
is,
after
all,
only
90
miles
from
Florida,
and
in
addition
to
historic
Havana,
features
pristine
beaches
in
other
parts
of
the
island,
I
am
told.
Perhaps
the
most
interesting
person
with
whom
we
met
was
Cardinal
Jaime
Lucas
Ortega
y
Alamino.
A
highly
intelligent,
charming,
and
ebullient
man,
Cardinal
Ortega
played
a
key
role
in
the
negotiations
between
the
Cuban
and
American
governments
that
led
to
the
exchange
of
Alan
Gross,
a
U.S.
AID subcontractor
who
had
been
wrongfully
imprisoned
for
five
years,
and
a
Cuban
national,
who
had
been
working
for
the
United
States
and
had
been
in
prison
for
20
years,
for
three
Cuban
spies
imprisoned
in
the
United
States.
His
detailed
and
fascinating
story
of
the
negotiations,
which
involved
the
intervention
of
Pope
Francis,
had
all
the
intrigue
of
a
spy
novel.
Cardinal
Ortega
has
been
criticized
by
both
the
Communist
government
and
by
some
in
the
Cuban
dissident
community.
He
clearly
has
to
walk
a
fine
line,
but
his
advocacy
has
led
to
the
release
of
political
prisoners
and
to
greater
religious
freedom
for
the
Cuban
people.
Along
with
the
U.S.
chief
of
mission,
I
attended
mass
at
the
Cathedral
in
Havana,
and
the
Cardinal
made
a

and
devoted
a
large
part
of
his
sermon,
in
both
Spanish
and
English,
to
the
Pope&#146;s
hope
for
a
better
relationship
between
our
two
countries.
Ever
since
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
Union,
which
had
heavily
subsidized
the
Cuban
economy,
the
Catholic
Church
has
played
a
major
role
in
attempting
to
ease
the
plight
of
the
poorest
Cubans.
I
met
with
a
Cuban
citizen
before
my
trip,
and
he
urged
me
to

small
sizes
of
toothpaste,
soap,
shampoo,
and
other

all
in
short

and
too

the

My
staffer
and
I
did
so
and
gave
them
to
the
Church

distribute.
At
the
request
of
the
Cuban
government,
I
also
had
a

three

what
appears
to
be
a
breakthrough
treatment
for
curing
serious
leg
and
foot

that
can
lead
to
amputations
in
older
individuals
with
diabetes.
(Clearly,
the
Cubans
had
done
their
research
on
me
and
knew
that
I
have
chaired
the
Diabetes
Caucus
in
the
Senate
for
many
years.)
Largely
because
of
the
embargo
and
despite
partnering
with
a
French
firm,
these
physicians
are
encountering
difficulties
in
securing
U.S.
government
permission
to
conduct
clinical
trials
in
the
United
States
with
the
possibility
of
commercializing
their
new
pharmaceutical
treatment.
If
this
treatment
is
as

as
the

portrayed,
trade

should
not
be
allowed
to

it
from
