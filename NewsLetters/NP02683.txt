Wicker Encouraged by Court
Ruling to Block
Obama's Amnesty Order
Legal
Battle Continues Against Executive
Overreach
The Constitution's system of checks and
balances was designed to keep one branch of the government from becoming
more powerful than the others.
Today, that time-tested system is
important to restraining President Obama's continued abuse of executive
power.
Mississippi Supports Court
Challenge
On February 16, U.S. District
Judge Andrew S. Hanen issued a temporary injunction to block the Obama
Administrations attempted overhaul of immigration law.
As Hanen
noted, "The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle" if
the President's far-reaching plan were implemented before its challenge
in the courts is resolved.
President Obama's actions are being
challenged as unconstitutional in a lawsuit filed by Mississippi and
25 other states.
The executive
action in question is President Obama's unilateral expansion of a
deferred deportation program, effectively granting temporary legal status and
work permits to nearly five million illegal immigrants.
Announced last November, the brazen power grab not only usurps the authority
of Congress, which is responsible for writing and amending federal
law, but it would also impose billions of dollars in costs on states.
Following the court order, the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) promptly suspended the President's initiative.
Applications
for the expanded program were set to begin just hours later on February
18.
I oppose amnesty for
immigrants who have entered illegally or overstayed their visas. I have also
been an outspoken critic of President Obama's relentless executive
actions, which undermine the democratic process and rule of law.
There is support in both political parties for comprehensive immigration
reform that reinforces our borders and strengthens national security
by fixing a broken system.
The President's decision not to work
with Congress misses a significant opportunity for meaningful
bipartisan action.
Instead, he has provoked a legal battle that many
predict will end up before the Supreme Court.
The President should
not be surprised.
Even he has described executive action on
immigration as "ignoring the law."
Democrats Obstruct Homeland
Security Funding
Because
the legislative branch holds the power of the purse, lawmakers are
responsible for authorizing and appropriating funds to federal agencies,
including DHS.
One of the most urgent items for Congress to
approve is homeland security funding.
DHS funds are set to run out at
the end of this month.
The House
of Representatives has passed a measure that would fund DHS and
prohibit the President's unconstitutional actions, but it has yet to be
approved by the Senate. Democrats continue to filibuster a routine
procedural vote that would bring the measure to the floor for debate.
Criticism of the President's
immigration proposal transcends party lines.
In recent weeks,
several Democrats have openly opposed the President's amnesty order.
I am hopeful that the court's action will help persuade Democrats to
allow debate on the bill.
Obama's Legacy of Legal
Fights
The President's
immigration policy is just one example of the deliberate executive
overreach that has characterized his time in office.
Sweeping
directives affecting health care and the environment have also ended up in
the courts, where they have yet to be settled.
We can be thankful that our Founders recognized
the danger of having too much power in one branch of government.
More than two-and-a-quarter centuries after the Constitution was
written, the checks and balances it established remain crucial to
preserving our democracy and the will of the people.
