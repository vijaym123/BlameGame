Last week President Obama delivered his State of the Union Address. The
President gave a good speech, as he usually does, but I believe he
missed an opportunity to talk about specific ways we can work together
to expand opportunity and strengthen the middle class.
He talked a lot about some of the same policies to increase
taxes and spending that have not worked to grow the economy or help
wages keep up with inflation. Specifically, his $320 billion tax
increase on small businesses, savings, and investment in order to pay
for more Washington spending hurts upward mobility and opportunity.
The President did talk about a few areas of bipartisan agreement - such
as giving American workers a chance to compete on a level playing field
by knocking down barriers to our exports. I was pleased to hear him
talk about the importance of exporting more goods stamped 'Made in
America' to consumers around the world. Putting actions behind those
words should be at the top of his agenda. Read more here
.
He also referenced the need for business tax reform that grows wages,
creates jobs, and improves the economy. This is another area where we
might find common ground to help ensure American workers are
competitive.
I was also pleased that the President acknowledged the need to ensure
American workers have the skills they need to fill open jobs. I've
worked a lot on skills training, and just last week I introduced
bipartisan legislation to better prepare students for 21st century jobs
called the Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act
.
While I was disappointed that a lot of the President's speech was
largely about more of the same big government solutions that haven't
worked over the past six years, I remain committed to working with
anyone, Republican or Democrat, toward commonsense solutions that will
increase economic opportunity for all Americans, including more jobs,
better wages, and lower costs for health care, education, and energy.
