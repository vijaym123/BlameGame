Rubio Visits London On Official Trip,
Delivers Major Speech On The
Transatlantic Alliance
During his three day official visit to
London, Marco met with British government
officials to discuss the future of the
transatlantic alliance. On Tuesday, he
delivered a major foreign policy speech,
which included the following excerpt:
Rubio: In the end, freedom
will triumph in this world. I am sure
of that, just as I am sure that it will
be the United States and the United
Kingdom leading the way. That is why I
stand before you optimistic today.
Optimistic about where America is
headed and where we
working
together with our European allies
will be able to take the ideals
of freedom, economic opportunity, and
human rights. Together, we will
be able to respond to the challenges of
the twenty-first century, just as our
forbears faced those of the last. And
when we do, our children will inherit a
world better than the one that was left
to us.

Rubio: D.C. Dysfunction Hurting
Military, Veterans
In
The Tampa Tribune , Marco outlines
the harmful effects the Senates
Democratic majority leadership is having
on our military and veterans. He explains
how worthy, bipartisan ideas to improve
the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), major legislation that spells out
our priorities for most national security
and military matters, are being blocked.
Below is an excerpt from the article:
Rubio: For example,
Ive joined one Democratic
colleague, Jon Tester from Montana, in
an effort to raise the salaries of
active duty military personnel by 1.8
percent. In its current form, the NDAA
includes President Obamas
original budget request for a 1.0
percent increase
even though a
2004 law requires that this
years increase be 1.8 percent.
During this time of record debt, we
believe doing right by our service
members, their families and existing
law is our duty to them; therefore,
weve offered a spending offset
that prioritizes this pay increase.
Unfortunately, even with
broad bipartisan support, the
Senates Democratic leadership
has decided to block any consideration
of this measure, short changing our
troops in the process.

Rubio Welcomes USS New York To
Mayport
On Friday, Marco welcomed the arrival
of the USS New York to Naval Station
Mayport. It is the first ship to be
relocated to Mayport as part of the new
Amphibious Ready Group being stationed in
Florida under the direction of the U.S.
Navy. In heralding the ships
arrival, Marco issued the following
statement:
In Florida, we are blessed to
have several military communities
throughout our state. I am excited
about the USS New Yorks arrival
and welcome its crew members and their
families to Jacksonvilles
military family.
Our state and nation are
grateful for their service and
sacrifices, and now we are proud to
call them our neighbors. We are also
humbled to now be the home port of a
ship built after 9/11 with remnants of
the World Trade Center.
Mayport is a crown jewel of
our Navy and a key part of our national
security infrastructure. The on-time
relocation of the USS New York from
Norfolk is a critical step toward the
strategic dispersal of our naval fleet,
and I will continue working to ensure
the two remaining ships that will
comprise the Amphibious Ready Group
eventually arrive on schedule as
well.
Rubio Calls For Alan Gross
Unconditional Release
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the fourth anniversary of the
unjust incarceration of Alan Gross, an
American being held hostage by the Castro
regime in Cuba:
Alan Gross is a hostage being
held captive by a state sponsor of
terrorism, and his liberation is long
overdue. Instead of considering more
unilateral concessions to the Castro
regime that enrich and help fund its
repressive machine, the U.S. should
pursue meaningful measures to secure
Mr. Gross immediate,
unconditional release.
Rubio Comments On Passing Of Nelson
Mandela
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the death of Nelson
Mandela:
The world has lost one of
historys most important figures,
though Nelson Mandelas example
will live on for generations to come.
Men and women striving for justice and
fairness around the world have drawn
inspiration from Nelson Mandela, and he
showed South Africans and the entire
world what the power of forgiveness
truly means and can accomplish. My wife
Jeanette and I send our condolences to
the Mandela family and to the people of
South Africa.
