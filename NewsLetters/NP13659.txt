Tell Mark: Budget Deal House and Senate Budget Committee Chairmen Paul
Ryan (R-WI) and Patty Murray (D-WA) have reached a budget agreement
that raises 2014 spending to just over $1 trillion, up from the
previous level of $967 billion. It includes $85 billion in deficit-reduction
provisions over the next ten years but restores $63 billion in
spending that had been previously cut through sequestration. The House is
scheduled to vote on this deal tomorrow. Do you believe Congress should
pass this budget? Yes No Undecided *By answering this survey, you are
