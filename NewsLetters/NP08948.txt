Remembering D-Day
Seventy years ago today, more than 160,000 Allied
troops landed on a 50-mile stretch along the coastline of Normandy,
France, in what became the largest seaborne offensive in history
Operation Overlord. In the battle known as D-Day, more than 4,000 Allied
troops died, including 2,500 Americans, but their sacrifice paved the
way to the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Today, Senator Corker released the following statement
honoring the 70th anniversary of D-Day:
Thousands of Americans were called to serve during World
War II, and they met that call with honor, dignity and courage. We
owe tremendous gratitude to the Greatest Generation and the many
Tennesseans who bravely stormed the beaches of Normandy for the causes of
liberty and freedom. May our generation and future generations honor
their legacy by working to strengthen our country, and may we all learn
from their example of putting the nations interests above their
own.

Tennessee Families, Businesses
Cannot Afford Costly Washington Regulations
On Thursday,
Senator Corker backed legislation to rein in the administrations
proposed rules on fossil fuel power plants announced earlier this week by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Low-cost,
reliable energy is essential to driving economic development and job growth,
but Im concerned the presidents proposal will limit our countrys
use of abundant resources and increase the cost of energy, said
Corker. This bill would ensure Tennessee families and businesses are not
burdened by costly, heavy-handed Washington regulations.
The
Protecting Jobs, Families, and the Economy from EPA Overreach Act
(S.2414) would ensure that before the EPA establishes any new regulation
limiting carbon dioxide emissions from new or existing power plants, the
administration must certify that the regulation will not eliminate
jobs, slow economic growth, increase electricity rates, or jeopardize
the reliability of electricity delivery.
