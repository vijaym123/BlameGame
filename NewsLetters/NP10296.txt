Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to Join Rep. Candice Miller on Tour of Unfinished Blue Water Bridge Plaza
WASHINGTON&#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, will host Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson on Friday, May 2 nd
to tour Customs and Border Protection operations at the Blue Water Bridge.
The tour will focus on ongoing efforts to complete the unfinished plaza and additional efforts to expedite
crossing.
Miller on tour of unfinished plaza at the Blue Water Bridge:
&#8220;After 9/11, when international screening protocols were strengthened, all stakeholders &#8211; local, state and federal &#8211; recognized the need to expand the American plaza at the Blue Water Bridge to address traffic
backups and increase the flow of commerce and committed to getting the job done. The Canadians have improved their plaza, while the U.S. has not.
&#8220;This commitment was reinforced in the Beyond the Border Agreement signed by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper in 2011, which stated the following:
&#8216;We commit to make significant investments in physical infrastructure at key crossings to relieve congestion and speed the movement of traffic across the border. Examples of the significant
infra&shy;structure upgrades may include: customs plaza replacement and redevelopment, additional primary inspection lanes and booths, expanded or new secondary inspection facilities, and expanded or new connecting roads, highway interchanges, and bridges.
&#8216;As initial respective priorities, the United States will put forward for approval Alexandria Bay, New York;
Blue Water Bridge, Michigan ; Lewiston Bridge, New York; Peace Bridge, New York for such investments.&#8217;
&#8220;After several years of no funding authorizations whatsoever for any of the land ports of entry, the President&#8217;s 2015 budget only authorizes funds for improvements to Alexandria Bay in New York.
However, the
fact is that the Blue Water carries more trade and commerce than any of the other ports mentioned in the Beyond the Border Agreement.
&#8220;Finishing the Blue Water Bridge plaza was a commitment made by the President in 2011 that this Administration has yet to live up to. So the simple question is, are we committed to this or not?
&#8220;I think that Secretary Johnson&#8217;s visit on Friday is a positive sign and will be instructive to him and the Administration on the need to get this job done.
&#8220;I first met Secretary Johnson the day he was confirmed by the Senate and he dropped by my office to visit.
I was very impressed by this outreach and used the opportunity to show him a large photo of the Blue
Water Bridge with a traffic backup that hangs in my office, and I explained the need for the plaza expansion.
He expressed interest in addressing the issue, even requesting a copy of the photo. I was more than happy to provide him with a copy, and I am glad
he is demonstrating that his interest in the plaza is serious by visiting in person.
&#8220;Over the last decade, federal and state agencies have allocated tens of millions of dollars on planning, condemnation and demolition to accommodate a new plaza at the Blue Water Bridge.
After working, reworking
and downsizing the plan over the span of the last decade, acres of shovel-ready land sit vacant while the need to complete this important project remains. Expanding this plaza and our screening capabilities is not only important to our security, but essential
to our local and national economy.&#8221;
Additional details for media opportunities surrounding Friday afternoon&#8217;s tour are forthcoming.
