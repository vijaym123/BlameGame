Friend ,
Thank you for sharing your thoughts in our recent survey. I truly appreciate your input and feedback.
As the next session of Congress quickly approaches, I am determined to continue to advocate for common sense solutions that will move our country forward.
It is the job of Congress to tackle the nation&#39;s most difficult problems and I hope that I will be able to send you positive updates in the coming year.
Once again, thank you for all that you have done. Without you, this wouldn&#39;t be possible.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
