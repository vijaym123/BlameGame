Text of Dear Colleague
Letter
(These folks
arent cutting their military budgets)
Support a Strong National Security
Budget
NO on Price 1, YES on Price
2
Dear
Colleague;
On Wednesday the House will vote on our fiscal year
2016 budget resolution. As you know, there will be two versions of
Chairman Prices budget that we will consider. The first version (Price
1), which is the version that was reported out of the Budget Committee,
is $20 billion below President Obamas request for defense spending
UNLESS Congress passes and President Obama signs into law $20 billion
or more in entitlement reform savings. This is by no means guaranteed.
Even if it does happen, it makes budgeting that amount very
problematic.
We urge you to support
Chairman Prices defense alternative (Price 2) which fully funds defense
at President Obamas requested level without relying on the President
to agree to entitlement reforms.
Now is the absolute wrong time to cut our national security budget.
The Russians have invaded Ukraine. ISIS is spreading. Iran is pursuing
nuclear weapons. North Korea is pursuing a submarine launched
ballistic missile to go with their nuclear program. Our military just
returned from fighting Ebola in Africa and is supporting the fight against
Boko Haram. China is growing more belligerent and threatening our
friends and allies in Asia. And President Obamas foreign policy is a
disaster which puts us at even greater risk.
Our military has already faced drastic cuts. The Air Force is
the
smallest it has ever been .
The
Army is on a path to being the
smallest since
1940 . And the Navy will soon be the
smallest since 1915 .
For all
these reasons, we simply cannot cut national security spending right now.
We urge you support the second Price budget substitute which fully
funds our national security budget.
Sincerely,
Doug Lamborn
