Dear Friend,
Today, Ill be at the New Hampshire
Veterans Home in Tilton where Ill have the privilege to meet with some
heroes in residence who fought to defend our nation. On Memorial Day, its
important to remember the tremendous debt we owe to those men and
women who have sacrificed for our country and way of life. One of the
most important ways we can honor those who have served is by committing
to the care of our veterans when they return home. In New Hampshire, we
are proud of our states significant contribution towards the defense
of our nation and strong tradition of military service. We must
continue to honor that tradition by making sure our veterans have access to
the healthcare and services they
need.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
