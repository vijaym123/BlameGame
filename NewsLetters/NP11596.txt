Congressman Lamborn Supports Rolling
Back Overreach by the Executive
Branch
3/14/14
This week in Washington, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined bipartisan House
majorities in working to restore balance to our system of co-equal
branches of government.
H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE the
Law Act of 2014: Passed by a bipartisan majority of 233 to 181, this
bill establishes a procedure for the House of Representatives or the
Senate to authorize a lawsuit against the executive branch for failing to
faithfully execute the laws.
Specifically, the bill allows the
House or Senate to adopt a resolution authorizing a civil action if
the President or any federal officer establishes or implements a policy
to refrain from enforcing the
law.
H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014:
Passed by a bipartisan majority of 244 to 171, this bill
amends federal law to require the Attorney
General to report to Congress any time a federal official establishes or
implements a formal or informal policy to refrain from enforcing any
provisions of federal
law.
" The Founding Fathers set up a system with equal branches of
government. As a former constitutional law professor, President Obama should
know better when it comes to executive overreach. However, the
President regularly ignores or delays provisions of laws that he
dislikes.
Examples include delaying vast sections of Obamacare,
immigration law, welfare law, and environmental law. It is inappropriate for
any President to overstep his constitutional limits, that is why the
House took an important step this evening to stand up for our
constitutional system of government."
