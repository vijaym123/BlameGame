July 27, 2014
Friends,
It's been a great weekend here in Ohio's 14th District after
many busy legislative weeks. Tomorrow I'll head back to Washington to
finish our July session in the House.
Before we dive into
these upcoming busy days, I wanted to take a moment to share some
highlights from this past week with you:
1. Growing
our economy through infrastructure investment
On
Monday, I had the opportunty to help kick off a new infrastructure
project with the City of Geneva and Harpersfield Township. In 2013, the
U.S. received a D grade on its infrastructure report card. One of the
best ways the government can help get the economy going is by
rebuilding it, and in my mind theres no better place to start than Northeast
Ohio.

2. Simplifying the tax
code for Ohio families
The House passed three
bills this week with the goal of simplifying the tax code to make life
easier for hardworking families. With one child who just
graduated from college and two still in, I'm all too familiar with the
financial hits parents have to take to make college possible for their kids.
H.R. 3393, the
Student and Family Tax Simplification Act ,
consolidates and makes permanent a number of higher education tax
benefits to make them more accessible to families facing the climbing costs
of college tuition. We also passed H.R. 4935, the
Child Tax Credit
Improvement Act , to update the existing tax credit for families
based on inflation and eliminate the marriage
penalty.
3. Protecting our nation and our allies from
terrorism
I was proud to join all of my House colleagues in a
unanimous vote to pass H.R. 4411, the
Hezbollah International Financial
Prevention Act,
this week. This bill tightens economic
sanctions on Hezbollahs vast foreign assets and targets its international
narcotics trafficking rings. We must stand firmly with our ally Israel
and against terrorist groups that threaten our
nations.
Congratulations to West Geauga High School, my alma mater, for
being named a 2014 Green Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of
Education.
It was a pleasure to visit with the
Weinbergers from South Russell before their U.S. Capitol tour. If you're
planning a trip to DC, please let our office
know!
