Rep. Miller to Co-Chair Congressional Boating Caucus in 114 th
Congress
WASHINGTON &#8211; Today, U.S. Representatives Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement announcing that she will continue serving as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Boating Caucus for the 114th Congress and welcoming new Co-Chair, Representative
Patrick Murphy (FL-18):
&#8220;I grew up on the Great Lakes, and my family was in the marina business. Spending time on the water wasn&#8217;t just a source of recreation for us, it was how we put food on the table and paid the mortgage.
My family, like many others, relied
on the Great Lakes and the marine industry. Therefore, I understand the importance of supporting the boating industry, which accounts for over 338,000 jobs across the country and $36.8 billion in revenue annually. In Michigan, we have one of the highest numbers
of registered recreational boats in the nation and play host to some of the world&#8217;s most competitive races, such as the historic Bayview Mackinac Race, which draws thousands of sailors from around the world to our beautiful Lakes.
Our residents enjoy boating
on the Great Lakes as well as on our river and inland lakes.
&#8220;I believe that we must do more to protect and maintain our nation&#8217;s waterways, which is a goal I have sought to accomplish, in part, as a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
In fact, as the only Member serving
on the Committee from Michigan, I worked tirelessly to ensure that the Great Lakes be designated as a single navigable system, improving their ability to compete for maintenance and dredging funding allocated by the Army Corps of Engineers.
&#8220;This Congress, as Co-Chair of the Boating Caucus, I will continue to advocate for policies and for restoration and maintenance initiatives that support the industry and preserve our precious Lakes and waterways.
I also welcome our new Co-Chair,
Representative Patrick Murphy.
A native Floridian, Representative Murphy shares my love for boating and will undoubtedly be a great advocate for
the
maritime
industry .
Together, we will work to help protect and advance the boating industry and preserve our precious waterways enjoyed by an estimated 88 million boaters across the country.&#8221;
Representative Miller has served as Co-Chair of the Congressional Boating Caucus since the 110th Congress and has been a member of the Caucus since she joined Congress in 2003.
The Caucus is comprised of a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators
and members of the U.S. House of Representatives working together to advance policies that help the recreational marine industry.
Their mission is to improve the economic vitality of the marine industry, help protect the environment and natural resources
used by the boating community, further boating safety awareness, and create more international opportunities for the industry.
According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association,
in Michigan, where there are approximately 771,439 registered recreational boats, the industry&#8217;s economic impact is estimated to be $7.43 billion and supports nearly 60,000 jobs.
