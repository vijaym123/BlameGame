WASHINGTON POST: Boehner-linked SuperPAC to spend $1 MILLION against Brad Schneider
We&rsquo;re running out of options.
-- First, Brad got named one of the MOST vulnerable Democrats in the country. -- now, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s dumped another $1,000,000 on Chicagoland T.V. against Brad. The worst part:
outside Republican spending in our race has now topped $5 million and is likely to keep growing.
Look David, we can win this race and keep Republicans out of Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district, but we have to fight back with everything we&rsquo;ve got. So, we&rsquo;re asking: will you rush $5 or more to our Illinois campaign immediately and help Brad fight back?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
28 days left -- no time to waste.
