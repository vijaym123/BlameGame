Last week, the Department of Defense
announced
that illegal immigrants who have been granted deferral from deportation and also possess certain skills, like language expertise, will now be eligible to join the military.
In 2012, the
Obama Administration first
announced
plans to grant temporary deferral from deportation to young people brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents, if they met certain criteria.
Since April of this year, over
560,000 individuals
have received deferred action from deportation under this program.
This announcement from the Defense Department to enlist illegal immigrants comes at a time when our military faces drastic
cuts
the Army and Marine Corps will lose 100,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively, while the Air Force plans to cut roughly 17,000 airmen in just the next year, the Navy has already cut 1,800 reservists
reducing our forces to pre-World War II levels.
Congressman Forbes believes the Administration must stop prioritizing amnesty over the security of our borders and over our men and women in uniform.
