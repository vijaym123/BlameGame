Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. I value the ability to
share information directly with you every week, and I hope that you
will share it with friends and family, who can sign up here
.

Opportunity Agenda
My Opportunity Agenda, focused on helping to increase hope and
opportunity in South Carolina through education and job skills
training, is central to my work in the United States Senate. Last
night, I discussed the initiatives that I believe will truly address
the causes of poverty in our nation on CNN. You can watch below.

My Statewide Veteran Job Training Initiative
I have talked several times about my statewide veterans job training
initiative recently because it is important to me not only to reach
veterans with this information, but also for all of us who may not have
served to be mindful of just how much we owe our veterans.
I sincerely hope that the information we've been able to provide to
those who have come to workshops so far will help them to be
successful. We have two more workshops in Beaufort and Conway this
coming week-you can learn more about them here
. My staff and I are also looking forward
to our December events on "Available Educational & Entrepreneurial
Resources" and "Resume Writing and Interviewing Skills and a Hiring
Manager's Panel," and veteran job and resource fairs in early 2015.
If you or a loved one are a veteran and need help with a federal
agency, please call my office at (843) 727-4525. While I can't always
promise a favorable outcome, I can promise that we will do everything
that we can to help you.
Confronting Global Security Threats
ISIS is a credible threat, and our country needs a solid long-term plan
to protect our citizens and our interests. At this point, the President
has committed another 1,500 American soldiers to the ground fight
against ISIS and has asked Congress for $5.6 billion in funding to
continue the fight.
Unfortunately, we haven't seen a credible plan.
Watch me discuss our path forward and need to lead on Fox News with
Greta Van Susteren earlier this week:

Interested in a Congressional Internship?
My office is now accepting applications for spring internships from
interested South Carolina undergraduate and graduate students! We have
opportunities in North Charleston, Columbia, Greenville, and
Washington, DC, with duties including answering phones, researching
legislation, attending Congressional hearings and briefings (in
Washington,DC, only), assisting with press tasks and assisting with
constituent letters on issues.
Interns become an integral part of our
day-to-day office functioning, and have the opportunity to learn
first-hand about government in action.
Interested students should contact internships@scott.senate.gov
or (202) 224-6121 to learn more!
It is my honor to serve as your voice in the United States, and I value
your feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact me with suggestions,
concerns, or if my office can ever be of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
