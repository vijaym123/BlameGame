Dear Friend,
As I write this, our nation faces a series of issues that require the
immediate attention of the Congress. We need to return to regular order
in our budget process and work together to craft a budget that works
for our future generations and provides stability and certainty to our
markets. We need to extend emergency unemployment benefits for our
working families who find themselves still struggling to find work. And
we need to end the continued assault on the rights of workers, women,
minorities, and all else who are still subject to the many improper and
immoral prejudices of the past. Swift action must be taken on all of
these matters.
Sadly, however, none of these important issues are being considered by
our Republican-controlled Congress. Instead, they've continued along a
path of repealing everything and fixing nothing. Whether it's repealing
the Affordable Care Act, blocking efforts to protect our right to vote,
or voting to end unemployment benefits for millions, their efforts are
misguided and do nothing to move our nation forward.
For a group of individuals so quick to criticize and question the cost
of everything, they've instead only shown that they know the value of
nothing. Our American families and small business owners work hard each
and every day, and it's beyond time for Congress to attempt to do the
same.
The last week alone, they've played politics with the good faith and
credit of these United States, voted to roll back important
environmental legislation I have fought for over the last 60 years, and
even voted to water down important regulations that help curb the
reckless actions of big banks and fat cats on Wall Street. Republicans
even claimed to introduce an alternative to the Affordable Care Act,
when in reality we just got more of the same political spin. I'm
willing to work together to make changes that cover more people for
less money, but I haven't yet seen such a proposal from my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle. All of these stunts do nothing more
than derail our progress on the road to recovery and further hinder our
working families' pursuit of the American Dream.
I'm going to continue to push for this Congress to tackle the more
pressing matters of the day, because I know that wasting both the time
and dime of our taxpayers is not an honest, fair, or proper approach.
I'll continue to fight to extend unemployment benefits for all who rely
on them, work to protect the many workers and industries important to
Southeast Michigan, and continue to reiterate to my colleagues that the
words "compromise" and "conciliation" should not be considered dirty
words in Washington, but should instead be recognized as the very
cornerstone of our democracy.
As your representative, I will continue to update you on all matters
being considered by Congress, be they the important issues we must
immediately tackle, or the wasteful partisan games we've seen that
hinder our progress and move Michigan backwards. It remains an honor,
privilege, and an absolute blessing to serve you.
Sincerely,
John D. Dingell

Dear
Friend,
As
I
write
this,
our
nation
faces
a
series
of
issues
that
require
the
immediate
attention
of
the
Congress.
We
need
to
return
to
regular
order
in
our
budget
process
and
work
together
to
craft
a
budget
that
works
for
our
future
generations
and
provides
stability
and
certainty
to
our
markets.
We
need
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
benefits
for
our
working
families
who
find
themselves
still
struggling
to
find
work.
And
we
need
to
end
the
continued
assault
on
the
rights
of
workers,
women,
minorities,
and
all
else
who
are
still
subject
to
the
many
improper
and
immoral
prejudices
of
the
past.
Swift
action
must
be
taken
on
all
of
these
matters.
Sadly,
however,
none
of
these
important
issues
are
being
considered
by
our
Republican-controlled
Congress.
Instead,
they've
continued
along
a
path
of
repealing
everything
and
fixing
nothing.
Whether
it's
repealing
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
blocking
efforts
to
protect
our
right
to
vote,
or
voting
to
end
unemployment
benefits
for
millions,
their
efforts
are
misguided
and
do
nothing
to
move
our
nation
forward.
For
a
group
of
individuals
so
quick
to
criticize
and
question
the
cost
of
everything,
they've
instead
only
shown
that
they
know
the
value
of
nothing.
Our
American
families
and
small
business
owners
work
hard
each
and
every
day,
and
it's
beyond
time
for
Congress
to
attempt
to
do
the
same.
The
last
week
alone,
they've
played
politics
with
the
good
faith
and
credit
of
these
United
States,
voted
to
roll
back
important
environmental
legislation
I
have
fought
for
over
the
last
60
years,
and
even
voted
to
water
down
important
regulations
that
help
curb
the
reckless
actions
of
big
banks
and
fat
cats
on
Wall
Street.
Republicans
even
claimed
to
introduce
an
alternative
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
when
in
reality
we
just
got
more
of
the
same
political
spin.
I'm
willing
to
work
together
to
make
changes
that
cover
more
people
for
less
money,
but
I
haven't
yet
seen
such
a
proposal
from
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle.
All
of
these
stunts
do
nothing
more
than
derail
our
progress
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
further
hinder
our
working
families'
pursuit
of
the
American
Dream.
I'm
going
to
continue
to
push
for
this
Congress
to
tackle
the
more
pressing
matters
of
the
day,
because
I
know
that
wasting
both
the
time
and
dime
of
our
taxpayers
is
not
an
honest,
fair,
or
proper
approach.
I'll
continue
to
fight
to
extend
unemployment
benefits
for
all
who
rely
on
them,
work
to
protect
the
many
workers
and
industries
important
to
Southeast
Michigan,
and
continue
to
reiterate
to
my
colleagues
that
the
words
"compromise"
and
"conciliation"
should
not
be
considered
dirty
words
in
Washington,
but
should
instead
be
recognized
as
the
very
cornerstone
of
our
democracy.
As
your
representative,
I
will
continue
to
update
you
on
all
matters
being
considered
by
Congress,
be
they
the
important
issues
we
must
immediately
tackle,
or
the
wasteful
partisan
games
we've
seen
that
hinder
our
progress
and
move
Michigan
backwards.
It
remains
an
honor,
privilege,
and
an
absolute
blessing
to
serve
you.

John&#160;D.
