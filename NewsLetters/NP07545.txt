David, sorry to bother you so early on a Saturday, but I&rsquo;m a little worried.
What&rsquo;s going on? Ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling just had his biggest fundraising quarter of the election.
Now, he&rsquo;s sitting on $500,081 in cold hard cash. You can be
sure
every nickel will be used on deceptive ads trashing my record.
Look, we can fight back -- and win -- but only if we hit each and every goal between now and the election. Will you pitch in a few dollars before midnight?

Here&rsquo;s the truth: I&rsquo;m working hard for you in Congress, I&rsquo;m working hard for our Democratic priorities, and I&rsquo;m working hard to get our message out to voters.
But without the funds to fight back against Mr. Schilling, our grassroots campaign could be in trouble. So I&rsquo;m asking, please chip in what you can: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
Thanks for all that you do,
