Affordable Care Act FAQ
Monday, February 10, 2014
Dear Friend,
Our
nation&rsquo;s health care system has always been complicated. And I know
that as the Affordable Care Act is being implemented
there has been some confusion about enrollment and understanding
coverage options or changes. I wanted to take a minute to provide you
with some resources that will hopefully answer some questions you might
be having, as well as point out some upcoming deadlines
so you can get your family and friends connected to quality healthcare.
In California, the health care exchange is known as Covered California. For individuals who have selected a plan through
this site, many questions like&mdash; how to check on enrollment or when you&rsquo;ll receive your insurance card&mdash;are answered on their
FAQ page .
To check the status of an application for a Covered California health insurance plan, log in to your account at
www.CoveredCA.com
and
click the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; button to view your application summary page. If
you do not see a plan or program listed with an enrollment date, you
still may need to pick your health insurance plan. You can also call
(800)
300-1506
for assistance.
If
you filled out a paper application, you will get a notice from Covered
California in the mail after your application
is processed, and you will also get a premium bill from your health
insurance plan. If you have not received a notice or a premium bill, you
can call Covered California at
(800)
300-1506
to check on the status of your application.
Once a plan is selected, your specific insurance company is the main contact for questions, especially about billing
or the status of your health insurance card.
The insurance companies have special phone numbers and websites for Covered California enrollees:
AnthemBlue Cross
(855)
634-3381
www.anthem.com/ca/paymentlanding
Blue Shield of California
(888)
256-3650
www.blueshieldca.com/coveredca
If
you need to make a payment: Enrollees should pay the health insurance
company, not Covered California. Your health
insurance company should mail you an enrollment package and membership
ID cards within 10 business days of the health insurance company
receiving your premium payment.
If you applied and chose a health insurance plan before December 1, you should have received a bill. If you have not
received a bill, please call your health insurance provider.
For those whose insurance company dropped their plan and still have not
chosen a new one, you may be eligible for a lower cost catastrophic-only
plan. Click

for details.
And if you haven&rsquo;t applied yet, you can still enroll through March 31. I encourage you to join over half a million
Californians who have already enrolled in Covered California and get covered!
Finally,
how has enrollment in the Affordable Care Act gone for you your family?
