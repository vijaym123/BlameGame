Easter Greetings
Dear Friend,
Teri joins me in sending blessed Easter Greetings to our friends and neighbors celebrating on this joyous day.
This holiday reminds us to stay optimistic; that the inevitable times of darkness and despair will always pass and goodness will prevail.
This Easter we pray for our men and women in uniform and for the military families whose loved ones are deployed.
We remember especially those who have given their lives in defense of our freedoms.
Mindful that I work for you, I remain
Yours in Freedom,
Scott Rigell
The Recent View from VA-02!
Scott met with Concerned Veterans for America.
Scott met with representatives of the Alzheimer's Association.
Scott was recognized by the Healthcare Leadership Council (HLC) for his ongoing support of patient-centered medical progress.
Teri and Scott ran into a few of the young ladies from Girl Scout Troop #142 in Virginia Beach earlier this spring - and couldn't resist the cookies!
Scott asked this group of young Americans at Renaissance Academy to raise their hands if a member of their immediate family has served our nation in the armed forces - more than half the kids in the room raised their hands.
Thank you to all who have served so that we may remain free.
You Should Go!
to the Norfolk Botanical Garden!
Check out the Spring Gardens which feature millions of blooms.
According to the Gardens website, in 1938 a grant paid 220 African-American workers to clear 30 acres of dense vegetation, sowing the seeds for what is now one of the largest collections of azaleas, camellias, roses, and rhododendrons on the East Coast.

Meet the Team!
This week, were proud to feature two of our District Staff members.
Bre and Richard work with our military and veterans communities.
Read more about them below.
Bre Kingsbury, Military Liaison for Representative Scott Rigell since January 2011
About Bre:
Im married to a Naval officer, love to cook, travel, and read. I also love going to military homecomings.
I cry every time I see a family reunited after a long deployment.
How She Serves VA-02:
Im the main liaison between our local military leadership, service members, and their families in the district. I am also responsible for our Congressional Nominations to our nations service academies. The best part of my job is when I can help a service member or their family get a successful outcome for an issue they were having with the federal government.
Also, meeting so many brave men and women who selflessly put our country first is awe-inspiring.
One of Bres Most Rewarding Cases:
I was able to help one military dependent get a refund of over $11,000 back from Tri-Care. It was a long case that involved many phone calls, but I was happy our office was able to get a positive result for her.

Richard Post, Veterans Case Worker for Representative Scott Rigell since April 2013
About Richard:
Proud father to three grown children and eight grandchildren. Education: BS Business Administration, Retired Navy (Vietnam era).
Hobbies are reading, enjoying classical music, and building model ships.
How He Serves VA-02:
I process all veterans and dependent compensation, disability, and miscellaneous claims.
I work primarily with the Veterans Affairs Department, the Department of Defense, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Army.
I have an average of 35 to 40 cases open at one time.
Waiting for the federal government to work and its lack of flexibility can sometimes be frustrating, but I enjoy my job because my work actually makes a difference in a veteran or their familys life.
One of Richards Most Rewarding Cases:
I had an 80 year old widow who was about to be evicted from her assisted living community.
Her son had applied for Aid and Attendance for her.
The assisted living community was not going to extend her care any longer because her bill was in excess of $11,000.
On the day she was to be evicted we managed to get the VA to approve her claim for Aid and Attendance and managed to convince the assisted living community to agree to let her stay until they got their money.
If you need help with a federal agency, please
get in touch with us .
It is our honor to serve you.
