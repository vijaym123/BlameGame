Dear Friend,
Yesterday, the House passed the
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act of 2015 a bill that I voted against. I have serious
concerns about the continued assault on programs that serve the most
vulnerable among us. There has been a disturbing trend of underinvestment
in programs and in our nations critical
infrastructure.
Specifically, the bill included substantial cuts
in:
TIGER
grants
Low income
housing
Public
housing
Fair housing initiatives
Instead of
focusing on making drastic cuts, we should be making the investments in
our communities that give us significant returns. Funding transportation
and housing initiatives has a positive cost-benefit ratio for our
nation, providing a substantial financial gain over the long term.
Cutting these programs is short-sighted policy that ends up harming our
economic development because it limits the amount of people who can buy
into the system.
The House Majority has continued to
demonstrate a short-term approach to governing that chooses to abandon
critical public needs like housing and infrastructure. I disagree with this
approach. We are in this together as Americans and we must not accept
policy that leaves people behind. I will continue to be a strong voice
in the fight for policy that works for everyone.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
