I&rsquo;m going to be totally honest with you: I need your help TODAY, or we could be in real trouble.
Friend -- I&rsquo;m going to be totally honest with you:
I need your help TODAY, or we could be in real trouble.
Either we raise enough by midnight to fund our
Get Out the Vote Campaign
to win the South and the Senate, or we risk letting the Republicans rip away our Senate majority.
I&rsquo;m not exaggerating:
If we want to win this, we need to start GOTV operations RIGHT NOW.
Friend, will you pitch in TODAY to fund our final Get Out The Vote Campaign? We need your help! Your gift will be triple matched until midnight and sent directly to battleground states.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Your support has allowed us to make smart investments in voter mobilization. The
New York Times
reports that &ldquo;More voters have been contacted by Democratic than Republican campaigns in [nearly] every state&rdquo;!
If we keep this up, we&rsquo;ll hand the GOP a devastating setback on November 4. But with less than four weeks till Election Day,
we MUST get Democrats out to the polls&hellip; starting TODAY. And we desperately need your help to do it.
Friend, GOTV will win us this election -- IF we can fund it. Will you give so we can bring out every single Democratic voter?
YOU are what will drive our victory.
Thank you,
Joe Biden
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
