New Study:
Affordable Care Act
Lowers Uninsured Rate
The results are in: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is helping
millions of people get health insurance who didnt have health
insurance before.
According to a new report released by the
Commonwealth Fund , 9.5 million additional adults ages 19 to
64 are now covered by insurance, and the national adult uninsured
rate declined from 20 to percent to 15 percent.
The Commonwealth
study also reveals that a large majority of enrollees report that they
are generally happy with their health care coverage, and almost 80%
said they were optimistic that the ACA would improve their access to
care.
Rep. Levin Supports Not My Boss Business
Act
One of the
provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires all employer health
plans to include approved contraception as part of preventive care for
women.
Access to contraception helps to prevent unintended
pregnancies, control timing of planned births, and treat medical conditions
like endometriosis.
On June 30, the Supreme Court essentially
nullified that provision.
In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Inc., the
Court said that most corporations are not required to provide
contraceptive coverage under the ACA if doing so does not comply with the owners
religious beliefs.
This decision allows some employers to deny
their employees critical coverage that has already made a major impact
on the lives of many women.
In response, Rep. Levin and more than 140 other House
lawmakers have introduced the Protect Womens Health from Corporate
Interference Act [ H.R. 5051 ], also called the Not My
Boss Business Act.
This legislation seeks to overturn the
Supreme Courts decision in the Hobby Lobby case to ensure that an
employer who offers health insurance coverage to its employees is prohibited
from denying coverage of specific health care servicesincluding some
forms of contraceptionwhere the coverage of such services is
required by other Federal
laws.
Protecting the Right to Vote
There is no more
fundamental right in our nation than the right to vote.
Voting is
the essential right that helps protect all our other rights.
In
1965, Congress approved the Voting Rights Act (VRA).
Before
passage of the VRA, some states employed poll taxes, literacy tests, and
other discriminatory obstacles to
voting.
Last June, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme
Court undercut the VRA by invalidating a key section of the law.
This re-opened the door to state and local election laws that would
unfairly limit the right to vote.
Since the Courts ruling, a
number of states with histories of discrimination have already moved
forward with new voting laws.
In response, Rep. Levin and more than
160 other House lawmakers have introduced a bill [ H.R.
3899] t o restore the Voting Rights Act.
The next step is to
convince the House Leadership to schedule a vote on H.R.
3899.
