Congressman Perry Hosts Service Academy Night for Students Seeking Nominations
Washington, D.C.
Students from Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin and York Counties who are interested in applying for admission to one of the United States Service Academies are encouraged to attend an informational session hosted by Congressman Scott Perry from 7:00 p.m.
9:00 p.m. on Tuesday, May 13 at Dallastown High School, 700 New School Lane, Dallastown, Pennsylvania.
Congressman Perry and members of his staff will outline the process for applying for a Congressional Nomination for an Academy appointment.
The U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marines Academy all require students seeking admission to obtain a nomination from a Member of Congress or from the Vice President of the United States.
The United States Coast Guard Academy does not accept Congressional Nominations but will have a representative present for informational purposes.
Students will have the opportunity to review the application process for each military academy and discuss the educational opportunities the academies offer.
All students are welcome to attend this event but only students who reside in the 4th Congressional District of Pennsylvania may apply for a Congressional Nomination with Congressman Perry.
Students may also receive information about the application process by calling one of the Congressmans District Offices. Students in Adams County may call (717) 338-1919; students in Cumberland and Dauphin County may call (717) 635-9504; and students in York County may call (717) 600-1919.
