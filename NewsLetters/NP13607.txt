Dear Neighbor,
In
the latest edition of the Southwest News-Herald, I write about what I
am doing to protect Americans from the disastrous rollout of the
Affordable Care Act. From the malfunctioning healthcare.gov website
to people not being able to keep their health care plan even when they
like it, these problems are unacceptable. Since the law was
passed in 2010, I have authored, co-sponsored, or voted for more than 20
pieces of legislation that would make needed fixes in the health care
law. I am committed to continuing this work as we head into
2014.
Sincerely,
Daniel
Lipinski

Congressman Lipinski Works to Fix
Problems
With Affordable Care Act
The rollout
of the Affordable Care Act has been nothing short of
disastrous.
Despite assurances from the president that you could keep your
plan if you like it, millions of Americans are finding that is not the
case and receiving cancellation letters from their insurers because
their coverage doesn't comply with the new law.
Healthcare.gov , the website that is
supposed to allow people to sign up for coverage and is critically important
to the laws overall success, didnt work for weeks and still is
riddled with bugs and glitches. The situation is improving, but errors
persist.
For those who can sign up through the
website, the insurance providers say the applications given to them are
sometimes duplicated and often incomplete. In some cases, applications
submitted through the website aren't even making it to the insurance
carriers, raising serious concerns about the safety of the personal
information being sent.
All of these stories are inexcusable
and unacceptable.
With the Dec. 23 deadline to enroll for
coverage that's effective on Jan. 1 a little more than a week away, many
of you are understandably concerned and angry about what is going on.
So am I.
I did not vote for the Affordable Care Act because
among other problems in the legislation
I felt it did not do
enough to rein in the skyrocketing health care costs for the working
families I represent. I also believed it is fiscally unsustainable and will
only wind up contributing to the countrys skyrocketing
debt.
While I could not support the law, I am committed to doing
everything I can to fix the multiple problems with it. What we cannot do is
go back to the status quo.
Since the Affordable Care Act
passed in 2010, I have authored, co-sponsored, or voted for more than 20
pieces of legislation to institute needed changes.
In
October, in response to the initial problems with healthcare.gov, I
introduced the Health Care Access Fairness and Penalty Delay Act to require
the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to
certify when the healthcare.gov website is fully operational. Once
the website is deemed operational, people would have 90 days to enroll
in a health care plan. The penalties to comply with the laws
individual mandate would not start until 30 days later. We need to have an
outside entity judging whether healthcare.gov is really working and
Americans should not be punished because of the administrations failure to
have the website functioning.
I recently cosponsored the If
You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act to allow insurance
companies to continue offering plans to existing customers that the law
currently requires them to cancel. Under the bill, there is no time
limit on how long these plans can be renewed, holding the administration
to its promise to Americans that they would not lose their coverage
once the Affordable Care Act took effect.
Just last week, I
led the effort to request that the nonpartisan Government
Accountability Office conduct the independent, comprehensive assessment of
healthcare.gov that Americans deserve. The report will help Congress determine
if an extension of the open enrollment period and a delay of the
penalties imposed on those who do not carry health insurance are
necessary.
If you have questions or comments about how the
Affordable Care Act works and how the law affects you, you are welcome to call
any of my district offices. The contact information is available at
lipinski.house.gov
I
am committed to working with you and on your behalf to develop a health
care system that really works for all
Americans.
