Ms. Fran Castro, Director of the CNMI Division of Coastal Resources Management and newly-appointed Chair of the Coastal States Organization Islands Work Group, and Ms. Erin Derrington, CRM Lead Coastal Planner, visited their congressional office this week while in Washington, DC to attend the CSO winter meeting and NOAA's Coastal Zone Management Program Managers meeting. Thank you both for visiting!
DOI budget includes funding for Rota National Park study - On Thursday, the House Natural Resources Committee held its oversight hearing on President Obama's Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal for the Department of the Interior . The President included funding for the Rota National Park study, which was only just approved last December, in the National Defense Authorization Act . The study will provide opportunity for public input and consider the addition of areas on Rota, already determined to be of national significance , to the National Parks system. This could have an enormously positive effect on Rota's economy and boost tourism throughout the Mariana Islands. The President's FY16 budget also includes funding other programs of benefit to the Northern Marianas, including operation and maintenance of American Memorial Park, Historic Preservation, Land and Water Conservation, and the State Wildlife programs. In my opening statement for the hearing record , I also supported increases for the Empowering Insular Communities program, which is paying for the geothermal explorations in Gualo Rai, the ABC Initiative helping maintain school buildings, the Coral Reef Initiative, and funding for the impact on the Commonwealth of migrants from the Freely Associated States.
Homeland Security funded - We have been reporting on the threat to national security, the wages of Homeland Security Department employees, and grants to the Commonwealth because of gridlock in Congress, but the threat lifted this week. The House passed H.R. 240
on Tuesday, funding the Department through the end of this fiscal year; and President Obama signed the bill into law the next day. The source of gridlock was insistence by the Republican majority that the Homeland Security appropriations bill contain statutory language blocking implementation of executive actions by the President to enforce our immigration laws. Finally, five months into the fiscal year, 75 Republicans joined 182 Democrats in the House to pass a "clean" bill to fund Homeland Security units, such as USCIS, TSA, CBP, FEMA, and the Coast Guard, that protect our borders and are important to the economy of the Northern Marianas. The Commonwealth Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management should now receive its State Homeland Security Grant and Emergency Management Performance Grant - $854,000 and $908,568, respectively, in fiscal year 2014.

Dr. Tim Kock, new Dean of the Cooperative Research, Extension and Education Service (CREES) at Northern Marianas College, and Ms. Patricia Coleman, Nutrition Programs Team Leader/EFNEP Coordinator, were in Washington this week for meetings hosted by the Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The two stopped by their congressional office to introduce the new Dean and update us on the work of NMC-CREES. Also under discussion were provisions we added to the Section 7113 of the Agriculture Act of 2014
to assist NMC and other insular area land-grant colleges to upgrade facilities and equipment for their research. Thank you for visiting and keeping us informed of your work.
$12.6 million released for environmental infrastructure - The Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs released $12.6 million of CNMI Covenant Funds on Thursday to complete two projects important to protecting the environment. The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation received $2.8 million for completion of the Power Plant Oil Pipeline, required by the U.S. District Court to bring CUC into compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. And the CNMI Department of Public Works received $9.8 million for completion of the Puerto Rico Dump Closure project, which will include new community park areas. The projects reduce threats to public health and will make Saipan safer and more attractive for residents and visitors alike. Congratulations to CUC, DPW, and the many CNMI Government offices that have worked on these projects.
$114,959 to Support Wildlife, Habitats and Imperiled Species - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that the Commonwealth's Department of Lands and Natural Resources, Division of Fish and Wildlife, is receiving a $114,959 State Wildlife Grant. The money will be used to conserve priority species and for programs that benefit wildlife and their habitats. Congratulations to the Division of Fish and Wildlife.
Thank you for your good wishes and for your prayers - Thanks to all who kept me in their thoughts on Monday during my back surgery at George Washington University Hospital. I am at my apartment in Washington now, under the care of my wife Andrea and daughter Patricia, and feeling better every day.
