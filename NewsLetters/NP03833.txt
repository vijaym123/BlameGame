Wicker: U.S. Should Heed Lessons of Iraq as Mission Ends in
Afghanistan
Success Should Be Measured by Country's
Stability, Not Troop
Withdrawal
The end of this year marks a new chapter in Afghanistan as
the U.S.-led combat mission formally comes to a close.
On
January 1, only about 13,000 coalition troops will remain, serving
primarily in support and training roles for Afghan
forces.
The recent decision by President Obama to revise the
scope of U.S. operations points to the uncertainty that lies ahead
for Afghanistan.
The Administration has long pushed for a full
withdrawal of forces by the end of 2016, but this arbitrary exit date
fails to take into account the changing conditions on the ground.
Warnings From Military
Leaders
Military commanders and experts have cautioned
that the security situation could rapidly deteriorate as the Taliban
and al-Qaeda seek to regain control.
In July, Gen. Joseph
Dunford, a former top commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed
Services Committee that a more "ambiguous" withdrawal timeline from the
President would have been preferable.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, the
departing commander, expressed similar misgivings to the New York
Times.
"I dont know if I'm pessimistic or optimistic," he said in
an interview this month about the future roles of coalition forces and
Afghan troops.
Indeed, the escalating violence in Afghanistan is worrisome.
In
recent months, the Taliban has intensified its attacks while local security
forces cope with extreme numbers of fatalities.
At this
critical moment, it is important to heed the lessons of Iraq, where the
brutal Islamic State has exploited the power vacuum that was left when U.S.
troops prematurely withdrew.
The Obama Administration should recognize that true success in
Afghanistan will not be measured by the speed with which U.S. troops
depart.
This year's democratic election of Afghan President Ashraf
Ghani and peaceful transition of power were significant steps toward a
stable future.
Likewise, civic participation is on the rise, as
well as life expectancy and education, especially for women.
These gains were fought for by brave Americans, and it is imperative to
protect them.
New Leadership at Defense
Department
This job will be no
small feat for the new Secretary of Defense, who will be responsible
for executing the President's military strategy.
Late last month,
Secretary Chuck Hagel resigned under pressure from the White House.
President Obama has since nominated former deputy defense
secretary Ashton Carter for the
position.
The Senate is expected to consider this confirmation in
January.
Although Mr. Carter has bipartisan support, his hearing before
the Armed Services Committee will no doubt cast scrutiny on the
President's national security policies.
For too long, the President's
worldview has remained alarmingly disengaged even in the face of
growing threats from Syria, Russia, and the Islamic State.
Congress Passes
NDAA
Critical to U.S. military success
in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere
is a comprehensive blueprint of America's defense agenda and the
resources needed to ensure our troops are safe.
The House of
Representatives and Senate recently passed the 53rd annual "National
Defense Authorization Act" (NDAA), which outlines these
priorities.
Mississippi continues to play a
robust defense role, providing support and equipment for our troops to
fulfill their missions.
NDAA upholds this tradition by protecting
Mississippi's National Guard, our aerospace manufacturing industry,
and the next generation of shipbuilding on the Gulf Coast.
As a
member of the Armed Services Committee, I am proud to have worked on
this important piece of legislation and look forward to overseeing its
implementation as our troops protect America's national security
interests around the world.
