Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my periodic newsletter.
My goal is to keep you informed on legislation that is important to you, let you know where I stand on issues which affect our nation, as well as keep you abreast of what I&rsquo;m doing in Washington to promote efficient, limited government.
If there is ever anything I or my staff can do to help you, whether it be booking tours of Washington landmarks, or providing assistance with a federal agency, please let me know.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Doug Lamborn
