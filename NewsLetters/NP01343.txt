David -- Hillary Clinton called for an anti-Citizens United Amendment -- and thanks to you, there&rsquo;s now a wave of momentum behind her!
A whopping 635,688 Democrats have stood up and called for an end to dark money in politics. AMAZING!
Hillary is right -- our campaign finance system is broken. We can&rsquo;t let the right-wing billionaire Koch brothers buy any more elections.
It&rsquo;s time to get their secret money out of politics NOW and forever!
Will you add your name? Join Hillary Clinton and Democrats across the country against Citizens United.
David -- 635,688 people have signed on already. Can you help us get to ONE MILLION supporters?
It&rsquo;s time for Citizens United to be an issue of the past.
Thanks,
