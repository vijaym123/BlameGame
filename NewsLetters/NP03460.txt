Lenexa Kansas Listening Tour Stop
Before leaving for Washington this week, I held a Kansas Listening Tour
stop in Lenexa to hear from Kansans and learn more about issues they
consider critical as the 114th Congress begins. Thanks to the more than
275 Johnson Countians who braved the cold and shared feedback on issues
including veterans' affairs, the Affordable Care Act, foreign policy,
immigration, the ABLE Act, Fair Tax and the budget. Thanks to Lenexa
Mayor Mike Boehm and Deputy Fire Chief Lonny Owens for their assistance
in organizing the event.

2015 Kansas Inauguration
It was great to kick off the 2015 Kansas Legistlative Session over the
weekend with more than 1,300 Kansans celebrating the past and future of
our great state. Best wishes to all the newly elected legislators as
well as the Kansas Board of Education Members, the Justices of the
Kansas Court of Appeals, Justices of the Supreme Court of Kansas, State
Treasurer Ron Estes, Commissioner of Insurance Ken Selzer, Attorney
General Derek Schmidt, Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Lt. Gov. Dr.
Jeff Colyer and Gov. Sam Brownback who were all sworn in today. Here,
I'm pictured with four fellow Hays natives - (L to R) Braden Dreiling,
Heath Kohl, Lt. Gov. Colyer and Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady.
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans-whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call-who wish to make their voice heard.

United Against Terrorism
This week, the world united with France in shock and grief over the
terror attacks in Paris. Over the course of three days, 17 innocent
people, the employees of the magazine Charlie Hebdo and Jewish patrons
of a kosher grocery store, as well as a police officer, were killed by
individuals who believe in committing violence, perpetuating fear and
terrorizing a free and democratic society.
The events of the past week serve as a tragic reminder to the United
States that the world is a dangerous place and there are extremists who
will use their faith as a deceitful disguise in an effort to undermine
the freedoms we hold dear. They will not succeed. We must make certain
our law enforcement, intelligence and military have the support they
need. Millions of citizens in France and leaders around the world
courageously came together as one voice against terrorism. We stand
with France and all who are victims of terror, and we remain resolved
to defend our liberty and way of life.
NBAF Funded in FY 2015 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill
This week, the House Appropriations Committee released the new Fiscal
Year 2015 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill which includes $300
million for construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility
(NBAF). This amount is equal to the funding passed by the Senate
Appropriations Committee last year and builds on the $404 million
appropriated for the construction of NBAF in the FY2014 Omnibus
Appropriations Bill.
I am working to make certain NBAF remains a top priority. This $300
million investment mirrors the funding passed out of the Senate
Appropriations Committee last year and solidifies Washington's support
for the construction of a modern, world-class facility in Kansas, which
will protect Americans against biological threats. I am hopeful this
final funding will soon be passed by both Houses of Congress and
ultimately help create jobs for Kansans in the fields of engineering,
science and technology. The talented young men and women who grow up
here will have more opportunities to work and live in Kansas, which is
poised to become a research epicenter.
Passage of an earlier version of the FY2015 Homeland Security
Appropriations Bill was stalled at the end of 2014 with President
Obama's announcement of an Executive Order granting amnesty to millions
of individuals who have entered the country illegally. As a result,
Congress passed a Continuing Resolution funding the Department of
Homeland Security at FY2014 levels through February 27, 2015. The House
Appropriations Committee Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Security
Appropriations Bill released today must pass the U.S. House of
Representatives and would then be considered by the U.S. Senate to fund
the remainder of FY2015. Click here

Opening Trade with Cuba is Common Sense, Moral Issue
Kansans have enough common sense to know that if something isn't
working after trying it for 54 years, you ought to try something
different. This week, I reiterated my support for changing the
half-century old unilateral U.S. sanctions and regulations that
restrict the ability of American farmers and ranchers to sell their
products to Cuba. My remarks came at the National Press Club launch
event of the U.S. Agriculture Coalition for Cuba (USACC) - a broad
coalition of agricultural organizations that was established to
advocate for greater trade relations between the United States and
Cuba.
Cuba imports the vast majority of its food. Yet, commerce between the
United States and Cuba is severely limited due to a 50-year old trade
embargo and restrictive Treasury Department regulations. Instead of
selling U.S. commodities to Cuba, like homegrown Kansas wheat, our
policies and regulations unilaterally block this market from our
farmers. Meanwhile, when we don't sell commodities to Cuba, somebody
else does. Cuba simply purchases wheat, its second largest import, from
other countries like France and Canada.
Cuba is a natural market for U.S. commodities. It costs about $6-7 per
ton of grain to ship from the United States to Cuba, compared to about
$20-25 per ton to ship from the European Union. It is time to reform
our policies and regulations to allow our farmers to benefit from this
built in advantage.
I am hopeful that economic reforms will also lead to a change in the
nature of the repressive Cuban Government, as well as greater personal
freedoms for the Cuban people. Allowing greater commerce and the travel
of U.S. citizens to Cuba will further promote freedom and liberty by
exposing Cubans to democratic thought and free market principles. And
increasing the standard of living among everyday Cuban citizens will
enable them to make greater demands on their own government to increase
individual and political rights. There is a noble calling to try to
make the world a better place for all citizens, including those who
live in Cuba. Common sense says we ought to do this and, in fact, our
morality says we ought to do this. Let's make the difference; let's
make the change. I think this is a Congress that has the ability to do
that.
I appreciated the invitation to speak at the USACC event this week, and
look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues to improve the
opportunities Americans as producers have in Cuba. Click here

Visiting with Kansas Business
This week, I enjoyed visiting with Kansas business leaders and their
employees at Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital, Bartlett and Company,
Ultra-Ice, Florence Manufacturing and Perceptive Software.
Touring Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital in Overland Park
This week, I visited Mid America Rehabilitation Hospital (MARH) in
Overland Park to see firsthand the care they provide to Kansas patients
to help them return to active and independent lives. MARH is a 98-bed
inpatient rehabilitation hospital that provides a wide range of
physical rehab services through a highly skilled network of physicians,
therapists and nurses. These health care professionals utilize the most
innovative, specialized rehab technology and medical equipment,
providing Kansans with access to the highest quality care. In addition
to rehab care, MARH has specialized inpatient programs for spinal cord
injury, stroke, brain injury, neurological conditions, and amputation.
I enjoyed having to opportunity to tour the 106,000-square-foot
hospital and visit with MARH's executive team and medical staff about
health policy issues affecting rehabilitation care, including the
relationship between Medicare reimbursement and access to quality,
rehab services. Thanks to MARH CEO Troy DeDecker for hosting my visit.
Bartlett and Company
This week, I visited Bartlett and Company whose focus is grain
merchandising, flour milling, feed manufacturing and cattle feeding.
After more than 100 years, Bartlett is still family owned and managed.
They currently operate nine grain facilities in Kansas, and currently
construction another facility in Barton County. Thanks to Jim
Hebenstreit for the informative visit.
Ultra-ICE in Manhattan
While in Manhattan on Monday, I also visited Ultra Electronics-ICE
Corporation in Manhattan. ICE was started more than 30 years ago by
Kansas State students as a company dedicated to excellence and
innovation in aircraft electronics. Ultra Electronics acquired ICE in
May, but retained the original management team. Today, ICE continues to
apply its research in a variety of products and industries -
specializing in the design, manufacturing, qualification and testing of
aerospace electronics. Seventy-five percent of their products are
commercial and the other 25 percent support U.S. military efforts. We
discussed the importance of STEM education and entrepreneurship to
support future manufacturing needs. Thanks to Randy O'Boyle and Gregroy
Thom at Ultra-ICE for the great visit.
Florence Manufacturing Company
On Monday morning, I visited Florence Manufacturing Company in
Manhattan. Florence Manufacturing is the largest manufacturer and
leading product developer of postal approved centralized mailboxes and
parcel lockers in North America with more than 600 employees. They also
recently celebrated their 80th anniversary. Their main message to me
was about the importance of a stable and viable postal service. Thanks
again to Florence President John Alstadt and the Florence employees for
the informative tour.
Perceptive Software
Also on Friday, I had the opportunity to tour Perceptive Software's new
offices in Lenexa. Perceptive Software started as a small startup
company and grew into a company that employees hundreds of people and
are located around the world. The main topics we discussed were how
they manage the growth of the company and their high customer
satisfaction rates. Leadership promotes entrepreneurial thinking
throughout the company and assisting startup companies to grow along
with promotion of STEM education. Thank you to Chief Operating Officer
Darren Knipp and Vice President for the Government Sector Dennis
Cunningham for the informative tour. Thank you also to Lenexa Mayor
Mike Boehm and Blake Schreck, President of Lenexa Chamber for joining
me on the tour.
Saint Luke's Cushing Hospital in Leavenworth
As I traveled back Kansas for the weekend, I stopped in Leavenworth to
tour Saint Luke's Cushing Hospital and visit with hospital
administrators and staff. I have had the opportunity to visit each of
the 128 community hospitals in Kansas. Meeting with Kansas hospital
administrators, physicians, nurses and other staff gives me important
insight on the challenges they face caring for patients, including
challenges created by the Affordable Care Act and other federal
regulations that jeopardize patients' access to care.
This visit was also a way to learn more about renovations and
expansions taking place at the hospital that will benefit the quality
of care provided to patients of Saint Luke's Cushing. The construction
is part of a 5-year, $20 million commitment Saint Luke's Health System
has made to the Leavenworth community. Through this investment, Saint
Luke's Cushing patients will benefit from renovations to the Radiology
Department and the Medical-Surgical Unit, resulting in private rooms
for every patient. Patients will also benefit from a new Intensive Care
Unit, expansion of the Emergency Department, and renovation of the
Medical Plaza Building to facilitate expanded outpatient specialty
care. Thanks to Saint Luke's Cushing CEO Adele Ducharme for hosting my
visit.
Requesting GAO Study of Major Government Technology Investments
Given the failures of major IT investments, such as Healthcare.gov,
making improvements to federal IT procurement policies continues to be
a priority for me. On Wednesday, I wrote to the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) to request a review of how well federal
agencies are implementing incremental information technology
development approaches and assessing the risk of their IT investments.
Last year during Senate Appropriations budget hearings, David Powner of
GAO testified that roughly 200 major federal IT investments totaling
$12.4 billion were at risk or in need of management attention. This
year, the federal government plans to spend $79 billion on IT
investments, of which, approximately $40.4 billion will be spent on
more than 750 major investments. The requested GAO study will help
identify how agencies are managing risk for these projects and will
also reveal how well agencies are developing in an agile fashion, much
like the private sector. This study will be valuable to Congress,
especially the Appropriations Committee, as we determine funding levels
for projects and make certain taxpayer funds are used as efficiently
and effectively as possible to deliver agencies missions. I look
forward to studying this topic further and working to provide more
value to American taxpayers.

United
Against
Terrorism
This
week,
the
world
united
with
France
in
shock
and
grief
over
the
terror
attacks
in
Paris.
Over
the
course
of
three
days,
17
innocent
people,
the
employees
of
the
magazine
Charlie
Hebdo
and
Jewish
patrons
of
a
kosher
grocery
store,
as
well
as
a
police
officer,
were
killed
by
individuals
who
believe
in
committing
violence,
perpetuating
fear
and
terrorizing
a
free
and
democratic
society.
The
eve nts
of
the
past
week
serve
as
a
tragic
reminder
to
the
United
States
that
the
world
is
a
dangerous
place
and
there
are
extremists
who
will
use
their
faith
as
a
deceitful
disguise
in
an
effort
to
undermine
the
freedoms
we
hold
dear.
They
will
not
succeed.
We
must
make
certain
our
law
enforcement,
intelligence
and
military
have
the
support
they
need.
Millions
of
citizens
in
France
and
leaders
around
the
world
courageously
came
together
as
one
voice
against
terrorism.
We
stand
with
France
and
all
who
are
victims
of
terror,
and
we
remain
resolved
to
defend
our
liberty
and
way
of
life.
NBAF
Funded
in
FY
2015
Homeland
Security
Appropriations
Bill
This
week,
the
House
Appropriations
Committee
released
the
new
Fiscal
Year
2015
Homeland
Security
Appropriations
Bill
which
includes
$300
million
for
construction
of
the
National
Bio
and
Agro-Defense
Facility
(NBAF).
This
amount
is
equal
to
the
funding
passed
by
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
last
year
and
builds
on
the
$404
million
appropriated
for
the
construction
of
NBAF
in
the
FY2014
Omnibus
Appropriations
Bill.
I
am
working
to
make
certain
NBAF
remains
a
top
priority.
This
$300
million
investment
mirrors
the
funding
passed
out
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
last
year
and
solidifies
Washington's
support
for
the
construction
of
a
modern,
world-class
facility
in
Kansas,
which
will
protect
Americans
against
biological
threats.
I
am
hopeful
this
final
funding
will
soon
be
passed
by
both
Houses
of
Congress
and
ultimately
help
create
jobs
for
Kansans
in
the
fields
of
engineering,
science
and
technology.
The
talented
young
men
and
women
who
grow
up
here
will
have
more
opportunities
to
work
and
live
in
Kansas,
which
is
poised
to
become
a
research
epicenter.
Passage
of
an
earlier
version
of
the

Opening
Trade
with
Cuba
is
Common
Sense,
Moral
Issue
Kansans
have
enough common
sense
to
know
that
if
something
isn't
working
after
trying
it for
54
years,
you
ought
to
try
something different. This
week,
I
reiterated
my
support
for
changing
the
half-century
old
unilateral
U.S.
sanctions
and
regulations
that
restrict
the
ability
of
American
farmers
and
ranchers
to
sell
their
products
to
Cuba. My
remarks
came
at
the
National
Press
Club
launch
event
of
the
U.S.
Agriculture
Coalition
for
Cuba
(USACC)
&ndash;
a
broad
coalition
of
agricultural
organizations
that
was
established
to
advocate
for
greater
trade
relations
between
the
United
States
and
Cuba.
Cuba
imports
the
vast
majority
of
its
food.
Yet,
commerce
between
the
United
States
and
Cuba
is
severely
limited
due
to
a
50-year
old
trade
embargo
and
restrictive
Treasury
Department
regulations.
Instead
of
selling
U.S.
commodities
to
Cuba,
like
homegrown
Kansas
wheat,
our
policies
and
regulations
unilaterally
block
this
market
from
our
farmers.
Meanwhile,
when
we
don't
sell
commodities
to
Cuba,
somebody
else
does.
Cuba
simply
purchases
wheat,
its
second
largest
import,
from
other
countries
like
France
and
Canada.
Cuba
is
a
natural
market
for
U.S.
commodities.
It
costs
about
$6-7
per
ton
of
grain
to
ship
from
the
United
States
to
Cuba,
compared
to
about
$20-25
per
ton
to
ship
from
the
European
Union.
It
is
time
to
reform
our
policies
and
regulations
to
allow
our
farmers
to
benefit
from
this
built
in
advantage.
I
am
hopeful
that
economic
reforms
will
also
lead
to
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
repressive
Cuban
Government,
as
well
as
greater
personal
freedoms
for
the
Cuban
people.
Allowing
greater
commerce
and
the
travel
of
U.S.
citizens
to
Cuba
will
further
promote
freedom
and
liberty
by
exposing
Cubans
to
democratic
thought
and
free
market
principles.
And
increasing
the
standard
of
living
among
everyday
Cuban
citizens
will
enable
them
to
make
greater
demands
on
their
own
government
to
increase
individual
and
political
rights. There
is
a
noble calling
to
try
to
make
the world
a
better
place
for
all citizens,
including those
who
live
in
Cuba. Common
sense
says
we
ought
to
do this
and,
in
fact,
our
morality
says
we
ought to
do
this. Let's
make
the
difference;
let's
make
the
change. I
think
this
is
a
Congress
that
has
the ability
to
do
that.
I
appreciated
the
invitation
to
speak
at
the
USACC
event
this
week,
and
look
forward
to
working
with
my
Congressional
colleagues
to
improve
the
opportunities
Americans
as
producers
have
in
Cuba.

Bartlett
and
Company
This
week,
I
visited
Bartlett
and
Company
whose
focus
is
grain
merchandising,
flour
milling,
feed
manufacturing
and
cattle
feeding.
After
more
than
100
years,
Bartlett
is
still
family
owned
and
managed.
They
currently
operate
nine
grain

Ultra-ICE
in
Manhattan
While
in
Manhattan
on
Monday,
I
also
visited
Ultra
Electronics-ICE
Corporation
in
Manhattan.
ICE
was
started
more
than
30
years
ago
by
Kansas
State
students
as
a
company
dedicated
to
excellence
and
innovation
in
aircraft
electronics.
Ultra
Electronics
acquired
ICE
in
May,
but
retained
the
original
management
team.
Today,
ICE
continues
to
apply
its
research
in
a
variety
of
products
and
industries
&ndash;
specializing
in
the
design,
manufacturing,
qualification
and
testing
of
aerospace
electronics.
Seventy-five
percent
of
their
products
are
commercial
and
the
other
25
percent
support
U.S.
military
efforts.
We
discussed
the
importance
of
STEM
education
and
entrepreneurship
to
support
future
manufacturing
needs.
Thanks
to
Randy
O'Boyle
and
Gregroy
Thom
at
Ultra-ICE
for
the
great
visit.
Florence
Manufacturing
Company
On
Monday
morning,
I
visited
Florence

Company
in
Manhattan.
Florence

is
the
largest
manufacturer
and
leading
product
developer
of
postal
approved
centralized

and
parcel
lockers
in
North
America
with
more
than
600
employees.
They
also
recently
celebrated
their
80th

Their
main
message
to
me
was
about
the
importance
of
a
stable
and
viable
postal
service.
Thanks
again
to
Florence
President
John
Alstadt
and
the
Florence
employees
for
the
informative

Perceptive
Software
Also
on
Friday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
Perceptive
Software's
new
offices
in
Lenexa.
Perceptive
Software
started
as
a
small
startup
company
and
grew
into
a
company
that
employees
hundreds
of
people
and
are
located
around
the
world.
The
main
topics
we
discussed
were
how
they
manage
the
growth
of
the
company
and
their
high
customer
satisfaction
rates.
Leadership
promotes
entrepreneurial
thinking
throughout
the
company
and
assisting
startup
companies
to
grow
along
with
promotion
of
STEM
education.
Thank
you
to
Chief
Operating
Officer
Darren
Knipp
and
Vice
President
for
the
Government
Sector
Dennis
Cunningham
for
the
informative
tour.
Thank
you
also
to
Lenexa
Mayor
Mike
Boehm
and
Blake
Schreck,
President
of
Lenexa
Chamber
for
joining
me
on
the
tour.
Saint
Luke's
Cushing
Hospital
in
Leavenworth
As
I
traveled
back
Kansas
for
the
weekend,
I
stopped
in
Leavenworth
to
tour
Saint
Luke's
Cushing
Hospital
and
visit
with
hospital
administrators
and
staff.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals
in
Kansas.
Meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses
and
other
staff
gives
me
important
insight
on
the
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients,
including
challenges
created
by
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
other
federal
regulations
that
jeopardize
patients'
access
to
care.
This
visit
was
also
a
way
to
learn
more
about
renovations
and
expansions
taking
place
at
the
hospital
that
will
benefit
the
quality
of
care
provided
to
patients
of
Saint
Luke's
Cushing.
The
construction
is
part
of
a
5-year,
$20
million
commitment
Saint
Luke's
Health
System
has
made
to
the
Leavenworth
community.
Through
this
investment,
Saint
Luke's
Cushing
patients
will
benefit
from
renovations
to
the
Radiology
Department
and
the
Medical-Surgical
Unit,
resulting
in
private
rooms
for
every
patient.
Patients
will
also
benefit
from
a
new
Intensive
Care
Unit,
expansion
of
the
Emergency
Department,
and
renovation
of
the
Medical
Plaza
Building
to
facilitate
expanded
outpatient
specialty
care.
Thanks
to
Saint
Luke's
Cushing
CEO
Adele
Ducharme
for
hosting
my
visit.
Requesting
GAO
Study
of
Major
Government
Technology
Investments
Given
the
failures
of
major
IT
investments,
such
as
Healthcare.gov,
making
improvements
to
federal
IT
procurement
policies
continues
to
be
a
priority
for
me. On
Wednesday,
I
wrote
to
the
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
to
request
a
review
of
how
well
federal
agencies
are
implementing
incremental
information
technology
development
approaches
and
assessing
the
risk
of
their
IT
investments.
Last
year
during
Senate
Appropriations
budget
hearings,
David
Powner
of
GAO
testified
that
roughly
200
major
federal
IT
investments
totaling
$12.4
billion
were
at
risk
or
in
need
of
management
attention.
This
year,
the
federal
government
plans
to
spend
$79
billion
on
IT
investments,
of
which,
approximately
$40.4
billion
will
be
spent
on
more
than
750
major
investments.
The
requested
GAO
study
will
help
identify
how
agencies
are
managing
risk
for
these
projects
and
will
also
reveal
how
well
agencies
are
developing
in
an
agile
fashion,
much
like
the
private
sector. This
study
will
be
valuable
to
Congress,
especially
the
Appropriations
Committee,
as
we
determine
funding
levels
for
projects
and
make
certain
taxpayer
funds
are
used
as
efficiently
and
effectively
as
possible
to
deliver
agencies
missions. I
look
forward
to
studying
this
topic
further
and
working
to
provide
more
value
to
American
taxpayers.
My
email
address
is
only
equipped
to
send
messages.
I
encourage
you
