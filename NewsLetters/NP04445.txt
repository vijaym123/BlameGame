Dear Friends,
Starting today, Delawareans can enroll or re-enroll in a health plan
through the Choose Health Delaware
health insurance marketplace. It is the
second year of the marketplace and it's critical that you get covered
now if you haven't already.
For too long, Americans have spent more on health care than any other
nation and worse yet did not always get better results. As a key piece
of the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance marketplace provides a
gateway to more affordable and higher quality health coverage by
increasing consumer choice in health care options.
In its first year, more than 14,000 Delawareans have used Choose Health
Delaware to find a health plan that works for them. I'm proud that
Delawareans are enrolling in plans that can help them live a healthier
life, perhaps leave a little extra change in their pocket and help to
bring down the long-terms costs for our country in this sector, which
has long been a drag on the American economy.
I urge Delawareans without insurance to protect themselves and their
loved ones by choosing a health care plan for the coming year through
the marketplace at ChooseHealthDE.com
. It's also crucial that that those who enrolled last
year go online to examine whether their plan is still the best fit for
them and find out if anything has changed about the tax subsidies
they're eligible to receive.
Don't have access to a computer? You can also call any of Delaware's
own "Marketplace Guides," who can walk you through the process of
choosing and enrolling in the best healthcare plan for you.
