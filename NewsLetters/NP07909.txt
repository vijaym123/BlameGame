Addressing the Burden of
Student Loans
Most college
students or parents with children in college can agree
college
affordability and student loan debt are major concerns. According to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, federal student loan debt now tops
$1 trillion
a staggering figure which is higher than our countrys
total credit card debt. Our country suffers when we price higher
education out of the reach of students or leave them with years of carrying
an enormous debt burden.
That debt harms our economy by
preventing people from purchasing homes, buying cars and starting
families.
To make matters worse, as
of July 1 st
rates for new student loans increased by 0.8
percent for undergraduate students, graduate students and parent plus
loans.
This did not have to happen
there is legislation in
Congress, which I support, that could have prevented those
increases.
Im a cosponsor of H.R. 1330, the
Student Loan Fairness Act, which would cap rates for federal student
loans at 3.4 percent
reducing interest rates and stopping the
increases that went into effect on July 1 st .
Im also a
cosponsor of H.R. 4582, the Bank on Student Emergency Loan Refinancing
Act (Rep. John Tierneys bill
Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a
similar bill in the Senate), which would allow existing federal and private
student loan borrowers to refinance their loans at last years
rates.
Passing these bills would help
make higher education affordable for hard working students and their
families. For more information please visit my website
you will find
a
Student Loan Toolkit
that offers great
resources and
my statement on the July 1 st
increases . I will continue to work with anyone who is willing to find
solutions on student debt.
If you have any questions about paying
back student loans feel free to call my office
we would be glad to
help you in any way possible.
Ending Child Hunger in
Our Communities
One in every five children in Cook County is at risk of hunger.
Almost 90 percent of low-income children who receive free and reduced
lunch during the school year dont get summer meals. However, there are
resources to help these children.
Last week, I visited the summer meals program at the High Ridge
YMCA, sponsored by the Greater Chicago Food Depository. I met dozens of
children who benefit from the program, as well as volunteers who
donate their time and resources to fight hunger.
There is really a
critical need in our communities to step up our efforts to ensure that
no kid goes hungry.
If
you know someone who needs help or if you can afford to help others,
these resources are available:
