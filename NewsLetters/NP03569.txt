Dear David,
In the first
hour of debate on opening day of the 114 th
Congress, I stood
on the House floor and told the story of a bridge in Bushnells
Basin. Over 100 years old, this bridge has fallen into such disrepair that
firefighters were told to stop using it because their engines might
not make it across, which endangers the people they serve. Our nations
crumbling infrastructure is now literally a life or death
matter.

This is one of many issues in front of Congress that
transcend partisan politics. Though there may be two parties that
rarely seem to agree, it is my hope that we can come together with one
voice to stand up for the American people. We might have been elected
as Democrats or Republicans, but we serve in Congress as Americans,
and it is far past time to tackle the big problems facing our
nation.
As the 114 th
Congress begins, I promise you that I
wont stop working until our Congress is once again worthy of the
American people. I earnestly hope that my colleagues will join me in this
pursuit and come together to serve the common
good.
Sincerely,
Louise
