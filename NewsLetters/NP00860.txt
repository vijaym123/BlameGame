The Lonestar Weekly
This week, America's oldest living World War II veteran
turned 109 years old.
Richard Overton served in the South
Pacific with the 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion from 1942-1945, and
when he returned to the U.S. after the Allies' victory, he built a house
in Austin that he
still
calls home today.
You can read
more about Richard and his incredible story
here .
It's an honor and a
privilege to know Richard Overton.
He's just one of many reasons
I'm proud to call Texas home.
Thank you for your service,
Richard, and thank you to all who sacrifice to keep America safe.
