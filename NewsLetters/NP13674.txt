Our Troops have Engaged and Significantly Damaged al Qaeda Terror Organization in Afghanistan; Time to Bring Them Home
Dec 12, 2013
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) today made the following statement regarding the pending agreement
between the United States and Afghanistan allowing U.S. forces to remain in Afghanistan post-2014.
Miller said:
&#8220;12 years ago on September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorists trained and supported by Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan attacked and murdered nearly 3,000 Americans.
&#8220;Shortly after that horrible day, American armed forces struck back in Afghanistan.
Our troops have performed brilliantly
and have significantly damaged al Qaeda terrorists&#8217; operations and brought the ultimate justice to bin Laden.
At the same time our troops have shed their blood to provide the Afghan people with the opportunity to break from the tyranny of the Taliban and
achieve freedom and liberty.
&#8220;In recent months, our government has offered the additional opportunity provided by a bi-lateral security agreement which
would keep American forces in that country beyond 2014.
To date, Afghan President Karzai has refused to sign that agreement.
&#8220;I believe that agreement should be withdrawn and President Obama should bring our forces home by the end of next year.
Our troops have performed brilliantly.
And now it is time for the Afghan people to step up and secure their own nation.
We have offered freedom and democracy to Afghans and they must either choose to take it or not.
And it is time for our troops to come
home.&#8221;
