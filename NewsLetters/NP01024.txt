WEEK IN
REVIEW
On Monday, I was joined by 67
of my colleagues in the House to send a letter to United States
Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter expressing our concerns about the Armys
Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) as planned, which will begin
transferring Apache helicopters out of the Army National Guard in April
2016, and its potential impact on the National Guard. You can read the
letter
here .
On Tuesday evening, Representatives Rick Crawford (AR-1), French Hill
(AR-2), Bruce Westerman (AR-4), and I went down to the House Floor to
pay our tributes to former U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt
(R-AR-3; 1967-1993) and observe a moment of silence in his
honor. If you missed it, you can
watch the video here !
On Wednesday, my friend, Ryley
Williams, was in Washington to testify before the House Appropriations,
Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee. Ryley is a proud
Bentonville Tiger and shared his story of suffering multiple strokes during
football practice in July 2013 and his remarkable recovery. Proud of
you, Ryley!
After the hearing, Japanese Prime Minister Abe addressed a Joint
Session of Congress. He is the first Japanese leader to address us, and it
was an honor to welcome him. Japan is a beacon of democracy and
continues to champion human rights and economic freedom in a region that
often opposes such values.
On Thursday, the House passed the
Conference Report to Accompany S.Con.Res.
11
by a vote of 226-197. The budget resolution
establishes the budget for the United States government for fiscal year (FY)
2016 and sets forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years
2017 through 2025 ( Roll Call
#183 ). The budget achieves balance by within 10
years without raising taxes, reducing total spending by more than $5
trillion over the next ten years. Moreover, the resolution calls on
the committees of jurisdiction to repeal the Affordable Care Act
through reconciliation, ensures that total defense resources are above the
President's request in the five and ten year budget window, and grows
the economy by more than $400 billion over the next ten years
(according to CBO estimates).
When I was elected to Congress, I
made a commitment to Third District Arkansans to cut spending and to make
the necessary reforms to put our nations finances on a sustainable
path; passing a budget resolution is essential to this process. But
passing the budget resolution we did this week
the first 10-year
balanced budget approved by both chambers since 2001
reflects our
commitment to working together to take the important and necessary steps to
get America back on track and ensure that we are not only spending
responsibly, purposefully, and within our means, just like families across
the Third District, but also leaving our country better than we found
it for our children and grandchildren. I was proud to support
it.
In addition
to the budget resolution, the House passed
H.R. 2029 , the Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of
2016, by a vote of 255-163 ( Roll Call #193 ). H.R. 2029 provides $171
billion in budget authority for the FY 2016 programs and activities
funded in the bill. The bill provides $163.2 billion in discretionary and
mandatory spending for the benefits and medical care
of
our
nation's veterans (an increase of $4.1 billion above the FY 2015 enacted
level) and $7.7 billion in discretionary spending for military
construction and family housing. In total, H.R. 2029 provides $76.6
billion in discretionary funding
$4.6 billion above the FY 2015
enacted level and $2.2 billion below the Presidents budget
request.
Moreover, the House passed
H.J.Res. 43 , a resolution disapproving the action of
the District of Columbia Council in approving the Reproductive Health
Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, by a vote of 228-192
( Roll Call
#194 ). H.J. Res. 43 disapproves and prevents implementation of the
Reproductive Health and Nondiscrimination Act ( RHNDA ) within the
District of Columbia, which was signed by the Mayor of the District of
Columbia on January 25, 2015, in order to prevent employers from taking
punitive action against any employees for using abortion services or
birth control. However,
RHNDA
would restrict the ability of
organizations within the District of Columbia to make employment decisions in
line with their deeply held beliefs regarding reproductive health. These
restrictions would apply to both religious and political
organizations.
Today, the House passed
H.R. 2028 , the Energy and Water Development
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of2016, by a vote of
240-177 ( Roll Call
#215 ). H.R. 2028 provides a total of $35.4 billion in
discretionary funding for the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of
Engineers, and vital national defense nuclear weapons activities in FY
2016. The legislation provides a total of $35.4 billion in discretionary
funding for FY 2016, which is $1.2 billion above the FY 2015 enacted
level and $633 million below the President's budget request. The bill
prioritizes funding for national security by providing increases for
nuclear weapons programs above fiscal year 2015 and protects funding for
critical national and regional waterways.
