With
Thanksgiving and the Christmas season approaching, it is a good time to reflect
on the past year.
Thanksgiving serves as a time for us to
thank God for our family, friends, and each day. Whether someone is
going through a rough patch in their own life or knows someone that is,
it is good to reflect on the meaning of Thanksgiving and give thanks
for the time spent with loved ones and friends.
While I hope
the blessings of this Thanksgiving bring smiles and good cheer to
your family, it is good to take time to pray for the less fortunate and
remember that the holiday season is about community and reaching out to
those in need.
A small token of generosity or volunteering your
time can go a long way to helping those in need of
help.
Have a blessed Thanksgiving!
