Dear Friend,
Last night I had a special guest with me at the President's 2014 State
of the Union speech.
Members of Congress are allowed to bring one person with them to the
Capitol that night, and I really put a lot of thought into who could
help me represent the 4th District at this important event. As soon as
I heard about Jen Walsh, I knew she was the perfect fit.
A teacher at Milford High School, Jen has been volunteering with the
Special Olympics in Milford for over 20 years. When she started helping
out with the local Special Olympics, there were a total of six
athletes. Today, she has grown the program to nearly 170. But here's
the most impressive part - Jen was just named North America Special
Olympics' Coach of the Year, beating out over 120,000 coaches in 35
sports!
So I extended an invitation right away. Luckily, she said yes. On
incredibly short notice, Jen flew down to Washington yesterday and
spent the morning with me and my team, including a very warm welcome
from Banjo, who took an immediate liking to her.
Of course, the best laid plans are subject to change in this city. We
had just sent her off on a tour of the US Capitol, when we called her
back to the office in a hurry so she could meet my old college
roommate, Jason Collins, who was also in town for the President's
speech and stopped by to say hello.
After finally getting that tour of the Capitol, Jen and I grabbed a
bite to eat and talked about some of the issues that she cares about
most and what she was hoping to hear President Obama speak about that
night. From special education funding in our schools to a renewed focus
on research for treatment and prevention of children's diseases, there
were so many issues that we agreed on. I have a feeling we'll be
working together in the future. From there we let Jen have a little
time to explore the things that D.C. can offer; she took a tour of the
Library of Congress and had a chance to unwind before the evening's
events began. Then it was time for the speech.
It was a fitting moment to have someone like Jen there to hear the
President speak about the importance of equality, education, and
economic opportunity. It's what she has spent her career fighting for -
the simple belief that, in this country, success should depend not on
who or what we are born to, but on hard work and heart.
Jen embodies
the spirit of service, compassion and inclusion that the Special
Olympics is all about. She is an inspiration to all of us hoping to
leave this world a little kinder and fairer than we found it.
It was a privilege to spend the day with her in Washington. I hope she
enjoyed the trip half as much as I did!

Joe Kennedy

Dear
Friend,
Last
night
I
had
a
special
guest
with
me
at
the
President&#8217;s
2014
State
of
the
Union
speech.
Members
of
Congress
are
allowed
to
bring
one
person
with
them
to
the
Capitol
that
night,
and
I
really
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
who
could
help
me
represent
the
4 th
District
at
this
important
event.
As
soon
as
I
heard
about
Jen
Walsh,
I
knew
she
was
the
perfect
fit.
A
teacher
at
Milford
High
School,
Jen
has
been
volunteering
with
the
Special
Olympics
in
Milford
for
over
20
years.
When
she
started
helping
out
with
the
local
Special
Olympics,
there
were
a
total
of
six
athletes. Today,
she
has
grown
the
program
to
nearly
170.
But
here&#8217;s
the
most
impressive
part
&#8211;
Jen
was
just
named
North
America
Special
Olympics&#8217;
Coach
of
the
Year,
beating
out
over
120,000
coaches
in
35
sports!
So
I
extended
an
invitation
right
away.
Luckily,
she
said
yes.
On
incredibly
short
notice,
Jen
flew
down
to
Washington
yesterday
and
spent
the
morning
with
me
and
my
team,
including
a
very
warm
welcome
from
Banjo,
who
took
an
immediate
liking
to
her.
Of
course,
the
best
laid
plans
are
subject
to
change
in
this
city.
We
had
just
sent
her
off
on
a
tour
of
the
US
Capitol,
when
we
called
her
back
to
the
office
in
a
hurry
so
she
could
meet
my
old
college
roommate,
Jason
Collins,
who
was
also
in
town
for
the
President&#8217;s
speech
and
stopped
by
to
say
hello.
After
finally
getting
that
tour
of
the
Capitol,
Jen
and
I
grabbed
a
bite
to
eat
and
talked
about
some
of
the
issues
that
she
cares
about
most
and
what
she
was
hoping
to
hear
President
Obama
speak
about
that
night.
From
special
education
funding
in
our
schools
to
a
renewed
focus
on
research
for
treatment
and
prevention
of
children&#8217;s
diseases,
there
were
so
many
issues
that
we
agreed
on.
I
have
a
feeling
we&#8217;ll
be
working
together
in
the
future.
From
there
we
let
Jen
have
a
little
time
to
explore
the
things
that
D.C.
can
offer;
she
took
a
tour
of
the
Library
of
Congress
and
had
a
chance
to
unwind
before
the
evening&#8217;s
events
began.
Then
it
was
time
for
the
speech.
It
was
a
fitting
moment
to
have
someone
like
Jen
there
to
hear
the
President
speak
about
the
importance
of
equality,
education,
and
economic
opportunity.
It&#8217;s
what
she
has
spent
her
career
fighting
for
&#8211;
the
simple
belief
that,
in
this
country,
success
should
depend
not
on
who
or
what
we
are
born
to,
but
on
hard
work
and
heart.
Jen
embodies
the
spirit
of
service,
compassion
and
inclusion
that
the
Special
Olympics
is
all
about.
She
is
an
inspiration
to
all
of
us
hoping
to
leave
this
world
a
little
kinder
and
fairer
than
we
found
it.
It
was
a
privilege
to
spend
the
day
with
her
in
Washington.
I
hope
she
enjoyed
the
trip
half
as
much
as
I
did!
