Dear
Friend,
Over the past several years, I have championed legislation that
will boost local and national footwear manufacturing while
simultaneously supplying U.S. servicemembers with the best equipment possible.
In response to my bill, the Department of Defense announced in 2014
that it would change its policy and provide recruits with American-made
footwear. The
Lowell Sun recently highlighted this in a
piece that you can read
in this edition of my
e-newsletter.
I have also focused on the benefits that our National Parks
provide to Americans and American communities like Lowell and Concord.
As the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on
Federal Lands, which oversees the National Park Service and other
federal lands, I place special priority on ensuring those benefits are
maintained, cultivated and grown. The economic impact cannot be
overlooked; a new National Park Service report shows that visitors to the
Lowell National Historical Park made an economic impact on the Greater
Lowell area of more than $40 million in 2014.
Read about
this report
and also
read about my favorite National
Parks , via the Find Your Park website!
Also in
this edition of
Congress in Your Inbox ,
you can
learn about my efforts to assist the Massachusetts Firefighting
Academy
in receiving a federal grant of $260,000 for a training
simulator that will, among other things, train recruits and current
firefighters in search techniques. I have made it a priority to ensure that our
local first responders are as fully equipped as possible. You can also
scroll down to
hear my latest interview on
WCAP.
Lastly, as summer begins it is important to remember some
highlights that the month of June brings. June is Mens Health Month,
a time to raise awareness of preventable health problems and
encourage early detection and treatment among men and boys. And it is also an
opportunity for Congress to recommit to supporting the vital medical
research that helps prevention and the search for cures. Visit
http://www.menshealthmonth.org/
for more information and
resources.
June is also LGBT Pride Month, an opportunity
to celebrate the progress our nation has made towards ending
discrimination, honor the individuals and organizations leading the charge for
equality and to reflect on how much farther we have to go. Even as
marriage equality spreads throughout the country, much work remains to
be done. I remain committed to pursuing justice on behalf of all
Americans and will continue to support legislation that furthers equality
for all Americans.
As always, I look forward to your
feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for staying engaged and enjoy this
edition of
Congress in your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
Sun: Why won't Pentagon buy this made-in-America
sneaker?
LAWRENCE -- Why do U.S. military recruits
still run around with Nike sneakers made in China on their feet?
That's what some U.S. sneaker manufacturers and U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas are
wondering more than a year after the Pentagon announced it would
change its policy and provide recruits with American-made footwear. .. READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE

Park: Rep. Niki Tsongas
When I was
fourteen years old, my family embarked on a cross-country drive to
California where we were going to board a ship to Japan. My father, an Air
Force Colonel, had received orders transferring him to Tokyo. The
entire experience was memorable for many reasons, but one of the most
indelible was unplanned and came before we even reached the West Coast.
