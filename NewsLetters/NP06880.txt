We are ashamed.
We should have been ready for Rove&rsquo;s Obama-bashing ad blitz.
But we didn&rsquo;t see it coming.
Now our Democratic candidates are paying the price. They&rsquo;re facing downright dishonest attacks -- and we don&rsquo;t have the resources we need to fight back.
So even after all you&rsquo;ve done, we have to ask you to dig even deeper:
We have a daunting task. We need 19,000 donations in the next 48 hours to close the gap with Boehner and Rove.
That means we need 25 donors to step up from the 60659 zip code.
