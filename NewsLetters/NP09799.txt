Dear Friend,
Here's a few updates from my work in Congress over the last few weeks:
#BringBackOurGirls
My heart goes out to the missing Nigerian girls who were kidnapped from
their school by the terrorist group Boko Haram. Every single woman in
the U.S. Congress-Democrat and Republican-has joined together in strong
condemnation of the abduction. Together, we introduced a resolution
urging President Obama to "use every avenue possible to assist in the
immediate recovery of the missing girls and in bringing the
perpetrators to justice." I urge you to watch First Lady Michelle
Obama's weekly address
on this unconscionable tragedy to learn more about what
America is doing to fine these girls and help their families during
this devastating time.
My Green Bank Bill
I'm focused on effectively representing you in Congress and creating
jobs while protecting your tax dollars, which is why I'm promoting
public-private partnerships. I proudly helped introduced the Green Bank
Act, which is modeled after Connecticut's "first in the nation" green
bank, the Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority (CEFIA).
Through public-private partnerships, CEFIA supports important clean
energy efforts such as loans to help businesses improve their energy
efficiency and competitiveness, crowdsourcing residential solar
projects, and clean energy initiatives for schools and non-profit
organizations. We have a great opportunity to share the innovative
model that's working here in our state to help folks all over the
country improve our economy and our environment.
Working for Safer Airplanes
Believe it or not, there's more GPS in the phone in your pocket than on
most of our 21st century airplanes. And that's frightening. As a member
of the Aviation Subcommittee of the U.S. Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, I've been advocating for the adoption
of
the "NextGen" air traffic monitoring system, which could lead to
significant cost savings. Our current radar system that major airlines
still use is outdated and inefficient.
Airplanes that use NextGen technology are more accurate, reducing fuel
usage by 10% and reducing congestion and noise. This is good for our
economy, our communities, and our environment. And here in Connecticut,
we have manufacturers who are at the forefront of aviation technology.
Transitioning to NextGen could support good-paying manufacturing jobs
in our state.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on these or any other issue. As always,
please don't hesitate to reach out by email
or at 860-223-8412. To find out more about my
work in Congress, check out my official Facebook page
or follow me on Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear
Friend,
Here's
a
few updates
from
my
work
in
Congress
over
the
last

weeks:
#BringBackOurGirls
My
heart
goes
out
to
the
missing
Nigerian

who
were
kidnapped

the
perpetrators
to
justice.&#8221;
