Dear Friends,
On January 1, 2015, millions of Americans and thousands of Delawareans
will be enrolled in high-quality, dependable health insurance plans.
Will you be one of them?
I hope you already are, but if you don't have health insurance secured
for next year yet, the clock is ticking! Any Delawareans who want
coverage that begins January 1 must enroll by December 15. That's
Monday! With only a few days left before time runs out, I encourage you
to stop and think about whether you still need to enroll or re-enroll
in a health plan for the coming new year. If you're set, then please
check with your friends and family to be sure they are, too.
I'd like to introduce you to Ray Halbach, one Delawarean who does have
health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. I recently met Ray
at my office where he told me about how he was diagnosed with cancer
after losing his job and his health insurance. He was forced to eat
into his savings to pay out of pocket for his cancer treatment until
the Affordable Care Act enabled him to get covered at a reasonable
rate, despite his pre-existing condition.
Delawareans who want to get covered
like Ray can get online and select a health plan through the Choose
Health Delaware
health
insurance marketplace. Even if you have insurance through the
marketplace, it's also crucial that that those who enrolled last year
go online to examine whether their plan is still the best fit for them
and find out if anything has changed about the financial subsidies
they're eligible to receive.
If you'd prefer to sign-up in person or over the phone, then there are
marketplace guides who can help. Find out more information here
(y en espaol tambin aqu
).
In its first year, more than 14,000 Delawareans have signed up for a
health plan that works for them. I'm thrilled that Delawareans are
enrolling in plans that can help them live a healthier life and perhaps
leave a little extra change in their pocket.
Don't let precious time pass you by. Be sure to log on to

as soon as possible and get covered!
Dutifully Yours,
