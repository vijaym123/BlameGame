David, I&rsquo;m asking for your help.
Polls show us in a dead heat against Republican Bob Dold. It's just one more piece of evidence that our race will go down to the wire.
We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to get our message out to voters -- knocking on doors and making phone calls --
but with 22 days to go, Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC just dumped another $1 million in our race.
Please, David, click this link and make a donation to help us break the tie. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/donate-link
Let&rsquo;s go win this!
