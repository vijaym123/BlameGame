Hearing From You About Social Security and Medicare
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend.
I spent last week hearing from
Granite Staters about Social Security and Medicare and discussing New
Hampshire priorities with constituents.
Thank You for Joining my Telephone Town Hall!
Last Tuesday, I hosted a live telephone town hall to hear directly from
New Hampshire seniors about the importance of protecting Social
Security, Medicare, and other vital programs.
During the call, nearly
4,000 seniors from across New Hampshire's second district shared their
own stories about why Medicare and Social Security are important to
them, and discussed their thoughts on what Congress can do to better
support these programs. I also highlighted my legislative efforts to
protect the programs that New Hampshire seniors rely on.
One of my top priorities in Congress is to protect Medicare, Social
Security, and other programs that are so vital to our seniors and
veterans.
I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from Granite
Staters about what these programs mean to them, and about what I can to
do on the federal level help our New Hampshire seniors thrive.
Among
other topics, I discussed my opposition to using chained CPI to
calculate Social Security cost-of-living-adjustments, a move which
could significantly reduce benefits for our seniors. I also addressed
how closing the Medicare Part D donut hole has saved New Hampshire
seniors millions of dollars in prescription drug costs; and I shared my
ideas to create additional savings for our seniors by allowing the
government to negotiate for cheaper prescription drugs for Medicare
recipients.
With NH American Legion reps
Hearing From NH Veterans
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to meet with American Legion
representatives from New Hampshire.
They gave me an update on the
issues that are facing the veterans community throughout the Granite
State and we discussed initiatives on the federal level that would
improve benefits and services for veterans and military families.
As a
member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have additional
opportunities to advocate for the courageous veterans, service members,
and military families who have sacrificed so much for our country.
It
is important that we work to strengthen health care benefits, cut
bureaucratic red tape, expand job opportunities, and properly honor the
dedicated men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States.
Increasing Access to Affordable Health Care
I was pleased by the White House's decision last Tuesday to allow a
special enrollment period to sign up for health insurance from March
31st to mid-April for individuals who had trouble signing up on the
Healthcare.gov website.
Earlier in the week, I joined Congressman Raul
Ruiz (CA-36) and other Representatives in sending a letter to the Obama
Administration specifically asking for extra time for these individuals
to enroll in health plans.
This was a critical announcement for people who were unable to sign up
for health insurance by March 31st because of website glitches or other
technical problems.
Every individual should have access to
high-quality, affordable health insurance, and no one should be
penalized for problems with the sign-up process that were beyond their
control. I'm so glad the President took the advice my colleagues and I
gave him in requesting such an extension.
Hearing from NH arts advocates
Working to Support the Arts
On Tuesday, I also met with advocates from the arts community in New
Hampshire, including the leaders of the Capitol Center for the Arts in
Concord.
In addition to discussing some of their recent events and
programming, we talked about the importance of federal funding for the
arts.
As a nation, it is critical that we continue to invest in public
centers for culture and artistic expression.
To help advance our
country and society, Republicans and Democrats must also work together
to improve the quality of education and to preserve organizations that
promote artistic and historical appreciation. That is why I urged my
colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to support robust funding
for the arts.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Hearing
From
You
About
Social

Hi
Everyone!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend.
I
spent
last
week
hearing
from
Granite
Staters
about
Social
Security
and
Medicare

New

Thank

Social

and
discussed
their

on
what

to
better
support
these
programs.
I
also
highlighted
my
legislative
efforts
to
protect
the
programs
that
New
Hampshire
seniors
rely
on.
One
of
my
top
priorities
in
Congress
is
to
protect
Medicare,
Social
Security,
and
other
programs
that
are
so
vital
to
our
seniors
and
veterans.
I
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
hear
from
Granite
Staters
about
what
these
programs
mean
to
them,
and
about
what
I
can
to
do
on
the
federal
level
help
our
New

seniors
thrive.
Among
other
topics,
I
discussed
my
opposition
to
using
chained

Social

cost-of-living-adjustments,
a

With
NH
American
Legion
reps Hearing
From
NH
Veterans
On
Tuesday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
American
Legion
representatives
from
New
Hampshire.
They
gave
me
an
update
on
the
issues
that
are
facing
the
veterans
community
throughout
the
Granite
State
and
we
discussed
initiatives
on
the
federal
level
that
would
improve
benefits
and
services
for
veterans
and
military
families.
As
a
member
of
the
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee,
I
have
additional
opportunities
to
advocate
for
the
courageous
veterans,
service
members,
and
military
families
who
have
sacrificed
so
much
for
our
country.
It
is
important
that
we
work
to
strengthen
health
care
benefits,
cut
bureaucratic
red

expand
job
opportunities,
and
properly
honor
the
dedicated
men
and
women
who
have
worn
the
uniform
of
the
United
States.
Increasing
Access
to
Affordable
Health
Care
I
was
pleased
by
the
White
House&#8217;s
decision
last
Tuesday
to
allow
a
special
enrollment
period
to
sign
up
for
health
insurance
from
March
31st
to
mid-April
for
individuals
who
had

Earlier
in
the

I

in
sending
a
letter
to
the
Obama

specifically
asking

This
was
a
critical
announcement
for
people
who
were
unable
to
sign
up
for
health
insurance
by
March
31st
because
of
website

or
other
technical
problems.
Every
individual
should
have
access

high-quality,
affordable
health
insurance,
and
no
one
should
be

for
problems
with
the
sign-up

I&#8217;m
so
glad
the
President

I
gave
him
in

such
an
extension.
Hearing
from
NH
arts
advocates Working
to
Support
the
Arts
On
Tuesday,
I
also
met
with
advocates
from
the
arts
community
in
New
Hampshire,
including
the
leaders
of
the
Capitol
Center
for
the
Arts
in
Concord.
In
addition
to
discussing
some
of
their
recent
events
and

we
talked
about
the
importance
of
federal
funding
for
the
arts.
As
a
nation,
it
is
critical
that
we
continue
to
invest
in
public
centers
for
culture
and
artistic
expression.
To
help
advance
our
country
and
society,
Republicans
and
Democrats
must
also
work
together
to
improve
the
quality
of
education
and
to
preserve
organizations
that
promote
artistic
and
historical
appreciation.
That
is
why
I
urged
my
colleagues
on
the
Appropriations
Committee
to
support
robust
funding
for
the
arts.
Have
a
fantastic
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
great
place
to
live!
