 to keep D.C. from enforcing its local gun laws passed the House as part of the House Fiscal Year 2015 D.C. Appropriations bill, I held a press conference
in the House with
D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Chief Alfred Durham (Chief Lanier was out of town), and representatives from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and DC Vote.
We discussed the clear and present danger to residents and the federal presence in the nations capital if the Massie amendment is not turned back in the Senate.
I have spoken with a highly-placed White House official and, with the help of the President, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the Senate, I am working to remove the gun amendment from the final bill.

White House on Our Side
Last Monday, the Obama Administration called on the House
to reject the D.C. marijuana and abortion riders in the Fiscal Year 2015 District of Columbia Appropriations bill and grant D.C. budget and legislative autonomy (the gun amendment had not yet been introduced).
The Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) said the administration strongly opposes the bills prohibitions on the Districts spending of its own local funds to implement its local marijuana policies, and to provide abortions to low-income women because they violate the principle of States rights and of District home rule.
The Presidents strong support will be helpful in our efforts in the Senate to keep the marijuana and abortion riders out of the final D.C. Appropriations bill.
Keeping our Drinking Water Clean
On Wednesday, I offered an amendment
in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to the so-called Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act.
The Republican bill would restrict the Obama administration from going forward with its proposed rule and guidance or using them as the basis for any decision regarding the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.
My amendment could not have passed because it protected most public drinking water from the Republican bill, but it sent a strong message against the Republican bill that could set back years of policy that ensure safe drinking water.
Strengthening the Local Justice Process in D.C.
My bill
that gives the District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service (PDS) and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) authority that will modernize their operations passed in the House last week by voice vote.
The passage of this bill will help make D.C.s justice process more efficient and, therefore, more effective for the residents of the District.
