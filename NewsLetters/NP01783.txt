Friend,
Today is the 8th annual World Autism Awareness Day, a celebration of the progress made towards the eradication of this disease.
Over one million families in the United States are affected by autism, and it is estimated that 80% of adults living with autism are unemployed or underemployed.
Although we should celebrate the progress made in combating autism, we must strive for the discovery of a cure, ensuring all who live with autism can lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
As your congressman, I have continually supported autism awareness and research programs, making it a top priority in my legislative agenda.
This year, I supported an appropriation of $10 million to the Defense Health Program, an initiative aimed at supporting research and treatment of autistic children in military families.
The results of this research will directly serve the interests of DoD families touched by autism as well as the medical, educational, healthcare and service professionals who serve the needs of the autism community within and beyond the DoD.
I also supported an appropriation of $22,000,000 for the Developmental Disabilities Surveillance and Research Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; as well as an appropriation of $48,000,000 for Autism Research at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).
This funding will allow HRSA to carry out autism education, early detection, and intervention programs.
Throughout my time as your congressman, I will continue to fight for additional funding in Congress, ensuring I do everything in my power to support the many autism programs around the country.
