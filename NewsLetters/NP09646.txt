ABC 10: Congressman Benishek visits Gwinn skills center
TV 6: Benishek looking to boost skill based education
Dear Friends,
Enjoyed another great week in Northern Michigan! From visiting the
Midwest Skills Development Center in Gwinn to awarding a Vietnam
veteran his war medals, it was a busy week back in the district!
Improving Vocational Education
We visited the Midwest Skills Development Center in Gwinn on Monday and
toured the facility. Vocational education is incredibly important up
here in Northern Michigan and this center is a great way to teach our
youth skills that they can use to get good paying jobs in the district.
Working to Protect the Great Lakes
This week we visited the Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council, which is
doing some fantastic work to protect the Great Lakes.
Tip of the Mitt
has received grants from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI),
which I have been working in Congress to help ensure funding for each
year.
Making sure that Michigan air and water remains clean for future
generations is one of my top priorities, which is why I started the
House Invasive Species Caucus.

programs at Tip of the Mitt, please visit:

Honoring our Veterans
It was truly an honor to award Ronald L. Warns his medals for serving
in the Vietnam War. He received the National Defense Service Medal,
Vietnam Service Medal with 3 Bronze Stars, Navy Unit Commendation
Ribbon, Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon, and the Combat Action
Ribbon, for his brave service to our country at the Gaylord Chamber of
Commerce earlier today. As the father of a veteran, I have seen how
hard our men and women work to defend America and should be praised
with honor when they return home. We have many great veterans up here
in Northern Michigan and I am working hard in Washington to make sure
they are treated with the care they need and deserve. A special thank
you to Mr. Warns, his family, and all of the veterans who have served.
Looking forward to attending the Great Lakes NOAA MATE ROV Regional
Competition in Alpena tomorrow!
I want to hear your thoughts on how best to protect the Second
Amendment, so please call me at 202-225-4735 or send me an email
through my website at www.benishek.house.gov
.
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.
