Manufacturing
Jobs
In West Virginia we are well aware just how much
manufacturers have been harmed by excessive regulations and unfair trade. Last
Congress we worked to stop bad regulations and protect American jobs
with legislation such as the
Promoting New Manufacturing Act ,
which passed last November.
This week I was honored to
receive the National Association of Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing
Legislative Excellence at the Bombardier Services Corporation in
Bridgeport.
This Congress, we have an opportunity to turn this
decline around and create a renaissance in American manufacturing by
expanding our home grown energy production, reforming our tax code, and
stopping overreaching regulations. Building our manufacturing base
should be a national priority. I will continue to work to promote a
climate where manufacturers can grow and create good jobs.
Making a Veterans Family
Whole
Corporal Bruce E. Oilers medals from his service in Vietnam were
stolen from him on his return to the United States forty years ago. On
Wednesday, his daughter was presented with the nine medals he earned
during his service with the United States Marine Corps.
My
staff worked tirelessly to restore these medals for the Oiler family so
they would have these mementos of their fathers service. If you know
a veteran who lost or did not receive medals or his having trouble
with a federal agency, such as the VA, please reach out to my
office.
A Full
Fortnight
Over the last two weeks, my staff and I have crisscrossed the First
District listening to senior citizens, visiting energy businesses, and
honoring the legacy of an American and West Virginian hero. You can see
some pictures from the last two weeks on my
Facebook page .
Back to
Washington
After a busy two weeks in West Virginia, Congress will be back
in session on Monday. Next week the House will focus on creating a
fair tax code to encourage job growth. A fair tax code means it is easier
for Americans to do their taxes, instead of wasting billions of hours
on paperwork. A simpler tax code also means a more transparent and
accountable IRS.
In the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, two
of my bills that directly impact West Virginians will see action. Our
coal ash legislation, which protects 316,000 American jobs, will be
passed out of Committee
the final step before the whole House can vote
on it. Also, a bill to strengthen Medicare and provide better care
for seniors will receive a hearing. I look forward to positive updates
on both of these bills next week!
Have a great
week,
David McKinley
