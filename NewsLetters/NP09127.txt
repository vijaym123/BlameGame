Dear Friend,
Every year on Memorial Day, soldiers, veterans, their families and
friends, and thankful Americans gather across the nation to pay tribute
to our brave sons and daughters who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in
defense of our great nation.
This year, I had the honor of spending this important day with the
troops in Afghanistan
. I led a
bipartisan Congressional delegation to spend time with our servicemen
and women, and meet with military leadership to get updates on the
situation on the ground.
Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day
Each year during Foster Care Month, Members of Congress spend a day with
current foster youth and foster alumni to get a firsthand account on
what challenges those in the system face.
Jacqueline of Duluth, MN was my shadow yesterday. She is an alumna of
the Minnesota foster system, having been in care from 6 months to age
17. I appreciated hearing about her experience aging out of the system,
about her relationship with her family, her educational goals, and what
she hopes Congress will address to improve the lives of those still in
the system. This wonderful young woman has a such a giving heart. I
can't wait to see what the future has in store for her.
