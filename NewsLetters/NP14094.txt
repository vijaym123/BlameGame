international stage. As part of his efforts
to protect Americans from the increasingly

provision that would force taxpayers to
fund a bailout of insurance companies. He

raise military pay, in accordance with
existing law. Finally, Marco wishes
everyone a happy and blessed Thanksgiving

Rubio Delivers Major Foreign Policy
Speech At AEI
Marco delivered a major foreign policy
speech at the American Enterprise Institute
in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. The
speech, titled Restoring Principle:
A Foreign Policy Worthy of the American
Dream, offered his views on the
current state of American foreign policy
and proposed a unique vision for
Americas role in the 21st century.
It included specific policy proposals
pertaining to Americas global
efforts to address key challenges.
Rubio: Diplomacy, foreign
assistance and military intervention are
tools at our disposal. But foreign policy
cannot be simply about tactics. It must
be strategic, with a clear set of goals
that guide us in deciding how to apply
our influence. These goals should be to
protect and defend our people, to promote
liberty and human rights throughout the
world, and to advance the enduring
pursuit of peace for all
mankind.

Marco further discussed the importance
of Americas global involvement in a
Senate
hearing
where he addressed the tragic
effects of Typhoon Haiyan.
Rubio Introduces Bill Preventing
Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts Of Insurance
Companies Under ObamaCare
On Tuesday, Marco introduced S.1726, The
ObamaCare Bailout Prevention Act. The bill
would eliminate a provision of ObamaCare
that allows for taxpayer-funded bailouts of
insurance companies at the Obama
Administrations sole discretion.
Under ObamaCares section 1342,
so-called risk corridors were established
for the laws first three years as a
safety net for insurers who experience
financial losses. Last weeks
announcement by President Obama that he
would act unilaterally to fix
his broken you can keep your
plans promise now increases the
likelihood of a bailout of health insurance
companies with taxpayer dollars.
Rubios bill would fully repeal the
risk corridor provision, thereby ensuring
that no bailout will occur under
ObamaCares section 1342.
The American people are sick
of Washington picking winners and losers,
especially since the chosen losers often
end up being taxpayers who foot the bills
for Washingtons mistakes,
said Rubio. Washingtons
bailout culture must end, and eliminating
ObamaCares blank check for a
bailout of insurance companies is a
common sense step to protect taxpayers
when ObamaCare fails.
Several
fiscal
watchdog and conservative organizations
have endorsed the measure. Marco
discussed the bill on FOX News
The
OReilly Factor .

Senators Rubio, Tester Introduce
Measure To Raise Military Pay
Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) joined Marco
in introducing an amendment to the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would
raise the salaries of active duty military
personnel by 1.8 percent. In its current
form, the NDAA includes President
Obamas original budget request for a
1.0 percent increase
even though a
2004 law requires that military pay be
linked to the Economic Cost Index, which
would be 1.8 percent this year.
The men and women of our
military make huge sacrifices for our
nation and have earned the chance to be
compensated accordingly. Passing this
amendment will have a direct positive
impact on our military volunteers and
their families,
said Rubio .
Congress and the President should
be following the laws already on the
books to provide appropriate compensation
to the members of the armed forces. As we
continue to deploy troops all around the
world to fight terrorism, respond to
disasters and defend our interests, we
have a duty to take care of them and
their families.
The amendment includes a spending offset
via reductions for Research, Development,
Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E). It is
endorsed by the Military Officers
Association of America (MOAA) and The
Military Coalition.
Rubio Announces Opposition To Fed Chair
Nominee
Marco issued a statement announcing his
opposition to Dr. Janet Yellens
confirmation to be the next Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Bank. The following is an
excerpt of his statement:
Rubio: []While Dr.
Yellen is an accomplished individual, I
will be voting against her nomination to
chair the Fed because of her role as a
lead architect in authoring monetary
policies that threaten the short and
long-term prospects of strong economic
growth and job creation. Altogether, she
has championed policies that have
diminished peoples purchasing
power by weakening the dollar, made
long-term savings less attractive by
diminishing returns on this important
behavior, and put the U.S. economy at
increased risk of higher inflation and
another future
boom-bust.[]

Honoring the 150th Anniversary of
President Lincolns Gettysburg
Address
Marco joined Ken Burns
Learn the Address project as
a way to honor the timeless and profoundly
significant Gettysburg
Address. Participants included all
the living presidents, politicians, news
anchors and other notable figures. Marco
made the following statement:
As we commemorate the 150th
anniversary of the Gettysburg Address,
there is no better tribute I can imagine
than simply
reading
President Lincoln's immortal
words.
Rubio Speaks at Florida Family Policy
Council 2013 Awards Dinner

free enterprise system and the crucial
impact family values have on both our
culture and our economy.

Marco Applauds National Adoption
Day
In light of National Adoption Day, Marco
penned a piece in The Christian Post. He
celebrates adoptions in America, but also
highlights the horrific realities of child
trafficking and corruption in certain
international adoption systems.
Rubio: On November 23rd, many
across our nation will celebrate National
Adoption Day. And there is much to
celebrate about this family institution
that has made us a better and stronger
society.

Constituent Casework Corner
In June, Lorenzo visited Senator
Rubios Central Florida regional

country due to his open opposition to the
government. A member of the staff contacted
the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Service and was advised that
his case was pending further review.
Recently, Lorenzo called to let us know
that his asylum has been granted.

Agency Updates
IRS Warns of Pervasive Telephone
Scam
The Internal Revenue Service is warning
consumers about a sophisticated phone scam
targeting taxpayers, including recent
immigrants, throughout the country. Victims
are told they owe money to the IRS and it
must be paid promptly through a pre-loaded
debit card or wire transfer. If the victim
refuses to cooperate, they are then
threatened with arrest, deportation or
suspension of a business or drivers
license. In many cases, the caller becomes
hostile and insulting.
Other characteristics of this scam
include:
Scammers use fake names and IRS badge
numbers. They generally use common names
and surnames to identify themselves.
Scammers may be able to recite the
last four digits of a victims
Social Security Number.
Scammers spoof the IRS toll-free
number on caller ID to make it appear
that its the IRS calling.
Scammers sometimes send bogus IRS
emails to some victims to support their
bogus calls.
Victims hear background noise of
other calls being conducted to mimic a
call site.
After threatening victims with jail
time or drivers license
revocation, scammers hang up and others
soon call back pretending to be from the
local police or DMV, and the caller ID
supports their claim.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS, heres
what you should do:
If you know you owe taxes or you
think you might owe taxes, call the IRS
at
800-829-1040 .
The IRS employees at that line can help
you with a payment issue
if there
really is such an issue.
If you know you dont owe taxes
or have no reason to think that you owe
any taxes (for example, youve
never received a bill or the caller made
some bogus threats as described above),
then call and report the incident to the
Treasury
Inspector General for Tax
Administration
at
800-366-4484 .
If youve been targeted by this
scam, you should also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their
FTC
Complaint Assistant
at
FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone Scam"
to the comments of your complaint.
Taxpayers should be aware that there are
other unrelated scams (such as a lottery
sweepstakes) and solicitations (such as
debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be
from the IRS. The IRS encourages taxpayers
to be vigilant against phone and email
scams that use the IRS as a lure. The IRS
does not initiate contact with taxpayers by
email to request personal or financial
information. This includes any type of
electronic communication, such as text
messages and social media channels. The IRS
also does not ask for PINs, passwords or
similar confidential access information for
credit card, bank or other financial
accounts. Recipients should not open any
attachments or click on any links contained
in the message. Instead, forward the e-mail
to
phishing@irs.gov .

report
phishing scams
involving the IRS is
