Social Media Photo Contest
Dear Friend,
Have you visited my Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, or Google Plus pages
recently? While I am very proud of the background photos on each of
them, they are getting a little out of date. That is why I am proud to
announce my first-ever social media photo contest, "Silicon Valley
Through Your Lens," where I will crowdsource my next background
pictures to YOU.
Submit your entry by midnight, January 4th, for consideration. All
valid entries will be posted on Facebook the following week, giving the
residents of Alameda and Santa Clara counties an opportunity to "like"
their favorites. The winners will be announced on January 17th.
So if you or someone you know is a shutterbug, submit your work to
"Silicon Valley Through Your Lens" soon! See the complete entry page
HERE
, or visit http://honda.house.gov/photocontest.
Competition Rules:
*	Photograph must be taken from, or include a part of,
California's 17th district (which includes the cities of San Jose,
Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Fremont, Cupertino, Newark, Santa Clara).
*	Photos must be high quality.
*	Photos must be taken by the person submitting the photo.
*	By submitting your photo, you are giving my office permission
to use your photo.
*	My office reserves the right to not post your photo for any
reason.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office
at Honda.Photocontest@mail.house.gov. I look forward to seeing all your
excellent work!

Mike Honda
