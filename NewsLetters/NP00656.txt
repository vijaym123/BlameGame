Dear Friends,
I had the honor and privilege to deliver this week's Weekly Republican Address in response to President Obama's. I say it is an honor and a privilege because it will air on Memorial Day weekend.
This weekend is time for all of us to honor and remember the military service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation and their families. It is also a time to reflect on the American values and principles that they fought and died for. Sally and I are so thankful for the brave men and women who have made that sacrifice to protect us and to protect the freedom and liberty of others across the world.

I hope you all have a safe Memorial Day weekend.
Sincerely,
