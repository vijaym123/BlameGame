February 7, 1776
Friends,
I will join
Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network at 7:00 PM ET tonight.
We will discuss the effort I am leading in the House of Representatives to STOP the President from bypassing Congress. The
STOP Resolution
has 100
cosponsors
and continues to pick up steam. Lou and I will also discuss current legislative issues facing our nation.
I hope you can tune in.
