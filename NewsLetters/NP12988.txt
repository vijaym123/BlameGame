Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I recently read
by Stephen Moore titled, "Bob Funk: Where the Jobs Are - and How to Get
One.
"
In an interview conducted by Stephen Moore for the Wall Street Journal,
Bob Funk, president and founder of Express Employment Services,
provides some insight on the state of the job market.
In the coming
weeks, the President, in a build up to the State of the Union speech on
January 27, will be making a political push for another extension of
unemployment benefits and income inequality.
I thought this article
would be a fitting primer.
Funk's insight into the current jobs market is spot-on - too much
regulation and too much welfare decimating the American work ethic.
He
asserts that employers are citing two key reasons why they are not
hiring.
First - the federal government's aggressive regulatory agenda
is freezing them in their tracks.
I hear from so many Hoosier
employers about the costs of regulations.
In fact, that is why I
launched my Red Tape Rollback program.
Secondly, employers are having difficulty finding qualified candidates,
even for what many would term "normal" jobs.
I think Funk is on to
something when he suggests our "vast social welfare state" has
contributed to a lesser work force.
I certainly support reforms to
these programs, if not for the simple fact that we cannot afford them
without forcing our children and grandchildren to pay for it in the
coming decades.

Funding the Federal Government - A Small Step in the Right Direction
Last Wednesday, the House passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
H.R. 3547
, spending
legislation to fund the federal government for the remainder of the
fiscal year.
We continue to make gains in reining in the out-of-control spending
that threatens the American Dream for the children of tomorrow.
The
spending levels in this bill are below what the government spent in
2009, and spending has actually declined in four consecutive years for
the first time since the Korean War.
In fact, spending is lower than
the first Path to Prosperity budget I helped to author in early 2011,
which liberals called radical.
While this appropriations bill contains far fewer spending reforms than
we need to achieve a balanced budget, it is a real step in the right
direction given a President and Senate insistent on more spending, more
debt and more government.
I will continue fighting to reform our
spending to ensure our children and grandchildren a shot at a brighter
future.

Another ObamaCare Lie and a Plainfield Man Loses His Insurance
When the President sold Hoosiers his health care reform plan -
ObamaCare - he made many promises.
He promised consumers would be
empowered with choices, Americans could keep their health care, health
care would be more affordable, and our national debt would be reduced.
We now know that the President was pedaling outright falsehoods that
have serious consequences for Hoosier families.
Take for instance Richard in Plainfield.
On September 19, he received
a letter from his insurance carrier that his personal insurance plan
would be canceled.
The carrier offered a new plan with additional
benefits, mandated by ObamaCare, that Richard did not want and would be
more expensive.
Why is the President so insistent on telling Richard,
or any American, what insurance they must purchase?
And why did he
promise Richard could keep his insurance when he knew he could not?
In my last Report, I shared with you Janet's story.
On Thursday, I
shared Janet's story on the House floor.
You can read her full story
and see my remarks here
.
I continue to receive stories from Hoosiers that underscore how
ObamaCare has done the complete opposite of what was promised when it
was sold to the American people.
The fight to repeal and replace this
insidious
law
continues.
Hoosiers deserve a better way to health care reform.
If you or someone you know has had a similar experiences due to
ObamaCare, please send me your story, your cancellation notice, or rate
increase documents at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.
Learn more about a better way to health care reform.
Last year, I
introduced a patient-centered and market-based plan - the American
Health Care Reform Act
.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Featured
in
this

is
an
article
I
recently
read
by
Stephen
Moore
titled,
" Bob
Funk:
Where
the
Jobs
Are
-
and
How
to
Get
One. "
In
an
interview
conducted
by
Stephen
Moore
for
the
Wall
Street
Journal,
Bob
Funk,
president
and
founder
of
Express
Employment
Services,
provides
some
insight
on
the
state
of
the
job
market.
In
the
coming
weeks,
the
President,
in
a
build
up
to
the
State
of
the
Union
speech
on
January
27,
will
be
making
a
political
push
for
another
extension
of
unemployment
benefits
and
income
inequality.
I
thought
this
article
would
be
a
fitting
primer.
Funk's
insight
into
the
current
jobs
market
is
spot-on
-
too
much
regulation
and
too
much
welfare
decimating
the
American
work
ethic.
He
asserts
that
employers
are
citing
two
key
reasons
why
they are
not hiring.
First
-
the
federal
government's
aggressive
regulatory
agenda
is
freezing
them
in
their
tracks.
I
hear
from
so
many
Hoosier
employers
about
the
costs
of
regulations.
In
fact,
that
is
why
I
launched
my
Red
Tape
Rollback
program.
Secondly,
employers
are
having
difficulty
finding
qualified
candidates,
even
for
what
many
would
term
"normal"
jobs.
I
think
Funk
is
on
to
something
when
he
suggests
our
"vast
social
welfare
state"
has
contributed
to
a
lesser
work
force.
I
certainly
support
reforms
to
these
programs,
if
not
for
the
simple
fact
that
we
cannot
afford
them
without
forcing
our
children
and
grandchildren
to
pay
for
it
in
the
coming
decades.
Funding
the
Federal
Government
-
A
Small
Step
in
the
Right
Direction
Last Wednesday,
the
House
passed
the
Consolidated
Appropriations
Act,
H.R.
3547 , spending
legislation
to
fund
the federal
government
for
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year.
We
continue
to
make
gains
in
reining
in
the
out-of-control
spending
that
threatens
the
American
Dream
for
the
children
of
tomorrow.
The
spending
levels
in
this
bill
are
below
what
the
government
spent
in
2009,
and
spending
has
actually
declined
in
four
consecutive
years
for
the
first
time
since
the
Korean
War.
In
fact,
spending
is
lower
than
the
first
Path
to
Prosperity
budget
I
helped
to
author
in
early
2011,
which
liberals
called
radical.
While
this
appropriations
bill
contains
far fewer
spending
reforms
than
we
need
to
achieve
a
balanced
budget,
it
is
a
real
step
in
the
right
direction
given
a
President
and
Senate
insistent
on
more
spending,
more
debt
and
more
government.
I
will
continue
fighting
to
reform
our
spending
to
ensure
our
children
and
grandchildren
a
shot
at
a
brighter
future.
Another
ObamaCare
Lie
and
a Plainfield
Man Loses
His
Insurance
When
the
President
sold
Hoosiers
his
health
care
reform
plan
&#8211;
ObamaCare
&#8211;
he
made
many
promises.
He
promised
consumers
would
be
empowered
with
choices,
Americans
could
keep
their
health
care,
health
care
would
be
more
affordable,
and
our
national
debt
would
be
reduced.
We
now
know
that
the
President
was
pedaling
outright
falsehoods
that
have
serious
consequences
for
Hoosier
families.
Take
for
instance
Richard
in
Plainfield.
On
September
19,
he
received a
letter
from
his
insurance
carrier
that
his personal
insurance
plan
would
be
canceled.
The
carrier
offered
a
new
plan
with
additional
benefits,
mandated
by
ObamaCare,
that
Richard
did
not
want
and
would
be
more
expensive.
Why
is
the
President
so
insistent
on
telling
Richard,
or any
American,
what
insurance they
must
purchase?
And
why
did
he
promise Richard
could
keep his
insurance
when
he
knew
he
could
not?
In
my
last

I
shared
with
you
Janet's

Thursday,
I
shared
Janet's
story
on
the
House
floor.
You

full

I continue
to
receive
stories
from
Hoosiers that
underscore how
ObamaCare

the
complete

what
was
promised
when
it
was

The

to

this

continues.
Hoosiers
deserve
