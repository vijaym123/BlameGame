Friend
Im sure by now you have heard the Administrations justification for executive action on immigration: that Presidents Bush, Reagan, and every president in the last 70 years have acted unilaterally to address the immigration system.
We could spend our time pointing out key differences between past presidents' actions on immigration, and the current Administrations sweeping executive order, which will impact roughly 5 million people who are illegally in this country.
But instead, I would like to focus on a different reason this is not justification for unconstitutional action. And that is because
this is not about politics . Its not about one person. Its not about one party. If a Republican president issued the same executive order, it would be just as wrong.
This is about principles.
Our nation was founded on the fundamental premise that the law is the ultimate authority
not the preferences of elected officials, the will of an elite minority, or the whims of an executive. This respect for the rule of law is what has defined our country since the day the words, We the People
were scrawled in ink on parchment, and the Constitution of the United States of America was birthed as the Supreme Law of the Land and a testament to freedom, justice, and equality under the law.
Our heritage is a nation of immigrants. But let us not forget our heritage is also a nation founded upon the integrity of the rule of law. The Constitution doesnt play favorites, and it has no respect for partisan politics. The law is the law. It must be respected.
Yours in service,
Randy
