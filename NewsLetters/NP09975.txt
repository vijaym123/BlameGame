Congressman Lamborn
Votes to Hold Lois Lerner in Contempt of
Congress
5/8/14
Yesterday evening, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted to hold Lois
Lerner in contempt of Congress and voted to call on the Department of
Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of
conservative groups by the IRS.
Yesterday, I voted to hold former IRS bureaucrat Lois Lerner
in contempt of Congress. Mrs. Lerner was one of the leading figures in
the scandalous targeting of conservative interest groups for invasive
audits and IRS attention. Mrs. Lerner refused to cooperate fully with
lawful Congressional hearings and requests. Therefore, we have no
choice but to hold Mrs. Lerner in contempt and pursue legal action against
her.
