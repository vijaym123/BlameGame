Dear
Friends,
In an Op-Ed printed in the December 17th edition of the
San
Mateo Daily Journal
titled Honoring Silicon Valleys Open Space
Districts, Reps. Zoe Lofgren, Mike Honda and I wrote about the great
achievements of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District and the
Santa Clara County Open Space Authority. This year marked their 40th
anniversary.
Both organizations have done extraordinary
work to promote open space, environmental preservation and public
restoration. They have secured millions of dollars in private, state and
federal funding to protect more than 78,000 acres in San Mateo and Santa
Clara Counties.
Below is a link to my Op-Ed honoring
Silicon Valleys open space districts. I hope it increases your
appreciation of the importance of these invaluable organizations and a
recommitment to the cause of protecting our regions open
spaces.
Should you have any questions or comments, please let me hear from
you.
Sincerely,
Anna G.
Eshoo
