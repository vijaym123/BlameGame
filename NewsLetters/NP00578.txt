Staff aides Wally Sparby and Tom Meium attended a retirement reception this week for State Farm Service Agency Executive Director Debra Crusoe. Deb, who farms with her husband in Meeker County, has served Minnesota farmers with the agency for 31 years, and has been State Director since May 2013. Under her leadership, the Farm Service Agency in Minnesota very successfully put the new farm programs into place for our state's producers. I want to thank Deb for her outstanding service and wish her a happy retirement.

Renewable Fuel Standard
The EPA on Friday released long-awaited Renewable Fuels Standards that unfortunately aren't at the levels laid out by Congress. Without a strong biofuels industry, we will never be able to reach our full potential when it comes to producing the next generation of homegrown biofuels. The rural economy has remained strong in part due to the jobs provided by biofuels production. EPA's announcement to set back the production of renewable biofuels
put those jobs and rural economic growth in danger. I appreciate USDA's attempts to do what they can to support infrastructure for the biofuels industry, but these efforts are no substitute for a strong RFS policy.
Transportation Funding
Last week, the House of Representatives passed another short-term, limited funding patch
to address the growing funding crisis for transportation in this country. Meanwhile, shovel-ready projects in the 7th District stand idle. Continuing this current path is unsustainable. We can't afford to wait for Congress to kick the can down the road again. I have heard from folks across the 7th District who are ready for Congress to quit the partisan bickering and work together to get the job done. A sustainable, long-term solution to meet our transportation needs is necessary to the success of our townships, cities, and counties.
Waters of the U.S. Rule
I am disappointed that the EPA has decided to move forward with the Waters of the U.S. rule
that increases confusion and red tape. Farmers, ranchers, local communities, and businesses all expressed concern with the rule's negative impacts. I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to explore all available options to prevent this arbitrary and subjective regulation.

Mark Twain, 1902
Mark Twain visited Saint Paul on May 27, 1882 while completing research for his book Life on the Mississippi. Published the following year, the book describes Minnesota as a land of "newness, briskness, swift progress, intelligence, and energy." Also included within Minnesota's chapter are colorful details of the state's landscape, architecture, infrastructure, flouring industry, and educational system.

Dear Friends,
This week&#8217;s proposals from the EPA to limit the production of domestic renewable fuels and regulate waters of the United States are unfortunate and further proof that, in my opinion, the
Agency just doesn&#8217;t understand rural America. Similarly, last week&#8217;s passage of a temporary extension of the Highway Trust Fund fails to provide the long-term certainty required for response to unique rural transportation needs. Strong investment in both the
biofuels industry and our transportation networks are fundamental to rural economic development, and I will continue working for both.
Sincerely,
[if gte vml 1]>

Memorial Day in Windom
Windom held a Memorial Day celebration to dedicate the new Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial. The memorial, located next to the Civil War Memorial, is an upright marble slab carrying the emblems
of the five branches of the U.S. military. Inscribed on the slab are the words: &quot;All gave some; some gave all.&quot; Benches face the memorial on either side, and all of it rests on a poured concrete square. Inscribed on the back of the benches are the words: &quot;All
Veterans are Honored and Remembered by the Windom Veterans of Foreign Wars #3844.&quot; At the dedication, the Windom Boys and Girls Club laid wreaths, Pastor Gary Wiens of First Baptist Church offered a prayer, and the Windom American Legion played &quot;Taps&quot; and
delivered a 21-gun salute.
