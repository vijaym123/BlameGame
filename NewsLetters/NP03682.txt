Dear Friends,
A new Congress
the 114th since our nations founding
will begin work next week at
a critical juncture. We have a chance to restore confidence; we must
not let the moment slip away.
I understand the
publics harsh opinion, with the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing
just 16 percent give Congress a positive job
rating.
Weve failed to tackle the issues that matter most to the American
people. To repair that relationship, Congress must advance policies
that empower individuals, not the government.
My aim is
to do everything I can to address our looming debt crisis, which
jeopardizes the prosperity of future generations and our national
security.
We also need tax reform that lowers rates and
gives every American the chance to thrive in a free market, not just those
who can afford lobbyists. Hand-in-hand with pro-growth tax policy, I
support regulatory relief to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that
built our great country.
We should move to overturn
the presidents executive action on immigration, which I consider
unlawful. It is the duty of Congress to enact a lasting legislative
solution. I believe a step-by-step process is the best path to reform, with a
string of bills that assure the American people their Congress
strikes the right balance between security and a modernized immigration
system.
Four years ago, I had the great honor of being
sworn in as a member of Congress for the first time. As I again swear
to uphold our Constitution, Ill reflect on the American Dream. The
opportunities Ive enjoyed
first as a young lawyer taking a similar
oath and then as a member of the Idaho Legislature
are rooted in the
rule of law.
I promise you my best as I work to
restore constitutional principles. Please keep me and my colleagues in your
thoughts and prayers as we do the publics
business.
Thank
you ,
