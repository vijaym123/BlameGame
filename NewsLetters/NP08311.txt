Speaker Boehner must&rsquo;ve been feeling pretty satisfied with himself:
FIRST:
Boehner launched a
$3O MILLION
assault on our top Democratic candidates.
THEN:
yesterday, Boehner&rsquo;s lackeys piled in $9 MILLLION to boost his Tea Party majority.
But then, this morning President Obama emailed you -- and your response has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE!
NOW:
We&rsquo;re within range of a JAW-DROPPING 20,000 online donations for the day. 5,317 are in just since 9am!!!
David, this is exactly the kind of response President Obama was looking for. If we can hit our goal before midnight tonight, it&rsquo;ll totally wreck Boehner&rsquo;s big week. Can you chip in today? Name: David Johnson
