Dear Friend, The Tea Party House has committed to paying $500/hour to the lawyers who will sue President Obama.
This is the same Tea Party House that refused to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hour. The facts are clear -- the Tea Party is much more concerned with frivolous litigation than passing legislation to help working families. The
Washington Post
recently gave the GOP an 82% chance of picking up the six seats it needs to take control of the Senate. We can&rsquo;t let one of those seats be from the Bay State -- chip in $5, even $10 if you can, to help us keep fighting.

We already know what the Republicans will do if they take the Senate. They&rsquo;ve already promised a return to shutdown politics, more gridlock, more ideological dysfunction. This isn&rsquo;t idle chatter -- this is what they&rsquo;re saying to the press, to donors, and to anyone who will listen. We need all hands on deck in this election. If we&rsquo;re going to run hard all the way through November, we need to hit our goals every step of the way -- starting with our $50,000 Primary Day goal. Give now and get us $5 closer.
This lawsuit is a terrible idea. Refusing to do anything to help middle class families is even worse. And a Tea Party Senate is too scary to consider. Let&rsquo;s do our part to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.
Thanks,
Ed
