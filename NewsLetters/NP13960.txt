A Thanksgiving Homecoming
Friends,
There is nothing quite like being with family during the holidays. This past week, more than 90 soldiers with the 255th Air Control Squadron were able to return to Mississippi just in time to reunite with family and friends for the Thanksgiving holiday. It is with thankful hearts that we welcome these moms and dads and sons and daughters home.
You can also make a difference for thousands of others still stationed overseas this holiday season. As part of their
Holiday Mail for Heroes
program, each year the American Red Cross delivers holiday greetings to veterans, military families and active-duty service members at hospitals and installations around the world.
Find out how you can get involved

As always, I encourage you to connect with me using my

In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
