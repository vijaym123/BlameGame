Dear David,
According to current VA estimates,
22 American Veterans
take their lives every single day.
High rates
of unemployment, homelessness, alcoholism, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress are decimating our community of veterans.
With the wars of the past 13 years in Iraq and Afghanistan coming to a close, we are seeing too many casualties among American soldiers in this transition to peace.
In light of this crisis, our collective mission must be to help our good soldiers return home and become good citizens.
Ariana Williams is a Seattleite and a veteran of the U.S. Army.
Ariana bravely served in Afghanistan.
Ariana&rsquo;s story demonstrates what can be achieved when our community works together to help our good soldiers come home.
In February 2012, I was honorably discharged from the Army after serving in Afghanistan.
I felt lost and overwhelmed. I was unemployed and a few months later I was homeless, with no way to pay my bills. I called the Veterans Suicide Hotline several times, fearing I would hurt myself if I was left alone.
The beauty of each of us as a Veteran is our resiliency. It&rsquo;s in our DNA. I was determined to survive, I was determined to get up each day and say &ldquo;I can make it. I can do it.&rdquo; And sure enough, with that inner toughness, and with the help of the Seattle community, things started to improve.
A local organization helped me find and move into a house. And just as my job search seemed hopeless, I discovered the great support team at Sound Mental Health&rsquo;s Veteran Employment Support Team (VEST) program. I was finally finding myself amongst people who would listen to my story and be dedicated to doing the kind of work I was interested in being a part of.
Every Veteran returning home needs to be able to find what I found: A proactive group of advisers and teammates whose mission is to see a Veteran employed, successful, and healthy.
We need a whole community of committed citizens eager to listen to the experiences of Veterans and to help find ways of bringing them back into society to be the productive and capable citizens they are.
If you are a veteran in need, I urge you to use the information below.
If you are a family member, neighbor or friend of a veteran in need, please share the information below.
On this Memorial Day 2014, let us embrace the idea that we all have a role to play in helping return our good soldiers to society: cleansed, rehabilitated, welcomed, and empowered.
Sincerely,
Congressman Jim McDermott
