Dear Friend,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to update you on my work in
the 113th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well.
As we are at the end of 2013, I wanted to use this Rokita Report as a
quick "Year-in-Review" of some of the bigger accomplishments this year.
_____
In September, I, along with several Republican Study Committee
colleagues, introduced the American Health Care Reform Act
- a consumer-driven,
commonsense health care reform bill designed to increase access and
reduce costs for all Americans.
We introduced this legislation because we believe it is important to
improve health care, not just repeal ObamaCare.
This bill now has
nearly 120 cosponsors and I look forward to more of my colleagues from
both sides of the aisle joining us in 2014.
You can view my remarks from the press conference where we rolled out
the legislation here
.
A brief summary of the bills reforms
*	Encouraging a more competitive health care market - Allows
Americans to purchase health care across state lines, increasing
transparency in Medicare by making claims data public, and allowing
small businesses to pool together to lower costs.
*	Increasing access to portable, affordable health insurance -
Implements an across-the-board standard deduction for all health
insurance plans, and expanding access and options for Health Savings
Accounts.
*	Improving access to insurance for vulnerable Americans -
Ensures affordable coverage for those with pre-existing conditions by
funding state high-risk pools, and removing barriers that prevent
continual insurance coverage.
*	Reforming medical liability law - Caps non-economic damages,
and placing a statute of limitations on liability cases.
*	Respecting human life - Prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion.
*	Repealing Obamacare
We continue to seek input from anyone that wishes to constructively
contribute to meaningful and responsible health care reform.

In August, the House considered and passed the Student Success Act.
The Student Success Act, introduced in June, is a bill I authored in my
role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and
Secondary Education
that reforms No Child Left Behind
and reasserts Indiana's explicit right to direct the education of
Indiana's children.
The Student Success Act reforms our nation's K-12 education system by
restoring local and state control to our schools.
In particular, the
Student Success Act gives states, not Washington, D.C., the authority
and responsibility to set academic standards, to measure if students
are meeting those standards, and to make changes if they are not
meeting their own standards.
Rep. Rokita Responds to Student Success Act Criticism 7-19-13
No Washington bureaucrat cares more about a child than a parent does.
And no one in Washington knows what is better for Indiana students than
Indiana families, teachers, and school boards. That is why the Student
Success Act (SSA) puts an end to the administration's National School
Board by returning control to state and local school districts.
Many Hoosiers will also be pleased to know that the Student Success Act
prohibits the Secretary of Education from coercing states into adopting
Common Core.
I would like to thank my fellow Education and Workforce Hoosier
colleagues - Reps. Larry Bucshon, Susan Brooks, and Luke Messer for
their help with this legislation.
It is my hope that the Senate considers their reauthorization
legislation in 2014. I look forward to working with my Senate
counterparts pass this plan next year.

Protecting your 4th Amendment Rights - Stopping the NSA from Spying on
Americans
Like many Hoosiers, I was greatly concerned when I learned about the
various National Security Agency spying scandals that were reported
this year.
As more and more revelations emerged about the NSA spying
on Americans' phone calls and electronic communications, it was clear
that the Obama Administration has been slow in taking responsibility
for abuses and invasions of Americans' privacy.
Since that news broke, I have continually been working on a bipartisan
basis to rein in the NSA's domestic surveillance operations and protect
Americans' privacy through legislation and congressional oversight.
Most recently, I co-authored bipartisan legislation called the USA
Freedom Act
to address NSA
abuses.
The USA Freedom Act makes reforms to end the dragnet
collection of Americans' phone records under Section 215 of the
PATRIOT.
This bill also provides more safeguards for warrantless
surveillance.
In September, I introduced legislation to establish a Select Committee
to investigate and report on the surveillance operations of the
National Security Administration
.
Also this year, I introduced another bipartisan bill to curb
unconstitutional surveillance, the Ending Secret Law Act, to require
declassification of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)
decisions.
Read my op-ed regarding this bill from the UK's Guardian,
which first broke the news of this surveillance, here
.
I am committed to continue and win this fight to uphold our
constitutional Fourth Amendment rights.

In the spring of 2011, my office in conjunction with the Indiana
Chamber of Commerce embarked on a critical initiative called "Red Tape
Rollback," to identify and roll back unnecessary and overly burdensome
federal regulations that kill jobs and hurt our economy.
The purpose
of Red Tape Rollback is to give businesses, individuals, and
institutions across the Hoosier State one location to report
information on these job-destroying rules and regulations.
I'm pleased to report that at the end of 2013-just over two years into
this effort-we've achieved 33 significant victories in our fight
against excessive regulations, and we've made major progress on dozens
of other issues.
From victories that will reshape the framework of
regulation in America to more specific regulations that burden
Hoosiers, we've achieved victories across the federal government.
We've
pushed back against regulations from the Environmental Protection
Agency, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human
Services, and more.
I will be releasing an annual report in early 2014
that contains stories about some of our successes and some of our
ongoing work.
However, our work is far from done.
As economic leaders across the Hoosier State, the Red Tape Rollback
program only works with your participation.
The Constitution vests
Congress with the duty to legislate, but equally important is our duty
to provide oversight of the executive branch.
As we in Congress
investigate and debate the appropriateness of federal regulations, I
invite you to join us in our efforts.
If you know of any regulation
that is destroying jobs, inhibiting growth, or slowing our economy, I
want to know about it.
It is important that we act now to remove unnecessary and burdensome
regulations that destroy jobs.
It is time to put Hoosiers back to work
and unleash our economy by tearing down the barriers that keep
businesses from growing.

regulatory overreach visit rokita.house.gov/redtape

I appreciate your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care and have a great 2014.

to

Criticism
7-19-13
No
Washington
bureaucrat
cares
more
about
a

than
a
parent
does.
And
no
one
in
Washington
knows
what
is
better
for

than
Indiana
families,
teachers,
and school
boards.
That
is
why
the

puts
an
end
to
the
administration&#8217;s
National
School
Board
by returning
control
to
state

Many
Hoosiers
will
also

this

Amendment
Rights

Stopping
the
NSA
from
Spying
on
Americans
Like
many
Hoosiers,
I
was
greatly
concerned
when
I
learned
about
the various
National
Security
Agency
spying
scandals
that were
reported
this
year.
As
more
and
more
revelations
emerged
about
the
NSA
spying
on
Americans&#8217;
phone
calls
and
electronic
communications,
it
was
clear
that
the
Obama
Administration
has
been
slow
in
taking
responsibility
for
abuses
and
invasions
of
Americans&#8217;
privacy.
Since
that
news
broke,
I
have
continually
been
working
on
a
bipartisan
basis
to
rein
in
the
NSA&#8217;s
domestic
surveillance
operations
and
protect
Americans&#8217;
privacy
through
legislation
and
congressional
oversight.
Most
recently, I
co-authored
bipartisan
legislation
called
the
USA
Freedom
Act
to
address
NSA
abuses.
The
USA
Freedom
Act
makes
reforms
to
end
the
dragnet
collection
of
Americans&#8217;
phone
records
under
Section
215
of
the
PATRIOT.
This
bill
also
provides
more
safeguards
for
warrantless
surveillance.
In
September,
I
introduced
legislation
to
establish
a
Select
Committee
to
investigate
and
report
on
the
surveillance
operations
of
the
National
Security
Administration .
Also
this
year,
I
introduced
another
bipartisan
bill
to
curb
unconstitutional
surveillance,
the
Ending
Secret
Law
Act,
to
require
declassification
of
Foreign
Intelligence
Surveillance
Court
(FISC)
decisions.
Read
my
op-ed
regarding
this
bill
from
the
UK's
Guardian,
which
first
broke
the
news
of
this
surveillance,
here .
I
am
committed
to
continue
and
win
this
fight
to
uphold
our
constitutional
Fourth
Amendment
rights.
In
the
spring
of
2011,
my
office
in
conjunction
with
the
Indiana
Chamber
of
Commerce
embarked
on
a
critical
initiative
called
&#8220; Red
Tape
Rollback, &#8221;
to
identify
and
roll
back
unnecessary
and
overly
burdensome
federal
regulations
that
kill
jobs
and
hurt
our
economy.
The
purpose
of
Red
Tape
Rollback
is
to
give
businesses,
individuals,
and
institutions
across
the
Hoosier
State
one
location
to
report
information
on
these
job-destroying
rules
and
regulations.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
report
that
at
the
end
of
2013&#8212;just
over
two
years
into
this
effort&#8212;we&#8217;ve
achieved
33
significant
victories
in
our
fight
against
excessive
regulations,
and
we&#8217;ve
made
major
progress
on
dozens
of
other
issues.
From
victories
that
will
reshape
the
framework
of
regulation
in
America
to
more
specific
regulations
that
burden
Hoosiers,
we&#8217;ve
achieved
victories
across
the
federal
government.
We&#8217;ve
pushed
back
against
regulations
from
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
the
Department
of
Labor,
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
and
more.
I
will
be
releasing
an
annual
report
in
early
2014
that
contains
stories
about
some
of
our
successes
and
some
of
our
ongoing
work.
However,
our
work
is
far
from
done.
As
economic
leaders
across
the
Hoosier
State,
the
Red
Tape
Rollback
program
only
works
with
your
participation.
The
Constitution
vests
Congress
with
the
duty
to
legislate,
but
equally
important
is
our
duty
to
provide
oversight
of
the
executive
branch.
As
we
in
Congress
investigate
and
debate
the
appropriateness
of
federal
regulations,
I
invite
you
to
join
us
in
our
efforts.
If
you
know
of
any
regulation
that is
destroying
jobs,
inhibiting
growth,
or
slowing
our
economy,
I
want
to
know
about
it.
It
is
important
that
we
act
now
to
remove
unnecessary
and
burdensome
regulations
that
destroy
jobs.
It
is
time
to
put
Hoosiers
back
to
work
and
unleash
our
economy
by
tearing
down
the
barriers
that
keep
businesses
from
growing.

I

your
continued
interest
in
Congress
and

supporting
my
efforts
in
Washington.
Take
care
and
have
a
great
2014.
