Dear Friend,
I take the responsibility of Congress to
provide oversight over the rest of the federal government very seriously.
I take it even more seriously when we're looking into something
that happened very, very close to home.
If you agree
with me, I hope you'll take just a few moments and check out these
three videos.
First, I want you to see an exchange I
had about a week and a half ago with the Director of the ATF, B. Todd
Jones.
I had some questions about an undercover sting operation
that the ATF had
carried
out in Atlanta
a few years ago.
Watch this
for more of the
story:
A few days later, I had the chance to ask some questions of
the Attorney General, Eric Holder.
I took that opportunity to ask him
what he
thought about the ATF issues I'd brought up earlier.
His response
was very
interesting:
If you were
watching WSB Channel 2 on Wednesday evening,
you saw this story
put together.
Here's the clip:
The bottom line is this: it's our job to
make sure people are held accountable when public safety is in
question.
That's why I'm pursuing this issue at every level possible
to find out how these storefront operations were handled, the extent to
which Georgians were at risk, and what's been done to make sure law
enforcement is always done the right way.
I want to
keep you informed on this issue.
As always, please
let me know
how you
feel.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
