Dear Friend:
Is the Supreme Court's majority living in the 19th century or the 21st century? While I am relieved that the Hobby Lobby ruling was narrow, I still cannot understand how the Court's majority could put the ideology of closely held corporations above the health and religious freedom of thousands and thousands of their female employees. We must act immediately to remedy this injustice, and my colleagues and I are already working to do just that.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
