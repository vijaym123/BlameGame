Dear Friend,
Every year we invite veterans from across
Congressional District 6 to assist me in interviewing applicants seeking
nominations for our nation's military academies. With interview day fast
approaching,
we thought
it would be a great time to highlight the outstanding work of one of
our future military officers currently attending the Naval
Academy.
Midshipman Madison Pascale recently attended ceremonies
in France commemorating the U.S. lives lost at Normandy beach during
World War II. She performed these ceremonial duties as the sole
representative of the U.S.
Thank you Midshipman Pascale
for your sense of honor and professionalism. We are so proud to have
such a stellar representative from Arizona representing our country at
such a solemn event.
Sincerely,
Scottsdale District
