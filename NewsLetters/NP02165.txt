Kansas Common Sense
March 16, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
My Washington, D.C., office has moved to a new location in the Dirksen
Senate Office Building, Room 521. If you are planning a trip to our
nation's capital in the near future please take note of the new
location. Click here

Call with FDA Commissioner After Listeria Outbreak
After learning of the listeria outbreak that claimed the lives of three
Kansans, I had a discussion with FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg
over the weekend to make sure everything possible was being done to
prevent further spread of the food borne disease. I asked Dr. Hamburg
to brief me on the unfolding situation, including whether proper
protocol was followed by federal agencies and other parties involved.
Listeria primarily affects the most vulnerable in our society - older
adults, pregnant women and their newborns, and people with immune
systems weakened by other illnesses. The contamination was discovered
in several Blue Bell ice cream products made on a particular production
line at the Blue Bell Creameries in Brenham, Texas. Those products have
been recalled. However, it is possible more cases will be discovered
before all of the product is removed from freezers, as well as due to
the long incubation period for listeria before some people show
symptoms of illness. The FDA? has warned consumers about the potential
contamination in Blue Bell Creameries' products. More information can
be found on the FDA website here
.
The tragic news serves as a sober reminder of the importance of
preventing food contamination. As Chairman of the Agriculture
Appropriations Subcommittee, I'm committed to working with FDA and USDA
- the agencies that oversee food safety - to prevent further spread of
the current listeria outbreak and of future food borne diseases. My
thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones due to
the listeria outbreak.
Trafficking Legislation Stalls in Senate
The United States Senate this week agreed to proceed on the Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act to address the scourge of modern slavery in
our society. This legislation is bipartisan and was reported out of the
Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote. Yet, progress was halted by
Senate Democrats over objections about the bill including the Hyde
Amendment, language that prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for
elective abortions. This language, which I support, has been approved
by Congress every year since 1976, and 23 of my Democratic colleagues
supported it last year.
Human trafficking is a serious problem that affects the lives of
thousands of women and children. This bipartisan effort to protect them
and punish those who enslave them ought not be delayed. More than 200
victims' rights and law enforcement groups support this legislation.
For this to move forward, Majority Leader McConnell offered Democrats
an up-or-down vote on the Hyde Amendment, but that offer was refused.
The Senate should function properly where amendments are offered and
voted on regardless of party. For the victims who suffer such horrible
abuse, we cannot afford to wait any longer moving forward and enacting
the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act into law.
Advocating for Fort Riley with Secretary of the Army
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to question the Secretary of the
Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General Raymond Odierno during
a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee Hearing on the Army's
fiscal year 2016 budget request. I wanted to make certain the Secretary
and Chief understood the immense capabilities and infrastructure -
schools, homes and the new Irwin Army Community Hospital - on Fort
Riley to serve and care for soldiers and their families. I reminded
them that the Army Listening Session on February 9, 2015, in Junction
City included 4,300 passionate and supportive Kansans who value Fort
Riley and the soldiers who call Kansas home. I was pleased Secretary
McHugh made it clear that the Army deeply appreciates Fort Riley and
it's one of the Army's most important bases. General Odierno spoke
about the value of training in Kansas, as the Army's first combat
operations of the Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) that is
currently deployed in Kuwait and stationed at Fort Riley. I invited the
Secretary and Chief to visit Fort Riley when we welcome home Major
General Funk and the 1st ID's Division Headquarters element when they
return from Iraq. Secretary McHugh and I will soon be meeting in my
office in Washington, D.C., to discuss the future of the Army and the
contributions Kansans will continue to make in support of soldiers and
their families. Click here

First Hearing as Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman
This week, the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing
to review the Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) fiscal year 2016
budget. As chairman of the subcommittee, I had the opportunity to raise
a number of issues with FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which form the basis of federal
nutrition policy, are reviewed every five years. A recent advisory
committee report recommending what foods should be included in the new
guidelines unwisely leaves lean red meat out of what it considers to be
a healthy diet.
At the hearing, I expressed concerns to the Commissioner about the
FDA's final rules on nutritional labeling of restaurant menus. The
Obamacare regulation - which requires chain food establishments to
provide detailed nutritional information on anything considered a menu -
is overly burdensome, inflexible, and has created significant
uncertainty for small businesses owners. Although the compliance date
is later this year, FDA is yet to issue guidance on many key portions
of the rule. At the hearing, I urged FDA to delay the compliance
deadline and work to make certain the regulations don't cause
unnecessary harm to small businesses.
I also discussed the rapidly growing personal mobile health device
industry. It is important that FDA utilize a risk-based approach in
evaluating applications that influence important medical decisions and
digital devices that transmit health information. This will enable FDA
to carry out its public health function without stifling technological
innovation with over-regulation. Click here

Senate Hearing on Religious Freedom
This week, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign
Operations held a hearing on the threat to international religious
freedom. Nonpartisan research shows 76 percent of the world's
population "live in countries with a high or very high level of
restrictions on religion." I am disturbed by the widespread persecution
of Christians and increasing anti-Semitism. I used the opportunity to
ask the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom David
Saperstein about our nation's effort to secure the release of Pastor
Saeed Abedini, an American detained by Iran since 2012. He assured my
colleagues and me that all diplomatic efforts are being undertaken, and
it was good to hear other witnesses speak of Ambassador Saperstein's
commitment to bring Pastor Saeed home.
China is listed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious
Freedom as one of the worst persecutors of religious freedom. I asked
another panelist, Bishop Oscar Cantu, on the plight of the Catholic
Church in China. Despite the Vatican seeking better ties, the Chinese
government continues to persecute Catholics who recognize the
leadership of the Pope. Bishop Cantu noted the sensitivity of the
subject and the need to tread carefully as Rome and Beijing negotiate.
However, the United States stands ready to assist all who wish to
profess their beliefs as they choose. Click here
to view my exchange at the hearing.
Inviting Top Secretaries to Visit Kansas
This week, I formally invited Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx
and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker to visit Kansas and learn more
about our vibrant manufacturing sector, the Kansas business community
and the transportation needs of our state. Earlier this month, both
secretaries testified before the Senate Commerce Committee regarding
their fiscal year 2016 budget requests. During that hearing, I
explained some of the transportation challenges Kansas faces and need
for a long-term highway solution. I also expressed my concern to both
secretaries about the impact of the Administrations constant attacks on
the aviation industry in Kansas. To view a video of my exchange with
Secretary Foxx and Secretary Pritzker, click here

ATF Rescinds Proposal to Ban M855 Sporting Ammo
On Tuesday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
(ATF) rescinded its proposed framework to ban M855 ammunition. Without
instruction from Congress, ATF intended to ban this ammunition - which
has been used by law-abiding American citizens for decades - because it
is "armor piercing," and therefore poses a risk to the safety of law
enforcement officers. The fact is, almost all rifle ammunition is
"armor piercing," and the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of
1986 specifically exempts this ammunition for sporting purposes. The
intent of this law was clear: law-abiding citizens should not be
deprived of their right to use M855 ammunition for legitimate purposes
such as target shooting, hunting, and shooting competitions.
Last week, I joined Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley
in outlining these concerns to ATF Director B. Todd Jones, and I am
thankful it appears our message was received. In Kansas, we enjoy a
rich tradition of hunting, target shooting, and other law-abiding
activities protected by our Second Amendment rights. I will continue to
monitor the Obama Administration's actions and strongly oppose any
effort that violates our firearm freedoms.
Speaking at South-by-Southwest
I took a detour on my way home from Washington this week, to stop in
Austin, Texas, where the South-by-Southwest Interactive Conference is
held each spring. On Saturday, I spoke on a panel about the engagement
between the startup community and lawmakers in Washington.
Entrepreneurs are critical drivers of economic growth in America but
too often bad policies in Washington make it harder for good ideas to
come to market or for emerging companies to survive. Pro-growth
policies can start with entrepreneurs and their success will result in
improved products at lower prices, more jobs, and a growing American
economy. While in Austin, I had the pleasure of meeting with a number
of Kansans who traveled to SXSW. We had a great discussion about how
things like Dodd Frank regulations, the visa system, and taxes affect
small businesses and their prospects for success. These conversations
are especially valuable because they offer insight on the state of
American small business and the greater economy that is difficult to
get from looking at raw economic data. I will continue to push for
legislation in Washington that eases the path for Kansans with good
ideas to launch a small business and compete in the free market system.
Supporting Short Line Railroads, Rural Economic Development
This week, I sponsored the Short Line Railroad Rehabilitation and
Investment Act of 2015 - legislation to extend the short line railroad
track maintenance tax credit, which expired in 2014. The short line
railroad network is a significant component of our transportation
system and plays an integral role in connecting farmers and factories
with communities around the globe. I was proud to introduce the
legislation that created this tax credit in 2004 as a Member of the
House of Representatives to help support large areas of the country,
including rural communities like those across Kansas, where short lines
are the only connection to the national railroad network.
The tax credit encourages railroads, railroad customers and suppliers -
who depend the most on short line railroads - to invest directly in
maintaining the more than 2,000 miles of short line rails in Kansas, as
well as systems across the country. Over the past five years, the short
line railroad tax credit has generated $1.5 billion in railroad
infrastructure investment, as well as created and preserved thousands
of jobs. It is vital that we extend this tax credit so that rail
operators will be able to increase their capacity and small businesses
and agriculture producers across the country can continue to get their
commodities and goods to market in a cost-effective and efficient way.

Meeting the Kansas Delegates to the United States Senate Youth Program
On Thursday evening, I had the opportunity to visit with Stefan
Petrovic of Lawrence High School and Britt Leake of Wichita East High
School, the Kansas Delegates to the Annual United States Senate Youth
Program (USSYP) in Washington, D.C. The USSYP, established in 1962 by
U.S. Senate Resolution, offers delegates the opportunity to learn about
their government and the legislative process, and helps ensure a
generation of well-rounded citizens. I commend the outstanding
achievements of these remarkably talented and engaged young Kansans. It
was a pleasure to visit with young people like these who take a strong
interest in the issues facing our country. You can read more about
Stefan and Britt below.
*	Britt Leake attends Wichita High School East and serves as the
president of the National Forensics League. He is active in his
school's French National Honor Society and National Forensics League.
After high school, Britt plans to further his studies in Arabic and
Hindi to prepare for a career in diplomacy or international development.
*	Stefan Petrovic is vice president of the Student Body at
Lawrence High School. In addition to presiding over several school
clubs, he has been involved in Habitat for Humanity, Lawrence's Boys
and Girls Club and a National Science Foundation's project on
sustainability. Stefan participates in debate, forensics and the Model
United Nations. He would like to obtain a Ph.D. in political science or
economics and law degree and specialize in sustainable development and
regulatory policies, and hopes to eventually enter a career in public
service.
City Visits
This week, my staff and I met with elected leaders from the communities
of Olathe, Shawnee, Ottawa, Lenexa, Emporia, Prairie Village,
Manhattan. We discussed numerous issues including a long-term highway
authorization bill and the deductibility of interest from municipal
bonds.
Speaking to National Business Aviation Association
On Thursday, I spoke to leaders of the National Business Aviation
Association (NBAA) about the importance of general aviation and
prospects for passing legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) in 2015. Founded in 1947, NBAA is a leading
organization for companies relying on general aviation aircraft to help
their businesses be more efficient and productive. General aviation is
the largest industry in Kansas, generating nearly $3 billion in annual
exports and manufacturing 40 percent of all GA planes.
Federal funding for FAA expires on September 30, 2015, and legislation
to reauthorize the agency is expected to be introduced this spring.
During the last reauthorization cycle, Congress resorted to nearly two
dozen short-term extensions before ultimately passing a long-term bill.
At Thursday's event, we discussed several issues that will be central
to Congressional consideration in this year's effort, such as
modernization of our air traffic control system and the commercial use
of Unmanned Aircraft Systems. As a member of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on Aviation Operations, with full jurisdiction over FAA
reauthorization efforts, I look forward to working with my colleagues
to tackle these important issues. Many thanks to NBAA and CEO Ed Bolen,
a University of Kansas graduate, for the opportunity to speak and
hospitality.
Honored to Serve You
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Call
with
FDA
Commissioner
After
Listeria
Outbreak
After
learning
of
the
listeria
outbreak
that
claimed
the
lives
of
three
Kansans,
I
had
a
discussion
with
FDA
Commissioner
Dr.
Margaret
Hamburg
over
the
weekend
to
make
sure
everything
possible
was
being
done
to
prevent
further
spread
of
the
food
borne
disease.
I
asked
Dr.
Hamburg
to
brief
me
on
the
unfolding
situation,
including
whether
proper
protocol
was
followed
by
federal
agencies
and
other
parties
involved.
Listeria
primarily
affects
the
most
vulnerable
in
our
society
&ndash; older
adults,
pregnant
women
and
their
newborns,
and
people
with
immune
systems
weakened
by
other
illnesses.
The
contamination
was
discovered
in
several
Blue
Bell
ice
cream
products
made
on
a
particular
production
line
at
the
Blue
Bell
Creameries
in
Brenham,
Texas.
Those
products
have
been
recalled.
However,
it
is
possible
more
cases
will
be
discovered
before
all
of
the
product
is
removed
from
freezers,
as
well
as
due
to
the
long
incubation
period
for
listeria
before
some
people
show
symptoms
of
illness. The
FDA?
has
warned
consumers about
the
potential
contamination
in
Blue
Bell
Creameries'
products. More
information
can
be
found
on
the
FDA
website
here .
The
tragic
news
serves
as
a
sober
reminder
of
the
importance
of
preventing
food
contamination.
As
Chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I'm
committed
to
working
with
FDA
and
USDA
&ndash; the
agencies
that
oversee
food
safety
&ndash; to
prevent
further
spread
of
the
current
listeria
outbreak
and
of
future
food
borne
diseases.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
families
who
lost
loved
ones
due
to
the
listeria
outbreak.
Trafficking
Legislation
Stalls
in
Senate
The
United
States
Senate
this
week
agreed
to
proceed
on
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
to
address
the
scourge
of
modern
slavery
in
our
society.
This
legislation
is
bipartisan
and
was
reported
out
of
the
Judiciary
Committee
with
a
unanimous
vote.
Yet,
progress
was
halted
by
Senate
Democrats
over
objections
about
the
bill
including
the
Hyde
Amendment,
language
that
prohibits
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
pay
for
elective
abortions.
This
language,
which
I
support,
has
been
approved
by
Congress
every
year
since
1976,
and
23
of
my
Democratic
colleagues
supported
it
last
year.
Human
trafficking
is
a
serious
problem
that
affects
the
lives
of
thousands
of
women
and
children.
This
bipartisan
effort
to
protect
them
and
punish
those
who
enslave
them
ought
not
be
delayed.
More
than
200
victims'
rights
and
law
enforcement
groups
support
this
legislation.
For
this
to
move
forward,
Majority
Leader
McConnell
offered
Democrats
an
up-or-down
vote
on
the
Hyde
Amendment,
but
that
offer
was
refused.
The
Senate
should
function
properly
where
amendments
are
offered
and
voted
on
regardless
of
party.
For
the
victims
who
suffer
such
horrible
abuse,
we
cannot
afford
to
wait
any
longer
moving
forward
and
enacting
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
into
law.
Advocating
for
Fort
Riley
with
Secretary
of
the
Army
On
Wednesday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
Secretary
of
the
Army
John
McHugh
and
Army
Chief
of
Staff
General
Raymond
Odierno
during
a
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee
Hearing
on
the
Army's
fiscal
year
2016
budget
request.
I
wanted
to
make
certain
the
Secretary
and
Chief
understood
the
immense
capabilities
and
infrastructure
&ndash;
schools,
homes
and
the
new
Irwin
Army
Community
Hospital
&ndash;
on
Fort
Riley
to
serve
and
care
for
soldiers
and
their
families.
I
reminded
them
that
the
Army
Listening
Session
on
February
9,
2015,
in
Junction
City
included
4,300
passionate
and
supportive
Kansans
who
value
Fort
Riley
and
the
soldiers
who
call
Kansas
home.
I
was
pleased
Secretary
McHugh
made
it
clear
that
the
Army
deeply
appreciates
Fort
Riley
and
it's
one
of
the
Army's
most
important
bases.
General
Odierno
spoke
about
the
value
of
training
in
Kansas,
as
the
Army's
first
combat
operations
of
the
Gray
Eagle
unmanned
aircraft
systems
(UAS)
that
is
currently
deployed
in
Kuwait
and
stationed
at
Fort
Riley.
I
invited
the
Secretary
and
Chief
to
visit
Fort
Riley
when
we
welcome
home
Major
General
Funk
and
the
1st
ID's
Division
Headquarters
element
when
they
return
from
Iraq.
Secretary
McHugh
and
I
will
soon
be
meeting
in
my
office
in
Washington,
D.C.,
to
discuss
the
future
of
the
Army
and
the
contributions
Kansans
will
continue
to
make
in
support
of
soldiers
and
their
families.

First
Hearing
as
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
Chairman
This
week,
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
held
a
hearing
to
review
the
Food
&amp;
Drug
Administration's
(FDA)
fiscal
year
2016
budget.
As
chairman
of
the
subcommittee,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
a
number
of
issues
with
FDA
Commissioner
Dr.
Margaret
Hamburg.
The
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans,
which
form
the
basis
of
federal
nutrition
policy,
are
reviewed
every
five
years.
A
recent
advisory
committee
report
recommending
what
foods
should
be
included
in
the
new
guidelines
unwisely
leaves
lean
red
meat
out
of
what
it
considers
to
be
a
healthy
diet.
At
the
hearing,
I
expressed
concerns
to
the
Commissioner
about
the
FDA's
final
rules
on
nutritional
labeling
of
restaurant
menus.
The
Obamacare
regulation
&ndash;
which
requires
chain
food
establishments
to
provide
detailed
nutritional
information
on
anything
considered
a
menu
&ndash;
is
overly
burdensome,
inflexible,
and
has
created
significant
uncertainty
for
small
businesses
owners.
Although
the
compliance
date
is
later
this
year,
FDA
is
yet
to
issue
guidance
on
many
key
portions
of
the
rule.
At
the
hearing,
I
urged
FDA
to
delay
the
compliance
deadline
and
work
to
make
certain
the
regulations
don't
cause
unnecessary
harm
to
small
businesses.
I
also
discussed
the
rapidly
growing
personal
mobile
health
device
industry.
It
is
important
that
FDA
utilize
a
risk-based
approach
in
evaluating
applications
that
influence
important
medical
decisions
and
digital
devices
that
transmit
health
information.
This
will
enable
FDA
to
carry
out
its
public
health
function
without
stifling
technological
innovation
with
over-regulation.

Senate
Hearing
on
Religious
Freedom
This
week,
the
Senate
Appropriations
Subcommittee
on
State
and
Foreign
Operations
held
a
hearing
on
the
threat
to
international
religious
freedom.
Nonpartisan
research
shows
76
percent
of
the
world's
population
"live
in
countries
with
a
high
or
very
high
level
of
restrictions
on
religion."
I
am
disturbed
by
the
widespread
persecution
of
Christians
and
increasing
anti-Semitism.
I
used
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
Ambassador-at-Large
for
International
Religious
Freedom
David
Saperstein
about
our
nation's
effort
to
secure
the
release
of
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini,
an
American
detained
by
Iran
since
2012.
He
assured
my
colleagues
and
me
that
all
diplomatic
efforts
are
being
undertaken,
and
it
was
good
to
hear
other
witnesses
speak
of
Ambassador
Saperstein's
commitment
to
bring
Pastor
Saeed
home.
China
is
listed
by
the
U.S.
Commission
on
International
Religious
Freedom
as
one
of
the
worst
persecutors
of
religious
freedom.
I
asked
another
panelist,
Bishop
Oscar
Cantu,
on
the
plight
of
the
Catholic
Church
in
China.
Despite
the
Vatican
seeking
better
ties,
the
Chinese
government
continues
to
persecute
Catholics
who
recognize
the
leadership
of
the
Pope.
Bishop
Cantu
noted
the
sensitivity
of
the
subject
and
the
need
to
tread
carefully
as
Rome
and
Beijing
negotiate.
However,
the
United
States
stands
ready
to
assist
all
who
wish
to
profess
their
beliefs
as
they
choose.

Inviting
Top
Secretaries
to
Visit
Kansas
This
week,
I
formally
invited
Secretary
of
Transportation
Anthony
Foxx
and
Secretary
of
Commerce
Penny
Pritzker
to
visit
Kansas
and
learn
more
about
our
vibrant
manufacturing
sector,
the
Kansas
business
community
and
the
transportation
needs
of
our
state.
Earlier
this
month,
both
secretaries
testified
before
the
Senate
Commerce
Committee
regarding
their
fiscal
year
2016
budget
requests.
During
that
hearing,
I
explained
some
of
the
transportation
challenges
Kansas
faces
and
need
for
a
long-term
highway
solution.
I
also
expressed
my
concern
to
both
secretaries
about
the
impact
of
the
Administrations
constant
attacks
on
the
aviation
industry
in
Kansas.

ATF
Rescinds
Proposal
to
Ban
M855
Sporting
Ammo
On
Tuesday,
the
Bureau
of
Alcohol,
Tobacco,
Firearms,
and
Explosives
(ATF)
rescinded
its
proposed
framework
to
ban
M855
ammunition.
Without
instruction
from
Congress,
ATF
intended
to
ban
this
ammunition
&ndash;
which
has
been
used
by
law-abiding
American
citizens
for
decades
&ndash;
because
it
is
"armor
piercing,"
and
therefore
poses
a
risk
to
the
safety
of
law
enforcement
officers.
The
fact
is,
almost
all
rifle
ammunition
is
"armor
piercing,"
and
the
Law
Enforcement
Officers
Protection
Act
of
1986
specifically
exempts
this
ammunition
for
sporting
purposes.
The
intent
of
this
law
was
clear:
law-abiding
citizens
should
not
be
deprived
of
their
right
to
use
M855
ammunition
for
legitimate
purposes
such
as
target
shooting,
hunting,
and
shooting
competitions.
Last
week,
I
joined
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
Chairman
Chuck
Grassley
in
outlining
these
concerns
to
ATF
Director
B.
Todd
Jones,
and
I
am
thankful
it
appears
our
message
was
received.
In
Kansas,
we
enjoy
a
rich
tradition
of
hunting,
target
shooting,
and
other
law-abiding
activities
protected
by
our
Second
Amendment
rights.
I
will
continue
to
monitor
the
Obama
Administration's
actions
and
strongly
oppose
any
effort
that
violates
our
firearm
freedoms.
Speaking
at
South-by-Southwest
I
took
a
detour
on
my
way
home
from
Washington
this
week,
to
stop
in
Austin,
Texas,
where
the
South-by-Southwest
Interactive
Conference
is
held
each
spring.
On
Saturday,
I
spoke
on
a
panel
about
the
engagement
between
the
startup
community
and
lawmakers
in
Washington.
Entrepreneurs
are
critical
drivers
of
economic
growth
in
America
but
too
often
bad
policies
in
Washington
make
it
harder
for
good
ideas
to
come
to
market
or
for
emerging
companies
to
survive.
Pro-growth
policies
can
start
with
entrepreneurs
and
their
success
will
result
in
improved
products
at
lower
prices,
more
jobs,
and
a
growing
American
economy.
While
in
Austin,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
a
number
of
Kansans
who
traveled
to
SXSW.
We
had
a
great
discussion
about
how
things
like
Dodd
Frank
regulations,
the
visa
system,
and
taxes
affect
small
businesses
and
their
prospects
for
success.
These
conversations
are
especially
valuable
because
they
offer
insight
on
the
state
of
American
small
business
and
the
greater
economy
that
is
difficult
to
get
from
looking
at
raw
economic
data.
I
will
continue
to
push
for
legislation
in
Washington
that
eases
the
path
for
Kansans
with
good
ideas
to
launch
a
small
business
and
compete
in
the
free
market
system.
Supporting
Short
Line
Railroads,
Rural
Economic
Development
This
week,
I
sponsored
the
Short
Line
Railroad
Rehabilitation
and
Investment
Act
of
2015
&ndash;
legislation
to
extend
the
short
line
railroad
track
maintenance
tax
credit,
which
expired
in
2014.
The
short
line
railroad
network
is
a
significant
component
of
our
transportation
system
and
plays
an
integral
role
in
connecting
farmers
and
factories
with
communities
around
the
globe.
I
was
proud
to
introduce
the
legislation
that
created
this
tax
credit
in
2004
as
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Representatives
to
help
support
large
areas
of
the
country,
including
rural
communities
like
those
across
Kansas,
where
short
lines
are
the
only
connection
to
the
national
railroad
network.
The
tax
credit
encourages
railroads,
railroad
customers
and
suppliers
&ndash;
who
depend
the
most
on
short
line
railroads
&ndash;
to
invest
directly
in
maintaining
the
more
than
2,000
miles
of
short
line
rails
in
Kansas,
as
well
as
systems
across
the
country.
Over
the
past
five
years,
the
short
line
railroad
tax
credit
has
generated
$1.5
billion
in
railroad
infrastructure
investment,
as
well
as
created
and
preserved
thousands
of
jobs.
It
is
vital
that
we
extend
this
tax
credit
so
that
rail
operators
will
be
able
to
increase
their
capacity
and
small
businesses
and
agriculture
producers
across
the
country
can
continue
to
get
their
commodities
and
goods
to
market
in
a
cost-effective
and
efficient
way.

and
the
legislative
process,
and
helps
ensure
a
generation
of
well-rounded
citizens.
I
commend
the
outstanding
achievements
of
these
remarkably
talented
and
engaged
young
Kansans.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
visit
with
young
people
like
these
who
take
a
strong
interest
in
the
issues
facing
our
country.

City
Visits
This
week,
my
staff
and
I
met
with
elected
leaders
from
the
communities
of
Olathe,
Shawnee,
Ottawa,
Lenexa,
Emporia,
Prairie
Village,
Manhattan.
We
discussed
numerous
issues
including
a
long-term
highway
authorization
bill
and
the
deductibility
of
interest
from
municipal
bonds.
Speaking
to
National
Business
Aviation
Association
On
Thursday,
I
spoke
to
leaders
of
the
National
Business
Aviation
Association
(NBAA)
about
the
importance
of
general
aviation
and
prospects
for
passing
legislation
to
reauthorize
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
in
2015.
Founded
in
1947,
NBAA
is
a
leading
organization
for
companies
relying
on
general
aviation
aircraft
to
help
their
businesses
be
more
efficient
and
productive.
General
aviation
is
the
largest
industry
in
Kansas,
generating
nearly
$3
billion
in
annual
exports
and
manufacturing
40
percent
of
all
GA
planes.
Federal
funding
for
FAA
expires
on
September
30,
2015,
and
legislation
to
reauthorize
the
agency
is
expected
to
be
introduced
this
spring.
During
the
last
reauthorization
cycle,
Congress
resorted
to
nearly
two
dozen
short-term
extensions
before
ultimately
passing
a
long-term
bill.
At
Thursday's
event,
we
discussed
several
issues
that
will
be
central
to
Congressional
consideration
in
this
year's
effort,
such
as
modernization
of
our
air
traffic
control
system
and
the
commercial
use
of
Unmanned
Aircraft
Systems.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Commerce
subcommittee
on
Aviation
Operations,
with
full
jurisdiction
over
FAA
reauthorization
efforts,
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
tackle
these
important
issues.
Many
thanks
to
NBAA
and
CEO
Ed
Bolen,
a
University
of
Kansas
graduate,
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
and
hospitality.
