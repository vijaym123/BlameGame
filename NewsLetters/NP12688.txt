What did you think of the Chrysler Super Bowl ad w/ Bob Dylan?
Dear Friends &#8211;
I hope you enjoyed the game last night, or at least the commercials.
I certainly did.
Specifically the Chrysler ad with Bob Dylan boosting
the new Chrysler 200 built right here in the heart of Southeast MI at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant.
It was a great depiction of the resurgence of our auto industry which spurred American innovation and our economy.
Makes me proud! &#8220;Is there anything
more American than America?&#8221;
What did you think?
