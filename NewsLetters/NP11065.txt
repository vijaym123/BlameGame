Friends,
Anniversaries are usually supposed to be a cause for
celebration.
Unfortunately, this past weeks anniversary was more
like a bad rendition of Groundhog Day than it was an excuse for balloons
and streamers.
Sunday, March 23 rd , marked the
four-year anniversary of President Obama signing Obamacare into law. Although
Nancy Pelosi was comfortable passing the law to find out whats in
it,
we all knew this would be a disastrous litany of broken
promises and empty rhetoric.
Four years later, our
deepest fears have unfortunately proved to be
true.
On top of
stopping job creation for millions of Americans who are out of work and
creating a part-time economy, this harmful law is forcing hard-working
individuals and families to deal with rising health care costs,
restricted access, and canceled insurance plans.
Just last
week,
WTVD
in Raleigh reported that in response to the laws
30-hour work week definition, our states public and private employers
are considering cutting employee hours just to stay afloat and avoid
Obamacares burdensome mandates.
In Greenville,
WITN
reports that the same Obamacare mandate is causing hours to be cut for as
many as 200 North Carolina
teachers.
The pain this law is causing
for millions of Americans is tragic.
It is no surprise
that with less than 10 days left to sign up, the Administration was
nowhere near the original enrollment numbers they needed and decided to
once again unilaterally delay the deadline in order to provide
themselves political cover.
This marks over 30 times that the
Administration has delayed its own law.
The American
people deserve basic fairness and genuine accountability from their
government, not self-serving executive overreach that only proves this law
is unworkable and in need of a permanent delay for
everyone.
Additionally
this week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases
challenging the constitutionality of Obamacares contraception mandate.
This mandate is a blatant violation of our fundamental right
to religious freedom.
While President Obama has proven
entirely comfortable granting delays and exemptions where it is
politically convenient for him, he refuses to grant the same leniency to
those whose conscience is violated by this unconstitutional mandate.
I hope the court will stand up for the First Amendment and demand the
Administration to show respect for the Constitution and for peoples
faiths.
Its past time that everyone admit that Obamacare is an utter
failure.
Instead of digging in their heels and trying to
force this train wreck on the American people, the Administration should
scrap it and start over by working with Republicans to advance
patient-centered reforms that ensure quality, affordable health
care.
I joined my House colleagues in proposing
The American
Health Care Reform Act
(H.R. 3121)a patient-centered system that
strengthens the doctor-patient relationship, reduces cost, increases
access, and allows American businesses to grow again.
I
will continue to do everything in my power to defund, repeal and replace
Obamacare.
Until next
week,
Richard
Hudson

Success
Story
Recently, a constituent
contacted my Concord office because he was having difficulty receiving
his Social Security Disability. Because the constituent was facing
financial hardship and his health was deteriorating, my office requested
that the judge review his medical records and make a decision without
a hearing. My staff helped expedite the process and helped him
receive a favorable decision within 3 months of contacting my
office.
If you need help navigating a federal agency, please dont
hesitate to call our Concord office at
704-786-1612 .
