Dear Friends,
Thanksgiving is a
uniquely American holiday. It does not celebrate a great leader or
patriotic day, yet it is part of our national existence. While not a
religious holiday, it is very much a part of my spiritual life. It is a
season to recognize we have been blessed, and from that blessing springs
a thankful heart.
When
I review the long list of things for which I am thankful in 2013,
people top the list. I reflect on those who have died in this past year,
and I am grateful that our lives intertwined. For those who are very
much alive, the brevity of life reminds me to not take my time with
them for granted.
I
have been blessed to be surrounded by wonderful people: parents and
in-laws who have given me a great heritage, a wife who supports me,
adult children and their spouses who make a dad proud, and two grand
children. This Thanksgiving, the air will be filled with the squeals and
laughter of Thomas and Harper playing on a tire swing in the front
yard.
I am thankful
for freedom, and those who have fought for it. A little over a year
ago, I had the great opportunity to administer the oath of office to my
son as he entered the US Navy, and I reflect on those who are not with
their families this year because they are keeping us
free.
The privilege of calling North
Mississippi home is also a blessing. This is a place where we care
about our neighbors and are committed to building a better world for
successive generations.
For
Thanksgiving 2013, I echo the words of the Psalmist of old, Praise
God from whom all blessings flow.
Stay in touch and God
bless,
