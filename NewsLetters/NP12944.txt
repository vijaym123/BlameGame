Friends,
I will hold my first Small Business Committee field hearing this Friday, January 24.
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access, I am able to hold federal field hearings in our district to examine our communitys needs.
My hearing this week in Dillon County will focus on solutions to rural unemployment and is open to the public.
I look forward to discussing with our witnesses what can be done to better foster job creation, particularly in rural areas. For more information about the hearing, please call one of my offices listed below.
Tomorrow, I will participate in
WPDEs ObamaCare Town Hall Meeting and speak at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention about my STOP Resolution,
both of which are open to the public. For more information about the Obamacare Town Hall Meeting click
HERE , and to learn more about the SC Tea Party Convention click

Last Friday, I attended the
Pee Dee Agriculture and Clemson Extension luncheon
and met with a packed room of Agriculture industry leaders.
We discussed the Advanced Plant Technology Program and the positive economic impact Clemsons Extension program has made in our district.
Upcoming STOP Resolution Interviews
The Stop This Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution now has 63 cosponsors and thousands of citizen cosponsors. Today, I will discuss the STOP Resolution with
Fox News Shannon Bream at 1:00PM. T omorrow, I will join Sean Hannity
at 2:00PM
to update him on the STOP Resolutions progress. I hope you are able to tune in.
Selected to Serve on Special P3 Panel
The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure last week established a special public-private partnership (P3s) panel.
The panel will focus on opportunities for P3s and best practices that can be used across the country to help create more jobs.
We will examine all modes of transportation, economic development, public buildings, water and maritime infrastructure. P3s have had a positive impact on South Carolinas infrastructure and I look forward to working with my colleagues on ways we can strengthen these partnerships nationwide.
Standing Up for South Carolinas Small Banks
I joined 27 of my colleagues last week in sending a letter to President Barack Obama expressing concern with his recent nominations to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The letter asks that the administration take into consideration the importance of appointing a governor who understands small community banks; one who can share their perspective with other governors when making decisions that could impact economic growth in rural communities and small counties.
As always, it is an honor and privilege to serve you.
Have a good week,
