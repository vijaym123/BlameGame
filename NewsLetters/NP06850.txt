Defeat, Not Just Contain,
ISIS
Last week Americans were reminded of the barbaric
and brutal nature of the terrorist ISIS army. It has occupied large
areas in Iraq and Syria, murdering innocent civilians and publicly
executing an American journalist in an effort to intimidate America and our
allies. The stated goals of ISIS are antithetical to a civilized
world. Now, as before, America needs to offer decisive leadership
to combat this threat and that of all terrorists who seek to destroy
and murder the innocent around the
world.
The president has believed from the beginning of his
administration that leading from behind allows the world to be a safer
place. That American disengagement would lead to more stability and peace.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The Obama Administration
needs a strategy to defeat, not just contain, this terrorist threat.
Congress, as always, stands ready to work with the Administration
where necessary to help protect and defend the American people and
support our allies.
More from Around the
District
This past week, we traveled all across the
Sixth District meeting with and listening to the thoughts and concerns of
folks on the ground doing their part to strengthen and improve our
communities. On Monday, I
spoke
at the Rotary Club of Sandy Springs
updating its members on
solutions we are focused on right now in Congress to address the
myriad of different challenges facing our country. That evening, I
met with the Knights of Columbus in
Marietta . We are thankful for the work they do to give back to our
communities.
On Tuesday we held
a
great town hall conversation
with local members of the AMAC
in Atlanta. Listening to and
understanding the issues of particular importance to our communitys
seniors
like our nations health and retirement programs
will have a
positive impact on how we help seniors today and future generations
retire with security and peace of mind.
On Wednesday,
we
visited Georgia Tech
where I got to the opportunity to see and
learn firsthand about the amazing technological innovations being
developed by talented engineers and scientists to aid in the delivery of
quality health care. And Thursday brought a visit to the Chamblee Chamber
of Commerce where we discussed what needs to be done in Washington to
make government more effective and efficient and how positive
solutions can pave the way for a brighter future for our communities and our
country.
It is a privilege to
represent such great folks working to improve our community. Please let
us know if you'd like us to visit your group or organization. Have a
wonderful week.
