Dear
Friends,
One of the foremost dangers that our nation faces is that of a
nuclear-capable Iran. Iran has not complied with the terms outlined by
the P5+1, continues production at the Arak heavy water reactor, denies
inspectors access to key facilities, and drags its feet every step of
the way as the P5+1 work to verify its intentions and capabilities. A
nuclear Iran would also present a threat to the security of our
greatest ally in the Middle East, the democratic Jewish State of Israel. The
Supreme Leader has already called for the destruction of Israel, and
nuclear weapons would only hasten the regimes ability to carry out
the Supreme Leaders expressed policy of hatred and terror towards our
strongest ally in the region.
Recently, Members of
Congress had the opportunity to hear Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu discuss the Iranian threat and the consequences of not acting to
prevent the regime in Tehran from further developing its nuclear program.
As the author of the strongest sanctions on Iran, I know that we must
continue to sanction Iran for its abysmal human rights practices, its
ballistic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction programs, its
worldwide support for terror, and its nuclear
program.
While some seek to advance a misguided and wholly unearned policy of
rapprochement with the Iranian regime, such an approach only weakens our
national security and the safety of Israel. As always, I welcome the
input from Israeli Prime Netanyahu and will continue to work to ensure
that Israel will always be able to count on our community and our
nation as one of its closest friends and allies.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
