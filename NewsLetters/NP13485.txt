Small Airplane
Revitalization Act
Congressman Pompeos leadership has been critical in guiding the Small Airplane Revitalization Act from introduction to law in just six months. This new law is a big win for Kansas, for our general aviation airframers and suppliers, and for every pilot and passenger who will reap the safety benefits.
- Pete Bunce,
President of General Aviation
Manufacturers Association
