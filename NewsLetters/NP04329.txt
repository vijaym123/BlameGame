Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Last week, I was pleased the Senate reauthorized the
Child
Care and Development Block Grant
that ensures working families
continue to have access to quality, affordable child care. This
legislation is the primary source of federal funding for child care,
benefitting nearly 1.6 million children nationwide, including more than 7,300 in
Nevada. In addition to child care assistance, states also use
this funding to improve the quality of care.
For millions of
families in the United States, child care is their single largest
household expense. The average cost of child care for a family with two
children is just under $15,000, which is more expensive than a year of
tuition at a public university. With an economy where most families
have two working parents, child care is a necessity, not a luxury. We
should be doing more to guarantee that every parent who wants to work can
afford adequate supervision for their children. And that every child,
regardless of income, has a safe place to learn.
Since
1996, when
Child Care and Development Block Grant
became law, we
have learned a great deal about the importance of early childhood
education and high-quality child care. This bipartisan reauthorization
builds on that knowledge. It updates health and safety standards for
child care centers, and requires providers to undergo comprehensive
background checks. However, this is only the first step, and I look forward
to continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
broaden access to quality early childhood education.
