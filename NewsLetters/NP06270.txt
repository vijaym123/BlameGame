Dear David,
Today marks the sixth anniversary of TransCanada's original
application to construct the Keystone XL Pipeline project. For six years,
President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid have played politics with
American jobs and our nation's energy security by delaying this
shovel-ready project.
More American energy means more
American jobs, and the Keystone XL Pipeline would help reduce our
dependence on foreign oil, support tens of thousands of jobs across the
country, and invest billions of dollars in the U.S.
economy.
With so many Americans still searching for
good-paying jobs, this decision should be common-sense. Click
here
to read the bipartisan legislation I co-sponsored to authorize
the construction and operation of the Keystone XL
Pipeline.
No more stalling. It's time for the president to put the
American people before politics and approve the Keystone XL Pipeline
now.
Sincere regards,
Washington
