Forbes Demands Administration Abandon
Plans for Executive Amnesty
Washington, D.C.
-
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) issued the following statement in response to the announcement that President Obama will take executive action on immigration:
The Presidents intention to act unilaterally to change our immigration laws is not discretion, but a blatant disregard of the separation of powers as laid out in the Constitution. I strongly urge the President not to proceed with granting executive amnesty to millions of people in this country illegally, and not to diminish our institutions, our Constitution, and our nations foundation built on the rule of law. Entry into the United States is not a right, but a privilege. The integrity of the law, as well as the integrity of our government, demand nothing less.
