PEARCE VOTES FOR ENHANCED
CYBERSECURITY PROTECTIONS
The U.S. House of
Representatives passed the National Cybersecurity Protection
Advancement Act of 2015, H.R. 1731.
U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued the
following statement:
Technology and the internet
improve our lives on a daily basis.
However, despite the benefits,
the internet poses a greater threat to our economic and physical
wellbeing than ever before, stated Pearce.
Every day,
individuals, coordinated groups, and foreign governments execute
millions of cyberattacks against the United States.
These attacks
range from attempts to steal classified defense secrets, which threaten
our national security, to stealing the intellectual property of a
business for the gain of another
threatening our economic competitiveness
globally.
While the target is different, the tactics are often
the same.
Pearce continued:
The work we
have done this week enables businesses to proactively defend and combat
against these attacks.
By protecting individual privacy and
information through multiple layers of scrubbing, these pieces of
legislation allow the federal government and private business to share only
the key information from a cyber-threat or the defense measure taken
against such a threat.
Cybersecurity is vitally important to the
health of our nation, but it cannot come at the compromise of Americans
civil liberties and right to privacy.
I believe the bills
passed strike the correct balance between privacy and sharing of critical
cyber-threat information.
It's
estimated that
$445
billion
per year is lost to
cybercrime across the world economy. In the federal government alone,
there were
46,160
incidents
reported in
2013.
This week the House passed the Protecting Cyber
Networks Act (H.R. 1560) and the National Cybersecurity Protection
Advancement Act of 2015 (H.R. 1731), both strongly bipartisan bills, which
help deter cyberattacks and would increase the exchange of hacking data
between the government and
businesses.
PEARCE CELEBRATES 67 YEARS OF
ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE
"Happy
Independence Day to Israel. For the past 67 years, the State of Israel has stood
as a pillar for democracy in the Middle East
and as our strongest
ally. We must stand with the Israeli people to support their ability to
prosper for generations to come -- under the principles we share --
freedom, justice and peace," said
Pearce.
Congressman Pearce
attended an event in Albuquerque
to celebrate 67 years of Israeli independence, which is commemorated
this month. Hosted by AIPAC, the program included a segment in which
Congressmen Pearce took questions on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle
East.
DON'T MISS THIS HIRING OPPORTUNITY FOR
VETERANS!
The New Mexico Trucking
Association and New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services have worked
incredibly hard to put this event together and Congressman Pearce
applauds their efforts. If you have any questions about the Job Fair or
would like to register, you can call
1-(866) 433-8387 or (505)
884-5575.
