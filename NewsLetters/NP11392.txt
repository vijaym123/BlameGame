Dear Friend-
Earlier today, Russia's President Vladimir Putin banned nine U.S. Officials from entry to Russia because of their efforts to promote democracy and freedom. I was one of them.
I want you to hear it from me first:
I wear these sanctions by Putin as a badge of honor.
It will not stop me from using my power as chair of the Energy Committee to promote America as an energy superpower and help increase energy exports around the world.
We must minimize Russia's influence over Europe, the former Soviet states-especially Ukraine that has fought so long for freedom-and our allies.
Know that I will not back down, and that I will continue to support democracy and freedom at home and aboard. Read more about these sanction in
this WWL article .
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
the office nearest you .
