Dear Friend,
As the father of three, I know how
difficult it can be for both high school
students and parents to navigate the
college application process. That is why my
office is pooling together resources so
that they are in one place for perspective
college students.
On
Thursday, February 19,
2015,
our office will host a
College Affordability
Program
at the
Akron General Health and Wellness
Center
in Uniontown, Ohio from
6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m . We
will have information about financial aid,
scholarship and grant opportunities, and
earning college credits while attending
high school. A panel of speakers, including
representatives from the U.S. Department of
Education, the College Board, and the Ohio
Association of Student Financial Aid
Administrators (OASFAA), will attend and be
prepared to answer your questions. The
event is free and open to the public. I
encourage all students and their parents
living in Ohios 16
th
District to attend with
questions.
We in the House of Representatives
recognize that during this time of economic
uncertainty, it is becoming more and more
challenging for parents to afford a higher
education for their children. Stagnant
wages and the lowest labor force
participation rate in decades make it all
the more difficult.
According to the Department of Education
(DOE), the total cost of paying for college
is higher in Ohio compared with public
institutions in other states.With
student loan debt in the United States
surpassing one trillion dollars, it is
imperative that Congress enact commonsense,
long-term reforms. Ensuring that students
and parents have the resources and
flexibility they need to make smart choices
about their education based on each
individuals unique financial
situation is critical.
This past week, a bill was introduced in
the House that would make higher education
more affordable by expanding and
modernizing 529 college savings plans.
Today, there are more than 12 million
accounts that have resulted in over $225
billion saved toward a college education.
Specifically, this legislation clarifies
that computers are a qualified expense for
529 account funds and it eliminates
unnecessary paperwork, making it easier for
students to obtain the tools they need in
order to excel in college. Additionally, it
permits the re-deposit of refunds from
colleges without taxes or penalties. For
example, if you are a student and withdraw
early due to illness or another reason and
obtain a refund from the school, as it
stands the refund would be subject to
income tax earnings and a 10 percent
penalty
this bill fixes that.
We all know that a good education leads
to expanded opportunity, and that is why it
is critical that we do our part to make
higher education more affordable. I look
forward to updating you on this important
legislation, and I encourage you to attend
the College Affordability Program on
February 19
