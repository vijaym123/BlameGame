Update from Senator Bob Corker
February

Obama Administration Now Out of Excuses on Keystone XL
Pipeline
With the release yesterday of another
environmental analysis of the Keystone XL pipeline that did not alter a
prior finding of no significant environmental impact from the project,
Senator Corker, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said
the Obama administration is now out of excuses for refusing to grant
completion of the pipeline, which was first proposed in 2008. The
State Department has yet to approve construction of the final section of
the pipeline, which, if completed, will have the capacity to transfer
more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Canada to refineries on
the Gulf Coast of the U.S.
The Obama administration is now
out of excuses for refusing to grant completion of this project. By
any reasonable standard, the Keystone XL pipeline is in the national
interest and will enhance U.S. economic and energy security. Not only
will the pipeline create jobs, promote economic growth and expand access
to North American energy, it will also provide a safer and more
environmentally friendly method of transporting oil, said
Corker.
Senate Caves to Narrow
Parochial Interests on Flood Insurance Bill
On
Thursday, Senator Corker voted against S. 1926, the Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act, which delays for over four years much needed
reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program, a program that is
already $24 billion in debt.
Just a few months after the new
flood insurance rates started to go into effect, rates that actually
reflect a more reasonable estimate of the true cost of this federal
program, the Senate caved to narrow parochial interests. If we really
wanted to address the legitimate affordability concerns of some, we would
have passed the Toomey Amendment, which phases in risk-based rates
more slowly while providing FEMA and legislators the opportunity to
consider and adopt an adequate means-testing program. We will never solve
our nations toughest challenges if we cant even live for a few months
within the terms of the small reform measures we actually do put into
law, said Corker.
Beretta to Invest $45 Million in
Tennessee
Senator Corker applauded Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam and Beretta USA
officials following an announcement that the company will invest $45
million in a new firearms manufacturing facility in Gallatin, which
will bring 300 new jobs to the area.
A $45 million
investment and the creation of 300 new jobs is outstanding news for Tennessee,
and I want to thank Beretta and its employees for making such a
substantial investment in our state, said Corker. I applaud Governor
Haslam and his economic development team for their work to attract
high-quality jobs to Tennessee, and I am proud to join them in welcoming
Beretta to Gallatin.
