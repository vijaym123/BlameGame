Capitol Update
The Need to Provide for the Common Defense
For the past 200 years, Congress has set our national security
priorities through the National Defense Authorization Act. This
legislation allows our military to pay and equip our troops and
maintain the most advanced fighting force in the world. In the upcoming
weeks, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have the
privilege of working on this bill to ensure our armed forces are
rebuilt following thirteen years of war. Funding and equipping our
armed forces is assigned to Congress by Article I of the Constitution.
In this increasingly dangerous world, where our brave men and women in
uniform must be ready to meet these challenges, failure to pass this
bill is not an option.
In order for America's armed forces to remain dominant, we must
recognize that even small budgetary reductions can have a huge impact
on capabilities. This year, the President requested a budget that takes
an axe to defense spending. With the size and scope of entitlements and
other domestic spending continuing to grow, defense continues to be
crowded out of the picture. Because of this, we have to make wise
decisions that make the most of the military funding available.
With these realities in mind, Congress must ensure it continues its
vital role in overseeing the military, while providing support to our
troops and their families, and value to the taxpayer.
Maintaining military readiness means looking at the strategic picture
and preparing the military to meet potential threats. This year, I will
be supporting military construction at the National Training Center at
Fort Irwin. This training center provides our soldiers with hands-on
training in conditions similar to those in combat. Further development
of the National Training Center allows our soldiers to improve
integration of technology into military strategy.
Nations like Russia and China are undergoing rapid and aggressive
nuclear modernization programs, and rogue states like North Korea and
Iran continue developing nuclear weapons. To ensure our armed forces
have the equipment they need, I am calling for identifying and making
available defensive gear to protect our troops against the threat of
weapons of mass destruction.
We live in an increasingly dangerous world, and our troops must be
prepared to carry out large-scale military actions. The time for debate
about our national security policy is now. As this process moves
forward, I will work to ensure our armed forces have the personnel,
training, and resources they need to meet the threats of the 21st
century. Our national security and the men and women who defend our
country must be our top priority.
Congressman Cook Votes in Favor of Open Government
Yesterday, Congressman Cook voted for S. 994, the Digital
Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act. The bill, designed to make
public records of federal expenditures more accessible to taxpayers,
passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
The DATA Act will consolidate and standardize government-spending data
while continuing to utilize USASpending.gov as the source of
information for taxpayers to learn where their money is going.
Government-wide accounting and reporting standards will enable
different agencies, companies, and citizens to compare spending more
easily. By making government documents simpler to understand, office
holders seek to restore the public's trust after years of erosion.
By cutting some bureaucracy out of the process and presenting higher
quality data, more transparency will come to a system that is too often
riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. Taxpayers are entitled to know
how their money is being spent, especially in this administration's era
of escalating debt and irresponsible spending.
A Message from Congressman Cook about Secretary Kerry's Anti-Israeli
Remarks
I was disappointed to hear that Secretary Kerry used the term 'apartheid
state' regarding Israel. His racially charged statement fails to
recognize Israel's unique situation as the only democratic state in an
increasingly authoritarian Middle East.
Irresponsible rhetoric like Secretary Kerry's only encourages one side
at the expense of the other. His comments come as this administration
continues to blame Israel rather than Palestinian obstructionism for
the failure of the Middle East peace process. I call on Secretary Kerry
to reject using the term 'apartheid' and issue the people and
government of Israel an apology. His most recent clarification did
nothing to answer these concerns. He needs to apologize immediately,
not blame others for his own words.
Secretary Kerry's comments come as the peace talks between Israel and
Palestine have stalled. Last week, Fatah, the leading political
movement in the West Bank, chose to form a coalition government with
Hamas, a terrorist organization dedicated to Israel's destruction. This
prompted Israel to withdraw from peace talks as long as the
Palestinians share power with the terrorists.
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Bill to Hold the Department of Veterans
Affairs Accountable
Recently, Congressman Cook proudly cosponsored the Department of
Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014. This bill would
give the Secretary of the VA the authority to fire an individual from
the Senior Executive Service if the Secretary determines that person is
unqualified for the position.
The legislation will provide some much needed accountability to an
agency that is famously flawed. The goal of the VA Management
Accountability Act is to give the Secretary more power over the agency
by making it easier for incompetent bureaucrats to be displaced.
Said Cook, "There is a laundry list of issues at the VA. I'm happy to
do whatever I can to reform an institution that has failed our veterans
for too long. Allowing the secretary to fire those who fail to serve
our veterans well is a necessary first step to fixing the VA and
guaranteeing our veterans receive the benefits they've earned."

Capitol
Update
The
Need
to
Provide
for
the
Common
Defense
For
the
past
200
years,
Congress
has
set
our
national
security
priorities
through
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
This
legislation
allows
our
military
to
pay
and

our

and

the
most
advanced

in
the

In
the
upcoming

as
a

of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee,
I
have
the
privilege
of
working
on
this
bill
to
ensure
our
armed
forces
are
rebuilt
following
thirteen
years
of
war.
Funding
and
equipping
our
armed
forces
is
assigned
to
Congress
by
Article
I
of
the
Constitution.
In
this
increasingly
dangerous
world,
where
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
must
be
ready
to
meet
these
challenges,
failure
to
pass
this
bill
is
not
an

In
order
for
America&#8217;s
armed

to
remain
dominant,
we
must
recognize
that
even
small

can
have
a
huge

on
capabilities.
This

the
President

a

With
the
size
and

of
entitlements
and
other
domestic

continuing

defense
continues
to
be
crowded
out
of
the

Because
of
this,
we
have
to
make
wise
decisions
that
make
the
most
of
the
military
funding
available.
With
these
realities
in
mind,
Congress
must
ensure
it
continues
its
vital
role
in
overseeing
the
military,
while
providing
support
to
our
troops
and
their
families,
and
value
to
the

Maintaining
military
readiness
means
looking
at
the
strategic
picture
and
preparing
the
military
to
meet
potential
threats.
This
year,
I
will
be
supporting
military
construction
at
the
National
Training
Center
at
Fort
Irwin.
This
training
center
provides
our
soldiers
with
hands-on

in
conditions
similar
to
those
in
combat.
Further
development
of
the
National

allows
our

to
improve

of
technology
into
military
strategy.
Nations
like
Russia
and
China
are
undergoing
rapid

nuclear
modernization
programs,
and
rogue
states
like
North

and
Iran

they

I
am

We
live
in
an
increasingly
dangerous
world,
and
our
troops
must
be
prepared
to
carry
out
large-scale
military
actions.
The
time
for
debate
about
our
national
security
policy
is
now.
As
this
process
moves
forward,
I
will
work
to
ensure
our
armed
forces
have
the
personnel,
training,
and
resources
they
need
to
meet
the
threats
of
the
21st
century.
Our
national
security
and
the
men
and
women
who
defend
our
country
must
be
our
top
priority.

A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
about
Secretary
Kerry&#8217;s
Anti-Israeli
Remarks
I
was
disappointed
to
hear
that
Secretary
Kerry
used
the
term
&#8216;apartheid
state&#8217;
regarding
Israel.
His
racially
charged
statement
fails
to
recognize
Israel&#8217;s
unique
situation
as
the
only
democratic
state
in
an
increasingly
authoritarian
Middle
East.
Irresponsible
rhetoric
like
Secretary
Kerry&#8217;s
only
encourages
one
side
at
the
expense
of
the
other.
His
comments
come
as
this
administration
continues
to
blame
Israel
rather
than
Palestinian
obstructionism
for
the
failure
of
the
Middle
East
peace
process.
I
call
on
Secretary
Kerry
to
reject
using
the
term
&#8216;apartheid&#8217;
and
issue
the
people
and
government
of
Israel
an
apology.
His
most
recent
clarification
did
nothing
to
answer
these
concerns.
He
needs
to
apologize
immediately,
not
blame
others
for
his
own
words.
Secretary
Kerry&#8217;s
comments
come
as
the
peace
talks
between
Israel
and
Palestine
have
stalled.
Last
week,
Fatah,
the
leading
political
movement
in
the
West
Bank,
chose
to
form
a
coalition
government
with
Hamas,
a
terrorist
organization
dedicated
to
Israel&#8217;s
destruction.
This
prompted
Israel
to
withdraw
from
peace
talks
as
long
as
the
Palestinians
share
power
with
the
terrorists.
Congressman
Cook
Cosponsors
Bill
to
Hold
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Accountable
Recently,
Congressman
Cook
proudly
cosponsored
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
of
2014.
This
bill
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
VA
the
authority
to
fire
an
individual
from
the
Senior
Executive
Service
if
the
Secretary
determines
that
person
is
unqualified
for
the
position.
The
legislation
will
provide
some
much
needed
accountability
to
an
agency
that
is
famously
flawed.
The
goal
of
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act
is
to
give
the
Secretary
more
power
over
the
agency
by
making
it
easier
for
incompetent
bureaucrats
to
be
displaced.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;There
is
a
laundry
list
of
issues
at
the
VA.
I&#8217;m
happy
to
do
whatever
I
can
to
reform
an
institution
that
has
failed
our
veterans
for
too
long.
Allowing
the
secretary
to
fire
those
who
fail
to
serve
our
veterans
well
is
a
necessary
first
step
to
fixing
the
VA
and
guaranteeing
our
veterans
receive
the
benefits
they&#8217;ve
earned.&#8221;
