Dear Friends,
Tuesday is Election Day,
when Americans of all stripes have a chance to have their
say.
For me, its a moment that affirms the genius of our Founders. Since
the Constitutions ratification in 1789, Americans have been engaged
in the profound experiment of
self-governance.
Unfortunately, voter participation has been declining in Idaho. In the last
off-year, non-presidential election in 2010, just 40 percent of those 18
years and older voted. Thats down from 57 percent in 1986. In the 2012
presidential election, 58 percent voted, down from 69 percent in
1980.
Im especially concerned about young voters skipping elections.
Participation is the essence of democracy and its important we
encourage the next generation to engage.
As voter apathy rises,
its worth remembering what Benjamin Franklin said at the close of the
Constitutional Convention in 1787 when asked if the Founders had
decided on a monarchy or republic.
Replied Franklin: A
republic, if you can keep it.
For those of us privileged to hold
high office, Election Day is a day of humility, the day when we learn
whether we continue to enjoy the trust of those we
serve.
One of my favorite figures in history, Winston Churchill, had a rich
appreciation of the power of the people. Having led Britain through her
darkest hour in World War II, the voters turned Churchill and his party
out after the Allied victory.
They have a perfect right
to kick me out, said Churchill, hearing the news during one of his
long baths. That is democracy.
If you havent already voted,
I encourage you to show up at your polling place Tuesday. For those
who arent registered
even if youve never voted
Idaho is among
eight states that allow registration on Election Day. For details, go to
www.idahovotes.gov, a website maintained by the Idaho Secretary of
State. Youll also find easy links to verify your registration, locate
your polling place, the Idaho Voters Pamphlet and other
information.
Remember to bring photo identification to the polls. You may
present an Idaho drivers license or Department of Transportation
photo ID, a U.S. passport of federal photo ID, or a current student photo
ID. If you are not able to show an acceptable ID, you may sign an
affidavit, under penalty of perjury, swearing to your
identity.
I encourage all of you, your family and your friends to get out to
vote and help keep our republic.
Thank
you ,
