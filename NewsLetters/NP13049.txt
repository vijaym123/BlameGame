Why you should care about unconstitutional recess
appointments
Yesterday, I had the great privilege of
attending the oral arguments for the
NLRB v. Noel Canning
case as
they were presented before the Supreme Court.
After hearing
oral arguments, I am very confident the Supreme Court will affirm the DC
Circuit Courts judgment in
NLRB v. Noel Canning
and determine
that the presidents recess appointments on January 4, 2012, were
unconstitutional.
In making the appointments, the president took a
power that does not belong to him. It rightfully
belongs to the American people , through their representatives in the
Senate, and is an essential constitutional check on the executive
branch.
I am confident the Supreme Court will restore the Senates
prerogatives and condemn this assault on the rule of law.
Even
if the court does affirm the DC Circuit Court's judgment, I still
believe there is a broader debate about what it means to take an oath to
uphold the Constitution.
I believe Congress, and in this case
the Senate, has an important role to play in defending the Constitution,
and we shouldn't be content to simply leave issues like this to the
courts to iron out the details.
On the surface this appears to be
a fight between senators, presidents, and judges, but ultimately what
is at stake is something that belongs to you, the American
people.
After attending the oral arguments on this case, I delivered
this floor speech
to share my thoughts on this
issue.
I would like to hear what you think about this, and you can
