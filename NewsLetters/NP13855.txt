Dear
David,
This week, family and friends will gather together to give
thanks for the many blessings we have received this year. As we count our
good fortune this Thanksgiving, let us not forget the simple fact that
we are blessed to be citizens of this great nation. Our Founding
Fathers outlined a set of ideals and values that we still hold dear today
an example of the strength and unity of this country and its
people.
Therefore, let us give thanks to our men and women in
uniform who have so bravely defended our freedoms. Let us remember their
selfless sacrifices, as well as those of their families, and let us
pay tribute to those who have given their lives, the ultimate
sacrifice, in support of these ideals. Thanksgiving is a time for our country
to restore its faith in itself, as well as our fellow Americans. It is
also a time for us to refocus our priorities on the very ideals our
forefathers used to guide their decisions: God, country and
family.
Let us observe Thanksgiving with gratitude and reverence for the
past, as well as hope and optimism for the future.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of
Congress
