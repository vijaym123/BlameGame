Criticizing an Illegal Prisoner
Swap
9/9/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn spoke on the House Floor in
support of House Resolution 644, Condemning and disapproving of the
Obama administration's failure to comply with the lawful statutory
requirement to notify Congress before releasing the Taliban 5. The
resolution passed on a bipartisan vote of 249 to
163.
"Congress must stand up and voice our
displeasure with the way this whole prisoner exchange took place. We are a
nation that believes in the importance of the rule of law. We have a
Congress that makes laws, and a President who is supposed to enforce them.
In this case, the law was broken, and Congress cannot remain
silent."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
