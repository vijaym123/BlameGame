Friend
Americans were outraged (and rightly so) when it was
discovered
last year that the Department of Health and Human Services was using taxpayer dollars for massive advertisement buys to promote Obamacare primarily targeting states that opted-out of the laws Medicaid expansion.
Thats why I cosponsored the Taxpayer Transparency Act ( H.R.310 ) to require agencies to disclose when taxpayer dollars are being spent for advertising
whether it's printed mailers, brochures, TV and radio ads, or billboards. This stops agencies from advertising without accountability to the American public.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I will keep you posted on the status of this bill as it moves through the legislative process.
