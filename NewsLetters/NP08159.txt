LEGISLATION
July 03, 2014
Dear
David,
For 238 years, America has been
a symbol of opportunity and freedom around the world. Tomorrow, as we
come together in the spirit of patriotism to celebrate this joyous and
festive holiday, we remember the brave service men and women with us
today and the heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep
America safe and secure. We also honor and offer our gratitude to those
serving overseas, away from their loved ones, to protect our freedoms.
Their courage and heroism will never be forgotten.
Below you
can find a sampling of some of the many festivals and celebrations
being held throughout the North State. As always, please feel free to
contact any of my offices if you have any questions or
concerns.
I hope you and your families have a happy and safe Fourth of
July!
Sincerely,
Redding 4th of July
