Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

State Appeals FEMA Denial of Public Assistance
On Thursday the Illinois Emergency Management Agency filed an appeal
with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) for Public
Assistance for local governmental and utility entities who had expenses
related to the November 17, 2013, deadly tornadoes and storms. The
original application was denied in January.
A new total of $21.4 million in clean-up and repair and replacement
costs for property damage in nine counties was submitted. Communities
in the 15th District affected are Champaign, Douglas, Massac,
Vermilion, Washington, and Wayne counties.
The Illinois Congressional delegation, including myself, sent a letter
of support for this appeal to the President. I am hopeful - on behalf
of the communities of Brookport, Gifford, and others - that the new
information will be enough to grant FEMA's approval.
If approved, the communities would be eligible for 75 percent
reimbursement by FEMA for the qualifying expenses.
Propane Prices Still High
Last week I discussed the issue of propane shortages, pricing, and
supply and demand. Propane retailers are still dealing with extremely
high demand due to the cold weather.
While most retailers are trying their best to meet contractual
obligations and deliver as much propane as possible, as quickly as
possible, there could still be unresolved issues between customers and
retailers. If you are unable to resolve an issue with your propane
retailer - or any business for that matter - the Attorney General's
office accepts consumer complaints.
Just go to the Attorney General's Protecting Consumers website
(http://goo.gl/TpbDJ
) and file a complaint regarding the issue.
Valentines for Heroes
Since 2008 my office has been collecting valentines for our injured
soldiers. The first effort focused on those recuperating at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center. Due to your tremendous outpouring of support -
with thousands of valentines sent in each year and with changing
military dynamics - we now focus on our local soldiers and veterans.
Valentines are shared with VA medical centers in Danville, Marion, and
St. Louis, VA clinics, Scott Air Force Base, USO at Lambert Airport in
St. Louis, and Illinois Veterans Homes in Anna and Quincy.
Your efforts, not mine, make this possible. Individuals, Sunday
schools, day cares, classes and more - from throughout Illinois, not
just the 15th District, and even other states - appreciate the service
that both our active duty military and veterans have made.
Shown below are the Southeastern Illinois College Mary Jo Oldham Center
for Child Studies kindergarten class presenting valentines to John
Hanson, my new Harrisburg office staff person, center, and the St.
John's Community Care Adult Day Program from Edwardsville presenting
valentines to Dora Rohan, far left, at my Maryville office.
Hunting and Fishing on Federal Land
On Wednesday the House passed a bill that combined several pieced of
legislation into one package related to supported the rights of hunters
and fishermen. The Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement
Act is meant to stop the over-regulating that hampers the public's
right to use federal property for hunting, fishing, and shooting.
Provisions include:
+ reaffirms that fishing, hunting, and shooting are activities that
should be allowed to continue or not be blocked on public lands
operated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
+ protects Second Amendment rights on Army Corps of Engineers property.
+ reiterates and clarifies existing law to protect lead bullets and
tackles from increased costs due to federal regulation for hunters,
sports shooters, and fishermen.
+ grants Secretary of Interior authority to allow states to issue
electronic duck stamps.
+ declares recreational hunting and fishing as environmentally
acceptable.
Energy and Congress
In my duties as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, I am asked
to participate in public policy discussions. Thursday morning the
Washington-based media outlet Politico hosted such a forum.

Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge: The new Interstate 70 crossing
over the Mississippi River in St. Louis was celebrated with a ribbon
cutting on Saturday and should be open for vehicle traffic today.
I
cosponsored Congressman Rodney Davis' bill that the President signed
into law giving the bridge its official name.
The $229.5 million bridge is part of the $700 million total project to
move I-70 off the Poplar Street Bridge, one of only two river bridges
in the country carrying three interstate highways.
Farm Bill Signed Into Law: The President signed the Agricultural Act of
2014 into law on Friday at Michigan State University. The law ends
direct payments to farmers and encourages risk management practices and
crop insurance instead. In addition, $8 billion over ten years is saved
in food stamp reforms. That is only a one percent reduction each year.

Propane
Prices
Still
High Last
week
I
discussed
the
issue
of
propane
shortages,
pricing,
and
supply
and
demand. Propane
retailers
are
still
dealing
with
extremely
high
demand
due
to
the
cold
weather.
While
most
retailers
are
trying
their
best
to
meet
contractual
obligations
and
deliver
as
much
propane
as
possible,
as
quickly
as
possible,
there
could
still
be
unresolved
issues
between
customers
and
retailers.
If
you
are
unable
to
resolve
an
issue
with
your
propane
retailer
-
or
any
business
for
that
matter
-
the
Attorney
General's
office
accepts
consumer
complaints.
Just
go
to
the

and
file
a
complaint
regarding
the
issue.
