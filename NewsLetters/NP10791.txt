Dear Friend,
I continue to receive letters, phone calls, and emails from folks asking for the truth about Benghazi.
Setting the facts straight is important to our national security and to ensure this never happens again.
We owe it to the Americans who lost their lives, their families, and those who continue to bravely serve today.
They deserve the whole truth, our complete support, and the assurance that their government has their best interests in mind.
Congress will continue to hold hearings until we get to the bottom of Benghazi.
Just recently, the House Intelligence Committee had former Deputy Director of the CIA, Mike Morrell, testify publicly about editing the Administration's talking points regarding what happened on the ground.
