Rep. Takano Appointed to House Committee on Education and the Workforce
Last month, Rep. Takano was appointed to the House Education and
Workforce Committee and issued the following statement:
"I'm incredibly proud to be joining the Education and Workforce
Committee," said Takano. "Having spent more than twenty years as a
classroom teacher and a union member, I have a unique perspective on
how to improve our education system and the lives of our nations'
workers. It is a perspective that is not influenced by special
interests, but rather the idea that we should take care of our workers
and that America should be the best educated nation in the world. I
thank Leader Pelosi, as well as Congresswoman DeLauro and Congressman
Miller of the Steering Committee for this opportunity, and look forward
to working on these important issues."
Prior to being elected to Congress in 2012, Takano spent more than
twenty years as a classroom teacher in Riverside County, California and
on the Riverside Community College Board of Trustees. Since taking
office, Takano has used his experience as a teacher to advocate for
improving the American education system through meaningful reforms that
will positively impact student performance.
Takano is also an outspoken critic of the for-profit college industry,
which often saddles students with meaningless degrees and large amounts
of debt. Takano has repeatedly called for a strong gainful employment
rule that would limit the federal funding to institutions that are not
properly preparing their students to enter the workforce.
Takano is a current National Education Association union member and an
ardent supporter of labor and workforce protections.

Takano Signs Petition to Force Vote on Immigration Reform
Last month, Rep. Takano signed a discharge petition for the Senate
Immigration Bill titled the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and
Immigration Modernization Act (H.R. 15). If 218 House Members sign the
petition, Speaker Boehner will be forced to bring the bill to the floor
for a vote.
Takano released the following video after signing the petition.

"We've known for decades that our immigration system is broken. It is
overrun with inefficiencies and outdated policies. The Senate has
passed a bill that addresses many of the current problems, but Speaker
Boehner is refusing to move forward on the issue.
House Democrats, however, are taking action.
Earlier today, I signed what's called a discharge petition. If 218
members of the House sign it, Speaker Boehner would be forced to hold a
vote on our immigration reform bill. If that happens, I believe it will
pass."
