News and Media
Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
This week has been a
somber one, as we reflect on the tragedy that struck our nation 13
years ago, and work together to ensure that we protect our great nation
from the new threats we face.
Those who lost their lives and who heroically laid down their lives to
save others on September 11, 2001 will never be forgotten.
Responding to Terrorist ISIS Threat
Our world remains a dangerous place.
America has to show decisive
leadership, principled strength and continuous resolve when confronted
with threats like ISIS. Lest we forget, two American journalists -
James Foley and Steven Sotloff - were barbarically beheaded by these
and ISIS continue to show an eagerness to act brutally against
religious minorities and other innocent people of the region.
I am hopeful that the President's outline for regional partnerships to
combat this continuing threat is finally signaling a willingness to
strategically address the rise of ISIS.
Launching the Women in Leadership Series
Being raised by an incredibly strong and hardworking mother, I have an
immense respect for the contributions of women to our society at all
levels.
This Monday, I am excited to host the first in a series of
"Women in Leadership" discussions in North Charleston.
We will be
welcoming former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina to share her
valuable perspective at the event.
The "Women in Leadership"
discussion series will be a robust discussion on the successes of and
the obstacles faced by women in all walks of life, including business,
non-profit, military, family and faith-based endeavors.
Thanking those who Serve Our Country
Every year, I look forward to the opportunity the USO brings to Capitol
Hill to allow Members of Congress to volunteer our time to pack care
packages for the troops while we have to be in Washington, DC for
legislative duties.
We have so much to be thankful for, and this is
just one more small way we can take the time to let the men and women
who wear our uniform and protect our nation how much they are
appreciated.
It is an honor to serve you and your family in the United States
Senate, and your feedback is extremely important to me.
Please do not
hesitate to email me or call my office at (843) 727-4525.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
