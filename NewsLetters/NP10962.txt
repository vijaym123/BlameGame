Standing with Oso and Darrington
I returned to Arlington and Darrington
this weekend to meet with officials on the
ground, volunteers, survivors and first
responders. What I saw there was some
of the worst devastation Ive ever
witnessed. But at the same time I
also saw incredible acts of generosity and
kindness. I saw firefighters who
hadnt slept in days because they
just wouldnt stop searching for
survivors. I saw families refusing to
give up hope, and I saw communities that
need our entire state and our entire
country to stand with them now. In
the coming weeks, months, years, and for
however long it takes, all of us will stand
with the people of Oso and Darrington to
help provide them with the resources
theyre going to desperately need in
this recovery and rebuilding effort.

Putting an End to Bullying and
Harassment at College
Last week, I was proud to reintroduce
legislation aimed at curbing harassment and
bullying at colleges and universities
across the country. The
Tyler
Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment
Act of 2014
requires colleges and
universities to prohibit harassment and
establishes within the Department of
Education a grant program to support campus
anti-harassment programs. The legislation
was first introduced by the late Senator
Frank Lautenberg after Tyler Clementi, a
freshman at Rutgers University, took his
own life after his roommate and another
student invaded his privacy and harassed
him over the Internet.
Despite statistics telling us LGBT
students are nearly twice as likely to be
harassed, there is no federal requirement
that colleges and universities have
policies in place to protect their
students. Thankfully, this bill gets to the
heart of this issue by ensuring students
and schools alike have the tools and
resources necessary to not only prevent
this epidemic of harassment, but assist
survivors who are too often left with no
sense of closure or recourse. No student
whether theyre gay,
straight, black, white, Christian, or
Muslim
should have to face
discrimination and harassment in their
pursuit of education.

Not Your Boss Business
Last week, I was able to sit in on the
first day of arguments before the Supreme
Court as they began hearing a set of cases
addressing whether secular, for-profit
corporations, can deny their employees
contraceptive insurance coverage provided
for under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
based on the corporations' and their
shareholders personal religious
beliefs. I was proud to lead the
Senates
brief filed in the Hobby Lobby case ,
opposing efforts by private corporations to
get in between a woman and her access to
comprehensive health coverage.
Politics and ideology should not matter
when it comes to making sure women get the
care they need at a cost they can
afford.

21
st
Century Worker Tax Cut Act:
Giving Struggling Workers and Families the
Tax Relief They Deserve
As we continue the debate about how to
expand opportunity to those who are
struggling, we need to make sure we are
giving todays workforce the best
shot at success in todays economy.
We should increase our outdated minimum
wage to give millions of workers a raise,
and then Democrats and Republicans need to
come together to update our tax code, and
give todays struggling workers the
tax relief they deserve. That is why
last week, I introduced the
21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act,
a bill that would update the tax code
to help todays workers and families
keep more of what they earn.
The bill builds on work incentives both
Republicans and Democrats agree have been
effective, and it is paid for by closing
wasteful and inefficient tax loopholes both
parties have proposed eliminating. I
think this bill would be a strong, fiscally
responsible step forward, and I am hopeful
that we can get this done for our workers
as quickly as possible.
