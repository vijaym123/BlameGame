PEARCE
TELLS
THE VA TO GET WITH THE CHOICE
PROGRAM
According to the Associated Press,
nearly a year after Americans were shocked by incidents involving sick
veterans getting sicker while enduring long wait times, VA statistics show
that New Mexico veterans are still plagued with long waiting lists
and substandard service.
In an
apparent attempt to respond to these poor reviews, the Albuquerque VA
announced this week that it had established a new (temporary) phone line
for veterans subject to long waits.
That should have been done last year when the problem was first
discovered or, at the latest, in August 2014 when the president signed into
law the most important reform bill in VA history, stated
Pearce.
Coming now on the heels of new revelations of
poor service, this looks like a public relations stunt. The fact that
this new phone line is available for only two weeks suggests that the
Department has no commitment to change.
The VA is applying a Band-Aid fix. A 14-day pilot program does
almost nothing.
On March 13 in Ruidoso, I
co-hosted a 90-minute town hall with New Mexicos newly appointed chief
administrator -- Andrew Welch. In talking with and providing guidance
to veterans about the new Choice Card Program, we have observed severe
problems within the VA bureaucracy, the appointment process, and its
computer system. It is totally unacceptable that the Department is
resisting veterans and medical providers who are trying to access the
Choice program.
Pearce continued: All
Americans -- and especially veterans -- deserve effective, efficient, and
accountable government. The VA is languishing in a 100-year old model
and needs to be entirely redesigned. I and my staff will continue to
work with the House Committee on Veterans Affairs and the VA to ensure
that the Choice Program helps our veterans in the way that the
American people intended.
