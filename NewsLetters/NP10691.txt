Equal Pay for Equal Work
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great weekend. I spent last week successfully
fighting to protect Medicare against cuts that would have hurt our
seniors, advocating for a woman's right to equal pay, and supporting
the needs of New Hampshire's agricultural community. In these difficult
economic times, we must ensure that our seniors have access to the
affordable Medicare services they need to stay healthy. Furthermore,
smaller paychecks for women make it harder for families to afford
health care, send their kids to college, and save for retirement. I am
committed to continuing to work to eliminate the pay gap and establish
gender equality in the workplace.
At the White House event
Advocating for Equal Rights for Women
Last Tuesday, I visited the White House to celebrate Equal Pay Day and
hear President Obama give two executive orders that will help support
fair pay for women and narrow the wage gap between genders. During
Tuesday's Equal Pay Day celebration at the White House, the President
announced the new executive orders which I had encouraged him to
support in a letter I sent last year. The first order will prohibit
federal contractors from retaliating against employees who choose to
discuss their compensation, so employees have a potential avenue to
discover violations of equal pay and seek appropriate action. The
second order will instruct the Secretary of Labor to establish new
regulations requiring federal contractors to submit to the Department
of Labor data on compensation paid to their employees, including by sex
and race. This will allow more targeted enforcement of equal pay laws.
I was so pleased the President took my letter into consideration and
announced these executive orders, which will help prevent pay
discrimination against women. I am a proud cosponsor of the federal
Paycheck Fairness Act, which would increase the effectiveness of
remedies available to victims of pay discrimination on the basis of
gender. It is outrageous that even in the 21st Century, women in New
Hampshire and across the nation continue to make only 77 cents to the
dollars of their male counterparts. We must do more to eliminate the
wage gap between genders, and this is a great step forward in the right
direction. I urge my colleagues in the House to swiftly pass the
Paycheck Fairness Act, which would provide women with necessary avenues
to report and remedy instances of pay discrimination.
Fighting to Preserve Medicare
On Wednesday, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS)
announced that it will raise payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans,
which will help protect important health benefits for New Hampshire
seniors. Previously, CMS had estimated a reduction in payments to
Medicare Advantage plans due to a provision in the Affordable Care Act
(ACA). I recently wrote a letter
to Health and Human Services
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius urging the Administration to reconsider
this scheduled cut, which could have adversely affected 12,542 Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries in New Hampshire by causing increases in their
premiums and copays, and affecting their plan and benefit options. The
recent announcement takes into consideration my advice, and no cuts
will take place for 2015.
I'm extremely relieved that CMS took my advice and reversed its
previous scheduled plan to reduce payments to Medicare Advantage. I
have long said the Affordable Care Act was far from perfect, and I was
deeply concerned that these specific reductions proposed by the ACA
were not cost-effective and could have negatively impacted many Granite
Staters who depend on these plans.
I'm thrilled that the
Administration has done the responsible thing and will continue to
support the Medicare Advantage plans that provide high quality,
affordable health care to many of our seniors.
With Danielle at the reception
New Hampshire's Cherry Blossom Princess: Danielle Duchesne
On Wednesday evening, I had the pleasure of escorting Nashua native
Danielle Duchesne to this year's Congressional Cherry Blossom
Reception. Danielle is representing New Hampshire in the 2014 Cherry
Blossom Princess Festival, and is being sponsored by the New Hampshire
State Society. Wednesday's reception was part of the annual Cherry
Blossom Princess program, a weeklong series for young women who have
been elected to serve as their state's representative, or "princess."
During the week, Cherry Blossom princesses participate in a variety of
leadership, educational, and service activities, and they are
introduced to leaders and female role models in government, cultural,
military, and business organizations who work in the Washington, D.C.
area.
Danielle's extensive leadership activities and commitment to New
Hampshire make her an excellent role model for young women back at
home. I was thrilled to escort her to this year's Cherry Blossom
Congressional Reception, and I know I speak on behalf of all Granite
Staters in saying we are proud to have her as our representative in
this year's Cherry Blossom Festival. I wish her the best of luck moving
forward!
Protecting NH Farmers
On Wednesday, I joined U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte
and Representative Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01) in sending a letter to
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack raising
serious concerns with a proposal to close Farm Service Agency (FSA)
offices in New Hampshire. FSA offices provide New Hampshire farmers and
ranchers with a range of supportive services, including loans,
financial planning, and disaster assistance.
President Obama's Fiscal Year 2015 budget plan proposed consolidating
or closing over 200 FSA offices across the nation in an effort to
modernize the program and reduce spending.
However, the New Hampshire
FSA has already consolidated or co-located many of its offices in an
effort to improve efficiency. Additional closures are unnecessary and
could prove to be devastating for New Hampshire farmers who rely on
these services to succeed.
Hearing From Alzheimer's Activists
On Wednesday, I met with representatives from the New Hampshire chapter
of the Alzheimer's Association to discuss their efforts to combat the
disease. Five million Americans have Alzheimer's disease today. In ten
years, that number is expected to grow to fifteen million. In New
Hampshire, twenty thousand people have Alzheimer's, which touches the
lives of families all across our state. Most people have someone in
their lives -- a spouse, a parent, a friend -- who is experiencing
memory loss or who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
Helping Granite Staters
Recently, my office was contacted by a consituent concerning her health
insurance coverage. Susan Glasheen had been trying for months to get a
coverage confirmation and her identification card for her new health
plan from Anthem. At the beginning of April, my staff was able to work
with Ms. Glasheen and Anthem to retrieve the necessary information and
materials. If my office may ever be of assistance with a problem you
are facing, please contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we may help you
resolve your problem or get you the information you need.
Have a wonderful week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Last

With
Danielle
at
the
recep ti on New

Cherry
Blossom
Princess:
Danielle
Duch es ne
On
Wednesday
evening,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
escorting
Nashua
native
Danielle
Duchesne
to
this
year&#8217;s
Congressional
Cherry
Blossom
Reception.
Danielle
is
representing
New
Hampshire
in
the
2014
Cherry
Blossom
Princess
Festival,
and
is
being
sponsored
by
the
New
Hampshire
State
Society. Wednesday&#8217;s
reception
was
part
of
the
annual
Cherry
Blossom
Princess
program,
a
weeklong
series
for
young
women
who
have
been
elected
to
serve
as
their
state&#8217;s
representative,
or
&#8220;princess.&#8221;
During
the
week,
Cherry
Blossom
princesses
participate
in
a
variety
of
leadership,
educational,
and
service
activities,
and
they
are
introduced
to
leaders
and
female
role
models
in
government,
cultural,
military,
and
business
organizations
who
work
in
the
Washington,
D.C.
area.
Danielle&#8217;s
extensive
leadership
activities
and
commitment
to
New
Hampshire
make
her
an
excellent
role
model
for
young
women
back
at
home.
I
was
thrilled
to
escort
her
to
this
year&#8217;s
Cherry
Blossom
Congressional
Reception,
and
I
know
I
speak
on
behalf
of
all
Granite
Staters
in
saying
we
are
proud
to
have
her
as
our
representative
in
this
year&#8217;s
Cherry
Blossom
Festival.
I
wish
her
the
best
of
luck
moving
forward!
Protecting
NH
Farmers
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
U.S.
Senators
Jeanne
Shaheen
and
Kelly

(NH-01)
in
sending

Tom
Vilsack
raising
serious

with
a

offices
provide
New

farmers
and
ranchers
with
a
range
of
supportive
services,
including
loans,
financial

President

budget
plan
proposed
consolidating
or
closing
over
200
FSA
offices
across
the
nation
in
an
effort
to
modernize
the
program
and
reduce

However,
the
New

FSA
has
already
consolidated
or
co-located
many
of
its
offices
in
an
effort
to
improve
efficiency. Additional

could
prove

On

I
met
with
representatives
from
the
New
Hampshire
chapter
of
the
Alzheimer&#8217;s
Association
to
discuss
their
efforts
to
combat
the
disease. Five
million
Americans
have
Alzheimer's
disease
today.
In
ten
years,
that
number
is
expected
to
grow
to
fifteen
million.
In
New
Hampshire,
twenty
thousand
people
have
Alzheimer's,
which
touches
the
lives
of
families
all
across
our
state.
Most
people
have
someone
in
their
lives
--
a
spouse,
a
parent,
a
friend
--
who
is
experiencing
memory
loss
or
who
has
been
diagnosed
with
Alzheimer's
disease.
