Situation in
Ukraine
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is an issue of
international concern. Unfortunately, the Obama administration
continues to demonstrate a lack of leadership in refusing to address
aggressors around the world. In my role on the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
I will continue to monitor this situation alongside my colleagues and
encourage our nation to stand against Vladimir Putin's dangerous
power grab and clear disregard for international laws.
Stop Government Abuse
Week
When talking with people in Western North Carolina, their
overwhelming lack of trust in government is clear. This past week, the House
voted on numerous bills to cut red tape, rein in government overreach
and prevent waste while restoring transparency and accountability to
the American people.
One of the bills passed this week puts
a stop to IRS targeting based on political beliefs. The American
people should never have to fear retribution by the IRS simply due to
exercising their First Amendment rights. Another bill reins in
regulatory loopholes in Washington and stops the burden of unfunded federal
mandates from falling on state and local governments. Yet another bill
reforms the regulatory process to lessen the burden on American
families and small businesses.

On Wednesday, I joined GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris
Rodgers (WA-5) and Representative Tim Walberg (MI-7) on a conference call
to discuss our efforts during Stop Government Abuse Week.

FOIA Amendment Passes House
The House passed
the
FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act
this week,
including a bipartisan amendment I co-sponsored with Congresswoman Tammy
Duckworth to expedite FOIA requests. Too often, FOIA deadlines go unmet by
agencies with no explanation. This amendment demands accountability
in the FOIA process.

Committee when we introduced this amendment.
Electrify Africa Act
Passes Committee
On Thursday, the House
Foreign Affairs Committee passed the
Electrify Africa Act
to
improve access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa through a
comprehensive, market-based approach to electricity projects in the region at
no cost to the U.S. taxpayer.
My amendment to the bill,
which passed and was included in the final version, allows the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation to conduct annual surveys and
report back to Congress regarding the effectiveness of this
program.
In my meetings with African ambassadors, many have expressed
concern about the lack of American investment in the continent as
compared with that of other nations. If we are going to compete with
countries like China, we must unleash the private sector to allow for
investment in Africa.
