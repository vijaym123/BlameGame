newsletters, don't forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook
page for daily updates! As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply
want to express your opinion. I'm always happy to hear from you.

Committee Spotlight
The House Financial Services Committee
has been working hard to protect Arkansans from
government overreach and to protect small banks against the unregulated
CFPB. This week, the Committee held a mark-up of several bills, one of
which addressed the CFPB's misguided definition of "rural" for the
purpose of mortgage lending by banks. The Bureau's published definition
was, unsurprisingly, a one-size-fits-all policy that would not have
worked for many parts of Arkansas. The regulation would prevent
community banks from issuing mortgages such as balloon loans, or other
responsibly underwritten products.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee
has also had a busy few weeks. We've been monitoring
the ongoing situation in Ukraine very carefully, and last week we held
a hearing on the matter. This week, the House also passed a resolution
condemning the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and
territorial integrity by military forces of the Russian Federation.
Additionally, Secretary of State Kerry testified before the Committee
on Thursday about the State Department's annual budget request.

H.R. 311: The Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship (FUELS)
Act
This week, the House passed fellow Arkansas Congressman Rick Crawford's
bill to ease fuel tank regulations on Arkansas's farmers. Currently,
farmers are forced to obtain certification of compliance with the EPA's
oil spill regulations by a professional engineer-an unnecessary and
costly process. Under this bill, farms with small, aboveground oil
storage and no history of spills would be allowed to self-certify their
compliance.
H.R. 3473: Hire More Heroes Act
Under Obamacare, employers are penalized if they employ veterans who
receive healthcare through the VA or TRICARE and do not offer those
employees separate healthcare coverage. This legislation exempts
employers from this penalty, incentivizing them to hire more veterans.
The men and women who serve in our military learn important tangible
and intangible skills that make them model employees and an asset to
any business.
H.R. 3979: Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders
Obamacare's employer mandate could increase costs and ultimately close
the doors of volunteer fire departments across Arkansas by requiring
them to provide healthcare to their volunteers. This legislation
permanently exempts volunteer fire departments from this mandate-
providing them with the certainty they need to continue protecting
local communities.
H.R. 4138: ENFORCE the Law Act of 2014
Laws are laws and the President of the United States cannot simply pick
and chose which of those laws he wants to enforce. The ENFORCE Act
allows Congress to bring a lawsuit against the executive branch if they
fail to faithfully execute the laws.
H.R. 4015: Sustainable Growth Rate Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment
Modernization Act of 2014
Because of an outdated mechanism used to control Medicare spending,
Doctors annually face a drastic cut in their reimbursements for
treating Medicare patients. Each year, Congress has passed a temporary
"fix" to these cuts but never dealt with the problem. This bill ensures
doctors will be paid for curing an illness, not just ordering tests.
Most importantly, it provides a 10-year window of stability for doctors
and patients. To pay for repealing this outdated policy, we will
legally delay the individual mandate for Obamacare.
Rep. Tom Cotton speaks at a Service Academy Forum Night in Hot Springs
Fighting Back Against Obamacare
Arkansans remain overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare-and they should.
Under this law they are seeing their healthcare premiums rise and their
hours cut. In this new newsletter section, I will keep you apprised of
my fight against this unworkable law.
Medicare Advantage provides high quality, affordable healthcare to
nearly 20 percent of Arkansas seniors. But if President Obama and his
liberal allies have their way, our seniors will see just the opposite:
higher costs and reduced benefits. The President's namesake
legislation, Obamacare, cut more than $200 billion from Medicare
Advantage payments. These cuts combined with other changes to the
program, resulted in payment cuts of 6 percent in 2014. And the vast
majority of Obamacare's cuts haven't even gone into effect, meaning
things are only going to get worse! Now, the Obama Administration is
proposing additional cuts to Medicare Advantage that would raise
Arkansas seniors monthly healthcare payments by up to $45 and further
reduce access to care.
This week, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter
to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, urging CMS to keep 2015 Medicare
Advantage payments rates at 2014 levels. Rest assured, I will fight to
save the Medicare Advantage program for Arkansas's seniors.

Rep. Tom Cotton with visitors from around Arkansas
Recently, I had a great meeting with members of the Arkansas School
Nutrition Association to discuss the Child Nutrition Reauthorization
2015.
I also enjoyed meeting with members of the Arkansas Humanities Council
to discuss all of their important work in the state. Thanks to Stan
Poole of Arkadelphia, Allyn Lord of Springdale, Clark Trim of Little
Rock, and Mark Christ of Little Rock, for stopping by the office.
I had a productive meeting with Ted Glaub, the Arkansas Director of the
National Soybean Association and AJ Hood, Vice President of Arkansas
Soybean Association about renewable fuel standards, international
trade, EPA conservation, and other issues important to the soybean
producers in Arkansas.
It was great to meet with Shatoria and Margaret with the Arkansas
Apartment Association. We discussed the state of the rental market,
housing finance reform, and tax reform. Thanks again for stopping by!
I also discussed homeland security and emergency management issues with
David and Tina from the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management.
Great to see you!
I also had the opportunity to meet Sarah-a talented athlete-as well as
Donna and Terri with Special Olympics of Arkansas. I was grateful that
Tim Shriver, Chairman of the Board for Special Olympics could join us
as well. Congratulations to Sarah for her many accomplishments and
thank you to Donna and Terri for all your hard work. We look forward to
seeing what you do next!
It was great to meet Teri and Julie with the Arkansas chapter of the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society. We discussed their fight in
finding a cure for MS, as well as MS research. Thank you for your
dedication to this vital cause and taking the time to meet with me.
It was great to see Arkansans Rick and Jim with Arkansas and Missouri
Railroad in DC. I enjoyed discussing Arkansas short lines and learning
more about the jobs that they provide. Thank you for taking the time to
stop by and discuss your concerns.
Lastly, I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with Cheri Arnold from
the Paralyzed Veterans of America (and her service dog Mollie!) to
discuss veteran and disability issues.

Spotlight: the LOCAL Act
Recently, I introduced the LOCAL Act
, a
bill allowing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to restore joint
management programs with local non-profit organizations to construct,
operate, and maintain recreational facilities at lakes and reservoirs
across the country. Despite years of successful operation, the Corps
recently determined they lacked the authority to continue these joint
management programs and are in the process of suspending all local
partnerships. Arkansans know better than anyone how to manage our lands
and cuts to the Corps' budget shouldn't dictate our ability to enjoy
these facilities. For years, these partnerships have allowed local
groups like the Friends of Lake Ouachita to successfully maintain
recreational facilities across our state. And they assured that access
fees collected upon entry went directly to support the local facility.
Arkansas is known as the Natural State-one of our greatest points of
pride is access to public lands and water. The LOCAL Act will ensure
that facilities like Lake Ouachita and Beaver Lake will remain easily
accessible for future generations. To read more about this legislation,

Rep. Tom Cotton tours DaVita Dialysis Facility in Hot Springs
Around Arkansas
Last month, my staff held a series of Service Academy Forum Nights
around the district to provide information and answer questions about
the service academy nomination process. I stopped by the Hot Springs
Service Academy night to meet some of the prospective students and talk
about my time in the Army. Click here
to download the 2014 Nomination Application for the United
States Service Academies.
I also recently visited the DaVita Dialysis Center in Hot Springs,
Arkansas. I spent the afternoon touring the facility and learning more
about kidney disease. Unfortunately, Obamacare's cuts to Medicare are
putting the lives of Arkansas's dialysis patients at risk. For these
patients, dialysis has meant the opportunity to see their children get
married or being there for the birth of their first grandchild. But
because of Obamacare, many physicians may choose to retire, sell their
practice, or transfer to a concierge-style practice where they only
take cash payments for rates that they themselves negotiate with
patients. Quite simply this will mean less doctors and more waiting for
Medicare patients, including those on dialysis. I am committed to
protecting dialysis treatments by repealing Obamacare and preserving
Medicare for both current recipients and future generations. It was a
productive, informative afternoon and I appreciated the opportunity to
visit the facility.

Fighting
Back
Against

Arkansans
remain
overwhelmingly

to
Obamacare&mdash;and
they
should.
Under
this
law
they
are
seeing
their
healthcare
premiums
rise
and

In

keep

of
my
fight
against
this
unworkable
law.
Medicare
Advantage
provides
high
quality,
affordable
healthcare
to
nearly
20
percent
of
Arkansas
seniors.
But
if
President
Obama
and
his
liberal
allies
have
their
way,
our
seniors
will
see
just
the
opposite:
higher
costs
and
reduced
benefits.
The
President&#8217;s
namesake
legislation,
Obamacare,
cut
more
than
$200
billion
from
Medicare
Advantage
payments.
These
cuts
combined
with
other
changes
to
the
program,
resulted
in
payment
cuts
of
6
percent
in
2014.
And
the
vast
majority
of
Obamacare&#8217;s
cuts
haven&#8217;t
even
gone
into
effect,
meaning
things
are
only
going
to
get
worse!
Now,
the
Obama
Administration
is
proposing
additional
cuts
to
Medicare
Advantage
that
would
raise
Arkansas
seniors
monthly
healthcare
payments
by
up
to
$45
and
further
reduce
access
to
care.
This
week,
I
joined
my
colleagues
in&#160; sending
a
letter
to
the
Centers
for
Medicare

Services
(CMS)
Administrator
Marilyn
Tavenner,
urging
CMS
to
keep
2015
Medicare
Advantage
payments
rates
at
2014
levels.
Rest
assured,
I
will
fight
to
save
the
Medicare
Advantage
program
for
Arkansas&#8217;s
seniors.

have
allowed

staff
held
a
series
of
Service
Academy
Forum
Nights
around
the
district
to
provide
information
and
answer
questions
about
the
service
academy
nomination
process.
I
stopped
by
the
Hot
Springs
Service
Academy
night
to
meet
some
of
the
prospective
students
and
talk
about
my
time
in
the
Army.&#160; Click

I
also
recently
visited
the
DaVita
Dialysis
Center
in
Hot
Springs,
Arkansas.
I
spent
the
afternoon
touring
the
facility
and
learning
more
about
kidney
disease.
Unfortunately,
Obamacare&#8217;s
cuts
to
Medicare
are
putting
the
lives
of
Arkansas&#8217;s
dialysis
patients
at
risk.
For
these
patients,
dialysis
has
meant
the
opportunity
to
see
their
children
get
married
or
being
there
for
the
birth
of
their
first
grandchild.
But
because
of
Obamacare,
many
physicians
may
choose
to
retire,
sell
their
practice,
or
transfer
to
a
concierge-style
practice
where
they
only
take
cash
payments
for
rates
that
they
themselves
negotiate
with
patients.
Quite
simply
this
will
mean
less
doctors
and
more
waiting
for
Medicare
patients,
including
those
on
dialysis.
I
am
committed
to
protecting
dialysis
treatments
by
repealing
Obamacare
and
preserving
Medicare
for
both
current
recipients
and
future
generations.
It
was
a
productive,
informative
afternoon
and
I
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
facility.
