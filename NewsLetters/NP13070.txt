Addressing
the Vulnerabilities in the President's
Healthcare Law
Dear Friend,
It seems as though every day we are
presented with a new glitch or problem
associated with the Presidents
health care law that harms the American
people. Whether it be the excessive waste
in the implementation of the law, canceled
policies, far higher premiums and
deductibles, fewer work hours and jobs, or
the cybersecurity risks within
Healthcare.gov, it could not be clearer
that the Presidents healthcare law
and its execution have been flawed,
misguided, and mismanaged.
Over the last several months, the House
has held four separate hearings on the
issue of data security, and through this
Congressional oversight, we have discovered
many unsettling vulnerabilities to personal
information within the Presidents
online healthcare exchanges. Cybersecurity
poses a significant and growing threat to
individual privacy, yet the Obama
Administration has been so focused on
getting the health insurance website to
function at a basic level that it has not
taken sufficient action to ensure that
users personal and medical
information will be protected, which is
unacceptable.
To address this glaring issue, last
week, the House of Representatives passed
the Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act, which requires the
Department of Health and Human Services to
notify Americans of a breach of security by
a federal or state health exchange within
two business days. I was pleased to see
this important legislation pass the House
with bipartisan support, as it brings
much-needed security measures to
Healthcare.gov and protects
Americans most private
information.
Yet another problem came to light last
week, as reports indicated that while some
Americans have paid for coverage to begin
on January 1, they have not received proof
of their insurance and are having to pay
significant out-of-pocket costs for
healthcare coverage as a result. This
unfortunate consequence is only the latest
in the series of problems with the law and
is another example of the design and
execution of this program hurting people,
not helping.
These unsettling realities are posing
significant risks to the American people
and I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues to ensure that all
Americans are protected from the harmful
impacts of the Presidents health
care law.
