A MESSAGE
FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
On Monday,
April 27 th , I will be hosting the 34 th
Annual
Military Service Academy Forum at the Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro,
Maryland. The forum is an opportunity for Fifth District students and
their parents to learn about applying for admission at the five United
States Service Academies. Four of the academies-- the Air Force
Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point, and the Naval Academy all require a nomination from an authorized
nominating source. Click

for
additional details about the academy nomination process.
This
event is open to the public and I encourage all interested high school
age students in the Fifth Congressional District to attend. Students
will be able to speak directly with college ROTC coordinators,
admissions personnel, military recruiters, and members of the Fifth
Congressional District Academy Selection Board. For more information, contact
the Waldorf District Office at 301-843-1577 or email:
