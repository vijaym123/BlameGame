Hi
friend,
Im
very excited to officially unveil my new Senate website:
http://menendez.senate.gov
With a brand
new look and features, you can more easily get connected with my office
for help or stay connected with my work in
Washington.
Youll find:
A
help
center
with new
online forms. Here, you can request help with a federal agency, request
a flag, apply for an internship with my office, and
more.
A
live video stream
that will bring you directly to the Senate Floor.
Alerts on the site will let you know when Im at an important hearing
in Washington, or visiting a location in New
Jersey.
An
entire
bilingual site .
Beautiful
New Jersey scenes
that change in
the background.
Please take a moment and
check
out the new site . And, if you like what you see, please share the site with
friends and family.
