Dear Friend,
Nothing kills jobs faster than a Washington regulation. Since my election to Congress last June, I have fought unnecessary and intrusive Washington regulations that are out of step with our rural way of life in Missouri&#39;s Eighth Congressional District. Washington wants to regulate everything from how we generate the power we need to run our homes and businesses, to how we are able to use our own land. Just recently, bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to change air standards that would have a disastrous impact on manufacturing, farming, mining and construction jobs across the country.
The EPA plans to tighten National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground&#45;level ozone from the current 75 parts per billion to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. Lowering the air standards has the potential to detrimentally impact manufacturing, natural resources and mining, farming, and construction jobs.
In Missouri more than 150,000 jobs have the potential to be affected. Ground&#45;level ozone can be created from manmade sources such as car fuel and industrial plants, but also biological sources including plants. Additionally, ozone levels naturally increase with warmer temperatures. We all cherish diverse natural resources in the Eighth District and want them to be around for future generations. However, the proposed standards set by the EPA are unachievable and unnecessary restrictions.
As with all government regulation, this proposed EPA plan comes at a high cost that will eventually reach taxpayers. When the EPA proposed making similar changes to ground-level ozone standards in 2011, it was estimated that the costs to comply would top $90 billion nationwide. In Missouri alone, the cost of implementing new standards could reach $1.9 billion. This negative impact on jobs and increased burden on taxpayers would be devastating. According to recent studies, all 30 counties in our Eighth Congressional District are likely to be out of compliance with a 60 parts per billion restriction. Let me tell you, I would much rather breathe the air in Missouri than air from New York or Los Angeles.
This week, I sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy urging her not to change current standards for ground-level ozone. Too often the EPA makes unfounded and unfair decisions that threaten our rural way of life. The EPA&#39;s plan to tighten air quality standards in rural Missouri is a prime example of Washington being out of touch with reality. I will continue monitoring the EPA and their actions to ensure Missouri jobs and Missouri workers do not become victims of Washington&#39;s war on rural America.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
On Friday night, The Arts Council of Southeast Missouri hosted a reception for the Eighth Congressional District High School Art Competition in Cape Girardeau. Congratulations to Elizabeth Green from Cape Central High School who was named the Best in Show Winner! Elizabeth&#39;s artwork will be displayed on Capitol Hill for the next year. A huge thank you to all the talented artists and art teachers for helping make the contest such a success!
I had a great day at Brewer Science near Rolla on Monday. Dr. Terry Brewer and his team officially opened a new 25,000 square foot expansion that will create 65 new jobs over the next 5 years. Thank you to Dr. Brewer and his team for inviting me to be part of the ceremony!
I was honored to meet Chris Radford on Monday at Bourbon High School. I nominated Chris to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, NY and his nomination was accepted. Chris will represent the Eighth District of Missouri well at West Point!
Tuesday I met with representative from the 12 Missouri Electric Cooperatives in our Eighth Congressional District. They serve over 400,000 folks in MO&#45;08. I also signed the NRECA comment card opposing the EPA's rules on new coal&#45;fired power plants that would raise electricity rates on all Missourians.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
