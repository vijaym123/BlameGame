Dear Friend,
Recently, I've visited schools and senior centers, discussing
manufacturing and the need to protect and preserve Social Security.
Here are a few highlights. As always, let me know your thoughts on
these or any other issues by email
or at 860-223-8412.
Protecting Social Security
Yesterday, President Obama announced he would drop proposed changes to
Social Security from his upcoming budget proposal. Seniors across
central and northwest Connecticut have earned these benefits through
lifetimes of hard work. It's time we reflect the reality of the rising
cost of living for seniors. That's why I asked President Obama to
reconsider last year and why I joined my colleagues earlier this week
to send him a letter urging him to rule out offering chained CPI in his
budget. I'm glad he made the right decision this year. Click here to
read my statement on this decision.
Visit to Oliver Wolcott Technical High School in Torrington
Check out this Torrington Register-Citizen
article on my visit with students
at Oliver Wolcott Technical High School in Torrington. Our state has
over 5,000 manufacturers-it's the backbone of our economy. I'm excited
to be working together with manufacturers
, small businesses, community colleges, and middle and high
schools to better prepare students for the jobs of the 21st century.
Launch of Constituent Corner
Website
When I talk with constituents after they've worked with my office, many
of them ask me to share their stories so that others will know how to
get help as well. I'm here to serve you by helping to solve problems,
cutting through red tape, and putting the service back in public
service.
"Constituent Corner
"
highlights positive stories, like these:
*
Gail and Lew Sirico from Danbury reached out to me after
falling behind on their mortgage when Lew got sick and lost his job. My
office helped modify their monthly mortgage payments, which saved them
$5,100 and allowed them to stay in their home during this cold winter.
*
Suzie Clayton from Canaan saved close to $1,500 per month on
health insurance costs after my office helped her enroll in a new
health plan through Access Health CT, our state's health insurance
marketplace. Because Suzie is a breast cancer survivor, insurance
companies charged her extremely high premiums. Now, under the
Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot charge her more just
because she had breast cancer.
If you or your loved ones need help, please contact my New Britain
office at 860-223-8412
In Case You Missed it.

Valentine's Day, but... #WhatWomenNeed are well-paid jobs and
affordable child care!
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out by email
or at 860-223-8412. I look forward to hearing
from you.

Dear
Friend,
Recently,
I&#8217;ve
visited
schools
and
senior
centers,
discussing
manufacturing
and
the
need
to
protect
and
preserve
Social
Security.
Here
are

Protecting
Social
Security
Yesterday,
President
Obama
announced
he
would
drop
proposed
changes
to
Social
Security
from
his
upcoming
budget
proposal.
Seniors
across
central
and
northwest
Connecticut
have
earned
these
benefits
through
lifetimes
of
hard
work.
It&#8217;s
time
we
reflect
the
reality
of
the
rising
cost
of
living
for
seniors.
That&#8217;s
why
I asked
President
Obama
to
reconsider last
year
and
why
I
joined
my
colleagues
earlier
this
week
to
send
him
a
letter
urging
him
to
rule
out
offering
chained
CPI
in
his
budget.
I&#8217;m
glad
he
made
the
right
decision
this
year.

positive

like
these: Gail

Sirico
from
Danbury
reached
out
to
me
after
falling

their
mortgage

Lew
got

helped
modify

after
my
office
helped
her
enroll
in
a
new

our
state's

Because
Suzie
is
a
breast
cancer
survivor,
insurance
companies
charged
her
extremely
high
premiums.
Now,
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
insurance
companies
cannot
charge
her
more
just
because
she
had
breast
cancer.
