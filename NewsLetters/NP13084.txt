News from Representative John Delaney
January 17, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write to you today to share some exciting news. Democratic Senator
Michael Bennet of Colorado and Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri
have partnered to introduce a version of my infrastructure bill in the
upper chamber. The Senate companion bill to my Partnership to Build
America Act was officially filed on Thursday, January 16.
Coming shortly after the legislation received its fiftieth cosponsor in
the House of Representatives, the Senate introduction of the
Partnership to Build America Act continues our bipartisan momentum. As
in the House, where my bill has 25 Republican and 25 Democratic
cosponsors, the companion introduced on Thursday has support from
Senators on both sides of the aisle.
I strongly believe that up-to-date transportation and energy systems
are critical to our nation's success, which is why I introduced the
Partnership to Build America Act. Numbered H.R. 2084 in the House of
Representatives, this legislation would create a $50 billion American
Infrastructure Fund (AIF), leveraged to $750 billion. Instead of using
new appropriated funds, this capital would be raised by selling bonds
to the private sector.
Having spent two decades in the private sector as an entrepreneur and
CEO, I understand the importance of infrastructure to job growth and
economic competitiveness in the United States. Today, we count on our
infrastructure to connect millions of people with their jobs, families
and place of work. Here in the Sixth District, we struggle with some of
the longest commutes in the country. Despite its vital nature, our
energy, water and transit infrastructure does not receive sufficient
financing to provide for needed improvements and prevent declining
conditions.
Please take a moment to tell me what kind of infrastructure
improvements you would like to see in Maryland's 6th District by
answering my survey.
The Partnership to Build America Act has been welcomed as a solution to
some of our nation's most critical infrastructure problems. The
Frederick News-Post has also offered its endorsement, stating, "U.S.
Rep. John Delaney deserves major credit for two things: for proposing
financial legislation that has bipartisan support, and for crafting a
bill that would help pay for a fast-deteriorating national
transportation infrastructure without increasing the nation's debt or
raising taxes."
Creating jobs and helping Maryland's economy are among my top
priorities here in Congress, and my infrastructure bill takes a big
step towards achieving these goals. You have made it clear that you are
tired of the partisan gridlock and believe we must do more to improve
our economy, and that spirit has motivated this legislation.
As the 113th Congress moves forward, I will continue to support smart,
bipartisan efforts to put our economy back on track. I welcome your
feedback on how we can achieve this goal.
Sincerely,
John

Dear
Friend,
I
write
to
you
today
to
share
some
exciting

Democratic
Senator
Michael

and
Republican
Senator
Roy
Blunt
of
Missouri
have
partnered
to
introduce
a
version
of
my
infrastructure

upper

The
Senate
companion

filed
on
Thursday,
January
16.
