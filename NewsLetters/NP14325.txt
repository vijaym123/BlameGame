Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
I had the privilege of hosting a Purple Heart transfer ceremony at
Stillwell High School on Veterans Day. Pictured here is Vietnam Veteran
Matthew Carlson who found the lost Purple Heart and worked to return it
to its rightful place.
Veterans Day
On Veterans Day I hosted a Purple Heart transfer ceremony at Stilwell
High School. This Purple Heart was awarded to the family of Clarence
Marcus Merriott, a Stilwell High School graduate, who entered the U.S.
Army in 1943 and was sent to the war in Europe.
PFC Clarence Merriott was a member of the 300thCombat Engineers
Headquarters and Service, which was the administration, supply,
operations, intelligence and reconnaissance arm of the battalion which
served in Europe from June 1944 to May 1945. Another member of the
300th Engineers is my grandfather Kenneth "Cowboy" Morris who served in
Europe during World War II.
Merriott and other members of the 300thEngineers, were aboard Landing
Ship Tank (LST) 523 on June 19, 1944 when it struck a mine in the
English Channel less than five miles off the coast of France where they
were preparing to land on Utah Beach. Merriott and many other soldiers
perished that day. The Purple Heart medal was sent to Merriott's family
in Stilwell, but somehow over the years, the medal got lost.
Earlier this year, Vietnam Veteran Matthew Carlson was at a swap meet
and flea market in Glendale, Arizona when he found a Purple Heart medal
for sale by a vendor. Carlson purchased the medal for $20 and with the
help of his son, found the website of the 300thCombat Engineers. The
site is maintained by Brad Peters and Jan Ross of Erving,
Massachusetts. Carlson contacted Peters and Ross and mailed the medal
to them so they could ensure it ended up in the right place.
My grandfather traveled in early October to the 300thCombat Engineers'
annual reunion. At the transfer ceremony, the Purple Heart was
entrusted to my grandfather, on behalf of the Engineers, to be given to
the Adair County Historical and Genealogical Association. The Merriott
family members have also expressed their desire to see the medal
donated and displayed in the museum.
The Purple Heart medal will now be displayed in the Adair County
Historical Association's museum in Stilwell. Merriott's name is also
inscribed on the Adair County War Memorial that is near the county
courthouse in Stilwell.
Students at Stillwell High School worked hard to make the Purple Heart
transfer ceremony memorable.
WRRDA Conferee
This week I was selected to be a conferee for the upcoming Conference
Committee on water infrastructure reform. H.R. 3080, the Water
Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA), was approved with
overwhelming bipartisan support in the House by a vote of 417-3. The
Senate has its own version of water infrastructure reform, which has
resulted in the two chambers coming together for a Conference
Committee.
The path WRRDA has taken thus far is a testament to true
bipartisanship. When members sit down and work together, we can arrive
at reasonable and rationale solutions. Being selected to serve on the
Conference Committee comes with great responsibility and I look forward
to representing the state of Oklahoma as we move forward in reforming
our nation's water infrastructure system.
The Conference Committee is made up of 36 members-8 from the Senate and
28 from the House. Conferees are selected based off of their
experiences and areas of expertise to discuss, debate and determine the
final form of a piece of legislation.

Keep Your Health Plan Act
This week I voted for H.R. 3350, the "Keep Your Health Plan Act" that
passed the House with bipartisan support.
Promises have been broken and we face critical situations that need to
be made right. Countless Americans, and many within the Second District
of Oklahoma, are going to their mailboxes only to learn that the health
insurance plan they liked is being canceled.
Click the picture below to hear my comments on Obamacare and the
President's broken promises.
Currently, insurance plans in the individual market that were in effect
at the time the Affordable Care Act was signed into law are deemed a
"grandfathered plan" and cannot be terminated. But the Departments of
Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor determined that if these
plans incurred any change in "benefits, cost sharing, employer
contributions, and access to coverage" the plans would then lose
grandfathered status. H.R. 3350 would allow insurance providers to
continue offering these types of individual insurance plans that were
in effect as of January 1, 2013, regardless of any change, and
effectively deem them all grandfathered plans through 2014. Individuals
can continue enrolling in these plans without being penalized with the
individual mandate tax.
This Administration failed to keep its promise that if Americans liked
their plans they could keep them. Obamacare has been a failure since
the beginning and today in the House we worked towards cleaning up the
damage of this health care mandate.
H.R. 3350 must now be approved by the Senate.

I
had
the

Veterans
Day On
Veterans

I
hosted a

at

This
Purple

was
awarded
to
the
family
of
Clarence

a
Stilwell

School
graduate,
who
entered
the

in

was

PFC
Clarence

was
a
member
of
the

Service,
which
was
the
administration,

and

arm
of
the
battalion
which
served
in
Europe
from
June
1944
to
May
1945.
Another
member
of
the
300 th
Engineers
is
my
grandfather
Kenneth
&#8220;Cowboy&#8221;
Morris
who served
in
Europe
during
World
War
II.
Merriott
and
other
members
of
the
300 th Engineers,
were
aboard
Landing
Ship
Tank
(LST)
523
on
June
19,
1944
when
it
struck
a
mine
in
the
English
Channel
less
than
five
miles
off
the
coast
of
France
where
they
were
preparing
to
land
on
Utah
Beach.
Merriott
and
many
other
soldiers
perished
that
day.
The
Purple
Heart
medal
was
sent
to
Merriott&#8217;s
family
in
Stilwell,
but
somehow
over
the
years,
the
medal
got
lost.
Earlier
this
year,
Vietnam
Veteran
Matthew
Carlson
was
at
a
swap
meet
and
flea
market
in
Glendale,
Arizona
when
he
found
a
Purple

medal
for
sale
by
a

Carlson
purchased
the
medal
for
$20
and
with
the
help
of
his
son,
found
the
website
of
the
300 th Combat
Engineers.
The
site
is
maintained
by
Brad
Peters
and
Jan
Ross
of
Erving,
Massachusetts.
Carlson
contacted
Peters
and
Ross
and
mailed
the
medal
to
them
so
they
could
ensure
it
ended
up
in
the
right
place.
My
grandfather traveled
in
early
October
to
the
300 th Combat
Engineers&#8217;
annual
reunion.
At
the
transfer
ceremony,
the
Purple
Heart
was
entrusted
to
my
grandfather,
on
behalf
of
the
Engineers,
to
be
given
to
the
Adair
County
Historical
and
Genealogical
Association.
The
Merriott
family
members
have
also
expressed
their
desire
to
see
the
medal
donated
and
displayed
in
the
museum.
The
Purple
Heart
medal
will
now
be
displayed
in
the
Adair
County
Historical
Association&#8217;s
museum
in
Stilwell.
Merriott&#8217;s
name
is
also
inscribed
on
the
Adair
County
War
Memorial
that
is
near
the
county
courthouse
in
Stilwell.
Students
at
Stillwell
High
School
worked
hard
to
make
the
Purple
Heart
transfer
ceremony
memorable.

Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act
This
week
I
voted
for
H.R.
3350,
the
&#8220;Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act&#8221;
that
passed
the
House
with
bipartisan
support.
Promises
have
been
broken
and
we
face
critical
situations
that
need
to
be
made
right.
Countless
Americans,
and
many
within
the
Second
District
of
Oklahoma,
are
going
to
their
mailboxes
only
to
learn
that
the
health
insurance
plan
they
liked
is
being
canceled.
Click
the
picture
below
to
hear
my
comments
on
Obamacare
and
the
President's
broken
promises.
Currently,
insurance
plans
in
the
individual
market
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
the
Affordable
Care
Act
was
signed
into
law
are
deemed
a
&#8220;grandfathered
plan&#8221;
and
cannot
be
terminated.
But
the
Departments
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
Treasury
and
Labor
determined
that
if
these
plans
incurred
any
change
in
&#8220;benefits,
cost
sharing,
employer
contributions,
and
access
to
coverage&#8221;
the
plans
would
then
lose
grandfathered
status.
H.R.
3350 would
allow
insurance
providers
to
continue
offering these
types
of individual
insurance
plans
that
were
in
effect
as
of
January
1,
2013,
regardless
of
any
change,
and
effectively
deem
them
all
grandfathered
plans
through
2014.
Individuals
can
continue
enrolling
in
these
plans
without
being
penalized
with
the
individual
mandate
tax.
This
Administration
failed
to
keep
its
promise
that
if
Americans
liked
their
plans
they
could
keep
them.
Obamacare
has
been
a
failure
since
the
beginning
and
today
in
the
House
we
worked
towards
cleaning
up
the
damage
of
this
health
care
mandate.
H.R.
3350
must
now
be
approved
by
the
Senate.
