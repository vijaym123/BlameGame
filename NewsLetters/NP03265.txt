County Courthouse Tour

Douglas County Courthouse 1876 / Present
After its establishment in 1866, Douglas County court proceedings took place in a small frame building on Main Street also occupied by the Alexandria Post. The widow of William E. Hicks, an Alexandria developer, decided to donate a plot of land for courthouse construction in 1875, provided that the structure cost less than $3,500 and was complete before 1878. County commissioners accepted these conditions, finishing the courthouse in 1877 for $3,447. County auditors soon decided, however, that the low cost of material and labor during the industrial depression warranted the completion of a new, "handsome" courthouse in 1895. The towered brick courthouse, which still serves Douglas County, features oak woodwork and tiled floors.
