Friends,
Years ago, my wife Julie and I worked with many concerned citizens to keep an abortion clinic out of Northwest Georgia. The mission to protect innocent life, born and unborn, has been at the core of my public service. That's why I voted today for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), which bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the point at which an unborn child can feel pain.
My vote for this legislation is a vote to protect unborn lives, and the conscience of millions of people around the country who, like me, believe every unborn baby has the right to life. While we must continue fighting to save unborn babies in every stage of pregnancy, this bill represents a critical step forward.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
