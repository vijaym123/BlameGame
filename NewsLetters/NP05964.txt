There&rsquo;s no sugarcoating it.
This has been one of the toughest months of the campaign. Here&rsquo;s why:
-- first, Boehner launched a $4,8OO,OOO.OO ad blitz on Illinois T.V.
-- then, our opponent launched a brutally dishonest ad of his own
-- today, we&rsquo;re in danger of missing our goal It&rsquo;s honestly frightening: if we don&rsquo;t close the gap, Cheri&rsquo;s re-election could be lost for good.
David, there&rsquo;s no time left. We need 5OO donations by tomorrow's critical FEC deadline to get back on track. It may take a last minute miracle, but we think we can do it.
