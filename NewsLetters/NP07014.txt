Friend,
I&#39;m back in our district for the August work period - there&#39;s nothing better than getting out in the community and hearing from the people I&#39;m so grateful to represent.
One thing I&#39;m hearing a lot of is anger and frustration with the way things are (or more accurately, aren&#39;t) working in Washington.
I spoke with one couple in particular who made a generous offer - they&#39;ve agreed to match donations up to $5,200 total from now until August 15th.
Click here and give now to double your impact-- your $5 turns into $10, or your $25 turns into $50.
As I spoke with this couple, they expressed their deep disappointment in the Speaker and his seeming lack of interest in addressing America&#39;s challenges. Instead of trying to pass a jobs bill, he has chosen to sue the President, ignore climate change, and continue to erode a woman&#39;s right to choose.
They&#39;ve supported me in the past, but in the face of the Speaker&#39;s inaction, and knowing how important this election is, they have decided to do their maximum contribution - and want to encourage others to do the same.
If you can donate $5 or $10, this couple will double your donation.
Click here to give $5 or $10 now - which will be DOUBLED if you give by midnight on August 15th.
We need to get the full match by this Friday, August 15, so if you can, please make a contribution today.
Remember, donations this week will be doubled.
I wouldn&#39;t be able to do what I do without your support.
Thank you.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - While John Boehner and his team are working to sue the President for political gain, I&#39;m working to serve the interests of my constituents and my community. By giving now, you&#39;ll help me continue to do so - plus, whatever you contribute will be matched dollar-for-dollar.
Pitch in $5 now.
