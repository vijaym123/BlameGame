Statement
regarding the Obama Administration's decision to release five Guantanamo
detainees
6/3/14
Congressman Lamborn
released the following statement regarding the Obama Administration's
decision to release five Guantanamo detainees in exchange for Army Sgt.
Bowe Bergdhal:
"While it is certainly
meaningful for a person thought lost to be reunited with his loved ones,
there are many troubling aspects of the repatriation of Army Sgt. Bowe
Bergdahl. Foremost among these issues is the fact that the Obama
Administration disregarded the law of the land and decades of precedent to
orchestrate an illegal and secret terrorist swap that effectively set
free five of the most dangerous enemies of America. Emptying and
closing Guantanamo will not end our war with the terrorists, it will only
encourage them to focus on another reason to spread their hatred of
America. I will use my senior position on the Armed Services Committee to
ensure that all of our questions are answered and that the
Administration is held accountable for violating the law."
