Dear Friends,
After three years of
struggle, this week Congress
finally passed the Farm Bill
and today President Obama
signed it into law. While it
took us far too long to
provide some
certaintyfor our
nations farmers and
those who rely on critical
safety net programs, like our
food assistance program the
Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), I
believe this agreement is
another positive sign that
compromise is not dead in
Washington. Though its
not perfect, the bill we
passed this week will save
the federal government $23
billion over the next decade
while providing an important
safety net for more than 16
million Americans and 30,000
Delawareans working in
agriculture.
In the First State, where
the chickens outnumber the
people by 300 to 1, a farm
bill that supports
agricultural research will be
critical for sustaining and
growing our economy.
Thats why I joined
with Senator John Boozman
from Arkansas to push for
provisions in the bill that
will prioritize research at
the Department of Agriculture
to improve the efficiency,
digestibility, and
nutritional value of a number
of feeds for the poultry and
animal agriculture
industries. At the same time,
I welcome the fact that this
legislation will help curb
our deficit by reforming
agriculture assistance
programs to reduce wasteful
spending.
Finally, I was thrilled to
work with Senator Ben Cardin
from Maryland, our own
Senator Chris Coons, and
other Mid-Atlantic senators
to ensure resources will
continue to be made available
to protect the Chesapeake
Bay. With one-third of our
state connected to the
Chesapeake Bay Watershed,
its critical that we
keep supporting efforts to
protect and restore the
Chesapeake Bay so our
children and grandchildren
can enjoy this important
resource.
Whether youre a
local farmer, a
conservationist, or a
Delawarean who enjoys fresh,
local produce and poultry, I
am curious to hear how you
feel on this important issue.
