reports, &ldquo;Democrats have invested millions more than Republicans in building a strong turnout operation.&rdquo;
Polls show Democrats leading in FIVE Southern states:
Kentucky (+2), North Carolina (+4), Louisiana (+3), Arkansas (+2), Georgia (+3).
If we win the South, we wouldn&rsquo;t just RUIN McConnell&rsquo;s takeover chances -- we&rsquo;d TRANSFORM the political landscape.
But as NPR reports, the Senate battle &ldquo;remains close and could tip either way.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching our massive, FINAL Get Out The Vote Campaign.
If we can fully fund it, we WILL get enough voters to the polls to WIN. But the election is in JUST 29 DAYS -- we need to raise $150,000 before MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
Will you pitch in before midnight to fund our final Get Out The Vote Campaign to win the Senate and the South? Gifts will be MATCHED until midnight.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Let&rsquo;s get out there and WIN!
