Improving health care for Montanans
Dear David,
I have some good news.
Just this week, Congress put aside its partisan differences and passed a bill that will help keep Montana families and communities healthy.
It was no small feat. In fact, it's the biggest bipartisan achievement this year.
The bill prevents a
scheduled 21-percent cut in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients. If Congress had failed to act, doctors would be forced to stop seeing seniors and older Montanans' access to health care would be significantly reduced.
The bill also supports health insurance for 30,000 Montana children from running out by extending funding for Healthy Montana Kids.
And the bill includes many other services critical to health care throughout Montana.
Without some of these provisions, rural ambulance providers could not afford to even start their engines and home health care providers would have a harder time serving rural areas.
While folks shouldn't wait to go to the doctor until they need the emergency room, we need to make sure patients can get to the doctor when they need it the most.
Hailing from Big Sandy, I know how hard it can be to get to the doctor. The drives are long and so a lot of folks simply choose not to go at all.
Fortunately though, Community Health Centers cut out some of the distance and provide great care to Montana patients.
Right now in Montana, Community Health Centers serve around 100,000 patients, offering quality, affordable primary care.
This bill we just passed includes two years' worth of funding so these clinics can keep the lights on and doctors can continue to provide check-ups and basic health screenings.
This bill is a big win for all Montanans, and I was proud to help push it across the finish line.
And as long as I'm in the Senate, I'll keep working to make sure folks can access affordable quality health care.
