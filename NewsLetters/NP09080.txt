Dear
Friend,
American Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, held by the Taliban
since 2009, was recently returned to the United States in exchange for
five Taliban prisoners being held at Guantanamo
Bay.
It is not yet clear if the soldier walked away from his post in
eastern Afghanistan in 2009, prompting questions as to how far the US
should go to rescue a potential deserter given that the military doesnt
make a distinction between deserters who leave their posts and
defectors who join enemy forces. Current law requires the President to notify
Congress at least 30 days before the transfer or release of a
Guantanamo detainee but this did not occur due to concerns over Sgt.
Bergdahls health and safety, according to the
Administration.
As youve heard, numerous concerns about the prisoner swap have been
raised. The longstanding practice of the United States is to not engage
in negotiations with terrorists. Others have raised concerns about the
swap primarily because the President acted outside of the law by not
notifying Congress 30 days in advance of the Guantanamo prisoner
release. Some have said the deal would jeopardize our national security and
place deployed soldiers at greater risk, while others believe the
most important consideration is the freedom and safety of an
American.
Next week, the House Armed Services Committee will
convene a hearing
on the prisoner swap. As Congress
examines the evidence to determine the terms and conditions of this
exchange, and reviews the Administrations decision to forego notifying
Congress contrary to legal requirements to do so, I am interested in
hearing your thoughts on this issue.
What do you
think?
Please choose the statement that best reflects your views
and add your thoughts in the textbox below. I support the Administrations actions. The
most important consideration is the freedom and safety of an American
POW. I oppose the
Administrations actions for one or some of the reasons listed
above. I am unsure.
Please share your thoughts.
