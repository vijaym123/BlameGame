 at the much-anticipated District of Columbia statehood hearing, the first-ever congressional hearing on D.C. statehood in the Senate.
Even more than the testimony, the historic hearing on statehood will be remembered for the unprecedented turnout by residents and for reinvigorating members of Congress to support statehood and District residents to join the statehood movement.
A few days after the hearing, I released a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) that concluded that a challenge to the constitutionality of my D.C. statehood bill, the New Columbia Admission Act, may be outside the courts purview and that there is likely a constitutional basis for the D.C. statehood bill.
The CRS report did not differ significantly from the conclusions of Georgetown Law School professor Viet Dinh, Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy for the Department of Justice in the George W. Bush administration, who testified at the hearing.
Two New Reports on the Completion of DHS Headquarters at St. Elizabeths
Last Friday, I attended a hearing
on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) St. Elizabeths complex.
The hearing focused on a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on DHS consolidation.
The Senate also released a report recommending completion of the complex, and the Senate appropriations committee has granted the Presidents full GSA construction request for DHS consolidation.
Although the GAOs report criticized some DHS and General Services Administration (GSA) planning practices on the project, it did not say that consolidation should not be completed.
The project, which will be built much more slowly than previously expected because of delayed congressional appropriations, is scheduled to be completed in 2026, with a new Master Plan to be submitted with the Presidents fiscal year 2016 budget request.
At this stage, as the hearing made clear, it would cost the government more not to finish the project than to proceed on the slowed schedule.
Add Your Suggestions to Roundtable: Can Grass and People Occupy the National Mall at the Same Time?
Last Thursday, my National Mall Roundtable
heard from Bob Vogel, National Park Service Superintendent
for the National Mall and Memorial Parks; Caroline Cunningham, President of the Trust for the National Mall, which is funding the makeover of the Mall; Michael Mason, Director of the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage; and Thomas Luebke, Secretary of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.
This was the first public meeting about current and pending Mall improvements.
At the roundtable, Vogel announced that gravel areas will be expanded to allow events, such as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, to continue.
He also announced that the new soil and turf will allow most activities thought to no longer be permitted to continue by accommodating games and large gatherings by sometimes rotating events.
There will even be a concert on the National Mall on the new turf later this fall that will attract hundreds of thousands of attendees.
Among the Mall recommendations were: Working with the District of Columbia Department of Transportation to establish a Circulator Mall route, which will be in place in time for the 2015 Cherry Blossom Festival; increased food options on the Mall, including lunch fare brought in from restaurants and a limited number of regulated food trucks; chairs and tables in the shade to allow people to sit for lunch or at other times; holding more events at Constitution Gardens, now being revitalized, which is one of the Malls most beautiful but forgotten places; refocusing on greater use of East Potomac Park; expanding the gravel space and walkways to accommodate more foot traffic; increase appreciation for both the Mall and the Smithsonian museums by bringing certain pieces of art or artifacts onto the Mall and explaining them during the day; and a designated dance floor on the Mall.

My Week on the House Floor to Kiss Goodbye to the Do-Nothing 113th Congress
Last Wednesday, I spoke on the House floor
about a House amendment, attached to the short-term continuing resolution, about funding to fight the terrorist group known as ISIL, without giving tax-paying District of Columbia residents a vote on this matter.
In war or peace, D.C. should be able to have a vote on it before our residents go into harms way.
The next day on the floor, as the Congress recessed until after the elections, I called out my Republican colleagues
for worsening the abysmal productivity of the 113th Congress by closing out the legislative year with a package of deeply ideological bills that had long ago failed to move in the Senate, instead of focusing on easily passable bills that already have broad appeal like the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act.
Bringing Back D.C.s Vote in the Committee of the Whole
Two days after testifying in the Senate for D.C. statehood, I testified
at a House Rules Committee hearing on Wednesday to at least try to retrieve the only vote D.C. has ever had on the House floor, the Committee of the Whole vote, a vote I won for D.C. in the 103rd Congress, shortly after being elected to Congress.
We can blame House Republicans, who took that vote away when they regained the majority in the 112th Congress.
As we struggle for statehood, we certainly cannot sit still and let Congress take away the rights we have won. Going backwards should not be an option.
Protecting Federal Workers Due Process
Last week, the House passed the Senior Executive Service Accountability Act, which relaxed the requirement for dismissing senior executives in the federal government.
I opposed the bill, but I am pleased that my due process amendment was included in the final bill .
House Committee Republicans initially wanted to shorten the time period for notice from 30 days to only 15 days, which would have severely limited the amount of time that the senior executive would have had to prepare her case in response to the charges.
My amendment maintains the government standard of 30 days.
First Asian Pacific American Judge for D.C. District Court
On Thursday, I testified
at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in favor of Amit Mehtas nomination to become the first Asian Pacific American judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
I recommended him to President Obama because he has been an outstanding litigator and an academic star.
Changing the Washington Football Team Name
On Tuesday, I spoke at a press conference
for the Change the Mascot campaign, led by Native Americans to change the name of the Washington football team.
A historic ruling by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in June found the name to be a racial slur (now on appeal).
When is National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell going to act like a leader and call on owners, all of whom share profits from the name, to get a name change before the law requires it?
We dont want the name of our progressive city associated with a derogatory insult to our native people.
Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month
I led, as Grand Marshal , the Parade of Nations at the 43rd annual Fiesta D.C. Festival yesterday, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.
For my own celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, a town meeting will be held on October 14 on unaccompanied children who have crossed the border from Central America.
Los Angeles, Rhode Island, and D.C. have the largest population of these children who have made it into the United States.
