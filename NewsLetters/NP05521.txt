U.S. Service Academy Nomination Application Deadline
Saturday, November 1, 2014
On September 25, 2014, I hosted my annual Military Academy Information Night. The event was well attended and our team was able to answer many questions for parents and students about the application process.
Students interested in attending a Service Academy must have a nomination from an authorized nominating source. As a Member of Congress, I am authorized to nominate candidates who reside in California's 21st Congressional District.
High school juniors or seniors interested in attending one of the United States Service Academies must submit their
Academy Nomination Application
to my office by
Saturday, November 1, 2014.
The U.S. Service Academies offer a unique and esteemed educational opportunity for young men and women. Accepted students receive a 4-year university education, room and board, medical and dental coverage and a stipend in exchange for a 5-year military service commitment at graduation.
If you or someone you know would like to learn more about the process, please contact my Hanford office at (559) 582-5526.
Sincerely,
David G. Valadao
Member of Congress
