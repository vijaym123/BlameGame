Dear Friends,
Over the last week I led a congressional delegation to the Russian
cities of Moscow and the home of the upcoming Olympics, Sochi. The
purpose of my visit was to ensure that appropriate measures were being
taken by the Russian authorities to ensure the safety of the thousands
of Americans that will participate and attend the Olympic games that
begin on February 7.
Although the security measures being taken are impressive and I believe
the so-called "ring of steel" offers great security around the Olympic
Village, I still have many concerns.
The "Black Widow" terrorists that
are suspected of having infiltrated the area need to be found. Russia
should also be sharing more intelligence with the United States about
potential threats.
Our country can offer many services to help better
secure the games.
The FBI has already sent counterterrorism agents to
assist in the efforts. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Martin Dempsey, has been working with his counterpart in Russia
so we can provide cutting edge technology for Improvised Explosive
Device (IED) detection.
This technology would assist with security
sweeps and better secure soft targets. I am hopeful the Russians will
also provide a more invisible presence so that the games will be safe,
secure, friendly, and represent the Olympic spirit.
During my visit I gave several interviews including on ABC's Sunday
morning show, "This Week" that touched on security preparations. You
can watch that appearance, and several others, below.

Dear
Friends,
Over
the
last
week
I
led
a
congressional
delegation
to
the
Russian
cities
of
Moscow
and
the
home
of
the
upcoming
Olympics,
Sochi. The
purpose
of
my
visit
was
to
ensure

appropriate

by
the
Russian
authorities
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
thousands
of
Americans
that
will
participate
and
attend
the
Olympic
games
that
begin
on
February
7.
Although
the
security
measures
being
taken
are
impressive
and
I
believe
the
so-called
&#8220;ring
of
steel&#8221;
offers
great
security
around
the
Olympic
Village,
I
still
have
many
concerns.
The
&#8220;Black

terrorists
that
are
