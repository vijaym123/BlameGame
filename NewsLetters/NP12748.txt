Kristi Speaks on the House Floor About the Farm Bill
Dear Friend,
This morning, I helped lead the House of Representatives in passing the
2014 Farm Bill. It has been a privilege to serve as South Dakota's
voice throughout the negotiations as a member of the Conference
Committee.
I'm proud we were able to include a strong livestock
disaster program, a good crop insurance program, conservation and
forestry provisions, and a safety net for those who rely on food
assistance.
It does all of this while producing billions in savings
for taxpayers.
If you're interested in learning more about the provisions that were
included, click here
.
Now is the time to bring the Farm Bill home. With the House's passage,
the Senate must now vote on the bill before the President can put his
signature on it. I'm hopeful the bill will be signed into law in the
next few weeks, so we can begin working with the USDA on its
implementation.
Have a great rest of the week!
-Kristi

Kristi
Speaks
on
the
House
Floor
About
the
Farm
Bill
Dear
Friend,
This
morning,
I
helped
lead
the
House
of
Representatives
in
passing
the
2014
Farm
Bill. It
has
been
a
privilege
to
serve
as
South
Dakota&#8217;s
voice
throughout
the
negotiations
as
a
member
of
the
Conference
Committee.
I&#8217;m
proud
we
were
able
to
include
a
strong
livestock
disaster
program,
a
good
crop
insurance
program,
conservation
and
forestry
provisions,
and
a
safety
net
for
those
who
rely
on
food
assistance.
It
does
all
of
this
while
producing
billions
in
savings
for
taxpayers.
If
you&#8217;re

Now
is
the
time
to

the
Farm

home. With
the
House&#8217;s
passage,
the
Senate
must
now
vote
on
the
bill
before
the
President
can
put
his
signature
on
it. I&#8217;m
hopeful
the
bill
will
be
signed
into
law
in
the
next
few
weeks,
so
we
can
begin
working
with
the
USDA
on
its
implementation.
Have
a
great
rest
of
the
week!
