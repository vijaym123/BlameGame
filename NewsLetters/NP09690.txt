Dear Friends,
As many of you are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) under President Obama's leadership has spiraled into
a bureaucratic mess. The unchecked regulations coming from the EPA
are hurting our agricultural industry and deteriorating America's
energy affordability and reliability.

The Oklahoman Editorial on Climate
Regulations ].
The agency has
also been in the spot light for paying six-figure salaries and
work-incentive bonuses to employees that were either not doing their jobs or not
showing up to work.

iceberg '].
Not as noticeable
are the politically-driven tactics within the agency to
implement the President's controversial climate change
regulations to hide their devastating impacts
from Americans and safeguard vulnerable democrats during
elections.
Ahead of the 2012 presidential
election, I first sounded the alarm on the EPA's unethical practice of
delaying regulations in order to influence elections. I released a report
in 2012of the harmful regulations I foresaw the administration
attempting to push aside until after the President was reelected.
The
Washington Post
later vindicated my warning when several
anonymous administration officials spoke to the paper of how they were
instructed to withhold rule proposals for political
reasons.

Now as
the country approaches critical elections this November, the EPA is
at it once again. As Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and
Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Oversight, my latest investigation has
resulted in what appears to be the EPA intentionally delaying until
after the 2014 elections a regulation called the New Source Performance
Standards (NSPS) rule, which will make our electricity grid less
reliable and less affordable for
Americans.
On April 28,
I sent a
letter
to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy asking for answers to simple
questions about the timeline for the EPAs NSPS rule. You see,
once an agency proposes a rule or regulation it must be submitted to
the Federal Register to publish and begin the required public
comment period. This process allows citizens, businesses,
organizations and any stakeholders to provide additional insight,
information or input on the proposed rule. For the NSPS
rule, the EPA then has one full calendar year to consider
outside comments and finalize the details and language of the
rule before implementation begins.
During an EPW Committee hearing on Jan.
16, Adm. McCarthy stated that she submitted the NSPS rule to the Federal Register's
office
as soon as that proposal was
released
to the public on Sept. 20, 2013. When in fact, the EPA did not
submit the rule to the Federal Register until Nov. 25, 2013, an
unprecedented 66-days later. When adding the average time in which
it takes the Federal Register to process a submitted proposal, the rule
will now not need to be finalized until January 2015, long after
critical elections.
Had the
EPA submitted the rule according to the timeline President Obama
and Adm. McCarthy had told the public, the rule would have been
finalized before the November elections, giving me and my colleagues the
opportunity to file a Congressional Review Act (CRA) for
the rule. A CRA forces the Senate Majority Leader to bring the rule up
for a vote. This would have forced many vulnerable Democrats to go
on the record supporting their President on his destructive climate
change regulation while harming their constituents' future accesses to
cheap electricity or instead choosing to vote against the NSPS rule
and possibly block it from being
implemented.
I will continue to press Adm. McCarthy on why her
on-the-record statement failed to support the actual actions of her
agency. I will also continue to work to uncover the political games being
played within the agency that is impacting the future of our nation's
affordable energy. It's time for accountability and transparency
within the Obama Administration, a campaign promise his EPA has yet to
fulfill. That is what I am working to accomplish in Washington and I
appreciate your
support.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
