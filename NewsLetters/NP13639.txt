Fixing the Broken Treaty of 1854
Watch Congressman Nolan speak in support of his bill to rectify the
Treaty of 1854
with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa
Dear Friend,
Congress has passed only 55 bills this year, and I'm proud to say that
here in the House, two of them are mine.
Just a few days ago, President Obama signed the bipartisan Small
Airplane Revitalization Act Senator Amy Klobuchar and I authored to
streamline regulations and spur new jobs in that vital American
industry - most directly at Cirrus Aircraft in Duluth. (See the story
below).
Then, last week, Democrats and Republicans in the House passed my bill
to help rectify the broken treaty of 1854 between the Fond du Lac Band
of Lake Superior Chippewa and the federal government by approving a
long-awaited land exchange between the Band and Carlton County. Senator
Al Franken is shepherding the companion bill through the Senate.
By way of background, the treaty set aside 101,000 acres of land
exclusively for the Fond du Lac Band Reservation. However, homesteaders
and others were wrongly allowed to settle on this land, much of which
was later forfeited to the County for non-payment of taxes. The result
today is a checkerboard of ownership that limits both the Band's and
the County's ability to effectively manage the lands they control.
Under the agreement - which Congress is required by law to approve -
approximately 3,200 acres the county currently owns within the
boundaries of the Fond du Lac Reservation will be returned to the Band,
in exchange for 1,451 acres of equal value the Band owns outside the
Reservation.
As a result, the Band will have space to construct much-needed housing
for its 6,700 members, as well as for traditional hunting and
gathering. And Carlton County will have valuable new timber and
forestry resources.
Despite the gridlock and partisanship that still permeate Washington,
we are getting some good things done for Minnesotans.
Sincerely,
_____
Small Airplane Bill Takes Off into Law As noted above, the President
has signed legislation Senator Amy Klobuchar and I authored to cut red
tape tying up the small airplane industry. Our Small Airplane
Revitalization Act modernizes the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA) certification process to improve safety, decrease costs, and
encourage innovation. This bipartisan legislation is all about jobs
spurred by a whole new generation of the world's safest, most
technically-advanced aircraft. Small aircraft manufacturers in America
have been slowly choking over the past twenty years due to an outdated,
unnecessarily lengthy approval process that increases the price of
safety and technology upgrades by up to ten times. This bill-now law-
gets to the root of the problem.
A Salute to Pearl Harbor Hero Arleigh Birk

I marked the 72nd anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack with retired
and active veterans at the Gilbert VFW and the Aurora American Legion -
as well as at a very special ceremony in Hoyt Lakes honoring a local
Pearl Harbor hero -
Boatswain's Mate First Class Arleigh Birk. Just 21
years old as Japanese planes swarmed over his ship, the USS Honolulu,
on December 7,1941, Arleigh went on to help fight off Kamikaze attacks,
sink several enemy destroyers, and rescue prisoners of war during his
ensuing five years aboard the USS Denver in the Pacific Theatre. Now 93
years old, Arleigh and his wife, Marion, still reside at their family
home in Hoyt Lakes. In honor of his service and bravery in the cause of
freedom, we presented him with an American flag flown over the United
States Capitol.
Fighting to Keep the USPS Facility Open in Duluth
Congressman Nolan with Plant Manager Bill Jaskari examine a letter
sorting machine
while touring the USPS Sorting Facility in Duluth
I am continuing to do everything within my power to keep the U.S.
Postal Service sorting facility in Duluth open and serving our region.
This state of the art facility, which is in danger of closure due to
budget cuts, provides good jobs, and speedy mail delivery. And as I
learned on tour last week, its closing would significantly slow down
and diminish service throughout the Duluth area and throughout
Northeastern Minnesota. We're going to do everything we possibly can to
make sure this fine operation stays up and running.
Honoring Volunteerism Around the World All over the globe, citizen
volunteers engage in real people-to-people diplomacy - selfless efforts
Congress ought to officially recognize. With that in mind, and to mark
International Volunteer Day on Thursday, December 5, Senator Ed Markey
of Massachusetts and I introduced a resolution to provide an annual
Congressional salute to the thousands of people who volunteer their
time and talents. Having traveled in many countries, I know firsthand
how these efforts change lives. Both my daughter and her husband served
in Peace Corps Guatemala, and they frequently remind me there's no
better way of inspiring altruism in others than donating your time and
care to those in need. Truly America putting its best foot forward.
A Safer, Better Highway 371 for Crow Wing, Cass Counties
Congressman Nolan meets with MnDOT representatives and local elected
officials from Nisswa, Pequot Lakes, Crosslake, and Breezy Point to
tour the proposed Hwy 371 improvement project
Last week I joined MnDOT representatives and local elected officials
from Nisswa, Breezy Point, Crosslake, and Pequot Lakes for a tour of
the proposed Highway 371 improvement project. The 16 miles of lane
expansion and safety improvements stretches from Nisswa to Pine River
in Crow Wing and Cass Counties. The group included Sergius Phillips,
MNDOT Government Relations; Darrell Schneider, Mayor of Crosslake;
Terrence Humbert, Assistant MNDOT District Engineer; Dan Anderson,
MNDOT District 3 Engineer; Breezy Point Mayor JoAnn Weaver; and Nisswa
City Councilor Jan Pierce.
Hats Off to the Duluth Coast Guard

One of the best parts of my recent visit to Duluth was a stop at the
Coast Guard Station - ranked #1 in the U.S. for iron ore and grain
cargo. Rear Admiral Fred Midgette (appears to my right in this picture)
was my gracious host; we discussed the wide range of activities for
which the Ninth District Coast Guard - which spans the entire Great
Lakes from Minnesota's Lake of the Woods to the eastern end of the St.
Lawrence Seaway - is responsible, including marine & waterfront safety
and security, search and rescue, and environmental response. Vanta
Coda, the new Executive Director of the Duluth Port Authority, appears
on my right in this picture. We happily welcomed him to snowy Duluth.

Briefly...
Also last week, I:
.
Discussed raising the minimum wage, worker health and
safety, and generating good-paying middle-class jobs during a packed
Duluth Labor Round Table with local Labor leaders and elected
officials, including Minnesota State Representative Jason Metsa.
.
Joined the entire Minnesota Delegation in cosponsoring the
Short Line Railroad Rehabilitation and Investment Act, H.R.721, which
proposes to extend the Section 45G short-line rehabilitation tax
credit, creating a strong incentive for short line railroads to invest
private sector dollars on freight railroad track rehabilitation. The
credit is due to expire on December 31, 2013.
_____
Meeting and Learning
One of the best parts of my job as Congressman is meeting with
a wide variety of people whose knowledge and experience help me better
represent Minnesota's Eighth District.
Last week, I was delighted to welcome to my Washington office
Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk to talk jobs and the economy -
Vanta Coda, Executive Director of the Duluth Port Authority, to discuss
the Water Resources (WRRDA) bill - and, as a member of the House Autism
Caucus, representatives of the Minnesota Autism Advocacy Coalition and
Board of the Autism Recovery Foundation, to discuss research and
related issues before the Congress.
I enjoyed interviews focusing on the Farm Bill and WRRDA with
Scott Hall of KXAE Radio in Grand Rapids and MSNBC's Ed Schultz. As a
co-sponsor of the Saving America's Pollinators Act (H.R.2692), I met
with experts from the Center for Food Safety to discuss how to protect
our honeybees. I also visited with Minnesota members of the National
Beer Wholesalers on taxes, and the National Conference of State
Legislators regarding ways we can foster better state and federal
cooperation.
_____
Coming Up In Washington
As we approach the last scheduled week of the 2013 session,
still pending are the Farm Bill, the Water Resources Reform &
Development Act (WRRDA), extension of benefits for the long term
unemployed, the agreement on the budget and the debt ceiling, as well
as immigration reform. Majority Leadership has informed us we may vote
on the Farm Bill and the budget agreement this week - but it's likely
some of these matters will be carried over into the new year.
This week, I have a meeting scheduled with John F. Sopko,
Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, to discuss
efforts by a number of us in Congress to stop the planned $12 billion
expenditure of U.S. taxpayer funds for infrastructure projects in
Afghanistan likely to add to the $60 billion in fraud and waste Mr.
Sopko has already documented to have been spent in that terribly
troubled nation.
I'll participate in a celebration marking the 377th anniversary
of the National Guard as a foundation of our national defense, and meet
with representatives of the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) on health care, the American Gas Association regarding federal
rulemaking, and the Alliance for American Manufacturing to discuss
serious potential problems relative to the ongoing Trans Pacific
Partnership trade agreement negotiations.
I will also pay a visit to the Embassy of Israel for talks on
Syria and the Middle East. Finally, I will focus on the Farm Bill
during interviews scheduled with KLTF Radio in Little Falls and the
Wadena Pioneer Journal.

Finally...
Isanti County's Judge James Dehn's SAFE CAB Program
Earns National Recognition for Lifesaving Change!
Isanti County Judge James Dehn with Century Council CEO and
President Ralph Blackman, after receiving the council's 2013 Kevin E.
Quinlan Award for Excellence in Traffic Safety
For his highly successful SAFE CAB program
and work in sharing it
with other Minnesota counties, hearty congratulations to Isanti County
District Judge James Dehn. SAFE CAB is a public-private partnership
that saves lives and substantial taxpayer dollars, reduces judicial,
jail, and offender costs, and allows our law enforcement officers to be
more productive.
Under SAFE CAB, DWI arrests in Isanti County have dropped 60% -
number 1 in Minnesota for the last six years. Now, I'm looking forward
to helping him expand this truly effective program throughout our
nation.

Representative
Rick
Nolan
Fixing
the
Broken
Treaty
of
1854
Watch
Congressman
Nolan
speak
in
support
of
his
bill
to
rectify
the
Treaty
of
1854
with
the
Fond
du
Lac
Band
of
Lake
Superior
Chippewa
Dear
Friend,
Congress
has
passed
only
55
bills
this
year ,
and
I&#8217;m
proud
to
say
that
here
in
the
House,
two
of
them
are
mine .
Just
a
few
days
ago,
President
Obama
signed
the
bipartisan
Small
Airplane
Revitalization
Act
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
and
I
authored
to
streamline
regulations
and
spur
new
jobs
in
that
vital
American
industry
&#8211;
most
directly
at
Cirrus
Aircraft
in
Duluth.
(See
the
story
below).
Then,
last
week,
Democrats
and
Republicans
in
the
House
passed
my
bill
to
help
rectify
the
broken
treaty
of
1854
between
the
Fond
du
Lac
Band
of
Lake
Superior
Chippewa
and
the
federal
government
by
approving
a
long-awaited
land
exchange
between
the
Band
and
Carlton
County.
Senator
Al
Franken
is
shepherding
the
companion
bill
through
the
Senate.
By
way
of
background,
the
treaty
set
aside
101,000
acres
of
land
exclusively
for
the
Fond
du
Lac
Band
Reservation.
However,
homesteaders
and
others
were
wrongly
allowed
to
settle
on
this
land,
much
of
which
was
later
forfeited
to
the
County
for
non-payment
of
taxes.
The
result
today
is
a
checkerboard
of
ownership
that
limits
both
the
Band&#8217;s
and
the
County&#8217;s
ability
to
effectively
manage
the
lands
they
control.
Under
the
agreement
&#8211;
which
Congress
is
required
by
law
to
approve
&#8211;approximately
3,200
acres
the
county
currently
owns
within
the
boundaries
of
the
Fond
du
Lac
Reservation
will
be
returned
to
the
Band ,
in
exchange
for
1,451
acres
of
equal
value
the
Band
owns
outside
the
Reservation.
As
a
result,
the
Band
will
have
space
to
construct
much-needed
housing
for
its
6,700
members ,
as
well
as
for
traditional
hunting
and
gathering.
And
Carlton
County
will
have
valuable
new
timber
and
forestry
resources.
Despite
the
gridlock
and
partisanship
that
still
permeate
Washington,
we
are
getting
some
good
things
done
for
Minnesotans .

Just
21
years
old
as
Japanese

swarmed
over

on

Arleigh
went
on
to

and
rescue
prisoners
of

during
his
ensuing

Now
93
years

Arleigh
and

still
reside
at
their
family
home
in
Hoyt

In
honor
of
his
service
and
bravery
in
the

of
freedom,
we
presented
him
with
an

This

which
is
in

due
to

provides
good

And
as

its
closing
would
significantly
slow
down

We're

the
debt
ceiling ,
as
well
as
immigration
reform.
Majority
Leadership
has
informed
us
we
may
vote
on
the
Farm
Bill
and
the
budget
agreement
this
week
-
but
it's
likely
some
of
these
matters
will
be
carried
over
into
the
new
year.
This
week,
I
have
a
meeting
scheduled
with
John
F.
Sopko,
Special
Inspector
General
for
Afghanistan
Reconstruction ,
to
discuss
efforts
by
a
number
of
us
in
Congress
to
stop
the
planned
$12
billion
expenditure
of
U.S.
taxpayer
funds
for
infrastructure
projects
in
Afghanistan
likely
to add
to
the
$60
billion
in
fraud
and
waste
Mr.
Sopko
has
already
documented
to
have
been
spent
in
that
terribly
troubled
nation.
I&#8217;ll
participate
in
a
celebration
marking
the
377th
anniversary
of
the
National
Guard
as
a
foundation
of
our
national
defense,
and
meet
with
representatives
of
the
Service
Employees
International
Union
(SEIU)
on
health
care,
the
American
Gas
Association
regarding
federal
rulemaking,
and
the
Alliance
for
American
Manufacturing
to
discuss
serious
potential
problems
relative
to
the
ongoing
Trans
Pacific
Partnership
trade
agreement
negotiations.
I
will
also
pay
a
visit
to
the
Embassy
of
Israel
for
talks
on
Syria
and
the
Middle
East .
Finally,
I
will
focus
on
the
Farm
Bill
during
interviews
scheduled
with
KLTF
Radio
in
Little
Falls
and
the
Wadena
Pioneer
Journal.
