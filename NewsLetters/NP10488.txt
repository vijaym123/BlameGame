Forward to a Friend
Dear Friend,
I am pleased to announce that voting for the 2014 Congressional Art Contest has begun and for the first time, you get to choose the winner! The high school student you select as the 2014 Peoples Choice Award winner will represent Iowas Second District and have his or her artwork displayed in the tunnel leading to the U.S. Capitol for one year.
Believe me, it is going to be a tough choice for you to make. We received 167 entries from 13 schools in 10 counties. With so many talented artists in our high schools, there are a lot of high quality pieces of work for you to pick from.

Online voting is very simple.
