Dear Friend,
It's well documented that most Americans today view Congress and
Washington with deep distrust and cynicism - Congress' approval rating
continues to hover around the single digits.
Much of this stems from
the perception that special interests and big money campaign donors
wield undue influence over the policy making machinery and that the
voices of everyday Americans count for very little.
The public has this perception for a very good reason. In the 2012
election cycle alone, big interests such as the oil and gas industry
and Wall Street contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to
Congressional campaigns and equally vast sums to lobbying groups.
Meanwhile, upwards of $1.3 billion poured in from Super PACs and "dark
money" groups that float outside the reaches of our campaign finance
laws.
It is perfectly rational to conclude, as most Americans do, that
Congress has developed an unhealthy dependence on these sources of
campaign funding and as a result too often leans in the direction of
the special interests and away from the public interest.
Over thirty
years ago, the Republican Minority Leader of the U.S. Senate, Robert
Dole, was quoted as saying, "When these political action committees
give money, they expect something in return other than good government."
Since then, the problem he identified has metastasized.
Whatever the
issue - job creation, health care, education, environmental protection -
big money is warping Congress' priorities and eroding basic trust in
government.
But there is still reason for hope.
Most people who run for public
office do so out of a sincere desire to help others and make a
difference in their community.
Many of us are deeply frustrated at the
outsized role of money in our politics and long to restore Congress'
independence and credibility with the public.
We share our
constituents' conviction that we need a government of, by and for the
people - not bought and paid for by big money campaign donors and
special interests.
Most members of Congress would leap at the chance to fund their
campaigns without having to turn to a familiar cast of big donors and
entrenched interests.
Today, that's virtually impossible given the
huge amounts of money it takes to run for office. The good news is that
we can craft a viable alternative to the current system - an
alternative that allows candidates to raise sufficient campaign funds
without turning their backs on everyday Americans.
That's why I am introducing the Government By the People Act
.
This sensible and
straightforward piece of legislation will do the following.
First, it will encourage the participation of everyday Americans in the
funding of campaigns by providing a refundable $25 My Voice Tax Credit.
This will bring the voices of the broad public into the funding side of
campaigns and democratize the relationship between money and speech.
Second, the bill will establish a Freedom From Influence Matching Fund
to boost the power of small-dollar contributions.
To be eligible for
these matching funds, a candidate must agree to a limit on large
donations and must demonstrate broad-based support from a network of
small-dollar contributors.
Amplified by the Freedom From Influence
matching fund, the voices of everyday Americans would be just as
powerful as the voices of the big donors.
Third, the Government By the People Act will provide candidates with an
opportunity to earn additional resources in the home stretch of a
campaign so that the voices of the people are not completely drowned
out by Super PACs and other dark money interests.
In the wake of the
Citizens United decision, this kind of support is critical to ensuring
that citizen-backed candidates have staying power.
We can pay for these changes just by closing a few of the tax and
regulatory loopholes that are the decades-old legacy of special
interest influence in Congress.
It's only fair that those who are
responsible for breaking the policy-making machinery in Washington
should bear the cost of fixing it.
The Government By the People Act, which has been supported by more than
130 Members of Congress and over 35 national organizations representing
millions of Americans, is a common-sense proposal to replace Congress'
dependence on big money with a new model of funding campaigns that puts
everyday citizens back in charge.
It holds the promise that the voice
of the people will once again find expression in the public policy that
comes out of Washington.
That heartfelt aspiration is one shared by
Democrats, Republicans and Independents.
I am ready and eager to join
Americans from across the political spectrum in this effort to restore
a government of, by and for the people.

Dear

It&#8217;s
well

that
most

deep

cynicism
&#8211;
Congress&#8217;
approval
rating
continues

Much
of
this
stems
from
the
perception
that
special

and
big

campaign
donors
wield
undue
influence
over
the
policy
making
machinery
and
that
the
voices
of
everyday
Americans
count
for
very
little.
The
public
has
this
perception
for
a
very
good
reason.
In
the
2012
election
cycle
alone,
big
interests
such
as
the
oil
and
gas
industry
and
Wall
Street
contributed
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
Congressional

and
equally
vast
sums
to
lobbying
groups.

upwards
of
$1.3

poured
in
from
Super
PACs
and
&#8220;dark
money&#8221;
groups
that
float
