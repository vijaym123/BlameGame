David --
Three years ago, I decided to run for Congress. My mission was simple: Break through the gridlock and put the focus back on serving families here in Illinois and around the country.
With the help of countless people just like you, I won my race in 2012.
In my first term in Congress, I&rsquo;ve worked hard to strengthen the middle class, rebuild a vibrant economy, and stand up against partisan bickering to help move our country forward. I've proudly stood up to defend women's access to critical health care services, supported sensible reforms to prevent gun violence, and took action to protect our environment. We&rsquo;ve made some progress, but our work is still unfinished.
I'm a proud, lifelong Democrat, but refighting the same old partisan battles isn't going to move our country forward. There are still too many middle class families struggling to make ends meet, too many students getting priced out of a good education, and far too many seniors living with uncertainty about their futures. That is not the legacy we should to pass on to future generations. I&rsquo;m running for re-election to continue to fight for solutions to our most pressing problems.
But our road ahead is tough. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to need your help every step of the way. Will you join me? David, click here to sign your name and say you&rsquo;re in for my 2014 campaign &gt;&gt;
Our fight is just beginning. Thousands of people from across Illinois and the country have already joined our grassroots movement. Please don&rsquo;t delay. Add your name now: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Say-Youre-In
