Friend,
I&lsquo;ve been thinking this weekend about my vision for a better government-- a Congress that rises above politics to work for the people.
As we work on the issues facing our communities and think through potential solutions, we always come to the same sticking point-- the inability of people to work together.
If there&rsquo;s one thing we can agree on, it&rsquo;s that this is why elections matter.
If we don&rsquo;t elect people who bring a pragmatic approach to Congress then we&rsquo;re just doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. (I think Einstein defined that as insanity.)
I wish I could change the culture in Washington faster but I can&rsquo;t do this alone.
That&rsquo;s why your support and engagement matter.
Anyway, I wanted to share my thoughts with you and I hope you&rsquo;re having a good weekend.
Be well,
Ami
