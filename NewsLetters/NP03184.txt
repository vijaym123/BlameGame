Friend -- You&rsquo;ve been a great supporter of Democrats in the past. We know you understand the importance of electing a Democratic White House and Senate.
But we see you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015 yet (your record below). Will you renew so we can get to work
immediately ?
DSCC Membership Status:
pending
2015 Membership Rate:

(renew membership now)
FEC Deadline: 48 hours
The GOP-controlled Congress has already attacked Social Security, Obamacare, and abortion rights. Meanwhile, the Koch brothers are promising to spend a huge amount on the 2016 elections,
meaning Republican Presidential and Senate candidates will be VERY well-funded -- which could end in disaster for us.
You can&rsquo;t let that happen. If 50,000 Democrats renew their DSCC membership by the FEC deadline in 48 hours, we&rsquo;ll STOP the GOP from taking an insurmountable lead. But if we DON&rsquo;T meet this goal, the White House and Senate could be out of reach.
Will you renew your membership by the FEC deadline? You have just 48 hours left!

Or donate another amount.
It may seem early, but the right-wing money machine will soon begin to bankroll a Presidential candidate. If we don&rsquo;t start competing now, we could seriously be looking at a President Christie&hellip; or Romney&hellip; or Cruz?!
Please keep that from happening by renewing your DSCC membership now!
