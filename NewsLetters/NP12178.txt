IRS "Free File" Great Opportunity for Eligible Taxpayers to File Online
for Free
With tax season in full swing, I strongly encourage qualified taxpayers
across Northeast Florida to use the Internal Revenue Service Program
"Free File" to prepare and file their federal taxes online at no cost.
At a Computer and Communications Industry Association-sponsored event
at the University of North Florida this afternoon, I explained program
details before community and non-profit organization leaders got some
hands experience in the University computer lab about how the software
works.
Any American with an Adjusted Gross Income of $58,000 or less is
eligible to use the program to prepare, complete, and e-file their
federal income tax at no cost. The folks attending today's briefing
will help spread the word across the region, and anyone can access
details online at www.IRS.gov/freefile
.
"Free File" is a great example of common-sense problem solving - the
government and private sector working together to help Americans save
money during tax season. The program doesn't cost the government a
dime, takes the confusion out of tax preparation, and keeps money in
the pockets of people who need it most.
Since 2003, it has saved taxpayers $1.2 billion while offering 70
percent of taxpayers free access to leading commercial tax preparation
software. To date, about 40 million returns have been filed through
"Free File." I hope those statistics keep growing as more folks take
advantage of the program this tax season.
At University of North Florida, talking about the benefits of IRS
"Free File."
