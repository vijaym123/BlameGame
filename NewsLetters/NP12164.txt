February 21, 2014
Dear Friend,
I wanted to share a few important updates with you. As you know,
communicating directly to you is one of my top priorities. That is why
I write this newsletter every week, visit businesses throughout the
District as part of my Congress at Your Company series, and provide
regular updates from Washington and Rhode Island on my Twitter account.
To continue to connect with you and other constituents, I will be
holding my next Neighborhood Conversation on March 17th in Providence
from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and will hold my first ever Twitter town
hall on Friday, February 28th at 12:00 p.m. I am excited to use this
tool to hear directly from you and all the people, families, and
communities I serve.
I encourage you to participate in this online forum by submitting your
questions on Twitter by including the hashtag #AskRepCicilline,
beginning today, and following the conversation on my twitter handle,
@DavidCicilline
.
STEAM App Challenge
This week I launched my first annual Student App Challenge to promote
innovation and engage students in science, technology, engineering,
art, and math (STEAM). This competition encourages high school students
to engage in digital education so they are prepared for the jobs of
today and the future. I am also pleased that the winner will have their
work displayed at the U.S. Capitol and featured on the U.S. House of
Representatives website.
I urge you to encourage friends, family, and neighbors to participate
in this competition. To register please visit my website
or
StudentAppChallenge.house.gov.
Preserving Social Security and Veterans' Benefits
Earlier this week I wrote a letter signed by 116 of my House colleagues
urging President Obama to preserve Social Security and veterans'
benefits in his budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2015 by excluding
chained CPI (Consumer Price Index). I was pleased the President
announced the very next day
that he would drop this change in how the cost-of-living-adjustment
(COLA) is calculated, but this is just the first step in the budget
process and as Congress sets its priorities for our nation's spending,
I will continue to fight to protect seniors by opposing any effort to
reduce cost-of-living increases.
Social Security is a promise our country has made so that Americans can
retire with dignity. Reducing these benefits will hurt families and
expand income inequality.
I will continue to fiercely defend Social
Security and other safety net programs that are vital to America's
seniors.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.
My best always,
David Cicilline
