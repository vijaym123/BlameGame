DONATIONS NOW 4X-mATCHED
WITH 48 HOURS UNTIL THE ELECTION, WE ARE OPENING AN EMERGENCY 4X-MATCH TO HELP US REACH OUR VOTE GOALS.
David --
When we get this close to the end, we always start thinking ahead to the day AFTER the election.
For those of us who were on the Obama 2012 campaign, that was a special day.
President Obama even stopped by campaign headquarters to give us a heartfelt thanks for our work.
Just think about that: the President -- tears welling up in his eyes -- thanking US for our work. It&rsquo;s a moment we&rsquo;ll never forget.
This is the last national election we&rsquo;ll have with Barack Obama as President. And now, we can set a NEW record: the most-ever online donations in a race for Congress.
We want to do President Obama proud one last time.
Just 11 donation(s) from the 60659 zip code to go before tonight&rsquo;s deadline.
David -- can you put us over the top?
