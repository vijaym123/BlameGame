Real People, Real
Stories
My son is disabled and
liked his insurance. It was
cancelled
due to
ObamaCare.
My insurance premium has increased
three fold
We employ 49 people and our
premium renewals went up
47% .
"Trying to keep the same type of coverage I have now, our cost will
TRIPLE . This is
devastating ."
"Yeah, I got to keep my health plan, I just have to pay
about
$900 more
per year for
it."
"Just got my notice.
I like my healthcare plan, cant keep
it.
Neither can any of my
employees."
We are a family of three that paid $753 a month for health insurance
when ObamaCare was enacted. We are now paying $1117 a month for the
same plan, a
48% increase .
I do not see
where the cost of health care is addressed just more people using a
system with ever-increasing costs."
These are
real quotes from folks who live in Magnolia, The Woodlands, and other
parts of our district. Are their stories familiar? Do they reflect
your own or someone you know?
Washington At Its Worst
Texans are
angry and worried , wanting to know how this unworkable
law is going to affect them, their families, their jobs and their
businesses.
Millions of folks across the country are
already facing some hard facts:
Their plans
being
cancelled
due to the Affordable Care
Act
Their monthly premiums are
going
up
Their deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses are
skyrocketing
They will no longer be able to see the
doctor they trust
or go to the local hospital for
care
Hardworking taxpayers are facing
higher
taxes
in order to pay for it all
What about the
dozens of promises that you can
keep the plan you have and
like ? Or that you can continue to go to the doctor you know and
trust? Or that the average family would see a
$2,500
decrease
in their yearly health care costs? And what about that
easy-to-use website?
Simply put, the President's health
care law exemplifies
Washington at its worst.
More Harm Than
Good
No matter how well intentioned this law may have been, it
is not working as promised. The folks who thought they would find
help are too often finding a non-working, glitch-filled website, or
health care costs that
bust the family budget .
Though this bill was sold as a way to make sure every American would be
able to afford quality health care,
millions of Americans will
continue to go without.
For those who will be
purchasing health care under this new system, are you ready to turn over
control of your health care decisions to a government that can't even
get a website up and running after three years? Are you ready to include
the
IRS
in your health care decisions,
knowing
they purposefully targeted and harassed Americans because of their
political beliefs?
Is it right to force every American to
purchase government approved health care --
or pay a
tax?
This Is
Reform?
The Affordable Care Act was supposed to
bring health care costs under control. But in truth, all it really does is
shuffle the cost around . If you're like me, most of
the people you know are now paying more.
Costs are going up,
but choice is going down
- and things are just getting started.
This is supposed to be health care reform?
Washington
shouldn't be coming between you and your health care decisions.
No one
should be forced to buy something they don't want and don't need.
And the White House should stand behind its promises.
Period.
As I have for the past four years, I will
continue to fight to stop the President's health care law. Its
one-size-fits-all approach is not right for Texas families and businesses. I
encourage you to join me on
Facebook
and
Twitter
as I spread the word about just how bad this
law is for our country, our economy and job growth. And if you have a
story to share about how this law is affecting you, I want to hear it.
You can contact me

"Excuse me... you're saying the system, right now, is
working?"
"The flaw is not simply the website - the flaw is the law
itself."
What do you
think? Is the President's
one-size-fits-all health care law the right prescription for
Texas? Yes. Washington knows
best and we need to get on board. No. We should be free to decide if we want to participate
in this law. Not
sure. *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my
