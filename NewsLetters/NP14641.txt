Honor Those Who Protect and Serve
Dear Friend,
Monday is Veterans Day, a day we set aside to honor those who serve and
protect our nation in the Armed Forces. It is important that we take
time out of our busy schedules on Monday to honor and remember the men
and women who sacrificed so much to serve our country. All too often we
forget that freedom is not free. A huge price is paid for the freedoms
we, as Americans, enjoy. This Veterans Day I thank all those who
served, both past and present, in our Armed Forces for their sacrifice
and service.

The Center of Business in Arizona
Thursday I spoke in Casa Grande at the groundbreaking ceremony of
PhoenixMart, a 1.7-million-square-foot multi-functional wholesale,
retail and convention center space. As a one-stop solution that
connects worldwide buyers to competitive sellers, PhoenixMart will
showcase the products of nearly 2,000 exhibitors and create
approximately 9,000 jobs.
With a smile and a can-do attitude, Casa Grande can be the center of
business in Arizona. PhoenixMart will create thousands of jobs locally
and facilitate global innovation. I can't wait to watch its ripple
effect. I would be remiss not to applaud the local officials and local
efforts that went into helping make this project a reality. Click HERE

EPA Could Destroy Arizona's Energy Future
The EPA recently announced alarming new plans to set carbon standards
for existing power plants as the agency simultaneously pursues a
reckless agenda of taking reliable, affordable power offline in Arizona
and across the country.
These plans are part of the Obama Administration's new strategy to
impose a "cap and trade" agenda on coal-fired energy production, even
though a bipartisan majority in Congress rejected those policies more
than four years ago. Click HERE
to read more in my joint op-ed with Reps. Franks, Salmon and
Schweikert in The Arizona Republic.
Eliminating the Demand for Sex Trafficking
On Tuesday, I announced my support and co-sponsorship of H.R. 2805, the
End Sex Trafficking Act of 2013. This bill would add federal
enforcement powers against the "customers" of child prostitutes as
opposed to just the sex traffickers themselves.
In order to effectively address sex trafficking we need to focus on not
just the suppliers of child prostitutes but also those creating the
demand. This law would subject sex buyers to the same punishment as the
sex trafficker where children are enslaved and victimized. Click HERE

Thank You for Being a Leader
On Friday I presented 15-year-old Brandon Colling of Gold Canyon with
the Youth Congressional Bronze Medal Award. The Congressional Award is
the award the United States Congress gives to young Americans who
achieve their own challenging goals in four categories: Volunteer
Public Service, Personal Development, Physical Fitness and
Expedition/Exploration.
I was proud to present Brandon with the Congressional Bronze Medal
Award. Brandon proved that he can achieve anything he sets his mind to;
he doesn't wait for others to set the bar for him.
(Rep. Gosar with Brandon and his parents, Jeff and Rena, November 8,
2013)
Our nation is built on character traits like the ones Brandon
exemplifies: self-determination, commitment and individual
responsibility. Thank you, Brandon, for being a leader in your
community and a positive example for your peers. Click HERE

It's Good to be Home
As I traveled throughout District 4 last week - my first district work
week since September - I visited schools, hospitals, manufacturing
plants and local businesses. I heard from constituents from every walk
of life. Yet, one thing remained clear: people are worried. They are
concerned about the weak economic recovery and they are scared that
Washington is going to let our nation's debt and deficit crush our
country for generations to come.
But people are also hopeful. They believe, as I do, that we can turn
things in Washington around. They are encouraged by those who stand up
to the establishment and say no to politics as usual. Every time I am
home in Arizona I grow more confident that we can get our country back
on the path to economic prosperity.

Obamacare Malady of the Week
$4 million, 4 enrollees: After spending $4 million in federal grant
money, Delaware enrolled only 4 people in Obamacare during the whole
month of October, out of a population of more than 900,000. That's $1
million per enrollee. Delaware is not alone in its paltry enrollment
numbers. In a Senate hearing on Obamacare this past Wednesday, Kathleen
Sebelius warned that very few people across the country have enrolled
in Obamacare.
Congressional District 4: DID YOU KNOW?
Kingman was named after Lewis Kingman, a railroad engineer who surveyed
and oversaw more than 900 miles of railroad in Arizona.

It's
Good

As
I
traveled

last
week
-
my
first

work
week
since
September
-
I
visited
schools,
hospitals,
manufacturing

and
local
businesses.
I
heard
from
constituents
from
every
walk
of
life. Yet,
one
thing
remained
clear:
people
are
worried. They
are
concerned about the
weak
economic
recovery
and
they
are
scared
that
Washington
is
going
to
let
our

crush
our
country
for

But
people
are
also
hopeful.
They

as
I

that
we
can
turn

in
Washington
around.
They
are
encouraged
by

Obamacare
Malady

Week
$4
million,
4
enrollees:
After

$4
million
in

grant
money,
Delaware
enrolled
only
4
people
in
Obamacare
during
the
whole
month
of
October,
out
of
a
population
of
more
than
900,000.
That's
$1
million
per
enrollee.
Delaware
is
not
alone
in
its
paltry
enrollment
numbers.
In
a
Senate
hearing
on
Obamacare
this
past
Wednesday,
Kathleen
Sebelius
warned
that
very
few
people
across
the
country
have
enrolled
in
Obamacare.
