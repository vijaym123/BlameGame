LEGISLATION
Dear
David,
Come See Me in
December
Mental Health &amp;
Substance Abuse Roundtable,
Featuring Special Guest Rep. Tim
Murphy
On
December 16 , at
Rasmussen College, 18600 Fernview St. Land O' Lakes, FL 34638, Rooms 102 and
103, I will be hosting a Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Roundtable
- starting at 1:00 pm!
The goal of this event
is to facilitate dialogue among health care
professionals, policymakers, and family members of those struggling with these problems. We
will discuss the needs that exist within our community, and the steps
that can be taken to improve access to quality treatments.
Our solution-oriented
discussion will focus on how to fix a broken system and ensure better
outcomes.
One important aspect of this conversation is the
treatment options available to our nations Veterans as they grapple with PTS
and other invisible wounds.
One size does not fit all,
especially when it comes to an issue as sensitive as mental health. I am
honored to have Representative Murphy joining me
he is the undisputed
leader in Congress on this issue.
The good work he is doing will
undoubtedly offer substantial improvements in the way this important
issue is viewed and the treatment options available to those with mental
illness.
Holiday Open House
The following day, I will be hosting a Holiday Open House
in Tarpon Springs. It will be at 38500 U.S. Highway 19 North, Room
BB-038 of the Michael &amp; Evelyn Bilirakis Building, on the Tarpon
Springs Campus of St. Petersburg College,
from 2:00 - 3:30
pm!
I hope you will
be able to attend my Holiday Open House. There will be refreshments,
and I look forward to meeting with all those who are able to attend.
If you would like to attend, please call 727 940 5860 to
RSVP.
Sincerely,
Gus
Bilirakis
Member of Congress
