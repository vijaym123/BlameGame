Standing With Colleges and Student
Workers
Many colleges and universities will soon be forced
to cut student jobs and hours due to a costly provision in
the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under the ACAcommonly referred to
as Obamacare colleges and universities will soon be required to
provide health insurance for student employees who work more than 30 hours
a week for 3 months or more, including summer breaks. I introduced a
bill last week that would exempt student workers from Obamacare's
Employer Mandate. At a time when student loan debt sits a $1.08 trillion
and the cost of tuition is rising, students can't afford to have fewer
on-campus job opportunities. It's simple: colleges can't afford this
and students certainly can't either. Read more about the bill
here .

Meet my District Office
Interns
Meet my District office interns: Dalton
Clark, William Kent, and Brooke Caldwell. I'm grateful for their
dedication and hard work so far this summer. As a freshman Member of
Congress, I have a smaller staff than many other Congressional offices, so I
rely heavily on the hard work of interns. If you're interested in
interning in my District office or my DC office, please apply

Prayers for Iraq
As
the terrorist group ISIS takes over more territory in Iraq, hundreds of
thousands of Christians and other religious minorities are forced to
flee for their lives. The deadly militant group has been executing
Christians who refuse to convert to Islam. It has also been killing
moderate Muslims. Whats worse, ISIS is videotaping their brutal massacres
of Christians as a recruitment tool.
The news stories coming out
Iraq are difficult to read. Many experts are saying that ISIS is
unlike any other terrorist group, because of its sophistication and
ruthless tactics. ISIS is singularly-focused on eradicating non-Muslims in
the region and implementing violent Sharia law wherever they take over.
I pray for the safety of the persecuted Christians and other
religious minorities in Iraq and for an end to ISIS' jihadist mission. I will
continue to monitor the situation closely and keep you informed
on what is going on.
