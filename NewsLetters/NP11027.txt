Dear Friend:
I'm greatly honored to have
received a perfect score of 100% on the voting record of Network, a
Catholic advocacy group looking for commitment to social issues and common
good. I've dedicated my life to advocate for social justice and to
taking care of the lesser among us. That's why I am fighting to improve
healthcare, raise minimum wage, and to push for immigration reform,
among other important social
issues.
Final Push for the ACA:
Four years ago I was proud to stand
with my Democratic colleagues, behind President Barack Obama, as he
signed into law the historical Affordable Care Act, a bill I had
introduced and helped pass in the House. For working families, people with
disabilities, small business owners, and the middle class, the
Affordable Care Act is working. More than six million people nationwide have
selected a health plan through the health insurance marketplace,
including nearly 720,000 New Yorkers. As we approach the deadline to enroll
for 2014 benefits on March 31st, I encourage everybody to sign-up and
get covered ASAP.
Women's Federal
Minimum Wage:
I've worked hard to ensure a living wage for every
hard-working men and women in America. However, today, women still
earn an average of just 77 cents for every dollar men earn.
A new
report prepared by the National Economic Council, the Council of
Economic Advisers, the Domestic Policy Council, and the Department of Labor
shows that raising the federal minimum wage is key for Americas women
due to the fact they make up nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage
workers in this country. Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to
$10.10 per hour will be good for millions of Americas working women and
good for America. Now is the time to get it
done.
Immigration Reform:
With Republicans continuing to
block a vote on comprehensive immigration reform legislation, I took
action to force a vote signing a Demand A Vote petition. Republicans
must stop crushing the dreams of immigrants in pursuit of success.
Comprehensive immigration reform would help secure our border, protect
our workers, unite our families, provide an earned pathway to
citizenship, and create jobs. Comprehensive immigration reform has enjoyed
widespread support from law enforcement, faith leaders, the business
community and the American people. It's time for Speaker Boehner to stop
blocking this sensible bipartisan reform that will ensure a better
future for hard-working immigrant families and our
country.
