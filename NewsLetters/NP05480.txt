Dear Friend,
2O12 was a good year -- we re-elected a President, and Democrats gained seats in both the House and the Senate.
2O1O? Not so much -- Democrats lost nearly 63 seats in the House and 6 more in the Senate.
If you take the pollsters and the pundits at their word, we&rsquo;re heading for an election that will look more like 2O1O.
But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.
If we turn out our voters, we can keep the Senate. We can stop the GOP and their outside interest allies from gaining more control in Washington. But whether we can power the Get Out the Vote efforts to do that depends on the fundraising we do right now. Help power our efforts by getting us $5 closer to our $16O,OOO October goal. Make a contribution today.

Or donate another amount.
The history of the 2O14 election is still being written. It&rsquo;s being written by each and every one of you.
You were the difference-makers in 2O12, and you can be the difference-makers in 2O14, too. With so much on the line this year, none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines. Contribute $5 and help our GOTV team stay strong until the last polls close.
Thanks,
Ed
