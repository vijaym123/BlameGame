Opposing Defense Cuts in the
Republican Budget Proposal
3/17/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following statement in response to the
proposed Republican budget from Chairman Tom Price and the House Budget
Committee.
I appreciate
the hard work being done by Chairman Price on the budget committee, but
I am very concerned about the $20 billion dollar shadow cut to
defense spending included in his budget. Chairman Price has told those of us
on the Armed Services Committee that approximately $20 billion of the
proposed $94 billion in the Global War on Terrorism/OCO funding
relies on a deficit neutral reserve fund. In truth, that means that this
$20 billion is not real and that the Republican budget is $20 billion
below the Presidents budget on national security funding. I do not
want a budget that uses budgetary tricks to appear strong on national
defense, but is actually leaving our warfighters $20 billion short. I
hope that Chairman Price reconsiders and finds a way to make all of the
OCO funding real dollars.
