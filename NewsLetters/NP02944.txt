The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States says that, The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." This isnt optional, its Constitutional.
I will continue to work to defend the constitutionally protected rights of the American people, and stand in support of the Supreme Law of the Land.
Yours in service,
Randy
