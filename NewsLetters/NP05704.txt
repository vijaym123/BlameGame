URGENT: All Gifts Today Matched Today's ad buy deadline is the most critical of the election. This is our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
It's over. It's done.
We have no ideas left. After we got President Obama to email you this morning to ask for help, we really thought we'd be in a better place.
But Rove, Boehner, and other Republican outside groups started spending $1O,OOO,OOO against us TODAY. It's their biggest spending spree of the election. So big -- even President Obama's email didn't get us close enough to our goal before the major ad buy deadline tonight.
But, there is still time. So we're putting all of our hopes in you answering President Obama's call to action in the next 12 hours.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
Seriously, we're at the end of our rope here. You're our only hope. MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS
MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
