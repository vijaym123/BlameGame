Millions of Americans depend on Social Security. It&rsquo;s a successful program that&rsquo;s benefited us for 79 years. We must do all we can to protect it. Stand with Brad to urge Congress to protect Social Security:
David --
If the Tea Party gets its way, Social Security is in trouble.
For years, Social Security has proved to be a successful program for millions of Americans. In Illinois alone, over 2.2 million people depend on Social Security. Alarmingly, some Republicans want to weaken Social Security to score political points with their base. We can&rsquo;t let them win.
Brad&rsquo;s joining other leaders across the country to demand Congress do everything it can to protect Social Security. Will you join us? Please click here to sign your name to our petition demanding Congress protect Social Security &gt;&gt;
If we&rsquo;re going to send Congress a loud and clear message to protect Social Security, we need to reach 25,000 strong signing our petition. So please click this link to add your voice: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Protect-Social-Security
Thanks, David!
