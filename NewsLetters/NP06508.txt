Lee Chewey, BSRs vice president and director of training,
describes a training exercise.
Dear
Friends,
Today I brought U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte to the Summit Point
Motorsports Park in Jefferson County to learn how this West Virginia facility
is helping to keep American dignitaries safe overseas.
BSR,
a local security training company, works with federal agencies such as
the State Department to train federal personnel at Summit Point
Motorsports Park on accident avoidance and anti-terrorism
driving.
This West Virginia facility plays a key role in keeping
Americans safe while they work and travel overseas on federal business.
Federal personnel here are trained in accident avoidance, defensive
driving and anti-terrorism strategies, helping them defend against those
who would wish to harm American citizens abroad.
I asked Sen.
Ayotte to join me today to learn more about the valuable training
provided at this West Virginia facility, which is less than an hour and a
half from Washington, and I will continue to fight for the future of
this training program in West Virginia.
I would like to
thank Congresswoman Capito for inviting me to join her for todays tour
of the Summit Point facility. Anti-terrorism training helps protect
Americans serving in diplomatic roles abroad. As a member of two Senate
committees that oversee our foreign and domestic security, I believe
we must ensure that diplomatic security personnel have access to the
training they need to stay safe while serving overseas, said Sen.
Ayotte, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee.
