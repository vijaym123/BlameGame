Wisdom of the District: Prisoner Swap
Recently, American Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban since 2009, was returned to the United States in exchange for five Taliban prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay.
Law requires the President to notify Congress at least 30 days before the transfer or release of a Guantanamo detainee, however this did not occur due to concerns over Sgt. Bergdahls health and safety, according to the Administration.
With which statement below do you most agree?
( )
I support the Administrations actions. The most important consideration is the freedom and safety of an American POW.
( )
I do not support the Administrations actions primarily because the United States government should never negotiate with terrorists.
( )
I do not support the Administrations actions primarily because the trade of Taliban prisoners will hurt our national security.
( )
I do not support the Administrations actions primarily because the President acted outside of the law.
( )
I do not support the Administrations actions primarily because I have reservations about Sgt. Bergdahls service.
