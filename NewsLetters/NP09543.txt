South Korea and Georgia Working Together
Last week I sat down with U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Sung
Kim and Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States
Ho-Young Ahn.
The economic partnership between the United States and
South Korea is one of the strongest in the world
today and will continue to grow in
the coming years. Georgia is as large a beneficiary of that
relationship as any state in the nation, and our congressional district
is particularly involved.
Today, there are more than a dozen South Korean companies in the 7th
District, employing over 900 residents in our community.
Just this
past week, yet another South Korea-based company, Dasan Machineries
, chose our community
to start a new facility. This new partnership was announced as our
Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce members and leaders were abroad in
South Korea and engaged with business leaders there in discussions of
ways to further strengthen and enhance our economic ties.
The results
of these efforts are clear: trade between the State of Georgia and
Korea has increased from $382.4 million to $806.5 million over the last
seven years.
You can count on me to continue focusing on doing everything possible
both here and in Washington to expand the jobs and opportunities
available right here at home.
Community Leaders Working to Expand Home Ownership Opportunities
Last week I had the pleasure of speaking with a tremendous group of
professionals with the Atlanta Chapter of the National Association of
Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP) at their Business
Development Rally.
Though improving, the housing market has
undoubtedly gone through difficult times in recent years, and visiting
with industry professionals is a great opportunity to discuss practical
solution for problems facing local families and homeowners.
Many initiatives come out of Washington to protect and promote
homeownership, some of which help and some of which hurt.
We have all
seen the troubled balance sheet of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, the
largest holders of home mortgages, and we must make changes to those
programs.
We are making progress with reform legislation, and I am
grateful to have partners like NAHREP that will share their expertise
to help us produce better legislation for the American people.

Uplifting and Educational Visits with 7th District Students
I often tell you how encouraged and inspired I am by my meetings with
our young people.
With the school year coming to an end, I tried to
maximize that inspiration last week with visits to four different
schools in the 7th District: Otwell Middle School in Cumming,
Meadowcreek High School in Norcross, Hopkins Elementary in Lilburn, and
Crews Middle School in Lawrenceville. Thank you to the parents,
teachers, and administrators of each of those four schools for being
kind enough to host me.
If you have any doubt about the future of our
nation, you need only find a way to visit with these future leaders.
>From the 5th graders to the 8th graders to the seniors, these young
people and their dreams move me.
We are so lucky to have one of the
finest school districts in the state to serve our children.

Georgians Celebrate Our Nation's Military Academies
Another place that you can always find pride and inspiration is the
Georgia Congressional Delegation statewide Service Academy Day at
Dobbins Air Reserve Base
.
Held this past
Saturday, there were more than 1,000 folks there who were interested in
learning more about the academies and becoming future leaders of the
United States Armed Forces.
Those attending had a unique opportunity
to learn about the process and talk one on one with folks from each
service academy.
It is inspiring to see so many young folks willing to
devote their time and talents to serving their country.
Dobbins ARB is
always such a great host for this event, and I thank them for helping
to make Georgia Academy Day 2014 such a great success.
If you know a young person in our community who is interested in
military service, please encourage them to visit my website and
consider applying for an academy nomination.
The Week Ahead
This week, the House will consider the National Defense Authorization
Act.
This bill authorizes our nation's programs within
the U.S. Department of Defense, and it is traditionally one of the most
bipartisan bills that comes before Congress.
In fact, the bill was
unanimously approved by the House Armed Services Committee a few weeks
ago, and I hope that it will garner significant bipartisan support on
the House floor this week as well.
The House will also begin consideration of another appropriations bill
this week -- the FY15 Commerce, Justice, and Science bill
.
This bill provides funding for the Department of Commerce, the
Department of Justice, NASA, and the National Science Foundation.
In
keeping with our bipartisan theme this week, this bill was unanimously
approved by the House Appropriations Committee on May 8th.
All House
members are going to have ample opportunity to offer amendments to this
legislation, and I am confident that the American people's voices will
be heard.
Georgians Go to the Polls This Week
If you've been watching television, listening to the radio, or reading
your local paper, you've no doubt seen, heard, or read about Georgia's
primary election on Tuesday, May 20th.
Voting is not just our right as
Americans; it is our honor and our duty, and I hope that every voter
turns-out tomorrow to make their voice heard.
If you want to know who
is on your ballot or where you need to go to vote, please visit the
Georgia Secretary of State's on-line office
.

South
Korea
and
Georgia
Working
Together
Last
week
I
sat
down
with
U.S.
Ambassador
to
the
Republic
of
Korea
Sung
Kim
and
Ambassador
of
the
Republic
of
Korea
to
the
United

The
economic
partnership
between
the
United

and
South
Korea
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
world
today
and
will
continue
to
grow
in
the
coming
years. Georgia
is
as
large
a

of
that
relationship
as
any
state
in

nation,

there
are
more

a

I
often
tell
you
how
encouraged
and
inspired
I
am
by
my
meetings
with
our
young
people.
With
the
school
year
coming

an

I
tried
to
maximize
that
inspiration
last

with
visits
to
four

you
to
the
parents,

and
administrators
of
each
of
those
four
schools
for
being
kind
enough
to
host
me.
If
you
have
any
doubt
about
the
future
of
our
nation,
you
need
only
find
a
way
to
visit
with
these

From

these

move
me.

have
one

in
