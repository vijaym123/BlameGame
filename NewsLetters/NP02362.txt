7th DISTRICT
March 06, 2015
Dear Friend,
This was a bad
week for common sense in
Washington
&gt; The Senate voted to not override
the Presidents veto of the Keystone pipelineeven as more oil rail
cars explode.
Removing the Keystone pipeline from our national
energy strategy and keeping reliance on the Middle East, Nigeria and
Venezuela just does not make sense.
&gt; Congress voted for funding that will underwrite the Presidents action to
grant amnesty for nearly 5 million illegal aliens.
While I strongly
support funding Homeland Security, I did not and will not vote for
funding or polices that provide amnesty for illegal aliens.
To follow some of
my activities and work, please visit our 7th Congressional District
website at www.Mica.House.Gov, and follow my efforts on Facebook at
www.facebook.com/JohnMica.
With my
regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L.
Mica
