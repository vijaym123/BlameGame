In Case You Missed It
Yesterday, I introduced the Federal Employee Accountability Act, in order to address the misuse of official time, by federal employees. Official time is the practice by which federal employees are paid by taxpayers to perform duties not related to the mission of their agency and instead perform union-related activities. This practice, which began under the Carter Administration, is directly responsible for the federal government spending $157 million and 3.4 million man hours per year on activities that are often political in nature.
After examining the practices of over sixty government agencies, my office has found an astounding amount of government waste. By eliminating the official time practice, we will return over a billion dollars to hardworking American taxpayers, and shed this shady, wasteful practice that only benefits unions.
I spoke with John Roberts on FOX News Channel about this commonsense legislation. To watch the interview please view
