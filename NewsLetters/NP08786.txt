Dear
Friend,
Although
Fathers Day is a time to celebrate and rejoice with our loved ones,
American fatherhood continues to face significant challenges.
One out
of six American males is unemployed and government policy has
diminished the fathers role in our family structures.
Truly, these are
difficult times for many American dads.
By supporting
public policies that strengthen the family structure and promote individual
responsibility, we can reverse the diminishing role of fathers in our
country.
The importance of fatherhood cannot be ignored by our
society if we are to ensure a promising future for Americas next
generation.
Even though our nation and our families face
serious difficulties, I am optimistic about our future.
I believe that
people working together in good faith and with good intentions can
make a difference.
America has risen to the occasion in the past,
and I know that we can in the
future.
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
