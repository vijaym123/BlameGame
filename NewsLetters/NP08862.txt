Dear Friends,
This week, I joined Members of the House of Representatives in a moment of silence to acknowledge another tragedy at one of our schools. With the victims and their families in our hearts and minds, it is again clear that we must act to reduce gun violence.
On the House floor earlier today, I called on House Leadership to end their silence on measures to reduce gun violence. Across the country, 92 percent of Americans support universal background checks. No matter where each Member stands on the issue, it is the responsibility of the people&rsquo;s House to cast a vote.

I remain committed to working with members on both sides of the aisle to reduce gun violence and continue to call on Congress to act. As I said today, the American people deserve a vote.
Sincerely,
