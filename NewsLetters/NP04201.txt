Dear David,
I have so much to be thankful for this year, including the opportunity to continue serving the hardworking people of Illinois&rsquo; 17th Congressional District. This would not have been possible without your strong support over the last two years, and from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
My family and I wish you a very happy Thanksgiving full of good food, football and, most importantly, family and friends.
I look forward to staying in touch with you and your family in 2015 as we continue working to prioritize the middle class and bring Midwestern common sense to Washington.
Kindest Personal Regards,
Cheri
