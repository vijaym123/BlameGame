Giving
Thanks to Our Men and Women in
Uniform
Dear Friend,
As we observe Memorial Day, we remember
with gratitude all of those brave men and
women who have sacrificed their lives while
defending our great nation. To all of those
who are and have been members of our armed
forces
thank you for all that you
have given up in the name of American
liberty.
Throughout American history, our
soldiers have courageously fought to
preserve our freedoms, and for that, we
will be forever grateful. Their sacrifice,
and the sacrifice of millions of others,
has allowed us to enjoy this way of life
which we often take for granted. With these
sacrifices in mind, our thoughts and
prayers are with all of those who have
served or are serving our nation and their
families.
I recently had the opportunity to visit
with
a
group of veterans
sponsored by
Danvilles Blessed Hope Church who
made a trip to Washington, and it was an
honor to be with them as they came to visit
the monuments that pay tribute to their
invaluable service. These men and women who
stood ready to lay down their lives for our
country have earned not only our utmost
respect but also the benefits and medical
service they so deserve from the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Unfortunately, we have recently learned
that the VA has provided service to our
veterans that has fallen woefully short. To
help address this issue, last week the
House of Representatives passed
the
Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act
by a bipartisan
majority of 390-33. This important
legislation allows for easier removal of
ineffective senior level officials at the
VA that are contributing to the
mismanagement within the agency.
It is my sincere hope that this bill
will serve as an important step toward
greater care for our veterans by holding
the VA accountable for its actions and
initiating desperately needed reforms. I
remain committed to working with my
colleagues to immediately implement real
reforms to the VA health system that will
end the egregious backlog of VA claims and
provide veterans with the service and
benefits they have earned.
It is an honor to represent so many
veterans and active duty soldiers in
Virginias Fifth District. I join
with the rest of the Fifth District in
honoring the fallen, and we are eternally
grateful for our service members who have
served and continue to serve this great
nation.
