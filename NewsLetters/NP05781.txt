Dear Friend,
Providing the best services possible to
my constituency is one of my top
priorities. As a member of the Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Social Security, I
want to make sure that the people of
Ohios 16
th
District have access to all
of the information they need when it comes
to their benefits. Since we frequently hear
from constituents who have questions
regarding Social Security benefits, we
arranged a Social Security Resource Fair
that will be held this
Thursday, October 9
th
from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00
a.m.
We will have representatives from
the Social Security Administration and our
office on hand to answer questions. I
encourage anyone who may have difficulty
navigating their benefits to attend. The
event is free and open to those at or near
retirement age.

Fair
