Protecting
Americans Health and Safety
Requires More Action
Dear Friend,
Over the past several weeks, our office
has received numerous calls and emails from
constituents who are concerned about the
growing threat of the spread of Ebola in
the United States and abroad. They are
concerned not only because of the
seriousness of the disease and how easily
it can spread, but also with the failure of
the agencies responsible for maintaining
the public health to take the proactive
steps needed to prepare for a domestic case
of the disease. I share my
constituents concerns and
frustrations and hope that additional
action will be taken to contain the
disease, prevent further incidences, and
reestablish the publics confidence
in these agencies ability to keep us
safe.
The House has been engaged on the
dangers of Ebola since August, holding more
than a dozen oversight hearings to assess
the situation and the federal response.
This past week, the Energy and Commerce
Committee held a key hearing at which
officials from the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC), National Institutes of
Health (NIH), and other federal agencies
involved in the response testified about
what they are doing to prevent the spread
of Ebola. It is clear that these agencies
could have been more proactive earlier on
in the process to prepare hospitals and
healthcare workers, as well as transit and
transportation systems, on the protocols
needed to contain any cases of the
disease.
While I appreciate that these agencies
are working to combat this threat and have
taken positive steps like enhancing
screening measures at international
airports and increasing training for
hospitals and medical personnel, more needs
to be done to ensure the safety of our
citizens. We need to evaluate and implement
additional tactics, including a temporary
ban for travelers from affected West
African countries, stronger quarantining
practices, and fast-track review of
potential treatments for Ebola.
These officials also have a
responsibility to keep the American people
properly informed about the situation. They
should not withhold information for fear of
inciting panic. The American
people know they must remain calm and
rational about the disease, but they also
want to be informed and vigilant so they
can do their part in ensuring the disease
is contained.
Here in Virginia, I am pleased that our
public health officials and hospitals and
medical personnel
are
taking action to be prepared
and help
mitigate this situation. Medical
professionals in the Commonwealth are also
educating
the public about the disease , and
researchers
at the University of Virginia
have been
instrumental in unlocking new discoveries
about the virus as they work toward a cure.
I am committed to working closely with
local, state, and federal partners to
ensure the government is doing what is
needed to fulfill its core responsibility
to keep the public safe.
