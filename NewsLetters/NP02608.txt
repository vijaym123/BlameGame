Dear Friends,
Nominating distinguished young Idahoans to our
nations service academies is one of the most rewarding parts of my
job. This week, I hosted a reception for the Idaho Congressional
Delegations academy nominees for 2015.
I was joined by Sen. Mike
Crapo and Sen. Jim Risch, along with families and friends of 22
nominees who attended Mondays event at Meridian City Hall.
These
extraordinary young men and women met exacting requirements to earn
their nominations and I am happy to congratulate them all. Each of them
deserves our support and respect.
In total, I nominated 34
candidates to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the Air
Force, Naval, and Merchant Marine academies. They now await word from the
academies, which are among the most selective colleges in the
country.
I hope you enjoy the photo of the nominees. They make
their families, communities and Idaho proud.
Thank
you ,
