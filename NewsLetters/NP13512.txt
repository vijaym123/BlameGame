Dear Friend,
This week was a district work week, so I have been traveling around
District 4 hosting events and speaking with Arizonans about all the hot
issues. Everywhere I go, the people of District 4 tell me how concerned
they are about the unsustainable spending and crippling debt on the
federal level and the disaster that is ObamaCare.
But they also tell me how hopeful they are for our country's future.
Like many of my constituents, I know that if we can get the right
leaders in Washington - people who are willing to cut spending and set
our businesses free - the future of this country will be bright.
Straight Talk
On Monday, I spoke to the Arizona Republican Lawyers Association. I
told them that, since the federal government cannot create jobs and can
only take away wealth, it needs to get out of the way and let our
businesses lead us out of our current economic problems. I also told
them that for politicians to continue to spend without doing anything
about it is BS.
(Rep. Gosar speaking to the Arizona Republican Lawyers Association,
December 16, 2013)
Welcome to the American Family
On Tuesday, I was the keynote speaker at a naturalization ceremony in
Yuma during which 26 people became citizens of the United States. I
congratulate those 26 people for immigrating legally and I am proud to
call them my fellow Americans.

to
read my official statement about the event.
I am a strong supporter of legal immigration. Our country was built by
immigrants who came here because America offered them the opportunity
to fulfill their dreams. America's greatness depends on our ability to
attract the brightest minds from across the globe.
I will continue to pursue immigration reform to address the challenges
faced within the current broken system. We cannot allow those who broke
the law to skip in front of those who have waited and are waiting to
comply with existing laws.

Listening to You
This week I held three Coffee with the Congressman events, one in
Buckeye, one in Lake Havasu City and the other in Bullhead City. I
particularly enjoy this type of event because I get to hear directly
from you, my constituents, about the issues you care about and your
opinions on those issues. This week I heard about many topics, but
ObamaCare and the federal debt were, by far, the most common.
(Rep. Gosar hearing from constituents in Bullhead City, December 19,
2013)
Meeting with Local Business Owners
I also held three events with local business owners this week in
Parker, Lake Havasu City and Bullhead City. These events give me the
opportunity to discuss with business owners how federal policies affect
their businesses. These folks were especially interested in discussing
the impacts ObamaCare, the Ryan budget deal and tax reform.
(Rep. Gosar talking about the federal budget at a business roundtable
in Lake Havasu City, December 18, 2013)
Preserving a Symbol of Our Freedom
I took an aerial tour of bald eagle nest sites on Friday. The Arizona
Game & Fish Department took me around to different nest sites so that I
could get an idea of how this endangered species is doing. It is
important that we continue to preserve this symbol of American freedom
for future generations.
(Rep. Gosar over the Verde River near Bartlett Dam, December 20, 2013)
ObamaCare Malady of the Week

health insurance premiums will be going up. The same poll also found

increasing. Click HERE

Did You Know?
Tonto Natural Bridge, located between Payson and Pine, is the largest
travertine natural bridge in the world. In the late 1800s, a prospector
and his family claimed squatter's rights over the bridge and
surrounding property but it is now an Arizona State Park.

Dear

I
have
been traveling

District

the

federal
level
and
the
disaster
that
is
ObamaCare.
But
they
also
tell
me
how
hopeful
they
are
for our
country's
future. Like
many
of
my
constituents,
I
know
that if
we

&#8211;
people who

it needs
