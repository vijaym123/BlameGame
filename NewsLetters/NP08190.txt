David,
Our infrastructure is in dire need of repair. You, I am sure, are no stranger to the difficulties Metro-North has presented local commuters in the past months. From two catastrophic failures at Walk Bridge, to endless delays on our highways&mdash;enough is enough.
Today, I&rsquo;m meeting with the Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, to discuss the looming expiration of the Highway Trust Fund and the need for Congress to pass a long-term measure that makes the investments we need in our nations infrastructure. The Highway Trust Fund is our main source of funding for critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and highways, and it's going to run out of money soon unless we act.
This crisis will affect Connecticut: if Congress cannot pass a funding solution by early October, ConnDOT may have to scale back certain projects. Among these would be re-building work on the New Haven Line, and critical highway repairs.
So here&rsquo;s what I want you to do: tell me if you experience commuter problems over this holiday weekend.
Download the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck&rdquo; app, input your information, and the app will send me an email if you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or on public transportation this weekend:

Building America&rsquo;s Future and the U.S. Travel Association partnered to build the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Stuck&rdquo; app, which will empower millions of American travelers dealing with travel delays and frustrations.
I&rsquo;ll be honest: there&rsquo;s not much I can do if you&rsquo;re stuck over the weekend. But if you tell me about it&mdash;if you send me messages&mdash;I can bring those messages to my colleagues here in the Senate and urge them to help renew the HTF so we don&rsquo;t continue to witness the crumbling of our nations infrastructure. This affects all of us.
Thanks, and have a happy &amp; safe Fourth of July,
