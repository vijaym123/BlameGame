Dear Friends:
In the first 100 days of the new Congress, we've worked hard to return
the Senate to regular order and get Congress working again. In just 100
days, the Senate has passed important legislation for our state and
nation, including my bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline
, a responsible
budget
that supports North Dakota's
priorities and legislation to provide important mental health services
for our veterans
Earlier this week, the Senate approved another important bipartisan
bill to help victims of human trafficking and the law enforcement
officials who work to stop these heinous crimes. I was proud to be an
original cosponsor of this legislation
and
also proud that it included my amendment to the bill that ensures North
Dakota receives fair treatment when competing for human trafficking
prevention grants.
Fortunately, this year's weather forecast does not predict heavy
flooding, but we are continuing my efforts to ensure that North
Dakotans have an affordable way to protect themselves from future
floods. We held a productive roundtable in Fargo with Roy Wright
, the administrator for mitigation with the Federal Emergency
Management Administration (FEMA), to ensure that FEMA's flood maps
accurately show how Fargo's permanent flood control project protects
homes in the flood plain. That's important, because good flood control
should help lower flood insurance rates for homeowners and businesses.
In closing, I want to congratulate the UND Men's Hockey team, who
finished off a spectacular year with an appearance in the Frozen Four.
It was their seventh appearance in eleven years, and we will be rooting
for them to make it again next year!
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

Enhancing Community Safety in Enderlin
Senator Brings Community and Rail Officials Together
Canadian Pacific Commits to Keeping Crossings Clear
ENDERLIN, N.D. - Senator John Hoeven met with officials from the city
of Enderlin and Canadian Pacific Railway. As a result of the meeting,
Canadian Pacific committed to modifying its operations so that trains
will not block a key thoroughfare through the city.
"When time is of the essence, ambulances and fire engines need to
respond as quickly as possible. The officials from Canadian Pacific saw
that detours around parked trains were not just an inconvenience, but
created a safety issue for residents. We appreciate that Canadian
Pacific recognized this need for safety and have agreed to address it."

Strengthening Medicare
Senate Passes Bill to Give Physicians More Certainty, Improve Care
Bill Also Reauthorizes Children's Health Insurance Program
WASHINGTON - Senator John Hoeven joined 91 other senators to pass the
Medicare Access and Chip Reauthorization Act.
"The bipartisan legislation the Senate passed affirms our commitment to
our seniors, our children and our health-care professionals. North
Dakota's seniors will continue to have access to reliable, high-quality
healthcare services, and health-care professionals won't face the
year-to-year uncertainty of rate reductions. At the same time, this
bill changes how we compensate our health-care professionals. Instead
of a fee-for-service system that pays regardless of outcomes, we will
transition to an incentive-based system that rewards providers for
quality of services." Click here to read more

Dear
Friends:
In
the
first
100
days
of
the
new
Congress,
we&#8217;ve
worked
hard
to
return
the
Senate
to
regular
order
and
get
Congress
working
again.
In
just
100
days,
the
Senate
has
passed
important
legislation
for
our
state
and
nation,
including
my
bill
to
approve
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline ,
a
responsible
budget
that
supports
North
Dakota&#8217;s
priorities
and
legislation
to
provide
important
mental
health
services
for
our
veterans .
Earlier
this
week,
the
Senate
approved
another
important
bipartisan
bill
to
help
victims
of
human
trafficking
and
the
law
enforcement
officials
who
work
to
stop
these
heinous
crimes.
I
was
proud
to
be
an
original
cosponsor
of
this
legislation
and
also
proud
that
it
included
my
amendment
to
the
bill
that
ensures
North

fair

competing

Fortunately,
this

but
we
are
continuing
my

accurately
show
how
Fargo&#8217;s

That's
important,
because
good
flood
control
should
help
lower
flood
insurance
rates
for
homeowners
and
businesses.
In

I
want
to
congratulate
the
UND

who
finished
off
a
