Dear Friend,
Each month, I record a video address
that recaps what we've been working on the
previous month. Video and text of May's
Monthly Video Address are available below.
You may view the video by clicking the

Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address for the month of May.
Today, I am at the Fauquier
Veterans Memorial in Warrenton, Virginia.
This beautiful memorial is dedicated
to the sons and daughters of Fauquier
County who served their country in the
United States Armed Forces, and it
bears the names of 159 Fauquier County
natives who have died for our country
dating back to World War I. It serves as a
reminder that across our country we often
find that our neighbors are our greatest
heroes - brave men and women who serve
selflessly so that we may continue to live
in the most free and prosperous nation on
earth.
Over the Memorial Day weekend, I
had the privilege of speaking at Memorial
Day ceremonies in
Danville
and
Martinsville .
In addition, I spent the rest of the week
meeting
with many veterans and active duty
members
of our armed services from
Henry County to Brunswick County and from
Fauquier County to Danville. It was an
excellent opportunity to thank these great
Americans for their service and to learn
how we can best serve those who have served
us.
In fact, during the month of May,
the House of Representatives passed seven
bipartisan bills that would help ensure
that our veterans receive the care they
have earned. While these bills are vital
steps to meaningfully and structurally
reforming the care our veterans receive,
they are not enough. I look forward to
continuing to do everything within our
power to restore a culture of duty and
service at the Veterans Administration and
to provide a level of care and service
worthy of the tremendous sacrifice our
veterans have made for the cause of
freedom.
In addition to the week we spent
with our veterans, we also spent
the
first week of May touring the Fifth
District
and meeting with a variety of
our farmers, our future farmers, and the
many folks that depend on them for their
business.
Agriculture
is the backbone of our economy
in
Virginia, and hearing directly from our
agricultural producers and their customers
is essential to making government more
responsive to the needs of this vital
industry.
Finally, back in Washington, the
House of Representatives continued its work
to find bipartisan common-sense ways to
reduce unnecessary and excessive regulatory
burdens for our Main Street businesses. In
fact, the Financial Services Committee
approved
two bipartisan bills
I introduced to
streamline regulations at the Securities
and Exchange Commission with the hope of
helping to promote job creation across the
Fifth District and our nation.
The
Small Company Disclosure Simplification
Act
is a common-sense proposal that
would streamline the filing requirements
for smaller public companies. Our second
bill,
the
Streamlining Excessive and Costly
Regulations Review Act,
is likewise a
bipartisan and common-sense measure that
would require the SEC to comprehensively
review and streamline its regulations every
ten years
a process that other
financial regulatory bodies already
perform. It is my hope that both of these
bipartisan bills will be passed in the
House and the Senate and signed into law by
the President.
As we close, I hope you will join
me in thanking all of those brave men and
women who have defended and continue to
defend our great nation. As your
representative, I encourage our veterans
and our active-duty members of the armed
services to
contact
our office
if we may ever be of
assistance in dealing with the Veterans
Administration or any other federal
agency.
Likewise, if we may ever be of
service to any of our constituents in any
other way, please contact us at
one
of our district offices or at our
Washington office . We can always be
reached at our website at
hurt.house.gov
-- where you can also sign up for regular
legislative updates. And don't forget to
join the conversation on our social media
pages.
Once again, thank you for tuning
in to our monthly video address.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
