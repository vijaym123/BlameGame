News and Media
Friends,
Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter.
I appreciate you keeping the
lines of communication open for me to share news from Washington and
South Carolina, and I value hearing your views as well.
Greater Opportunities for Students
I strongly believe that giving parents the power to choose the best
educational path for their kids is a cornerstone of success and
prosperity.
This week, I joined
Senator Lamar Alexander at the American Enterprise Institute to discuss
the importance of school choice. I also talked about my bill, the
CHOICE Act, which will specifically help kids with special needs by
ensuring they have the ability to attend the school that best suits
them. It also provides greater choice for military families and
enhances an extremely successful school choice program already underway
in our nation's capital.
Putting People Back to Work
The easiest way to put people back to work is to make sure they're able
to compete for the jobs that are already available.
Unfortunately, our
workforce training and development programs currently fall short in
equipping workers to fill jobs that are already available. To this end,
I've introduced the SKILLS Act, which will make training more
responsive to jobs that need to be filled right away and cut down on
waste and duplicative spending by the federal government.
In his State of the Union Address, President Obama called for a
significant focus on workforce training. I believe we can find common
ground
on this issue and I've called on him and
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to support an up-or-down vote on the
SKILLS Act.
Honoring Our Past and Celebrating Our Future
Next month, I'll be hosting a historic discussion titled,"Honoring Our
Past and Celebrating Our Future: Discussing Personal Journeys and a
Nation's Progress with America's Black Senators."
I'm proud to be joined by Senator Cory Booker and former Senators Carol
Moseley Braun, Roland Burris, and Mo Cowan to discuss this important
topic. If you're in the DC area and want to join us on February 25 at
9:30 a.m. at the Library of Congress, please email
RSVP@scott.senate.gov.
It's an honor to serve you in the United States Senate. As always,
please contact my offices if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

Friends,
Thanks
for

I

Greater

I

Putting

The

to
