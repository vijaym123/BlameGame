Snow has begun falling in what is forecasted to be a rare winter storm hitting our region.
Make sure to charge cell phones, make note of elderly or disabled neighbors to check on during this storm, and consider the following information:
70% of injuries due to ice and snow result from vehicle accidents .
Stay off roads and monitor road conditions: Dial 511 or
www.511virginia.org
Frozen pipes occur most frequently in areas with temperate climates where pipes are more likely to be exposed or under insulated.
Running water, even at a trickle, helps prevent pipes from freezing.

Bring pets inside, if possible, and move other animals to sheltered areas with access to non-frozen drinking water.

Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart.
If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, follow your doctors advice about shoveling snow or performing other hard work in the cold.
