Dear David,
Earlier this week, I was proud to announce that the
Rochester Institute of Technology has been selected as a partner in our
nation's first-ever Digital Manufacturing and Design Institute. In October
of last year, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense and
urged him to consider the unique strengths of RIT
when forming
the institute, and I am thrilled that work will soon begin in our
community.
The Digital Manufacturing and Design
Institute was formed to ensure that the manufacturing jobs of the future
are created in the United States. As part of the institute,
researchers at RIT will receive up to $20 million to help our nation master the
complex organizational and technological challenges of digital
manufacturing and design, and begin developing products to be sold around the
world. In so doing, it is expected that this institute will create
75,000 jobs across the country over the next 5 years.
In order to create jobs and grow our economy, it is vital that we
rebuild the manufactuing industry in our region. This week's announcement
is an important step forward in our efforts. I look forward to seeing
RIT's innovations, and I will continue working with our universities
and businesses to create advanced manufacturing jobs right here at
home.
P.S. Do you know an engineer of the future?
I am currently inviting all high school students in the 25th
District to participate the first annual Congressional STEM App Challenge.
I am seeking your best software application design for mobile, tablet
or desktop computer.
