Connecting Job Seekers with Employers in New Hampshire
Hi All!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend. I spent last week in New
Hampshire, working to match Granite State businesses with qualified
workers and advocating for women leaders in the business community.
At the Career and Opportunities Fair in Concord
My Second Career and Opportunities Fair!
Last Thursday, I hosted my second Career and Opportunities Fair to help
connect local residents with jobs and employment opportunities
throughout the Granite State. The fair drew nearly 300 job seekers to
the Holiday Inn in Concord, where they met with representatives from
more than 30 employers and service agencies with over 1,000 job
openings.
>From day one, my top priority has been to create jobs and better
opportunity for middle class families across the Granite State. That's
what the Career and Opportunities Fair was all about - connecting local
job seekers with a wide variety of New Hampshire employers who are
looking to expand their businesses, hire new workers, and grow the
economy. I was proud to host Thursday's event, and look forward to
holding additional job fairs in the months ahead.
At the roundtable in Keene
Discussing Workforce Development in the Monadnock Region
On Wednesday, I convened a diverse group of business owners, workers,
and education leaders for a roundtable discussion in Keene focused on
local efforts to train and secure a highly-skilled, 21st Century
workforce in the Granite State. During the roundtable, I heard directly
from local stakeholders who are working to ensure that Granite Staters
have the skills they need to compete for and win well-paying, middle
class jobs. I also discussed my Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity
Agenda
, which
proposes a series of bipartisan, common sense steps Congress can take
to strengthen workforce development, create jobs, and grow the economy.
To keep the New Hampshire economy growing, we must invest in a 21st
Century workforce. In Keene, business owners and education leaders are
working together to develop new, innovative ways to build our
workforce. I was thrilled to host this roundtable to hear about the
great work being done in Keene and all across New Hampshire to prepare
our workers for the jobs of tomorrow (Read more about the roundtable
here
).
At the roundtable in Salem
Meeting With Women Business Leaders in Salem
Last Tuesday, I discussed the need to better support New Hampshire's
women business leaders during a roundtable discussion on Southern New
Hampshire University's Salem campus. During the discussion, I joined
with local women business owners and leaders calling for the
elimination of the gender pay gap, increased access to capital, and
better representation in corporate leadership for women.
Investing in the future of our women entrepreneurs is not only the
right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. Ensuring that
women business leaders have the support they need throughout their
careers means more jobs for New Hampshire residents and faster economic
growth. It's time we recognize the vital role women play in our economy
(Read more about the event here

Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Connecting
Job
Seekers
with
Employers
in
New
Hampshire
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend. I
spent
last
week
in
New
Hampshire,
working
to
match
Granite
State
businesses
with
qualified
workers
and
advocating
for
women
leaders
in
the
business
community.
At
the
Career
and
Opportunities
Fair
in
Concord My
Second
Career
and
Opportunities
Fair!
Last
Thursday,
I
hosted
my
second
Career
and
Opportunities
Fair
to
help
connect
local
residents
with
jobs
and
employment
opportunities
throughout
the
Granite
State. The
fair
drew
nearly
300
job
seekers
to
the
Holiday
Inn
in
Concord,
where
they
met
with
representatives
from
more
than
30
employers
and
service
agencies
with
over
1,000
job
openings.
From
day
one,
my
top
priority
has
been
to
create
jobs
and
better
opportunity
for
middle
class
families
across
the
Granite
State. That&#8217;s
what
the
Career
and
Opportunities
Fair
was
all
about
&#8211;
connecting
local
job
seekers
with
a
wide
variety
of
New
Hampshire
employers
who
are
looking
to
expand
their
businesses,
hire
new
workers,
and
grow
the
economy. I
was
proud
to
host
Thursday&#8217;s
event,
and
look
forward
to
holding
additional
job
fairs
in
the
months
ahead.

To

we
must
invest

Keene,
business

are
working

to
develop
new,

was

host
this
roundtable
to
hear
about
the
great

being

in
Keene
and
all
across
New
Hampshire
to
prepare
our
workers
for
the
jobs
of
tomorrow

At
the
roundtable
in
Salem Meeting
With
Women
Business

in
Salem
Last
Tuesday,
I
discussed
the
need
to
better

New

during
a

on

for
the
elimination
of
the
gender
pay
gap,
increased
access
to
capital,
and
better
representation
in
corporate
leadership
for
women.
Investing
in
the
future
of
our
women
entrepreneurs is
not
only
the
right
thing
to
do,
it
also
makes
good
business
sense. Ensuring
that
women
business
leaders
have
the
support
they
need
throughout
their
careers
means
more
jobs
for
New

residents and faster
economic
growth. It&#8217;s
time
we
recognize
the
vital
role
women
play
in
our
economy

Have
a
fantastic
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you

make

to
live!
