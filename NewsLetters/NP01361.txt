Friend
Recently, I joined my Virginia colleagues in
sending a letter
to the Hampton Veterans Affairs Medical Center demanding decisive action to address the unacceptable claims backlog. Specifically, we are requesting to know the immediate steps being taken to bring down wait times to the Departments standards
including a detailed explanation of what is being done to increase responsiveness to patient inquiries and the timetable for resolving the backlog.
As the Congressional delegation representing nearly 368,000 veterans, we have an obligation to ensure our men and women in uniform are receiving the benefits they have earned in a timely manner. Our veterans did not wait to answer the call of duty; they should not have to wait to receive timely, quality medical care. They deserve the best this country can offer
not backlogs, bureaucracy, and blunders.
There is no higher purpose of our government than to protect those who sacrificed to preserve our freedom. Read the text of the letter,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I will keep you posted as we look for a reply from the VA. We made a promise to care for our men and women in uniform, and their families, long after their service is complete, and it is our duty to meet those obligations.
