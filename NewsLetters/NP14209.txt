November 19, 2013
Today marks the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln delivering
the historic Gettysburg Address to mark the dedication of Soldiers'
National Cemetery. This historic address is as sacred to Americans as
the Declaration of Independence or the Star-Spangled Banner. Like those
other great American texts, the Gettysburg Address delivers a message
of hope for the endurance of the uniquely American dream of a
government truly of the people, by the people, and for the people.
There exists no definitive edition of the speech President
Abraham Lincoln gave to dedicate a cemetery at the Civil War
battlefield. Scholars still debate which of four versions the President
actually delivered on November 19, 1863. In honor of the 150th
anniversary of the speech, I decided to recite the version of the
address scholars mostly agree President Lincoln delivered on that day.
I will be submitting this video to documentarian Ken Burns' project to
educate Americans about the importance of the Gettysburg Address. To
see others, including all five living Presidents, recite the address
please visit the Learn the Address
project.
