Praying for Charleston
The horror that occurred at Mother Emanuel Wednesday night has truly
devastated our community. Emanuel AME means so much to so many, and we
stand by them today as they mourn the loss of their leader and brothers
and sisters in Christ.
Pastor Pinckney was a good man, an honest man and a wonderful
representative for his congregation. I will continue to stand in prayer
with Pastor Pinckney's congregation, the families who are enduring
unimaginable pain, and the people of Charleston.
We will forever remember those we lost:
Reverend Clementa Pinckney,
Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Myra
Thompson, Ethel Lance, Rev. Daniel L. Simmons, Susie Jackson, and
DePayne Doctor.
As people of all ages and races continue to visit Mother Emanuel night
and day to mourn our loss, we see our community standing together,
beginning to come to terms with what has happened, and starting the
healing process.
While we unfortunately know that hate enters some people's hearts, I
also know this: we can and will work every single day to replace hate
with love, pain with kindness, and hostility with good will.
God Bless.
Sincerely,
Tim

Praying
for
Charleston
The
horror
that
occurred
at
Mother
Emanuel
Wednesday
night
has
truly
devastated
our
community.
Emanuel
AME
means
so
much
to
so
many,
and
we
stand
by
them
today
as
they
mourn
the
loss
of
their
leader
and
brothers
and
sisters
in
Christ.
Pastor
Pinckney
was
a
good
man,
an
honest
man
and
a
wonderful
representative
for
his
congregation. I
will
continue
to
stand
in
prayer
with
Pastor
Pinckney's
congregation,
the
families
who
are
enduring
unimaginable
pain,
and
the
people
of
Charleston.
We
will
forever
remember
those
we
lost:
Reverend
Clementa
Pinckney,
Sharonda
Coleman-Singleton,
Cynthia
Hurd,
Tywanza
Sanders,
Myra
Thompson,
Ethel
Lance,
Rev.
Daniel
L.
Simmons,
Susie
Jackson,
and
DePayne
Doctor.
As
people
of
all
ages
and
races
continue
to
visit
Mother
Emanuel
night
and
day
to
mourn
our
loss,
we
see
our
community
standing
together,
beginning
to
come
to
terms
with
what
has
happened,
and
starting
the
healing
process.
While
we
unfortunately
know
that
hate
enters
some
people's
hearts,
I
also
know
this:
we
can
and
will
work
every
single
day
to
replace
hate
with
love,
pain
with
kindness,
and
hostility
with
good
will.
God
Bless.
