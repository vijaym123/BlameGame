Dear Friend-
On Tuesday, I held my first committee hearing as chair of the Senate Energy Committee on how energy exports will create thousands of high-paying jobs here at home and assist our allies abroad.
The hearing, focused on increasing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, something we know about in Louisiana thanks to our three LNG facilities.
Watch my opening statement as Chair of the Energy Committee hearing here:
A recent LSU report estimates that approximately $47 billion of private sector investment will be made in new and existing plants and projects in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jefferson Davis Parishes to increase energy production between 2012 and 2018.
That investment is expected to create more than 37,000 new high-paying jobs.
Not only will this be a domestic asset, but this will also support our allies across the world, particularly in light of Russia's illegal aggression in Ukraine.
Last week, Russia sanctioned nine U.S. officials-including me. This has only encouraged me to redouble my efforts to increase domestic energy production here in the United States and promote our country as an energy superpower. We all know real competition in open markets drives efficiency and lowers prices for everyone.
The last thing Putin and his cronies wants is competition from the United States of America in the energy race. I look forward to playing a role to bring energy security and independence to America and it democratic allies around the world.
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
