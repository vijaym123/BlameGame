Dear Friend, The Republicans said they&rsquo;d do everything they could to bring the misguided Keystone XL pipeline to life, and on Thursday, they made their move.
Of course, they had to break their pledge for an open process, but one month into the new Congress, we know how the Republican majority plans to operate. They&rsquo;re going to play fast and they&rsquo;re going to force us to defend the progressive priorities we know our country needs. Keystone XL is just the first of the bad policies the new Republican Senate is going to push. We need to fight back, and you can help by pitching in $5.

I attempted to offer an amendment on the Keystone XL pipeline, and was told that I could not speak. That flew in the face of Senator McConnell&rsquo;s assurances that we&rsquo;d have an open process -- but the real pain is going to be felt far from the Senate floor.
The Keystone XL pipeline will funnel a dirty, dangerous fossil fuel through our nation&rsquo;s heartland. It will do nothing to lower energy prices for American consumers, it will do nothing to grow jobs for American families, but it will do a lot to enrich oil tycoons including the Koch brothers -- they have the rights to more than 1 million acres in the Alberta oil sands region. We may have lost this vote, but there are more fights coming our way. We need to be ready -- give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford to help us stand strong.
Thanks.
