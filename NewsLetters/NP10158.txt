Friends,
You likely have seen disturbing news reports about the treatment of America's heroes - our veterans - who, for years, have been stuck in a long backlog waiting to use their health care benefits.
This is a shameful breach of our moral and legal obligation to our veterans.
To help right these wrongs, the House passed a key bill this week that will implement solutions for the disability claims backlog, increase oversight and improve benefits that veterans and their families have earned in the service of our country.
To end the backlog in 2015, the bill provides funding for paperless claims systems and modernization of the VA electronic health record system. New funding is restricted until the VA and Defense Department demonstrate progress on these updates. This accountability means we aren't throwing money at a problem, we're actually fixing it.
The bill increases oversight of taxpayer dollars and maintains strict reporting requirements in order to track the performance of regional VA offices.
We also amended the legislation to prevent the Veterans Affairs secretary from issuing bonuses to senior executives.
Thank you to the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country. You deserve the best care and benefits available.
With continued hard work, accountability and innovation, we can fix the VA mess and prove to our veterans and their families that we are a grateful nation.
Freedom First,
