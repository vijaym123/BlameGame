Dear Friend,
Last week in Washington, a very important step was taken for our
nation's veterans. By a strong, bipartisan vote of 326 to 90, the House
voted to restore full Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) benefits to
working-age military retirees. I am pleased that we have come together in a
timely manner to find a solution to this issue. This is an issue I
have been working hard to get fixed, so I was happy to be first in line
to cast my vote. It is important that our country keeps its promises to
those who have served. This is a real win for our veterans.
Veterans also deserve better
medical care. That is why I've co-sponsored the VA Management
Accountability Act of 2014. This legislation will make it easier for the VA
Secretary to fire, demote, or reassign executives and hospital directors
who are not meeting standards and expectations. With over 8 million
patients, better performance is crucial for the VA. By introducing
accountability into the equation, this legislation will lead to better
care and more efficient health care outcomes for our veterans.
Also last
week, I opposed the legislation raising our nation's debt ceiling. Any
increase in our national debt must be tied to spending reforms and
deficit reductions. We cannot keep marching down the same path that adds
to the debt burden of our children and grandchildren.
It is an honor
to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's
Happening in Washington
DC?
On Monday, February 10th, President
Obama once more bypassed Congress and made a unilateral decision to
delay portions of Obamacare. This Swiss cheese approach is an admission
of failure that creates further turmoil and confusion in the private
sector. It is time to completely repeal and replace Obamacare with
patient-centered reforms that work for all Americans. Please click
HERE
for more information.
As mentioned above, I signed on last week as a
co-sponsor for the VA Management Accountability Act. To find out more
information on this important piece of legislation, please click

On Tuesday, February 11th, the House
Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations released a
comprehensive report evaluating the response of the Department of
Defense to the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. I took part in the
recently declassified hearings investigating this heinous attack on our
nation. We uncovered troubling information about our military posture
and readiness on September 11th, 2012. To view this important report,

Last week, I took part in a House Armed Services
Committee hearing on our
Security Policy and Defense Posture in the
Middle East . I was able to question administration witnesses on
Iranian nuclear capabilities. Regional allies tell us Iran could develop in
two months, the administration says a year.

Recently at the United States Air Force Academy, I
was able to honor the local students I have nominated for our
nation's Service Academies. These young people are the absolute best and
brightest in the Fifth Congressional District. They are a credit to their
families, their state, and their nation. Below are my pictures with
the nominees to the Air Force Academy, West Point, the Naval Academy,
and the Merchant Marine Academy.
It's not very often that two Republican Congressmen find
themselves in agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However,
that's exactly how my colleague Congressman Tent Franks (AZ-08) and I
feel when it comes to the New Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(START). Please click

Last week in Washington, it was a pleasure
meeting the new president of Colorado Mountain College, Dr. Carrie
Hauser. Colorado Mountain College is based in Glenwood Springs, CO but has
six locations throughout the state including Buena Vista, right here in
the Fifth Congressional District.
Even though the Broncos lost Super Bowl XLVIII, I'm happy that
House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Doc Hastings will be
receiving two hormone and antibiotic-free Callicrate Beef sirloin steaks
from Ranch Foods Direct. This exchange is a result of a friendly Super
Bowl wager between the Colorado and Washington Congressional
Delegations.

One of the most important things I can do
is listen to my constituents. My staff and I get thousands of phone

sampling of what you are saying.
