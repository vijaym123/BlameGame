We can&rsquo;t believe that we are able to do this again. Because we&rsquo;ve received more than 16,OOO donations since President Clinton&rsquo;s email this morning, we can now
TRIPLE-MATCH
all donations we receive TODAY ONLY.
But here&rsquo;s the thing: That still leaves us 34,OOO short of where we need to be by tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline. So we absolutely MUST take advantage of this amazing opportunity.
In the final sprint to Election Day, we need to make every TRIPLE-MATCH count.
