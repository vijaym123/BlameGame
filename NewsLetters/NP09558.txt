Dear friends,
One
year ago today the nation witnessed the Oklahoma Standard in action
neighbors helping neighbors rise from the rubble; strangers giving
countless resources to help others recover and rebuild; Oklahomans
praying without ceasing for those who lost loved ones. A year after the
devastating storms, Oklahoma has persevered. Today we owe our deepest
gratitude to the emergency response teams and volunteers who have
helped Oklahoma move forward and heal. Let us also remember in our
prayers and thoughts today those who lost loved ones in the storms. The
strength and resilience I see in our state time and again make
me proud to be an Oklahoman.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
