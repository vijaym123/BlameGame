Friend,
This Monday , the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision on an important case - they will decide whether an employer is allowed to deny birth control access to their employees. As you can imagine, I&#39;m watching this case very closely. As a doctor who is also married to a doctor, I&#39;m invested in ensuring a patient&#39;s right to make their own healthcare decisions in the privacy of a doctor&#39;s office - with no outside involvement.
That, among countless other things, is what Ami fights for every day in Congress.
For patient&#39;s rights, women&#39;s rights, people&#39;s rights - to make their own decisions, free from government intrusion.
I want Ami to continue to be able to fight for us - and to do that, he needs to meet this
June 30th
goal. The team has already told you what we&#39;re up against, and trust me, this will be a difficult reelection.
We need your help, and we need it now.
Click here to give $5 or whatever you can towards our goal.
I&#39;m proud to stand alongside Ami as he works to ensure our rights and freedoms. The work he does is so important.
Please join us today by pitching in $5 or more here.
Thanks for standing with us. We&rsquo;re standing up for you.
Best,
Dr. Janine Bera
PS - I wouldn&#39;t write if it wasn&#39;t important, but Ami&rsquo;s team is facing a very serious deadline.
We know Ami&rsquo;s opponent, Doug Ose, can put millions of dollars of his own money in the race.
That&rsquo;s why this deadline is so crucial.
Please click here to support Ami with a contribution before midnight, June 30 th .
