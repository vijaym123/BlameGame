Dear Friend,
When President Obama unveiled his plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 30%, he had a simple request for us Democrats: &ldquo;Please go on offense.&rdquo;
As someone who&rsquo;s always fought to prevent climate change, all I can say is,
let&rsquo;s get to work. This is the moment we&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Show your support for the President&rsquo;s proposal to cut carbon emissions by adding your name to our petition.
These new emissions targets will shift the American clean energy revolution that has already started into overdrive, creating jobs for today and a cleaner planet for tomorrow.
This is the beginning of the end of America&rsquo;s long, dirty power plant era. This is the kind of move we&rsquo;ve been demanding for a long, long time. Support the President&rsquo;s new carbon-cutting regulations by signing our petition.
Thanks for your support in this fight.
Sincerely,
Ed
