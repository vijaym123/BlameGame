One message I keep hearing over and over again is: Enough is enough!
Businesses across the 4 th
District and around the nation have had enough taxes, enough regulation, and enough uncertainty.
Its time for Washington to be an enabler to economic growth, not a barrier.
We must work to reform the tax code so its simple and fair, reduce burdensome regulations, and ensure that the rules are not changed from day to day in order to return stability to the marketplace.
Read more about my effort to achieve these goals in both the
financial services
and
housing
industries.
Yours in service,
Randy
