Would you rather America get energy from Canada or
the Middle East? What if getting more energy from Canada would also help
create thousands of jobs here in America?
Last year, the
House of Representatives
approved legislation to
authorize and expedite construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline . If
approved for construction, the Keystone Pipeline would transport crude
oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. The State Department
issued a new report on January 31 concluding that building the
pipeline would not have a significant environmental
impact.
What would approving the Keystone Pipeline
mean?
The State Department
projects
that
building the pipeline would support 42,100
jobs .
Once completed, the pipeline would carry
approximately 830,000 barrels of oil to U.S. refineries every day
thats about
half of what were currently importing from the
Middle East .
An in-depth
review
by the State Department concluded that the pipeline
would have a
minimal impact on the
environment .
Building the Keystone XL Pipeline
would not
cost taxpayers one dime .
Despite these benefits and
bipartisan support for building the pipeline, the Obama Administration
has still not issued a permit to begin construction. After more than
five years of waiting,
I think its time to build. Do
you?
Why do you think? Do you support legislation to begin
construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline? Yes No Other *By answering this
