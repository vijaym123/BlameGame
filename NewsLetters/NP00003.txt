Dear
Friend,
You heard that
right! Theres going to be a woman on the $10 dollar bill. This week, The
U.S. Treasury Department announced that it will be adding the portrait
of a woman to the $10 dollar bill as part of that bills scheduled
redesign. The announcement follows a tremendous grassroots movement to
add a woman to the $20 dollar bill and the introduction of my Women on
Twenty Act legislation in the
Senate.
Although this latest announcement
does not place a woman on the $20 dollar bill, it is historic, and a big
step forward. Young girls across this country will soon be able to see
an inspiring woman on the $10 dollar bill who helped shape our
country into what it is today and know that they too can grow up and do
great things for our country.
The Treasury Department is seeking input from
all Americans on who should be on the new $10 dollar bill, and what it
should look like. Our currency is an important part of our daily lives,
and its important for it to reflect the contributions of all
Americans. I hope youll be part of that process by sharing your ideas on
https://thenew10.treasury.gov/
or by using the
hashtag #TheNew10 on social
media.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
