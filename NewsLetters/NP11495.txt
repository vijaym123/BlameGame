Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was another busy and extremely productive week in Washington and I
am looking forward to spending this week in Kentucky! You may have
heard of "Sunshine Week," and while I cannot promise beautiful weather,
I can assure you that our office is doing everything we can to be
accessible and transparent!
"Sunshine Week" brings attention to the need for transparency and
accessibility in our democratic society. This is something my staff and
I continually strive for - whether it is providing service in
convenient locations for you through monthly mobile office hours in
each county, taking your questions at town hall meetings and Meet your
Congressman events, or through this very weekly newsletter you are
reading.
It is an honor to serve Kentucky's Sixth District in Congress, and I
will continue working to ensure openness and accountability in
government.
Advancing Commonsense Solutions for Kentucky Communities
On Friday, the House Committee on Financial Services approved two
pieces of legislation I introduced to ensure that Washington
bureaucrats don't needlessly and arbitrarily restrict access to the
credit needed to create jobs. I am especially glad that the committee
approved my bill to fix the new, flawed, one-size-fits-all formula from
Washington-based bureaucrats, who shockingly and incorrectly claimed
that Bath County, Kentucky should be considered "non-rural."
Both of my bills included significant bipartisan input from Congressman
Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX) and Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY). I
appreciate their contributions, which addressed important concerns and
helped gain strong bipartisan support. I am glad that we were able to
work together to advance these commonsense solutions.
I look forward to continuing to advance these important pieces of
legislation so we can break the stranglehold Washington bureaucrats and
their mounting regulations have on American consumers and job-creators,
get people back to work and spur economic recovery.

Making it Easier for Small Businesses to Hire Veterans
Unfortunately, too many veterans cannot find work these days as a
result of flawed Washington policies like Obamacare that hinder job
creation. Although this Administration has delayed Obamacare's employer
mandate, many small businesses in my district in central and eastern
Kentucky have expressed deep concern that Obamacare would discourage
them from hiring more workers.
That is why on Tuesday, I spoke on the floor of the House of
Representatives in support of H.R. 3474, the Hire More Heroes Act.
This legislation will give those who have selflessly served our country
more employment opportunities by providing American small businesses
with the ability to hire more veterans. H.R. 3474 would exempt veterans
from businesses' full-time employee count if they already receive
health insurance from the Department of Veterans Affairs or they are
reservists covered under TRICARE. This commonsense solution is designed
to give small businesses another incentive to hire veterans, without
being punished for hiring these qualified and well-trained employees.

Hire More Heroes Act

Calling Sixth District Artists!
Congressman Barr congratulates 2013 Congressional Art Competition
winner, Bryan Station High School student Gabriel M. Baczkowski.
The Congressional Art Competition is just around the corner! I am happy
to once again invite all high school students in the Sixth District to
participate. The overall winner will have his or her piece displayed in
the United States Capitol for the next year. It will represent the
Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky among hundreds of pieces from
other congressional districts throughout the county. The winner of the
competition will also receive two airline tickets from Southwest
Airlines to come see their artwork as it is displayed.
Students who wish to participate should submit a participation form
from my website to the Lexington Office by Friday, March 28! Those
participating must then submit one piece to the Lexington District
Office no later than Monday, April 14, 2014.

Kentuckians in the Capitol
I had the great opportunity to meet with the Kentucky Psychological
Association delegation Tuesday. We discussed the important services
that psychologists provide in our community, as well as how Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursement affects patient care.
Thanks to representatives of the American Urological Association who
came by the office Tuesday to discuss the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force Recommendation Process, Graduate Medical Education funding, and
the Sustainable Growth Rate.
Many thanks to Reverend Mark Howell of First Baptist Church in
Frankfort for coming by my office to talk about religious liberty,
immigration, and our moral obligation to help those less fortunate.
While they were in Washington for the American Public Transit
Association's annual Legislative Conference, I had the pleasure of
meeting with Lextran General Manager Rocky Burke and Board Member Jeff
Fugate to discuss the importance of a long-term federal transportation
funding bill and the New Market Tax Credits program for mass transit in
central Kentucky.
On Wednesday, I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. JD Carey, the
President of the Greater Lexington Apartment Association, to discuss
the growth in apartment construction in the Lexington area.
It was a pleasure to welcome representatives from the Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) Society's Kentucky-Southeast Indiana Chapter Wednesday
to talk about the developments and improvements in MS treatment that
are the result of research at NIH, and the importance of continued
support for this research.
I had a great visit with Tom Vallandingham from Cynthiana, and Hack
Albertson of Paralyzed Veterans of America. Their service and bravery
as they face challenges is inspiring.
Thanks to Dr. T. Shawn Caudill from Lexington, who swung by the office
Wednesday to update me on NIH funding, GME reform, and ways to
incentivize payments to increase the supply of primary care physicians
in Kentucky.
I had the pleasure of welcoming Kentucky Parent Teacher Association
(PTA) representatives Liza Holland, Secretary of the Lexington PTA, and
Sharon Whitworth, Commissioner of the Taylorsville PTA, to discuss
federal education policy and how to expand parental engagement and
representation with schools in the Bluegrass.
Thanks to Andrew Collar, Andrew Wiemann, Alex Peyton, and John Cox, who
are students from UK and EKU, for stopping by my office to talk about
issues facing our nation that are important to our community. I am
always proud to represent young people like these four who are active
and engaged in public life, and wish them the best in their future
endeavors.
Thanks to Nathan Henderson and Michael Wester from RJ Corman Railroad
Group for stopping by to discuss ways Washington can help promote the
railroad industry's ability to grow, create jobs, and invest in
domestic infrastructure.
Fighting for Our Firefighters
Did you know that 90 percent of Kentucky's fire departments are either
fully or mostly staffed by volunteers? Fire Chiefs have told me that
they do not have the resources to provide the health benefits required
by Obamacare's employer mandate to these brave and selfless volunteers,
who either have NO expectation of receiving such benefits or receive
their benefits through other lines of work.
As an original cosponsor, I was pleased to help introduce the
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. I am
glad to report that on Tuesday, the House passed this bill to more
permanently establish in law a provision that firefighters across
Kentucky's Sixth District have told me is vital to their ability to
continue protecting our communities.
While I am glad that in January, the IRS answered my calls for
clarification, and I welcomed the long-awaited announcement from the
IRS stating that emergency services volunteers will not forced to be
counted as full-time employees under the Obamacare employer mandate,
passage of the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency
Responders Act will ensure as a matter of law that these departments
cannot fall victim to the costly employer mandate in Obamacare.
I remain committed to replacing Obamacare with reforms that will
actually lower the cost of healthcare without jeopardizing the safety
of our communities.

Report
Dear
Friend,
It
was
another
busy
and
extremely
productive
week
in
Washington
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
spending
this
week
in
Kentucky!
You
may
have
heard
of
&#8220;Sunshine
Week,&#8221;
and
while
I
cannot
promise
beautiful
weather,
I
can
assure
you
that
our
office
is
doing
everything
we
can
to
be
accessible
and
transparent!
"Sunshine
Week"
brings
attention
to
the
need
for
transparency
and
accessibility
in
our
democratic
society.
This
is
something
my
staff
and
I
continually
strive
for
-
whether
it
is
providing
service
in
convenient
locations
for
you
through
monthly
mobile
office
hours
in
each
county,
taking
your
questions
at
town
hall
meetings
and
Meet
your

events,
or
through
this
very
weekly

you
are

It
is
an
honor
to
serve
Kentucky&#8217;s
Sixth
District
in
Congress,
and
I
will
continue
working
to
ensure
openness
and
accountability
in
government.
Advancing
Commonsense
Solutions
for
Kentucky
Communities
On
Friday,
the
House
Committee
on
Financial
Services
approved
two
pieces
of
legislation
I
introduced
to
ensure
that
Washington
bureaucrats
don&#8217;t
needlessly
and
arbitrarily

access
to
the

I

especially
glad
that
the
committee
approved
my
bill
to
fix
the
new,
flawed,
one-size-fits-all
formula
from
Washington-based
bureaucrats,
who
shockingly
and
incorrectly
claimed
that
Bath
County,
Kentucky
should
be
considered
&#8220;non-rural.&#8221;
Both
of
my
bills
included
significant
bipartisan
input
from
Congressman
Ruben
Hinojosa
(D-TX)
and
Congresswoman
Carolyn
B.
Maloney
(D-NY).
I
appreciate
their
contributions,
which
addressed
important
concerns
and
helped
gain
strong
bipartisan
support.
I
am
glad
that
we
were
able
to
work
together
to
advance
these
commonsense

I
look

to
continuing
to
advance
these
important
pieces
of

so
we
can
break
the
stranglehold

bureaucrats
and
their
mounting

have
on
American

cannot
find

Kentucky
have
expressed
deep

that
Obamacare
would
discourage

That

on

count
if
they
already
receive
health
insurance
from
the
Department

or

I
had
the
great
opportunity
to
meet
with
the
Kentucky
Psychological
Association
delegation
Tuesday.
We
discussed
the
important
services
that
psychologists
provide
in
our
community,
as
well
as
how
Medicare
and
Medicaid
reimbursement
affects
patient
care.
Thanks
to
representatives
of
the
American
Urological
Association
who
came
by
the
office

those
less
fortunate.
While
they
were

I
had
the
pleasure
of

Fugate
to
discuss
the
importance
of

bill
and
the
New

Tax
Credits
program
for
mass
transit
in
central
Kentucky.
On
Wednesday,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
Mr.
JD
Carey,
the
President
of
the
Greater
Lexington
Apartment
Association,
to
discuss
the
growth
in
apartment
construction
in
the

It
was
a
pleasure
to
welcome
representatives

Chapter
Wednesday
to
talk
about
the
developments

improvements
in
MS
treatment
that
are
the
result
of
research
at
NIH,
and
the
importance
of
continued
support
for
this
research.
I
had
a
great
visit
with
Tom
Vallandingham
from
Cynthiana,
and
Hack
Albertson
of
Paralyzed
Veterans
of
America.
Their
service

challenges
is
inspiring.
Thanks

T.
Shawn
Caudill
from
Lexington,
who
swung
by

reform,
and
ways
to
incentivize
payments
to
increase
the
supply
of
primary
care
physicians
in
Kentucky.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
Kentucky
Parent
Teacher
Association
(PTA)
representatives

Holland,
Secretary
of
the
Lexington
PTA,
and

issues
facing
our
nation
that
are
important
to
our
community.
I
am
always
proud
to
represent
young
people
like
these
four
who
are
active
and
engaged
in
public
life,
and
wish
them
the
best
in
their
future
endeavors.
Thanks

Fighting
for
Our
Firefighters
Did
you
know
that
90
percent
of
Kentucky&#8217;s
fire
departments
are
either
fully
or
mostly
staffed
by
volunteers?
Fire
Chiefs
have
told
me
that
they
do
not
have
the
resources
to
provide
the
health
benefits
required
by
Obamacare&#8217;s
employer
mandate
to
these
brave
and
selfless
volunteers,
who
either
have
NO
expectation
of
receiving
such
benefits
or
receive
their
benefits
through
other
lines
of
work.
As
an
original
cosponsor,
I
was
pleased
to
help
introduce
the
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act.
I
am
glad
to
report
that
on
Tuesday,
the
House
passed
this
bill
to
more
permanently
establish
in
law
a
provision
that
firefighters
across
Kentucky&#8217;s
Sixth
District
have
told
me
is
vital
to
their
ability
to
continue
protecting
our
communities.
While
I
am
glad
that
in
January,
the
IRS
answered
my
calls
for
clarification,
and
I
welcomed
the
long-awaited
announcement
from
the
IRS
stating
that
emergency
services
volunteers
will
not
forced
to
be
counted
as
full-time
employees
under
the
Obamacare
employer
mandate,
passage
of
the
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act
will
ensure
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
departments
cannot
fall
victim
to
the
costly
employer
mandate
in
Obamacare.
I
remain
committed
to
replacing
Obamacare
with
reforms
that
will
actually
lower
the
cost
of
healthcare
without
jeopardizing
the
safety
of
our
communities.
