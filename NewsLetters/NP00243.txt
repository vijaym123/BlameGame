Dear Fellow Nevadan,
This week, the Department of Labor
announced the availability of $34 million for the third round of grants
for the Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF). Funding awards will support
approximately 6-8 grants, ranging from $3 million to $6
million.
This is the first round of WIF funding since the passage of the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of
2014 , which emphasizes the coordination and alignment of resources across
the federal government and with state and local partners. Funds in
this round will help the WIF build on the acts principles of a fully
integrated, job-driven workforce system. Grants funded in this round will
pursue one or more of the following
strategies:
Enhance strategic collaboration and coordination of workforce
development programs to align services with employer needs and local economic
development activities and be more effective;
Strengthen
the quality of services to individuals and employers at American Job
Centers; and
Promote accountability, data-driven
decision-making and customer choice.
All WIF grantees are
required to procure an independent evaluator to evaluate the project
rigorously. These evaluations are likely to yield significant new
evidence and best practices to stimulate innovation throughout the broader
workforce system.
Grant applications are due by
July 23, 2015 . Information on applying for this grant is
available at
www.grants.gov .
Interested
applicants are encouraged to visit

Innovation Fund, and to find tools and resources to support application
development. A
tutorial on applying for grants
is also
available online.
