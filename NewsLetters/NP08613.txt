A Crisis at Our
Borders
We have a national security, rule of law
and humanitarian crisis on our hands right now on our border. Weve
known for a while now that our immigration system is broken and in need
of reform. It is why in the House of Representatives weve called for a
step-by-step approach to reform
that must begin with securing our
borders
because we understand that earning back the trust and respect
of the American people is an important part of finding real
solutions.
The Obama Administration has
been less than capable of meeting that standard. What we are seeing
right now is both the failure of our current immigration system and the
consequences of the Obama Administrations habit of trying to work
around the laws of this nation. When laws are not enforced, when
thousands of immigrants who have been convicted of criminal activities are
released, we have a scenario where theres little room for trust among
the American people for their
government.
More must be done to solve our immigration challenges. More
must be done to restore trust. A good start is enforcing the laws of
this land.
Enhancing Health Care for
Veterans
This past Tuesday, the House of Representatives
passed the
Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014
legislation
that gives our veterans greater options and flexibility in obtaining
quality, timely health care
including the ability to access non-VA
care facilities using their VA benefits. Its an important step forward.
But we have to begin to fix the system and to make it responsive and
reflective of the level of service our veterans provided to this
nation.
Conservative Incrementalism
Last week I spoke at the Heritage Foundation on how we can
achieve fiscal responsibility, promote economic growth and do so through a
principled, logical and strategic way to secure real gains for our
country and future generations. Its a strategy of small but important
gains in the direction of a more limited and accountable government
something we call conservative
incrementalism.

Iraq
News out of
Iraq that terrorist forces are taking the fight to the Iraqi military
and threatening Baghdad are disturbing and portend even more
instability in the Middle East. The presidents comments so far on the situation
are not reassuring that his administration has a plan to protect
American interests there or across the region
particularly in light of
the fact that this situation was largely predictable. After thousands
of brave Americans lost their lives liberating that country from a
brutal dictator, we need a strategy that does not abandon our allies or
interests.
