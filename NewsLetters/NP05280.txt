just reported, &ldquo;control of the U.S. Senate [is] resting on a handful of incredibly close races.&rdquo; The GOP has zeroed in on the 12 closest races, and today they launched a $20.3 MILLION, ONE-WEEK attack to win at the last second.
If we fall short tonight, our leadership team will face a tough decision tomorrow:
Which battlegrounds should we fund, and which should we cut loose?
