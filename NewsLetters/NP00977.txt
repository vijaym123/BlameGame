Happy Mother's Day!
I can say without hesitation that I would not be where I am today
without the guiding hand of my mother, Frances Scott. She worked
16-hour days as a single mom to keep a roof over our head and food on
the table, and for that I can never really thank her enough. She
sacrificed so much of herself for my brother and me, and I am truly in
awe of her strength.
Perhaps even more importantly from my view, she did not give up on me -
even when I had given up on myself. Failing multiple classes in 9th
grade, cutting up in class, focusing too much on football and not
enough on academics - it didn't matter, because she knew that there was
more potential in me than I could see at the time.
And I think that speaks to what we all can see in our mothers - that
their unbridled optimism, not for their own lives, but for their
children's lives, can lead to amazing things. I take that message with
me as a public servant, and I will continue working to build an even
better America for our kids and grandkids than we have today.
Happy Mother's Day to my mom, and all the moms across our great nation
who are working, guiding, teaching, disciplining (something I also know
well!), and showing their families the definition of strength,
dedication and love.
Sincerely,
Tim

Happy
Mother&#8217;s
Day!
I
can
say
without
hesitation
that
I
would
not
be
where
I
am
today
without
the
guiding
hand
of
my
mother,
Frances
Scott.
She
worked
16-hour
days
as
a
single
mom
to
keep
a
roof
over
our
head
and
food
on
the
table,
and
for
that
I
can
never
really
thank
her
enough.
She
sacrificed
so
much
of
herself
for
my
brother
and
me,
and
I
am
truly
in
awe
of
her
strength.
Perhaps
even
more
importantly
from
my
view,
she
did
not
give
up
on
me
&#8211;
even
when
I
had
given
up
on
myself.
Failing
multiple
classes
in
9 th
grade,
cutting
up
in
class,
focusing
too
much
on
football
and
not
enough
on
academics
&#8211;
it
didn&#8217;t
matter,
because
she
knew
that
there
was
more
potential
in
me
than
I
could
see
at
the
time.
And
I
think
that
speaks
to
what
we
all
can
see
in
our
mothers
&#8211;
that
their
unbridled
optimism,
not
for
their
own
lives,
but
for
their
children&#8217;s
lives,
can
lead
to
amazing
things.
I
take
that
message
with
me
as
a
public
servant,
and
I
will
continue
working
to
build
an
even
better
America
for
our
kids
and
grandkids
than
we
have
today.
Happy
Mother&#8217;s
Day
to
my
mom,
and
all
the
moms
across
our
great
nation
who
are
working,
guiding,
teaching,
disciplining
(something
I

and
showing
their
families
the
definition
of
strength,
dedication
and
love.
