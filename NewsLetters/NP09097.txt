Statement on 70th Anniversary of
D-Day
6/6/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn has released the following
statement to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of
D-Day.
Seventy years ago, the day dawned with a
world at war and a continent divided. Thanks to the bravery and sacrifice
of 156,000 men from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and elsewhere, night fell on a world closer to peace, closer
to freedom, and closer to the defeat of evil. As I represent our
country at the commemorations alongside members of Ft. Carsons
4 th
Infantry Division and the Air Force Academy here in Normandy, on
behalf of a grateful nation and the entire free world, I say thank you
to these brave, selfless, tireless, fearless, and heroic men.
Unfortunately, it will not be too many more anniversaries before these men are
no longer with us. Whatever chance you have, spend time with these
heroes and thank them for giving you the opportunity to live a free life
today.

Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
