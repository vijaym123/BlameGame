Dear
Friend,
With warmer weather and longer days upon us, I want to share information
with you about a bill that I am working on in Congress to help keep
you and your family safe in the summer sun.
Sunscreen is one
of the most effective ways to prevent skin cancer and many of us use
it daily to help protect our families.
However, in recent years
the United States has fallen behind other countries in the number and
quality of sunscreen products available. In fact, the last time a new
ingredient was approved and added to sunscreen by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) was
15 years ago .
Since then, research and innovation have offered eight new ingredients
to improve sunscreen
all of which have been submitted to the FDA,
but remain stuck in a backlog for final approval.
To help
ensure Americans have access to the safest, most effective sunscreens
available, I recently co-sponsored the
Sunscreen
Innovation Act, H.R. 4250 . This bill will streamline the FDAs
acceptance process for ingredients in sunscreens that have already been
approved in places like Canada and Europe, while still maintaining our
countrys strict safety standards.
Specifically, the Sunscreen
Innovation Act ensures that all sunscreen ingredients receive review by
the FDA within 11 months, or less. The fact that some ingredients
have been waiting for approval for more than a decade is excessive by any
measure and indicates a situation where we can be more efficient
without sacrificing safety in approving products. Additionally, the
legislation requires that the FDA submit reports to Congress on its progress
within a year after the law is enacted.
I am proud to be a
sponsor of this bill, and am honored to serve in Congress on behalf
of Utah families like yours. As your representative, I always
appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community. Please
let me know
areas you find
especially interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
