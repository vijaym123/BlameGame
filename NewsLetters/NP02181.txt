House Republicans just released their new budget. Bad news: it&rsquo;s a nearly identical version of Paul Ryan&rsquo;s disastrous plan from last year. The main point?
Destroy Medicare and the Affordable Care Act so the GOP&rsquo;s billionaire backers can enjoy lavish tax breaks.
What makes this year&rsquo;s plan different from other Ryan Budgets? Republicans have control of BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS.
This could be the year it gets through Congress.
We can&rsquo;t let that happen. In the next 24 hours, we need 50,000 supporters to stand up for the middle class and STOP the Republican Budget. Will you add your name?
Thanks,
