Friend -
As a nation this week, we are commemorating law enforcement officers, past and present, who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their responsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their communities, and, in so doing, have established for themselves an enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security of all citizens."
President Kennedy spoke these words over 50 years ago, but they still ring true today.
Law enforcement officers put duty before self, working on the front lines to protect our homes, our communities, our children, and our lives.
While it is hard to convey our gratitude for such sacrifice, National Police Week affords us an opportunity to commemorate the dedication of these special patriots. We are truly grateful.
Yours in Service,
Randy
