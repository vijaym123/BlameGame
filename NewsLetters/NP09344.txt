Dear Friend,
As we mark Memorial Day tomorrow, I join you in honoring the service of
our brave men and women in uniform and upholding our commitment to our
veterans. Many of our nation's sons and daughters - in both recent
times and throughout our history - have made the ultimate sacrifice.
These Americans answered the call to serve, not for recognition, but to
defend our nation. This display of selflessness and courage will
continue to inspire Americans for generations to come.
A Bipartisan Plan to Accelerate Medical Breakthroughs
Recently, I joined Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton
(R-MI) to announce the launch of 21st Century Cures
, a new initiative that aims to accelerate the pace of
cures and medical breakthroughs in the United States. Despite the
gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, we all agree that America must
maintain its place as the health care innovation capital of the world.
Health research moves at a rapid pace, but the federal drug and device
approval process is in many ways a relic of another era. Our nation has
dedicated scientists and bold leaders at agencies like the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), but when our laws don't keep pace with innovation, we risk
falling behind.
That is why, for the first time ever, Chairman Upton and I are going to
take a comprehensive look at what steps we can take to accelerate the
pace of cures in America. This bipartisan effort
will take a broad look at the full arc of the
process - from the discovery of clues in basic science, to streamlining
the drug and device development process, to unleashing the power of
digital medicine and social media at the treatment level.
We are seeking the input of a number of experts including thought
leaders from the Administration, academia, research, and industry to
dig deep into how we can effectively and efficiently tackle some of the
more complex challenges in medicine.
At The Atlantic's Future of Medicine: A Conversation on Cost and Value
event this past Wednesday, I joined Newsweek Contributing
Editor Matthew Cooper to discuss the 21st Century Cures initiative in
depth. Click to watch the video below:
As always, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up to date on the latest news from Washington and in Colorado. Also,
you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can read
my positions on issues and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While you're there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about
what matters most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to share
this email with your friends, family, and neighbors so that they too
can be a part of this important dialogue.

Dear
Friend,
As
we

Memorial

tomorrow,
I
join
you
in
honoring
the
service
of
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform

upholding
our
commitment
to
our
veterans.
Many

our
nation&#8217;s
sons

made
the
ultimate

not

This
display

Americans
for
generations
to
come.

we
risk
falling
