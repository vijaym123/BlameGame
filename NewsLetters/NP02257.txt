CNN : Disrespect of Obama hits new low
David -- This is outrageous:
In an unprecedented move, 47 of the U.S. Senate&rsquo;s 55 Republicans sent a letter directly to Iranian leaders, threatening to nullify any diplomatic deal negotiated by President Obama.
Nothing Republicans have done up until this point has reeked so much of disrespect for the President of the United States of America. The
New York Daily News
even called them &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; for sabotaging President Obama&rsquo;s attempt to prevent war.
We have to get $50,000 into our Republican Accountability Fund by the end of the week to get the message out to average Americans.
If you support President Obama, you need to have his back in this critical moment.
You CAN&rsquo;T let these Republicans tear down your President.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
This is just too far -- the Republicans are screwing with international peace just because of their deep contempt for President Obama. And they won&rsquo;t get away with it.
