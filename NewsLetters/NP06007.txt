Friend,
Breaking news - Doug Ose&#39;s campaign has released an internal poll. He&#39;s not the only one - we&#39;ve had a few separate polls come across our desks, and the results we&#39;ve been seeing are startling.
According to one poll,
Ami is down by 4 percentage points.
While these polls may be overstated, they confirm what we&#39;ve known all along - this race is going to come down to the wire.
We&#39;re neck and neck,
and we&#39;re more motivated than ever.
We need your immediate help to close the gap - click here and give $5 or more now.
What&#39;s more, this news comes just as we&#39;re facing our most important end of quarter deadline - it&#39;s a lot to tackle at one time.
In order to stay on track with our budget and close this gap, we must raise $20,000 by midnight on September 30th. And in light of these polls, it&#39;s critical that we have our strongest showing to date.
We need your help immediately - please click here and give $5 or $10, right now.
Thanks
- we&#39;ll be back in touch soon.
Best,
Team Bera
PS - The next 7 days will be vital to the success of the campaign. Our September 30th deadline is the most crucial we&#39;ve faced - please, click here and give $5 or $10 right now. We need you - now more than ever.
