Citizens United :
SIGN YOUR NAME &gt;&gt;
David --
Cheri went to Congress for one reason: to represent the people of Illinois&rsquo; 17th District.
That means helping hardworking people like you -- NOT special interests.
But thanks to
Citizens United , corporations are spending millions to buy our elections and control Washington&rsquo;s agenda --
and Cheri&rsquo;s had enough of it. Dark money shouldn&rsquo;t be able to buy our elections -- please add your name now to end
Citizens United
&gt;&gt;
Cheri&rsquo;s fighting everyday to protect Social Security and Medicare, improve access to child care, and expand economic opportunity for everyone.
But David, with special interests calling the shots, it&rsquo;s going to take an unprecedented effort to keep corruption out of Washington&rsquo;s agenda. Our democracy shouldn&rsquo;t be sold to the highest bidder. Please sign your name to overturn
Citizens United : http://action.cheribustos.com/citizens-united
