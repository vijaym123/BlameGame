My (second) Sandy Koufax Moment
Dear David,
For most congressional candidates, tonight marks the start of the final fundraising push of the third quarter. For me, however, tonight is the beginning of the Rosh Hashanah holiday marking the beginning of the Jewish New Year. It is a time of reflection and contemplation. It is a time to spend with family and friends.
I am reminded of Sandy Koufax, who in observance of Yom Kippur, chose not to pitch in the first game of the 1965 World Series. I imagine Koufax would have loved to open that Series, but he also knew that there would be a game the next day. Koufax went on to pitch in games 2, 5 and 7, helping his Dodgers win their second World Series in three years.
So, like Sandy Koufax did in 1965, and like I did in 2012, I will be sitting out this period of campaigning and fundraising. But I will be back &ldquo;on the mound&rdquo; in a couple days to keep our momentum going and building our team for success.
Still, September 30th remains a critical date. It&rsquo;s one of the final reporting deadlines of our entire campaign. That's why I need your help right now. Please help us reach our $10,000 goal and make a contribution today. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Your support will make a huge difference to this campaign.
Wishing everyone a year of Sweetness and Health, Happiness and Peace.
Thank you,
Brad
