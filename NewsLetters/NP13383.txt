December 25, 2013
Each year, Christmas brings together families, friends, and
communities to rejoice in the birth of Jesus and celebrate God's gifts
- a teaching that has encircled the globe for countless generations.
The holiday season is a time for renewed hope amidst continued
challenges. It's also a time to ponder the common values that unite us
- to have compassion and treat others as we wish to be treated. In this
season of hope, let's help those who need it most - those less
fortunate than we are. On behalf of Christy and our family, please
accept my very best wishes for a very happy, healthy, and Merry
Christmas.
