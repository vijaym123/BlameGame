Statement on SCOTUS Marriage
Debate
4/29/15
Congressman Lamborn released the following statement after
this week's oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court in
Obergefell
v. Hodges , the case determining whether the Constitution requires
the states to redefine marriage to include same-sex
couples:
There is
nothing in our Constitution that prohibits a state from retaining the
time-honored definition of marriage as a union between one man and
one woman, and the debate about the importance and public purpose of
marriage should be left to the states.
The Supreme Court does not
have the authority to redefine marriage for the states, and I am
hopeful the Supreme Court will respect the democratic
process.
