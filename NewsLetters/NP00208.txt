Trade Promotion Authority Poll
Soon, the House is expected to vote on H.R. 1314, the Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, commonly referred to as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA has been used to negotiate many trade agreements since 1974. Under TPA, Congress defines a set of parameters that the Executive branch must adhere to as it negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the United States.
Before the final trade agreement is signed by the President, the text must become publicly available for 60 days. Congress must then take an up-or-down vote on any trade agreement. This process ensures that foreign countries know they are negotiating with one voice, that the parameters of the negotiation are set by Congress, with Congress ultimately holding the power to approve or disapprove of the trade agreement. With that in mind, do you support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)?
