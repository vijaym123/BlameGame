Dear friend,
Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday season, a time when we
gather with our families and loved ones to enjoy each other's company
and take time to unwind together. We come together to remember all that
we have to be thankful for and the blessings we have received-and, of
course, enjoy a well-cooked turkey dinner.
The Thanksgiving celebration dates back four centuries. Our first
President, George Washington, celebrated it, as did Abraham Lincoln
during the difficult days of the civil war. It has always brought us
together as a people, and it is truly among the most quintessential of
American holidays.
But the holiday season is also a time to pause and remember that many
Americans remain in need. In addition to spending time with your friends
and families over the coming weeks, I hope you will consider lending a
hand to the less fortunate, whether with your time, your prayers, or in
some other way. Your kindness can make a big impression in the lives of
others.
We should also honor those who have sacrificed in uniform and those
still serving today. Many are unable to be with their loved ones this
holiday season, fighting for our flag far from home. I know they will
remain in my thoughts, and I appreciate their sacrifices.
I wish you and your family a wonderful Thanksgiving and an enjoyable
holiday season.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

Dear
friend,
Thanksgiving
marks
the
start
of
the
holiday
season,
a
time
when
we
gather
with
our
families
and
loved
ones
to
enjoy
each
other&#8217;s
company
and
take
time
to
unwind
together.
We
come
together
to
remember
all
that
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
and
the
blessings
we
have
received&#8212;and,
of
course,
enjoy
a
well-cooked
turkey
dinner.
The
Thanksgiving
celebration
dates
back
four
centuries.
Our
first
President,
George
Washington,
celebrated
it,
as
did
Abraham
Lincoln
during
the
difficult
days
of
the
civil
war.
It
has
always
brought
us
together
as
a
people,
and
it
is
truly
among
the
most
quintessential
of
American
holidays.
But
the
holiday
season
is
also
a
time
to
pause
and
remember
that
many
Americans
remain
in
need.
In
addition
to
spending
time
with
your
friends
and
families
over
the
coming
weeks,
I
hope
you
will
consider
lending
a
hand
to
the
less
fortunate,
whether
with
your
time,
your
prayers,
or
in
some
other
way.
Your
kindness
can
make
a
big
impression
in
the
lives
of
others.
We
should
also
honor
those
who
have
sacrificed
in
uniform
and
those
still
serving
today.
Many
are
unable
to
be
with
their
loved
ones
this
holiday
season,
fighting
for
our
flag
far
from
home.
I
know
they
will
remain
in
my
thoughts,
and
I
appreciate
their
sacrifices.
I
wish
you
and
your
family
a
wonderful
Thanksgiving
and
an
enjoyable
holiday
season.
As
always,
I
remain.
Most
sincerely,
