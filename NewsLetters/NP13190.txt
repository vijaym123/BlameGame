Update from Senator Bob Corker
January 12,
2014
Committed to Tennessee Veterans
Last Tuesday,
January 7, Senators Corker and Alexander and Congressmen Black and Roe
announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs had reversed
its previous decision not to fund innovative learning support classes
for Tennessee veterans pursuing further education under the G.I.
Bill.
The classes
which prepare veterans for college and other
higher educational programs using new technologies and approaches to
increase graduation rates and reduce costs
are available at 13
community colleges throughout Tennessee and will now receive federal support
as other classes do under the G.I. Bill. The VA had previously stated
it would not provide funding that veterans normally receive under the
G.I. Bill for such classes.
Our service members, military
retirees and veterans should receive every benefit that America has
promised them, said Corker. I am pleased to have joined my colleagues
in urging Veterans Affairs to resolve this issue, and I will continue
working to ensure Tennessee veterans have access to the educational
resources they have earned.
The Department of Veterans
Affairs had previously classified the classes as independent study,
which would not qualify for funding under the G.I. Bill. Corker,
Alexander, Black and Roe aided local community colleges in making the case that
the classes
which include classrooms and instructors
are
innovative programs that should still qualify for the same support that
traditional veterans education courses do.
The classes are
taught at Chattanooga State Community College, Cleveland State Community
College, Columbia State Community College, Dyersburg State Community
College, Jackson State Community College, Motlow State Community College,
Nashville State Community College, Northeast State Community College,
Pellissippi State Community College, Roane State Community College,
Southwest Tennessee Community College, Volunteer State Community
College and Walters State Community College.
Honoring Coach Pat
Summitt
Senators Corker and Alexander last week introduced legislation by
Congressman Duncan in the Senate that would award former University of
Tennessee womens basketball coach Pat Summitt the Congressional Gold
Medal. The Duncan legislation is also cosponsored by the entire
Tennessee House delegation.
The Congressional Gold Medal is
awarded to Americas most distinguished citizens, and there is perhaps no
one in America who has made a more indelible mark on their profession
and in their community than Pat Summitt. She set a historic record of
achievement in her 38 years as head coach of the Lady Vols, an
achievement that is only surpassed by her positive impact on the lives of the
women shes coached, said Corker. No longer on the sidelines, Coach
Summitt has taken her enthusiasm to pursue a new crusade: supporting
Alzheimers awareness. She is most deserving of this honor, and we are
grateful as Tennesseans for the lasting impact she has had on our
state and our nation.

Obama
Administration Should Maintain Commitment to Nuclear
Modernization
After Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
expressed support
for resources to modernize the
nations nuclear arsenal, Senator Corker, ranking member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, called on the Obama administration to include
necessary funding in the 2015 budget request to maintain their commitment to
full modernization. The president previously agreed to provide the full
and necessary funding to upgrade and modernize the United States
aging nuclear arsenal.
As Secretary Hagel emphasized
the importance of appropriate resources to modernize our nations
nuclear arsenal, I urge the Obama administration to match this level of
commitment with the funding necessary in the 2015 budget request so
modernization remains on track. To date their track record has been
inconsistent, said Corker. I recognize the need to address the nations
spending problems, but I believe we can meet this challenge while also
ensuring a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent, which is vital for U.S.
and global security.
