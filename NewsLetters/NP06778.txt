This is the biggest fundraising comeback of the year:
Over 33,000 grassroots supporters have made a donation since President Obama emailed you his call-to-action. That's just since this morning! Against all odds, we're just 42,000 donations from closing the gap!
That&rsquo;s STUNNING. Boehner is going to scream with rage when he sees this email.
David Johnson Answered President Obama's call-to-action? NO DONATION
David, we want all the President&rsquo;s best supporters to be part of this -- that includes you! But we don't see your name yet.
Are ready to step up for the President now and to help us complete this epic comeback? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
