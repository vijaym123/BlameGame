Friend -
Last month, a Veterans Affairs hospital in Michigan was ordered to conceal all Christian symbols inside of its chapel due to a VA policy handbook published in 2008, which states, When VA Chaplains are not providing or facilitating a religious service for a particular faith group, the chapel must be maintained as religiously neutral, reflecting no particular faith tradition.
In response, I joined 22 of my colleagues in sending
a letter
to the VA inquiring about the policy implementation in 2008 and urging the VA not to scrub its chapels of all religious symbols.
We are a nation founded on the freedom
of
religion, not freedom
from
religion. Over time, this important concept has been distorted, and its misapplication has led the public to believe that the Constitutions intent was to confine religion to the four walls of the church.
But the Constitution does not require the elimination of religious symbols from the public square
rather, it protects the free exercise of religion for every American.
Yours in service,
Randy
