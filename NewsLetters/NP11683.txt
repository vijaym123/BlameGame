The IRS has released a series of tax tips
to help Americans
understand how health insurance choices they make under the Affordable
Care Act could affect their 2014 taxes.
Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, House Republicans voted for the 50th time to obstruct,
undermine, and repeal the Affordable Care Act, jeopardizing the
benefits millions of Americans have gained under the law. Despite the
repeated failure of these tactics, House Republicans show no signs of
ending their crusade to put health insurance companies back in charge
of Americans' health care.
At the same time, House Republican leadership has failed to act on the
priorities that Coloradoans and Americans actually need Congress to
deal with: creating jobs, securing genuine opportunity for people to
get ahead, and growing our economy. We should be working together on
meaningful legislation to renew emergency unemployment insurance, raise
the minimum wage, and tackle comprehensive immigration reform; instead,
Congress reached a sad milestone with another vote to take health care
benefits from millions of Americans.
Despite the relentless attacks to undermine the Affordable Care Act,
85,000 Coloradoans and 4 million Americans are enrolled in health
insurance marketplaces, 3.1 million young adults have stayed on their
parents' plans until 26, and millions more have secured coverage
through Medicaid expansion. In addition, 129 million Americans with
pre-existing conditions can get coverage without being charged more or
losing coverage when they get sick.
Connect for Health Colorado
You might have heard about our state's health insurance marketplace -
known as Connect for Health Colorado
- and those eligible should know an important
deadline is quickly approaching. For those eligible to enroll through
Connect for Health Colorado, the open enrollment period this year ends
on March 31, 2014. Please visit Connect for Health Colorado to sign up
.
Since the marketplaces - like Connect for Health Colorado
- have opened for business, many people have
questions about what it means for them and how it works. That is why I
hosted a series of town hall meetings last year to provide important
information about the ACA, Connect for Health Colorado
, and benefits of this comprehensive new law. If you
were unable to attend one of the town hall meetings, you can watch the
videos below:

I hope you find the information about Connect for Health Colorado
in the videos helpful. If you need additional assistance
or have any questions, please contact Connect for Health Colorado
directly
.
As always I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up-to-date on the latest news from Washington and in the district.
Also, you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can
read my positions and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about the
issues that matter most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to
share this email with your friends, family, and neighbors so that they
too can be a part of this important dialogue.
