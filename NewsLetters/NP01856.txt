Dear Friends,
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives took a significant step towards securing our Nations future and restoring our fiscal sanity. For far too long, Congress and the President have ignored the will of the people and continued to spend taxpayer dollars at unsustainable levels.
The
budget proposal
that passed the House balances, eliminates wasteful government spending, repeals Obamacare, preserves Social Security and Medicare for current beneficiaries and future generations, and commits to providing a strong national defense for America.
The following day, an overwhelming bipartisan majority passed H.R. 2,
the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 . H.R. 2 would repeal and replace Medicares severely flawed SGR formula, providing certainty to seniors and their health care providers.
H.R. 2
marks the first major structural entitlement reform in nearly two decades and is an important first step in fixing Medicare to ensure its survival for future generations.
This is the type of the responsible, commonsense governing the American people demand from their elected officials, and I am proud to have been able to stand up and support these solid universal principals.
Tell me what you think about these historic bills by going to my Facebook page and commenting
here .
Sincerely,
Representative French Hill

Hill Questions SEC Chair on the Administration's 'War on Savings'
Hill said: The final topic I would like to raise with you today is this issue on what I have sort of described as the war on savings. And I group all of these things together: the 529 proposal that was withdrawn, the DOL proposal that is in discussion, the increasing capital gains taxation, the removing of stepped-up basis, the cap on IRA accounts. [I]n the ancient history when I served at Treasury, we were demanded to increase savings and to create more ways to encourage Americans of all income levels to save and improve our capital markets....
