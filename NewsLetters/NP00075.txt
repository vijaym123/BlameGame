Dear Friend,
Since last fall when news came out that the Newport helicopter facility
was on the closure list, I and so many others in Oregon have been
determined to do whatever it takes to keep this facility open and ready
to assist when the distress call comes.
Last week, we took a big step forward with the Senate Appropriations
Committee voting to provide funding for the U.S. Coast Guard helicopter
facility in Newport to stay open through September 2016.
The Newport helicopter facility has helped save countless lives over
the years and now we are one step closer to keeping it open for an
additional year. This is a map of the incidents in 2013 that the
Newport U.S. Coast Guard Station at Newport responded to. Incredibly,
this facility alone assisted 529 lives.
If you agree we need to fund the Newport helicopter, click here to

Newport Helo
It's crucial that we keep this lifesaving facility operating on
Oregon's central coast.
But the fight isn't over.
We need to make sure that the full Senate, the House, and the President
all get on board to save the helicopter.
I'm proud to have the support of the Newport Fishermen's Wives on this
important issue and I look forward to working towards funding the
Newport Air Station permanently so we never have to worry about this
crucial facility closing again.
All my best,
Jeff

Dear
Friend,
Since
last
fall
when
news
came
out
that
the
Newport
helicopter
facility
was
on
the
closure
list,
I
and
so
many
others
in
Oregon
have
been
determined
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
this
facility
open
and
ready
to
assist
when
the
distress

comes.
Last
week,
we
took
a
big
step
forward
with
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
voting
to
provide
funding
for
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
helicopter
facility
in
Newport
to
stay
open
through
September
2016.
The
Newport
helicopter
facility
has
helped
save
countless
lives
over
the
years
and
now
we
are
one
step
closer
to
keeping
it
open
for
an
additional
year.
This
is
a
map
of
the
incidents
in
2013
that
the
Newport
U.S.
Coast
Guard
Station
at
Newport
responded
to.
Incredibly,
this

alone
assisted
529
lives.
