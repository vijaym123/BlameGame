Dear Friends,
Since the National Flood
Insurance Program was created in 1968, Floridians have been tested
by, and learned from, numerous natural disasters
including major
flooding. We have become experts out of necessity in disaster preparedness,
mitigation and response. Florida accounts for over 2 million NFIP
flood insurance policies covering half a trillion worth of
property.
So I understand why many folks around our nation assume that the
NFIP is subsidizing our tropical lifestyle.
The reality is
that
Florida has been an overly responsible, even generous,
partner in the National Flood Insurance Program . In the
last 20 years, our residents have paid 4 times in premiums what we have
seen returned in claims. And Florida holds almost 40% of all NFIP
policies nationwide, so that is no small change.
So you will
imagine my shock, and my communitys shock, when the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implemented counterintuitive and radical
changes to the program that are forcing hard-working, diligent and
responsible families from their homes. FEMA is raising thousands upon
thousands of policy premiums to absurd levels
easily doubling, tripling,
or quadrupling them
and in some cases far worse. Only a Federal
agency could consider such a move without a hint of guilt or
embarrassment.
It is time to take a step back and reign in this
callous agency and its harmful belief that this is a potential path forward.
A delay in implementing this bad policy would give us time enough to
find common sense, bipartisan, solutions to the problems faced by the
National Flood Insurance Program.
Families in
our South Florida need, and deserve, relief from these ridiculous
premiums.
I will continue to work with my colleagues on
finding a reasonable solution to this crisis
one that will address the
immediate needs of local homeowners.
In response to this
pressing problem:
I am an original co-sponsor of the
bipartisan
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act
(H.R. 3370). Under this bill, rate increases would be delayed for
approximately 4 years. The bill would delay the implementation of rate
increases until 2 years after FEMA completes its affordability study mandated
in Biggert-Waters. It would require FEMA to propose regulations that
address the identified affordability issues within 18 months after the
completion of the study and establish a 6 month moratorium thereafter
to provide for Congressional review. It also allows FEMA to utilize
National Flood Insurance Funds to reimburse policyholders who
successfully appeal a map determination amongst other helpful
items.
I am a co-sponsor of the
Flood Insurance Fairness
Act
(H.R.3218) that would delay flood insurance premium increases in
the National Flood Insurance Program. Biggert-Waters contained an
affordability study. That study was supposed to have been completed by now,
but FEMA Administrator Fugate has made clear that it won't be ready
anytime soon - possibly not until 2015. Under this bill any rate
increase cannot go into effect until the study is complete and if the new
rates aren't affordable, then FEMA must provide its recommendations as
to how to make a new rate system affordable. It also requires Congress
to vote up or down on those recommendations within 10 legislative
days. If either chamber votes the modifications down, the rates would be
delayed for an additional 180 days.
I am a co-sponsor of
H.R.3312
a bill that will cap premiums
over the period
of homeownership to being no more than the value of the property. The
bill also phases-in any increases over ten years, and will allow
homeowners to pay their premiums monthly instead of in a lump sum
upfront.
I am a co-sponsor of the
Flood Insurance
Implementation Reform Act
(H.R.2199), which would add a three year
delay in implementing the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform
Act.
I am a co-sponsor of the
Flood Insurance Relief and
Transparency Act
(H.R.3693). The bill delays rate hikes on
grandfathered properties until 2015 and delays rate increases for
properties subject to Flood Insurance Rate Map revisions. It also cuts
through bureaucratic red tape to expedite FEMA's affordability study and
requires FEMA to be more transparent with proposed rate adjustments.
Finally, the bill allows policyholders the option to make monthly
installments on their flood insurance premiums.
I also signed
onto a letter to House leadership
opposing flood insurance rate
hikes
mandated by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform
Act. The letter had urged inclusion of an amendment in the debt
ceiling legislation and in in any legislative vehicle used to complete the
appropriations process.
I signed a letter to FEMA
regarding the same flood insurance rate hikes - specifically the letter asks
FEMA to use its authority to
keep flood insurance rates
affordable .
I also voted to
shield flood
insurance policyholders from excessive rate increases
in this
years FY14 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.
Of course I
will continue working to find a fix to this immense problem and look
forward to a quick resolution.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
