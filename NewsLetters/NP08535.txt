The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of June 16 - 20, 2014
This week the House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations
Act, which will provide funding for vital programs for our troops and
their families. This legislation plays a critical role in ensuring that
our military has the resources that it needs to protect our homeland
and fight those who threaten our security, all while providing support
for the brave men and women who risk their lives in order to keep us
safe. I am pleased that the House passed this bipartisan legislation
that effectively allocates resources to ensure that programs vital to
our national defense are adequately funded.
Legislative Business
On Thursday I managed the rule on the House floor for the Customer
Protection and End User Relief Act. This legislation would reauthorize
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while protecting end users
like farmers, ranchers, and other small businesses by eliminating
burdensome and unnecessary regulations. I believe that we need to get
Washington out of the way and give businesses the opportunity to grow
and expand. I will continue to support policies that promote
appropriate but limited regulations that ensure the stability of prices
and allow Americans to thrive and prosper. To watch a clip of my floor
speech, click here

This week I also joined some of my Republican colleagues in
cosponsoring House Resolution 621. This free speech resolution
reaffirms the commitment of the House of Representatives to the First
Amendment and the vital freedom of speech protections it provides for
the American people. Here is the full text
of the resolution.
Telephone Town Hall
On Wednesday evening I held a live telephone town hall meeting with
constituents in the 32nd Congressional District. I was delighted to
have more than 3,000 participants on the call and enjoyed our
conversations about a variety of issues throughout the meeting,
including the current unrest in Iraq, the rising costs of Obamacare,
the need for transparency with the IRS and the VA, as well as my ideas
on social security reform.
I always appreciate the opportunity to hear directly from North Texans
regarding their views on policy and the issues facing our nation. If
you would like to participate in future telephone town hall meetings,
please contact my Washington, DC, office at 202.225.2231. For those of
you who did not have the opportunity to join us on Wednesday evening,
you can listen to the entire meeting here
.
Congressional Gold Medal
On Thursday I had the pleasure of congratulating one of the recipients
of the Gold Congressional Award Medal, Gabrielle Gafford of Dallas.
This award focuses on volunteerism, personal development, physical
fitness, and expedition and exploration. Through her participation in
400 hours of community service and 200 hours of personal and physical
development, Gabrielle is extremely deserving of this award. This is an
extraordinary honor and I am very proud that the 32nd Congressional
District is represented by such an accomplished and ambitious young
woman.
Congressman Sessions with Gold Congressional Award Medal winner
Gabrielle Gafford
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress
