Stopping Executive Amnesty
Friends,
Last night, President Obama did something staggering in its magnitude. In an address from the White House, he announced executive actions giving legal status to five million people in our country illegally.
I will use every legislative tool available to stop this illegal amnesty. Law enforcement is the foundation of our liberty and prosperity, and the President is blatantly refusing to do his job and enforce the law. As the new chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice and Science, I will help our federal law enforcement officials do their job despite President Obama's attempt to derail their efforts.
This morning,
I spoke with Laura Ingraham about President Obamas actions and what Congress is doing to stop them . I hope you take a few minutes to listen.
Sincerely,
John
