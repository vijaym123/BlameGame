Making the Most of Our Time
Dear Friends,
We play this trick on ourselves &mdash; falling back and springing forward &mdash; but our time here is of course limited. Each morning, as the day begins, all of us receive a deposit of 86,400 seconds to spend. Think about it: 604,800 seconds a week or 2,592,000 a month.
How would you handle the daily deposit?
My friends, in the bank of time there is a deposit made in our account of 86,400 seconds each morning. We in Congress have this precious time to spend improving the lives of 320 million Americans, whom we pledge to protect and serve.
The great tragedy, for us, is that the amount of time spent on partisan postulates is greater than the time spent on working together to develop the best polices reachable in a two party system. In fact, at the close of each day we leave tens of thousands of seconds in the bank, unused, or thrown away on tribalistic conflict.
No matter how long we are blessed to serve in the House, it is but a fleeting moment in time. Our time in the House is perishable and priceless.
Let us treat it that way.
Emanuel
Cleaver, II
Member of
Congress
