A Victory
for Job Creation in Virginia's Fifth
District
Dear Friend,
Last week's March Jobs Report once again
demonstrated that this Administration's
policies are hindering the dynamic economic
and job growth we so desperately need. The
report showed that our economy is not
growing fast enough to reduce the
unemployment rate, the percentage of
able-bodied adults that have given up
looking for a job is nearly the highest
it's been in thirty years, and more than
seven million Americans are only working
part-time when they would rather work
full-time. This bleak status quo that our
country has experienced for the past five
years is unacceptable, and we should do
everything we can to remove the federal
government as a roadblock to job creation
so people have greater opportunities to
provide for their families.
Thankfully, our efforts to remove one of
those roadblocks impeding job growth in the
Fifth District came to a successful
resolution this week. I was pleased by the
news that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
finally issued a permit to the Henry County
Industrial Development Authority to proceed
with the development of the Commonwealth
Crossing Business Centre after a lengthy
and unnecessary delay. This site has the
potential to bring a significant number of
much-needed jobs to Southside Virginia.
Along with Congressman Morgan Griffith and
Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, we
introduced the Commonsense Permitting for
Job Creation Act last summer to expedite
approval of the site, as we have long
supported efforts by Henry County and
Martinsville to secure a permit for site
preparation. I thank our local officials in
Henry County and Martinsville who have
worked diligently to bring jobs to
Southside Virginia despite the bureaucratic
red tape that continually stalled their
progress.
I look forward to Commonwealth
Crossings development and the jobs
it will bring to area residents. It is my
hope that the Corps will now turn its
attention to approving the permit for
Pittsylvania Countys Berry Hill Mega
Park, which is currently at a standstill
because of the same unnecessary red tape
that stalled Commonwealth Crossing. To
remedy these problems permanently, I will
continue working with my Virginia
colleagues to pass the Commonsense
Permitting for Job Creation Act, which will
ensure that future economic development
projects do not face the same regulatory
hurdles as Commonwealth Crossing and Berry
Hill and instead can focus on creating jobs
for Virginians.
