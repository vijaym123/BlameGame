Mothers teach and inspire us. Mothers strengthen
our families and love unconditionally. Their value cannot be
underestimated
though it all-too-often is. And while there is simply no way we can
sufficiently thank our mothers for all they do, on Sunday, we try by
observing Mothers Day. It truly is a special day, a day to celebrate our
mothers and the love and happiness they bring to our families. I am
blessed to celebrate not only my mother, Liz, and my wife, Terri, but all
Third District moms, and I wish all of you the happiest of Mothers
Days.
Thank you
for all you do.
Happy Mothers
Day!
From the
