Bringing Together Employers and Job Seekers
Hi All!
I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. Last week, I toured the state
to hear from you, and highlight a few priorities that I know Granite
Staters care about. For example, I was thrilled to hold my third Career
and Opportunities Fair in Claremont to match up job seekers with
Granite State employers, and I toured the Route 10 bridge replacement
project in Winchester, to highlight the importance of passing my DRIVE
Now Act in order to keep Granite State drivers safe and protect vital
construction jobs.
At the Career and Opportunities Fair in Claremont
Careers and Opportunities in Claremont
As part of my continuing effort to help create jobs and opportunity for
middle class families, I hosted my third Career and Opportunities Fair
to help connect local residents with jobs and employment opportunities
throughout the Granite State. The fair, which was held at the Common
Man restaurant in Claremont, featured employers from the financial,
medical, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality industries, among
others.
I was proud to host this terrific event, where I got the chance to help
job seekers make real connections with New Hampshire employers.
Creating jobs and increasing economic opportunities for Granite State
residents is my number one priority in Congress, and we must ensure
that those looking for work have access to and are aware of new career
opportunities. More than 100 job seekers were matched with nearly 20
employers and service agencies during the Fair, including UPS, the U.S.
Small Business Administration, Creare LLC, Work Ready NH, Dartmouth
College, Black River Produce, and many others.

Working to Save Transportation Projects in Winchester
Last week I discussed my new bill
to support continued federal
investment in our roads and bridges while touring the Route 10 bridge
replacement project near the Winchester-Swanzey town line. I was joined
by state transportation officials and other local leaders and planners
to discuss the importance of continued funding for transportation
infrastructure in New Hampshire and across the country.
As we head into the busy summer construction months, it's more
important than ever to protect the federal funding needed to complete
vital infrastructure projects like the Winchester-Swanzey bridge
replacement. Not only will projects like this protect Granite Staters
from the safety hazards that come along with unstable infrastructure,
it will also provide construction jobs for our workers.
I call on
Congress to immediately pass my DRIVE Now Act, which would replenish
the Highway Trust Fund so that projects like this one won't be forced
to come to a halt right in the middle of the summer construction season.
Speaking at the World Affairs Council event
Celebrating 60 Years of Global Education in NH
Last week I was honored to join the World Affairs Council to celebrate
its 60th anniversary. For 60 years, this incredible Granite State
organization has been educating our students and keeping our citizens
connected to the world around us. New Hampshire's history, culture, and
economy are so closely tied to other nations. Now, with New Hampshire
exports growing so rapidly, it's more important than ever that we
celebrate these connections and make them part of our education,
economic, and community systems.
Have a good week and thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire
such a wonderful place to live!

Bringing

Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
fantastic

I
toured
the
state
to
hear
from
you,
and
highlight
a
