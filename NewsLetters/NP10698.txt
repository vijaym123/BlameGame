Link Pro-Jobs Policies to a Responsible Extension of Unemployment Benefits
An opinion piece that I wrote with my colleague,
Congressman Mark Meadows
of North Carolina, ran on
Roll Call.com's
website today. Rep. Meadows and I make the case for the GROWTH Act (Generating Real Opportunities for Workers and Transitional Help Act) which we introduced. We believe there is a better way to help those who are unemployed and struggling to pay the bills while addressing the underlying problem: the lack of job opportunities for many hardworking Americans.

With best wishes,
