Capitol Update
$500,000 Water Grant Coming to Hi-Desert
Congressman Cook is pleased to announce that the Hi-Desert Water
District has been awarded a $500,000 grant from the Bureau of
Reclamation to fund a portion of the district's Wastewater Treatment
Project. The District's Wastewater Treatment Project is becoming
increasingly necessary as the Morongo Basin continues to grow.
Hi-Desert Water District has been applying for grants for years, but
this year was the first time that it was awarded this competitive
grant. Hi-Desert Water District is a congressionally authorized project
sponsor under the Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI program, which is
part of the Water SMART initiative. Congressman Cook has been working
closely with the Hi-Desert Water District to secure this vital funding.
This grant will ensure water purity for the Hi-Desert as the community
continues to grow.
Cook said, "I'm proud that I was able to play a role in securing this
grant for the people of Yucca Valley. My most important job in Congress
is responding to the needs of my district, and this grant will go a
long way toward ensuring that Morongo Basin residents continue to have
access to clean water."
Congressman Cook announces Job Program
Last week, Congressman Cook announced a pilot program to provide jobs
for members of the California National Guard. The Work for Warriors
program creates partnerships with employers in order to provide
full-time work for California Guardsmen.
Having recently celebrated its two-year anniversary, the Work for
Warriors program has placed over 2,400 guardsmen in jobs, reducing
unemployment in the Guard by 25 percent. The success of the program has
driven its expansion into the US Army Reserve Forces. Congressman Cook
now offers the blueprint of California's program as a model for other
states seeking similar success.
Cook said, "I'm extremely pleased to see the success of Work for
Warriors. When I came to Washington, it was on a platform of creating
jobs, reviving the economy, and supporting are veterans. This program
has managed to do all of these things."
"As co-founder of the congressional Work for Warriors Caucus,
Representative Paul Cook recognizes that the job security of our
guardsmen and reservists is not just a moral issue, but is a
significant readiness issue," said Maj. Gen. David S. Baldwin, Adjutant
General of the California Military Department. "Without the support of
Representative Cook this job program would not have received the
critical support it needed and countless service members might still be
out of a job."
A Message From Congressman Cook: It's Time to End Human Trafficking
According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service study, 17,500 people
are believed to be trafficked into the United States annually. The
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that as
many as 100,000-300,000 American children are at risk of being
trafficked for commercial sex in the U.S. alone each year. Statistics
regarding victims vary widely, but one thing we all can agree on is
that one victim of these horrible crimes is one victim too many.
Today, I joined with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to
approve five bills that will make headway in the fight to end human
trafficking. These bills are H.R. 3530, the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act, H.R. 4058, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and
Improving Opportunity for Youths in Foster Care Act, H.R. 3610, the
Stop Exploitation through Trafficking Act, H.R. 4225, the Stop
Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act, and H.R. 4573, the
International Megan's Law.
Each of these bills brings the U.S. closer to ending domestic and
international trafficking by boosting support and protection for human
trafficking victims and increasing and streamlining law enforcement
resources. They will also enhance victim services, and strengthen our
laws to ensure that both buyers and sellers engaged in sex trafficking
are held accountable for their crimes.
Human trafficking has no place in any society, particularly when it
involves the abuse of children. Protecting our kids from sexual abuse
has been a focus of my legislative career. These despicable acts must
stop and today's legislation is a good step toward combating this
vicious crime. I'm proud to have voted yes on these important bills.

Cook

&#8220;I&#8217;m
extremely
pleased
to
see
the
success
of
Work

When
I

to
do
all
of
these
things.&#8221;
&#8220;As
co-founder
of

Work

Caucus,
Representative
Paul
Cook
recognizes
that
the
job
security
of
our

not

a
moral

&#8220;Without
the
support
of

this

would

A
Message
From
Congressman
Cook:
It&#8217;s
Time
to
End
Human
Trafficking
According
to
a
2013
Congressional
Research
Service
study,
17,500
people
are
believed
to
be
trafficked
into
the
United
States
annually.
The
National
Center
for
Missing
and
Exploited
Children
estimates
that
as
many
as
100,000-300,000
American
children
are
at
risk
of
being
trafficked
for
commercial
sex
in
the
U.S.
alone
each
year.
Statistics
regarding
victims
vary
widely,
but
one
thing
we
all
can
agree
on
is
that
one
victim
of
these
horrible
crimes
is
one
victim
too
many.
Today,
I
joined
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
approve
five
bills
that
will
make
headway
in
the
fight
to
end
human
trafficking.
These
bills
are
H.R.
3530,
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act,
H.R.
4058,
the
Preventing
Sex
Trafficking
and
Improving
Opportunity
for
Youths
in
Foster
Care
Act,
H.R.
3610,
the
Stop
Exploitation
through
Trafficking
Act,
H.R.
4225,
the
Stop
Advertising
Victims
of
Exploitation
(SAVE)
Act,
and
H.R.
4573,
the
International
Megan's
Law.
Each
of
these
bills
brings
the
U.S.
closer
to
ending
domestic
and
international
trafficking
by boosting
support
and
protection
for
human
trafficking
victims
and
increasing
and
streamlining
law
enforcement
resources.
They
will
also
enhance
victim
services,
and
strengthen
our
laws
to
ensure
that
both
buyers
and
sellers
engaged
in
sex
trafficking
are
held
accountable
for
their
crimes.
Human
trafficking
has
no
place
in
any
society,
particularly
when
it
involves
the
abuse
of
children.
Protecting
our
kids
from
sexual
abuse
has
been
a
focus
of
my
legislative
career.
These
despicable
acts
must
stop
and
today's
legislation
is
a
good
step
toward
combating
this
vicious
crime.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
have
voted
yes
on
these
important
bills.
