WEEK IN REVIEW
On Monday, I
along with Representatives Rick
Crawford (AR-1), French Hill (AR-2), Bruce Westerman (AR-4), David
Jolly (FL-13), Barry Loudermilk (GA-11), Rodney Davis (IL-13), Andy Barr
(KY-6), Dan Benishek (MI-1), Alan Nunnelee (MS-1), Mark Amodei
(NV-2), Dave Joyce (OH-14), Mike Kelly (PA-3), Mick Mulvaney (SC-5), Pete
Olson (TX-22), Blake Farenthold (TX-27), Glenn Grothman (WI-6), and Reid
Ribble (WI-8)
introduced the Truth in Obamacare Advertising
Act.
In Fiscal Year 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), which is largely in charge of administering the PPACA, will
use over $702 million of user fees to spend a total of $773 million on
consumer outreach and education for the Obamacare marketplaces.
Unfortunately, while the administration conducts this massive advertising
campaign to increase the laws popularity, taxpayers
who largely view
the law unfavorably and whose dollars fund these campaigns
are left
in the dark on how their dollars are being used to promote Obamacare.
The Truth in Obamacare Advertising Act brings light and transparency
to the administrations continued use of tax dollars to pay for
propaganda ads to prop up Obamacare by requiring communications that are
federally funded, directly or indirectly (through user fees), to advertise
or educate the public on provisions of Obamacare to follow rules
similar to the franking rules to which Congress already complies. The
final text of the bill can be found
here . And you can
read the
Democrat-Gazette's coverage of it here .
On Wednesday, the House
passed
H.R. 351 ,
the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, by a vote of
277-133. (See
Roll Call
#50 ).
H.R. 351 requires the Department of
Energy (DOE) to issue a final decision on applications to export
liquid natural gas (LNG) within 30 days of the conclusion of the NEPA
environmental review of the LNG facilities.
Moreover, the bill
provides for expedited judicial review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
circuit in which the LNG export facility will be located.
As a
condition of approval of authorization to export LNG, H.R. 351
requires the DOE to publicly disclose specific export destinations of LNG
exports.
On
Thursday, I joined the Arkansas Congressional delegation in sending a letter
to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom
Vilsack to request an extension of the loan repayment date for farmers
impacted by the collapse of Turner Grain until bankruptcy proceedings are
completed. Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) extended loan repayment
dates for farmers impacted by the collapse of Turner Grain last fall.
The repayment extension is set to expire for farmers during the week of
February 1, 2015. The full text of the letter can be found
here .
Thursday evening, I joined the Russellville
Chamber Banquet to celebrate another successful year at the
Russellville Chamber and the vital role it plays in promoting and capitalizing
on the potential of Russellville. It was an honor to give the evenings
keynote speech and have the opportunity to talk about building an
economic backbone in the community to support jobs, which requires
establishing and growing infrastructure and investing in the types of
education coveted by employers who are looking for communities that have the
bandwidth to fill high-skilled jobs. Read
more about the evening here !
Next week, in addition to suspensions, the House
will consider the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act
of 2015 (H.R. 50), the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R.
527), and legislation to fully repeal
Obamacare.
Finally, Id like to close
out this weeks From the Front by thanking all of the Arkansans who
visited my office while in Washington this week, including the Arkansas
Federation of the Blind, Rosi Smith of Arkansas Childrens Hospital,
the Arkansas Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development,
Ray Dillon of Deltic Timber, the Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas, the
Homstad family from Springdale, and Save the Children-Arkansas Head
Start! Great to see you! Safe travels
home.
From the Front...
