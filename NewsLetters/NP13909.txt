A Fair Fix for All
Friends,
To hear the White House tell it, ObamaCare has now been "fixed". Although the roll-out of the healthcare.gov website was certainly a trainwreck, it represents just one small part of all that is broken with the law.
Among the broken ObamaCare promises, the American people were told:
- Costs would go down (premiums have increased by as much as 400%)
- If you like your health plan, you can keep it (4 million+ have lost plans)
- Jobs would be created (jobs are being lost or reduced to part-time hours)
Fixing a broken website does nothing to fix these broken promises for the people now feeling the effects of ObamaCare. I believe that
t he
only fair fix for all
is a full repeal of the law, and replacing ObamaCare with patient-centered, free market reforms. You can learn more about the reforms I support
here.
As always, I encourage you to connect with me using my
website ,
twitter , and
facebook .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
