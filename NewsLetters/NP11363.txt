Dear Neighbor,
Did you know that fraudsters only need your name and Social Security
Number to file a fake tax return?
With less than a month left to file your taxes, I wanted to ensure that
you are armed with all the tools and knowledge to not fall victim to
tax-related scams.
Protect yourself from tax-related schemes:
1.
Store and protect your personal and financial information, such
as your Social Security Number (SSN) or your Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number (ITIN). Do not carry sensitive information with
you daily.
2.
Never provide financial or other personal information over the
phone or in an email, unless you initiate contact and know exactly who
is receiving the information.
3.
The IRS will contact you via mail if they need any information.
They will never contact you by email, social media, or text. Beware of
IRS email scams.
4.
File your tax return early - filing sooner gives identity
thieves less time to file tax returns using stolen SSNs.
5.
Protect your computer by installing firewalls and changing your
Internet passwords regularly.
6.
Do not use an open, unprotected Wi-Fi connection to file your
tax returns online.
7.
Check your credit report every 12 months through a major credit
reporting agency like Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion.
8.
Know and trust your tax return preparer.
9.
Never sign a blank tax return.
Don't fall victim to identity theft:
If the IRS sends you a notice that states -
1.
You already filed your return but actually didn't.
2.
You received more wages than your W2 says you earned in 2013.
3.
Your federal or state benefits changed even though an
adjustment never occurred.
If you are expecting a tax refund or other information after filing
your tax return and you do not receive any information in the mail from
the IRS.
If you have questions about a notice you received from the IRS,
immediately call the IRS Correspondence Hotline at 800-829-1040 or
click here
.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding any legislative or
district business please feel free to call one of my offices. Remember
that I work for you and my offices are here to help.
Sincerely,
Randy K. Weber

the

is
very
simple

COMMENT:
The
TD

where
you
can
declare
a
default
font-family,

text-alignment
(left/right/centered)
and
a
valign

top/middle/bottom

COMMENT:
By
declaring
a
default

on
the

you
avoid
the
need
to
apply
a

paragragh,
DIV
(Division),

in
your

COMMENT:
You
can
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's

Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than

because
they

Dear
Neighbor,
Did
you
know
that
fraudsters
only
need
your
name
and
Social
Security
Number
to
file
a
fake
tax
return?
With
less
than
a
month
left
to
file
your
taxes,
I
wanted
to
ensure
that
you
are
armed
with
all
the
tools
and
knowledge
to
not
fall
victim
to
tax-related
scams.
Protect
yourself
from
tax-related
schemes:
Store
and
protect
your
personal
and
financial
information,
such
as
your
Social
Security
Number
(SSN)
or
your
Individual
Taxpayer
Identification
Number
(ITIN).
Do
not
carry
sensitive
information
with
you
daily. Never
provide
financial
or
other
personal
information
over
the
phone
or
in
an
email,
unless
you
initiate
contact
and
know
exactly
who
is
receiving
the
information. The
IRS
will
contact
you
via
mail
if
they
need
any
information.
They
will
never
contact
you
by
email,
social
media,
or
text.
Beware
of
IRS
email
scams. File
your
tax
return
early
&#8211;
filing
sooner
gives
identity
thieves
less
time
to
file
tax

using
stolen
SSNs. Protect
your

by

online. Check
your
credit
report
every
12
months
through
a
major
credit
reporting
agency
like
Experian,
Equifax,
or
TransUnion.
Know
and
trust
your
tax
return
preparer. Never
sign
a
blank
tax
return.
Don't
fall
victim
to
identity
theft:
If
the
IRS
sends
you
a
notice
that
states
&#8211;
You
already
filed
your
return
but
actually
didn&#8217;t. You
received
more
wages
than
your
W2
says
you
earned
in
2013. Your
federal
or
state
benefits
changed
even
though
an
adjustment
never
occurred.
If
you
are
expecting
a
tax
refund
or
other
information
after
filing
your
tax
return
and
you
do
not
receive
any
information
in
the
mail
from
the
IRS.
