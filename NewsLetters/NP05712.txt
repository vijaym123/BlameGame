Dear Neighbor,
This week, Chautauqua County was
designated
as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). The designation will allow the county to receive Federal resources to further the coordination and development of drug control efforts among Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement officials.
Illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation and distribution are a significant problem in Chautauqua County. By designating Chautauqua County as a HIDTA, we can ensure that the county will receive the resources and assistance it needs to help combat this serious problem. This is another we way we can care for those who are victims of illegal drug activity and potentially prevent some of our neighbors from becoming victims.
OPEN EMPLOYEE TOWN HALL AT SITEL
Reed listens to staff members at the SITEL call center in Painted Post.
Yesterday we
visited the SITEL call center
in Painted Post, which specializes in customer service chat and opened up the floor for an open employee town hall to discuss new contracts, which has resulted in 200 new employee hires, and job growth inNY-23. We care about job growth in the Southern Tier. Businesses like SITEL are increasing projects with new contracts and bringing more good jobs right here in the district.
CUMMINS FACTORY TOUR IN LAKEWOOD
Reed with a member of the Cummins team .
Yesterday Tom Reed met with
members of the Cummins team
to discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with their production activity and opportunities for manufacturing not only in NY-23, but across our country. The challenges facing U.S. manufacturers are urgent, but our legislation will enable us to maintain our global leadership in manufacturing, create jobs, and care for an industry that employs over 12 million Americans.
CONTINUING THE FIGHT TO SAVE DUNKIRK POWER PLANT
The closing of the Dunkirk power plant would be devastating to local employees and taxpayers. Keeping local jobs and preventing unnecessary taxes has always been a priority, and the Sierra Club&rsquo;s lawsuit threatens both of these goals. Senator Young, Assemblyman Goodell, Mayor Dolce, and I have fought to preserve these jobs, and will continue fighting to make sure local taxpayers aren&rsquo;t left to foot the bill.
HONORING OUR VETS
Reed speaks with veterans and volunteers at Twin Tiers Honor Flight's send-off ceremony.
Over the weekend we
attended the Twin Tiers Honor Flight's ceremony
at the Corning American Legion, and had the chance to thank our veterans for all of their hard work and service. This was a way for us to show our veterans how much we care for them, and for us to gather, as a community, to tip our hats to those veterans who have done so much for us and our country. The Honor Flight Network continues to make visiting the war memorials accessible to all who have served.
WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?
Today we will be in Ithaca promoting National Manufacturing Day, visiting FoodLink, and visiting Geneva General Hospital.
P.S &ndash; Over the weekend we attended a walk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease.
Best,
Tom
