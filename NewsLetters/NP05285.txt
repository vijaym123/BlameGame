I know you&rsquo;ve put up with a heck of a lot of emails. But I&rsquo;m emailing again because this is critically important.
Friend &mdash; I know you&rsquo;ve put up with a heck of a lot of emails.
But I&rsquo;m emailing again because this is critically important. I NEED you to stop what you are doing NOW and read this:
In five Southern states, Democrats are tied.
If we win these toss-ups, we&rsquo;ll transform the political landscape as we win the South.
But if we lose them, it could cost us the Senate.
And this is not hyperbole: right now EVERY SINGLE ONE could go either way.
I want this badly, and I know you do too. But it&rsquo;s not enough for you to simply WANT Democrats to win.
You&rsquo;ve got to work for it, or we risk losing at the last second.
I&rsquo;ll ask directly: Will you pitch in now so we can win on November 4? Your gift will be TRIPLE-MATCHED.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Here&rsquo;s the truth, Friend.
In an election like this, we can&rsquo;t afford to be outmatched on the air OR on the ground.
We need every dollar possible so we can fight back against smears on the air and get every voter we can to the polls.
The more money we have, the more attacks we can counter and voters we can reach. And with just 13 days left, we don&rsquo;t have a minute to lose.
Bottom line:
you need to contribute now
&mdash; not tomorrow, NOW &mdash; to help secure that victory and our future.
The sooner we get your gift, the farther it will go towards helping Democrats win.
Friend, thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done so far. Democrats like you &mdash; who give what they can, when they can &mdash; are the reason we&rsquo;re going to win.
Thank you,
Joe Biden
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
