Susan Baird, a West Point liason, talks with a high
school student at my 2012 Academy Day event in
Hedgesville.
Dear Friends,
As a member of Congress, I have the
privilege of nominating a select group of individuals for admission to
the United States service academies: Army, Navy, Air Force and Merchant
Marine. Dozens of students I have nominated have been accepted to
these academies and have served us honorably in the armed
forces.
I encourage students interested in a career in the military and
their parents or guardians to attend one of my upcoming Academy Days to
learn more about the opportunities available at our nation's service
academies:
Sunday, September 21,
2014
2-4 p.m.
South Charleston High School
1 Eagle
Way
South Charleston, W.Va. 25309
Sunday, September
28, 2014
2-4 p.m.
Washington High School
300
Washington Patriot Dr.
Charles Town, W.Va. 25414
The
number of available appointments is highly competitive, so I encourage
students interested in applying to attend one of my Academy Days or
contact my Charleston office at (304) 925-5964 as soon as possible for
more information.
Applicants should be residents of the
Second Congressional District of West Virginia and between the ages of 17
and 22. The deadline for receiving all required information is
Friday, Oct. 31, 2014.
For an application for a
nomination from my office, please

In addition to a
nomination from a member of the U.S. House of Representatives or a
U.S. senator, candidates must apply to the service academy of their
choice. Information on the academies' admission requirements and standards
can be obtained by contacting the admissions offices of the
academies.
Serving our nation in the armed forces is an honor and a
great responsibility. I wish all of our applicants well and look
forward to meeting prospective candidates in South Charleston and Charles
Town in September.
Thank you
for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you
can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
If you will be traveling over the Labor Day weekend, I wish you and
your family a safe journey.
Sincerely,
