Dear Friend,
If we miss our
FEC deadline goal at midnight , our campaign won&rsquo;t turn into a pumpkin. But our team
will
be forced to change our game plan for the last weeks of the campaign.
With just 35 days left until the election, the last thing we want to do is change our tack. But in order to keep to the plan, we need to reach $145,OOO. And we only have 8 hours left to make that happen. We have a winning strategy. Contribute $5 before midnight to help us reach our $145,OOO goal and keep our campaign on course.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
I want to go back to the Senate to finish the work we&rsquo;ve started. The Tea Party House continues to pass budgets that would end Medicare as we know it, and Koch-backed candidates are going to fight tooth-and-nail against climate change legislation.
I want to go back to the Senate to raise the federal minimum wage and to guarantee equal pay for equal work. I want to make sure we&rsquo;re funding basic research for diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s and to expand educational opportunities for a new generation. And I&rsquo;m worried that if Republicans take over, none of that will happen. We still have work to do. Get us $5 closer to our $145,OOO goal before midnight and give us the tools we need to win in November.
Thanks.
