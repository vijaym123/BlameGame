NEW YORK TIMES:
Outside spending shows that Ami&#39;s is one of the few competitive house races
This is NO joke:
Republicans are spending $3.2 MILLION in the final week of this campaign.
Folks, we know this may sound grim, but this last-minute attack could sink us at the last possible moment.
Our LAST ad-buy deadline of the election is at midnight tomorrow, and this latest news means we can&rsquo;t risk falling even a single dollar short.
Please -- can you rush $5 or whatever you can and have Ami&rsquo;s back today?
