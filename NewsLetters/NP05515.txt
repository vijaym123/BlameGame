Dear Friend:
The health sciences have deep roots in Southwest Michigan. Today, local employers continue to lead the world in medical innovation while providing for thousands of jobs across the region.
We need to make sure that local legacy of delivering life-saving treatments and cures continues to grow in the 21st century and beyond.
That is why earlier this year I joined Congresswoman Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) in launching a new bipartisan initiative called
21st Century Cures . Our goal is to accelerate the pace at which medical treatments are discovered, developed, and delivered in the United States. In doing so, we can save patient lives and keep the United States the leader in medical innovation.
Every one of us has been impacted by a life-threatening disease in one way or another, which is why this work is so important.
Through a series of hearings, roundtables, and white papers, my committee has spent the past several months taking the first-ever comprehensive look at the cycle of cures, gathering invaluable input from patients, researchers, medical professionals, and advocates from across the country. At the end of this process, I will be unveiling legislation based on the feedback received over the past several months.
This week, I brought the 21st Century Cures conversation to Southwest Michigan with a roundtable at the newly opened Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine. Our roundtable brought together the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and health leaders from right here in our own community.

Southwest Michigan has long been synonymous with cutting-edge medical research and care
from our nationally recognized hospitals and manufacturers to our most recent addition, the WMU School of Medicine.
Michigan has an important role to play in this collaborative effort to provide more hope for families, and better treatments and cures for patients.
