The State of Our Union
The fact that I was even in the House
Chamber last week, listening to the
President deliver his message of
opportunity to the nation, is direct
evidence that government can and should
help provide the lifeline that middle class
families teetering on the brink many times
need. After all, serving as a Senator was
something that I couldnt imagine as
a teenager many decades ago when my father
fell ill and my mother was forced into the
role of both breadwinner and caregiver for
seven kids. But thanks to a federal worker
training program, VA benefits, student
loans, and even food stamps for a time, my
family made it.
Millions of families across Washington
state and our nation now stand at that same
crossroads. And last week those families
heard President Obama rightly focus on
specific proposals aimed at helping them.
Policies focused on creating jobs,
addressing our nations wage and
skills gaps, growing the middle class, and
investing in educational opportunities for
the next generation.
I am particularly glad that the
President focused so much attention on
education, the heart of true opportunity
for this generation and the next. As a
former preschool teacher, I have seen
first-hand the value of early childhood
education in making sure our youngest
students start off on the right track and
are ready to succeed. I also strongly
support President Obamas call to
raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage
has fallen further and further behind the
rising cost of living and we owe it to our
workers to make sure their hard work is
properly rewarded. I expect Congress to act
in the near future to give millions more
workers a raise and I am hopeful that
Republicans decide to work with us instead
of playing politics.
The President also talked about the
clear need to reform our immigration
system, support our veterans and wounded
warriors, reform our bloated and unfair tax
code, and invest in our nations
infrastructure priorities. The American
people are expecting their elected
officials to work together to tackle these
issues, and many more, over the coming
months and years. I am ready to keep
working to build on the bipartisan budget
deal, and I hope Republicans are ready to
join me at the table.

The Farm Bill: A Critical
Compromise
Building on momentum from the bipartisan
budget deal I reached with Congressman Paul
Ryan, the Farm Bill were now
considering represents another critical
compromise in which no one got everything
they wanted, but colleagues from both sides
of the aisle produced legislation that will
help our economy continue to grow.
As a state whose economy is driven by
thriving agriculture industries,
Washingtons farmers, growers, and
agricultural businesses gained significant
wins in this five-year Farm Bill. It
makes investments in jobs, provides
meaningful support for our fruit and
vegetable growers, and reforms many
programs while continuing the safety net
for farmers.
This bill also addresses several
economic issues of particular importance to
Washington state by continuing support for
specialty crops, rural development,
conservation, and alternative energy
programs, while investing in programs that
ensure Washingtons agriculture
industry remains competitive in the global
marketplace.
Despite the hard-fought victories for
agriculture programs and industries,
Im very disappointed that this
compromise makes harmful cuts to nutrition
programs for low-income families in
Washington state. Food assistance was
there for my family when we needed it, and
now is not the time to leave behind
families and children who need help putting
food on the table. Im
encouraged that this bill includes
increased assistance for food banks,
community food projects, and Congresswoman
DelBenes important employment and
training program, but Ill continue
working with my colleagues to strengthen
the SNAP program that families across our
country rely on.

IN-STATE for Dreamers
I believe all qualified students should
have the same opportunities to get a
college degree, regardless of their
immigration status. Undocumented
students are no different than their
classmates. They live in the same towns,
attend the same schools, and share the same
dreams
and they deserve an equal
chance to go to college and start
successful careers in this country.
That is why I was proud to
join my colleague Congressman Jared Polis
(D-CO) to introduce the
Investing
IN States To Achieve Tuition Equity
(IN-STATE) for Dreamers Act of 2014
.
The IN-STATE for Dreamers Act
establishes the American Dream Grant
program, which encourages states to
increase access to higher education for
low-income students, regardless of
immigration status. This program would
provide $750 million in need-based student
financial aid to states that set equitable
in-state tuition rates or offer state
financial aid to the thousands of
undocumented students who graduate from
American high schools each year.U.S.
Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Rep.
Joaquin Castro (D-TX) have also signed on
as original co-sponsors of this
legislation.

Womens Health Care is Not a
Political Football
In 2013, our nation saw yet another
record-breaking year of state legislatures
passing restrictive legislation barring
womens access to abortion services.
In fact, in the past three years, the
United States has enacted more of these
restrictionsthan in the previous ten
years combined. This means that now more
than ever it is our jobto protect
this decision for women, to fight for
womens health, and to ensure that
womens health does not become a
political football.
For this reason-- along with 18 other
members of my caucus -- I filed a brief
with the Supreme Court of the United States
in the case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby
Stores, Inc. And just like the many
attempts before this case, there are those
out there who would like the American
public to believe that this conversation is
anything but an attack on womens
health care. To them, its a debate
about freedom, except of
course the freedom for women to access
care. Its no different than
when we are told that attacks on abortion
rights arent an infringement on a
womens right to choose
theyre about religion or
states rights. Or when were
told that restricting emergency
contraception isnt about limiting
womens ability to make our own
family planning decisions
its about protecting pharmacists. Or
like just a few weeks ago, when we were
told that a certain former Republican
Governors comments about
womens libido was a
tone issue, rather than a
direct reflection of the Republican
partys misguided and arcane
policies.
The truth is this
is about contraception.
This
is
an attempt to limit a
womens ability to access care.
Allowing a womans boss to call the
shots about her access to birth control
should be inconceivable to all Americans in
this day and age, and takes us back to a
place in history when women had no voice or
choice. I will not allow Republicans
to turn back the clock on this issue that
was decided decades ago.

Beauty: Wild Olympics

After extensive engagement and
discussion with residents and local
business leaders on the Olympic Peninsula,
I was thrilled to join Representative Derek
Kilmer in reintroducing the Wild Olympics
Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act
of 2014 in the Senate and House of
Representatives. As part of an
ongoing effort to preserve and grow jobs on
the Olympic Peninsula, this legislation
would protect some of the most
environmentally sensitive parts of our
region for future generations while
protecting access to outdoor recreation
opportunities and private landowners
rights.
The Olympic Peninsulas wild
spaces are among Washington states
crown jewels, and the Wild Olympics
proposal supports the foundation of
conservation developed over
generations. This plan is the result
of several years of negotiation and
compromise, and is a step in the right
direction to protect our most treasured
places for our kids and grandkids. I
look forward to working with Representative
Kilmer to pass this bill into law.
