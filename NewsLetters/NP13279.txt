Dear Friend,
I hope you had an enjoyable
holiday and are looking forward to a happy and prosperous 2014.
Unfortunately, the new year is already bringing many Americans unpleasant
surprises related to their health insurance coverage under
Obamacare.
According to a
report in Time
this week, many
consumers whose Obamacare coverage started in 2014 will find [that]
these plans offer access to fewer providers than their previous plans
or [than] those [previously] offered to Americans with job-based
health insurance."
In 2009, as part of her argument in favor of
passing Obamacare, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the high
number of uninsured Americans that were being seen in emergency rooms.
However, a
new Harvard study
shows the expansion
of Medicaid under the health care exchanges has actually increased
trips to the ER, instead of reducing them. The sad truth is that more
Americans have actually lost their health insurance since the
implementation of Obamacare than have gained it.
As you learn more
about how Obamacare is affecting you and your family this year, please
share your stories with me at
Ellmers.house.gov .
My office worked hard to serve you in 2013 and will continue to
do so in 2014. In 2013, we responded to constituent questions and
requests by sending more than 35,000 pieces of mail, helped more than
1,400 constituents (including hundreds of veterans) deal with matters
involving government agencies, and assisted more than 350 constituents
who visited Washington, D.C. by providing tours of the
Capitol.
Visit the "Constituent Services" section of my website to see the
many other services my office provides to constituents of the Second
District. As always, please dont hesitate to contact my office for
assistance. You will find contact information for my Washington, Dunn and
