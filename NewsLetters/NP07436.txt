Dear Friend,
Ed mentioned the Republican National Committee&rsquo;s latest round of attacks, and while I have to pay attention to stuff like that, I&rsquo;m more focused on how
our
campaign is going to function.
With that in mind, here&rsquo;s a look at our fundraising for July. GOAL: $35,000
RAISED SO FAR: $25,275 NEEDED: $9,725
Supporters like you have helped us all year long, and Ed&rsquo;s going to need your help from now until election day.
Can you make a $5 contribution to power our campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
These calls are attacking Democrats like Ed all across the country. And in the end, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to stop it.
What we
can
do, however, is give Ed the resources to defend himself in case these attacks come to Massachusetts. You can be a part of that. Give $5, $10, or whatever makes sense for you, and help Ed keep fighting.
Thanks.
Colleen
