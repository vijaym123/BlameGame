Good
evening,
Earlier this week I sent out a poll asking for
your views on legislation that would authorize the President to arm and
train Syrian rebels. This evening, the House of Representatives is
expected to vote on this proposal as an amendment to the Continuing
Resolution to fund the government through December 11th.
I appreciate your input and engagement.
Tonight, after deep deliberation and based on the feedback I
received, I will be opposing this legislation.
It's an honor to represent
you.
