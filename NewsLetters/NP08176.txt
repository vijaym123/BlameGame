Summer Job and Tax Information
Summer is a great time to get good job experience and earn a little
spending money. But it's important to make sure you know
about tax
rules for students with summer jobs!
For information about forms you'll need to fill out, what tax
withholdings there might be on your paycheck, and what taxable income
you need to report, visit the Internal Revenue Service's students' page

your knowledge and experience in Washington, D.C.? Consider applying

nation's capital. It's a government and education program, and a
one-time $5,000 college scholarship.

obtained from high school principals, school counselors, or the
state-level selection contact. For more information, deadlines, and
state selection contacts, visit the USSYP website

Volunteer in Your Community
One of the ways that we best contribute to the future success of our
state is through giving back to our communities. Make the most of your
summer by taking
time to do volunteer work!
Every town has unique needs, so explore how you can best help in your
area. Here are some ideas:
*
Do you like being active and working on your feet? Volunteer
at a local food pantry or soup kitchen.
*
Are you an energetic people person? Spend time helping in a
senior center or at your local community center.
*
Are you a natural caregiver? Volunteer in a hospital or an
animal shelter.
*
Do you feel strongly about a particular political or social
issue? Volunteer for a local nonprofit, activism group, or political
campaign.
*
Not sure what you want to do? Contact you school's social
worker or a social service agency near you for help and ideas.
Visit Your Local Library
Summer is a great time to take a break from your regular school
schedule, but that doesn't mean you need to stop learning and
broadening your horizons. Visit your local library.
Reading is a wonderful way to expand your knowledge and your
vocabulary, which will help in your writing and communication skills.
Plus, it's a great way to find out which subjects you're most
interested in for future study.
If you're not sure where a library near you is, you can find it on the
Maine State Librarian's website
.
Visit Your Government, Your Neighborhood
One of the most exciting outreach initiatives that Senator King's staff
offers is the Your Government, Your Neighborhood program. Throughout
the year, the senator's representatives visit communities across Maine,
and make ourselves available for anyone to come by with questions and
concerns, or just to talk about how we can better serve you, in a
welcoming and informal environment. Feel free to stop by and visit us
at any of the upcoming YGYN events
.
