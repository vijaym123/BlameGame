January 29, 2015
Greetings from Washington D.C. -
It has been a busy few weeks in Washington as we kicked off the 114th Congress. From President Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union speech, to working to increase accountability for law enforcement and fighting against the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Take a few minutes to see all that I have been working on:
