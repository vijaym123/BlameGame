Perry
January 20, 2014
Today, we celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who, fifty years ago, stood on our national mall in the shadow of President Lincoln and shared his dream for our nation. His was a vision that all Americans might share the freedom to make our lives what we choose; that our children might climb higher than we.
Click on the picture below for a short video message from Congressman Perry about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Dr. King's life was dedicated to serving others. As we honor that legacy, it's not just a day to pause and reflect at a prayer breakfast - it's a day to ACT. Today, many Americans will gather around the country to participate in countless service projects with United We Serve. I encourage you to those efforts into an ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of others in your communities, your cities, and your country.
On behalf of my family, thank you to all who continue to honor the legacy of a great man and the promise of a great nation. May we continue to march toward the day when we respect the dignity and humanity of every person. May God bless Dr. King and the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
