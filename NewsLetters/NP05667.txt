Dear Friend,
I am proud to announce that on Friday, October 17th, I will be
hosting an 11th district hiring event in conjunction with the Illinois
Department of Employment Security at the Prisco Community Center in
Aurora. Job seekers are invited to come and connect with over 30 area
employers currently hiring for available positions. Veterans will receive
advanced entry with a special half-hour preview.
Job seekers who register at

opportunity to be individually matched with area employers. They may
also have the opportunity to schedule on-site
interviews.

friends and family to

Remember I am here to work
