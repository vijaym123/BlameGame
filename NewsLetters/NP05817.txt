MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now before the critical FEC deadline at midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt:
We need help.
And we don&rsquo;t know where else to turn: FIRST:
John Boehner's $6 MILLION ad blitz started pummeling Democrats coast-to-coast AND NOW: Republican outside groups just reserved $11.9 million MORE to attack our campaigns
It&rsquo;s just awful. Our fundraising deadline is TONIGHT -- and now, our budget gap is even bigger.
David, we still have a few hours to catch up. But we have to pull together 6 donations from 60659 by tonight&rsquo;s midnight fundraising deadline to close the gap. Please -- can you chip in whatever you can before tonight&rsquo;s federal fundraising deadline? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
