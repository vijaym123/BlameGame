15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Last night, the
House passed a bill to protect families from the exorbitant flood insurance rates . This bill will hold FEMA accountable to communities, increase FEMAs transparency to homeowners, and help protect taxpayers.
While weve made progress, our work is far from over. In order to fully protect both homeowners and taxpayers, we need to provide an opportunity for the private market to get involved in the selling of flood insurance.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
