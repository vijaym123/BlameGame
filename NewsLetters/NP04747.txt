emailing for $5
I&rsquo;m writing to ask for your help. Election Day is tomorrow. Please, David -- Can you chip in $5 or more right now?
All Donations Now Quadruple-Matched
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking:
The American people are with us on all of the big issues. They want to break the gridlock. They want to raise the minimum wage, pass equal pay laws, and close all those tax loopholes for millionaires. You know it. I know it. The polls show it.
Now I just need a Congress that&rsquo;s willing to work with me. And that means getting as many Democratic voters to the polls as we can this Tuesday.
Every dollar you give right now helps us knock on another door. Every dollar helps us turn out another vote.
Right now, we need 6 people from the 60659 zip code to chip in before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. I&rsquo;m counting on you to be one of those, David. Can I count on you one last time? https://secure.dccc.org/Chip-In
Thanks,
Barack Obama
