Capitol Update
Congressman Cook: Only a Strong America can Guarantee a Peaceful World
During the Cold War, we learned that peace only comes through strength.
The malaise and military decline of the post-Vietnam years under
President Jimmy Carter set the stage for Russian aggression abroad and
uncertainty among our allies. President Ronald Reagan won the Cold War
and ended the threat of Russian domination of eastern Europe for a
quarter century through a policy of military strength at home and
resolute leadership abroad. Tragically, the Obama Administration has
ignored this history and through its policies of military cuts at home
and abandonment of allies abroad, set the stage for Russia's current
invasion of Crimea.
America has spent the last decade at war, and the American people are
tired of conflict abroad. There is no military solution that will
reverse the Russian conquest of Crimea, but there are steps we can take
to prevent further aggression. The Obama Administration's extremely
limited sanctioning of less than two dozen Russian officials and
offering of rations (but not weapons) to Ukraine is a pitiful response
and will do nothing to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from
invading eastern Ukraine.
Instead of these limited sanctions, America should impose a travel ban
and asset freeze on all top Russian government and military officials
as well as the top officials in strategic state-owned enterprises such
as Gazprom. This would put pressure on Putin and his key allies
immediately, which could restrain further Russian aggression.
Additionally, America should consider expanded arms sales not only to
Ukraine but to our key eastern European allies. Allowing victims of
aggression to defend themselves is common sense, not a provocation.
Finally, the United States should reopen negotiations to build a
missile shield in eastern Europe that will protect not only against
attacks from rogue states like Iran, but from rogue empires like
Russia. Reagan's stalwart support for American missile defense was a
key part of our Cold War victory.
More importantly, however, America must rebuild a military that was
weakened by a decade of protracted warfare and now faces potentially
crippling cuts due to sequestration. With Russia on the move in Europe,
this is hardly the time for America to force our military to do more
with less. The President is threatening to shrink the Army to its
smallest level since World War II, close crucial military bases, and
reduce military pay raises. This introduces the very real threat that
our armed services will be left without the resources needed to carry
out large-scale military actions. Putin and his generals see these cuts
to America's armed forces as a sign of weakness and evidence that this
is their time to rebuild their empire in Europe.
It's time for the Obama Administration to go back to the drawing board
with its budget and maintain defense funding. America should not go
abroad looking for foes to fight, but it must have a military capable
of defeating any threat. In particular, a significant investment in
expanding our naval and air forces will ensure that we are ready to
face down the threat of not only terrorists and insurgent militias, but
the armored might of powerful nations such as Russia. This will send a
message to Putin that America is ready to meet its commitments to
defend our allies and that the administration's claim that invasions
and annexations are a relic of the 20th century must be taken
seriously.
History has shown that aggressors like Russia understand only the
language of force, and so far the Obama Administration's neglect of our
military has been speaking much louder than its diplomatic threats. A
Reagan-style military strengthening coupled with effective sanctions
and meaningful support for our allies will make sure that Crimea is the
final act of Putin's aggression. Only a strong America can guarantee a
peaceful world.

The American People Deserve Answers on Benghazi
The bottom line is a U.S. Ambassador and four of our fellow Americans
died on September 11, 2012 after the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was
attacked by terrorists, and this administration is not being held
accountable. Since the attack, I have taken part in multiple hearings
to investigate why the U.S. State Department still has not assigned
responsibility for this tragedy.
I have signed onto H. Res. 36, which calls for the establishment of a
select committee to investigate the September 11, 2012 attack. This
committee would have 90 days from their initial meeting to investigate
and issue a definitive report to the House on what happened during the
attack, whether any improper conduct occurred, and what can be done to
prevent similar attacks.
The oversight process is one of the most important of my duties as a
Congressman. Please be assured I am committed to getting to the bottom
of this tragedy.

Veterans' Corner
Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day Sunday March 30, 2014
As a Vietnam veteran, Congressman Cook understands the need to show
appreciation to those who serve. Veterans of Vietnam did not receive
the warm and grateful welcome home they deserved. It was commonplace
for these Veterans to be neglected, insulted, and even spat on by
anti-war activists upon returning home. This inability to separate
opposition to a policy from opposition to our troops severely harmed
our Veterans. While in the State Legislature, Congressman Cook was
proud to author a bill recognizing Vietnam Veterans for the heroes they
are by designating March 30 as the Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day.
This Sunday, make sure to thank a Vietnam Veteran for their service.

Capitol
Update
Congressman
Cook :
Only
a
Strong
America
can
Guarantee
a
Peaceful
World
During
the
Cold
War,
we
learned
that
peace
only
comes
through
strength.
The
malaise
and
military
decline
of
the
post-Vietnam
years
under
President
Jimmy
Carter
set
the
stage
for
Russian
aggression
abroad
and
uncertainty
among
our
allies.
President
Ronald
Reagan
won
the
Cold
War
and
ended
the
threat
of
Russian
domination
of
eastern
Europe
for
a
quarter
century
through
a
policy
of
military
strength
at
home
and
resolute
leadership
abroad.
Tragically,
the
Obama
Administration
has
ignored
this
history
and
through
its
policies
of
military
cuts
at
home
and
abandonment
of
allies
abroad,
set
the
stage
for
Russia&#8217;s
current
invasion
of
Crimea.
America
has
spent
the
last
decade
at
war,
and
the
American
people
are
tired
of
conflict
abroad.
There
is
no
military
solution
that
will
reverse
the
Russian
conquest
of
Crimea,
but
there
are
steps
we
can
take
to
prevent
further
aggression.
The
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
extremely
limited
sanctioning
of
less
than
two
dozen
Russian
officials
and
offering
of
rations
(but
not
weapons)
to
Ukraine
is
a
pitiful
response
and
will
do
nothing
to
deter
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
from
invading
eastern
Ukraine.
Instead
of
these
limited
sanctions,
America
should
impose
a
travel
ban
and
asset
freeze
on
all
top
Russian
government
and
military
officials
as
well
as
the
top
officials
in
strategic
state-owned
enterprises
such
as
Gazprom.
This
would
put
pressure
on
Putin
and
his
key
allies
immediately,
which
could
restrain
further
Russian
aggression.
Additionally,
America
should
consider
expanded
arms
sales
not
only
to
Ukraine
but
to
our
key
eastern
European
allies.
Allowing
victims
of
aggression
to
defend
themselves
is
common
sense,
not
a
provocation.
Finally,
the
United
States
should
reopen
negotiations
to
build
a
missile
shield
in
eastern
Europe
that
will
protect
not
only
against
attacks
from
rogue
states
like
Iran,
but
from
rogue
empires
like
Russia.
Reagan&#8217;s
stalwart
support
for
American
missile
defense
was
a
key
part
of
our
Cold
War
victory.
More
importantly,
however,
America
must
rebuild
a
military
that
was
weakened
by
a
decade
of
protracted
warfare
and
now
faces
potentially
crippling
cuts
due
to
sequestration.
With
Russia
on
the
move
in
Europe,
this
is
hardly
the
time
for
America
to
force
our
military
to
do
more
with
less.
The
President
is
threatening
to
shrink
the
Army
to
its
smallest
level
since
World
War
II,
close
crucial
military
bases,
and
reduce
military
pay
raises.
This
introduces
the
very
real
threat
that
our
armed
services
will
be
left
without
the
resources
needed
to
carry
out
large-scale
military
actions.
Putin
and
his
generals
see
these
cuts
to
America&#8217;s
armed
forces
as
a
sign
of
weakness
and
evidence
that
this
is
their
time
to
rebuild
their
empire
in
Europe.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
Obama
Administration
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
its
budget
and
maintain
defense
funding.
America
should
not
go
abroad
looking
for
foes
to
fight,
but
it
must
have
a
military
capable
of
defeating
any
threat.
In
particular,
a
significant
investment
in
expanding
our
naval
and
air
forces
will
ensure
that
we
are
ready
to
face
down
the
threat
of
not
only
terrorists
and
insurgent
militias,
but
the
armored
might
of
powerful
nations
such
as
Russia.
This
will
send
a
message
to
Putin
that
America
is
ready
to
meet
its
commitments
to
defend
our
allies
and
that
the
administration&#8217;s
claim
that
invasions
and
annexations
are
a
relic
of
the
20th
century
must
be
taken
seriously.
History
has
shown
that
aggressors
like
Russia
understand
only
the
language
of
force,
and
so
far
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
neglect
of
our
military
has
been
speaking
much
louder
than
its
diplomatic
threats.
A
Reagan-style
military
strengthening
coupled
with
effective
sanctions
and
meaningful
support
for
our
allies
will
make
sure
that
Crimea
is
the
final
act
of
Putin&#8217;s
aggression.
Only
a
strong
America
can
guarantee
a
peaceful
world.

As

Veterans

It

This
