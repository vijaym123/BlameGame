Dear Friend,
This week was a rarity in Washington. Democrats and Republicans came
together in the House of Representatives to pass two important bills: a
budget bill and the National Defense Authorization Act. I voted for
both of these compromises, and I want to report back to you about what
they'll accomplish and why I voted for them.
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013
The bipartisan budget agreement was crafted by Congressman Paul Ryan
(R-WI) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA). In the aftermath of budget
brinksmanship and a government shutdown, this compromise would set
overall discretionary spending for the current fiscal year at $1.012
trillion-about halfway between the Senate budget level of $1.058
trillion and the House budget level of $967 billion. The agreement will
alleviate some of the pain sequestration is causing to programs that
help seniors, children, and families in New Hampshire, and it will
reduce the irresponsible cuts at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, at the New
Hampshire National Guard, and other places across New Hampshire.
I voted for the bill, but it was not a vote I took lightly, and I spoke
on the floor of the House
to express my concerns with this legislation.
Although the bill reduced the deficit by about $23 billion over 10
years, the two year bipartisan budget failed to extend unemployment
insurance. This means 1,300 Granite Staters
will lose vital benefits on December 28, and an
additional 3,900 New Hampshire workers
will lose their benefits in the first six months of
2014 if Congress doesn't act soon.
Traditionally, extending unemployment benefits has enjoyed bipartisan
support. Republicans never failed
to extend unemployment
benefits under President George W. Bush. President Reagan
so firmly believed
in the importance of unemployment insurance that he announced his
support in his 1983 State of the Union Address.
Americans who benefit from emergency unemployment insurance are not
moochers, nor are they lazy. They are workers who ran into hard luck
and lost their job through no fault of their own. Many of them rely on
emergency unemployment compensation to keep their families out of
poverty and a roof over their heads.
But ultimately, the people of New Hampshire sent me to Washington to
make hard compromises, and this was one of them. This budget deal wasn't
what I wanted, but as the Wall Street Journal said
, it
is "the least bad budget deal".
After voting for the budget, I joined 166 lawmakers in urging Speaker
John Boehner (R-OH) not to adjourn the House of Representatives for the
year without allowing a vote to extend emergency unemployment
compensation.
National Defense Authorization Act
For 52 consecutive years the U.S. government has enacted a National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to provide for the security of our
nation and strength of our Armed Forces. This year, although the house
passed an NDAA, the Senate has not. On Wednesday, the House of
Representatives passed a bicameral compromise NDAA for Fiscal Year
2014.
It is Congress' solemn responsibility to ensure the safety of our
nation and the strength of our Armed Services. I am proud that the bill
includes a number of key priorities that are important to Granite
Staters: addressing PTSD, protecting soldiers' health, and saving
taxpayers money.
The bill also includes a key provision barring additional rounds of
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), which protects the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard does vital work on behalf of
our national defense, and I welcome this outstanding news.
While this bill is not everything I wanted, it represents a reasonable
compromise that both parties and chambers of Congress can agree on.
You can read more details about the legislation here
.
Final Thoughts
As 2013 comes to a close, I share much of your frustration and
disappointment with the lack of progress made by the 113th Congress.
Next year, the challenge facing Washington will not be how to pass a
budget. It will be how to reclaim the American Dream: to build an
economy where hard work merits fair pay. I hope that Washington will
build on recent compromises and address the priorities that Granite
Staters sent me here to focus on: creating good jobs, giving every
child a shot at a good education, preserving Social Security and
Medicare, and helping families access quality, affordable health care.
It won't be easy, but as this week proved, it's not impossible.
Best Wishes,
Carol

Dear
Friend,
This
week
was
a
rarity
in
Washington.
Democrats
and
Republicans
came
together
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
pass
two
important
bills:
a
budget
bill
and
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
I
voted
for
both
of these
compromises,
and
I
want
to
report
back
to
you
about
what
they&#8217;ll
accomplish
and
why
I
voted
for
them.
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013
The
bipartisan
budget
agreement
was
crafted
by
Congressman
Paul
Ryan
(R-WI)
and
Senator
Patty
Murray
(D-WA).
In
the
aftermath
of
budget
brinksmanship
and
a
government
shutdown,
this
compromise
would
set
overall
discretionary
spending
for
the
current
fiscal
year
at
$1.012
trillion&#8212;about
halfway
between
the
Senate
budget
level
of
$1.058
trillion
and
the
House
budget
level
of
$967
billion.
The
agreement
will
alleviate
some
of
the
pain
sequestration
is
causing
to
programs
that
help
seniors,
children,
and
families
in
New
Hampshire,
and
it
will
reduce
the
irresponsible
cuts
at
Portsmouth
Naval
Shipyard,
at
the
New
Hampshire
National
Guard,
and
other
places
across
New
Hampshire.
I
voted
for
the
bill,
but
it
was
not
a
vote
I
took
lightly,
and
I
spoke
on
the
floor
of
the
House
to
express
my
concerns
with
this
legislation.
Although
the
bill
reduced
the
deficit
by
about
$23
billion
over
10
years,
the
two
year
bipartisan
budget
failed
to
extend
unemployment
insurance.
This
means
1,300
Granite
Staters
will
lose
vital
benefits
on
December
28,
and
an
additional
3,900
New
Hampshire
workers
will
lose
their
benefits
in
the
first
six
months
of
2014
if
Congress
doesn&#8217;t
act
soon.
Traditionally,
extending
unemployment
benefits
has
enjoyed
bipartisan
support.
Republicans
never
failed
to
extend
unemployment
benefits
under
President
George
W.
Bush.
President
Reagan
so
firmly
believed
in
the
importance
of
unemployment
insurance
that
he
announced
his
support
in
his
1983
State
of
the
Union
Address.
Americans
who
benefit
from
emergency
unemployment
insurance
are
not
moochers,
nor
are
they
lazy.
They
are
workers
who
ran
into
hard
luck
and
lost
their
job
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
Many
of
them
rely
on
emergency
unemployment
compensation
to
keep
their
families
out
of
poverty
and
a
roof
over
their
heads.
But
ultimately,
the
people
of
New
Hampshire
sent
me
to
Washington
to
make
hard
compromises,
and
this
was
one
of
them.
This
budget
deal
wasn&#8217;t
what
I
wanted,
but
as
the
Wall
Street
Journal
said ,
it
is
&#8220;the
least
bad
budget
deal&#8221;.
After
voting
for
the
budget,
I
joined
166
lawmakers
in
urging
Speaker
John
Boehner
(R-OH)
not
to
adjourn
the
House
of
Representatives
for
the
year
without
allowing
a
vote
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
compensation.
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
For
52
consecutive
years
the
U.S.
government
has
enacted
a
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
to
provide
for
the
security
of
our
nation
and
strength
of
our
Armed
Forces.
This
year,
although
the
house
passed
an
NDAA,
the
Senate
has
not.
On
Wednesday,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
bicameral
compromise
NDAA
for
Fiscal
Year
2014.
It
is
Congress&#8217;
solemn
responsibility
to
ensure
the
safety
of
our
nation
and
the
strength
of
our
Armed
Services.
I
am
proud
that
the
bill
includes
a
number
of
key
priorities
that
are
important
to
Granite
Staters:
addressing
PTSD,
protecting
soldiers&#8217;
health,
and
saving
taxpayers
money.
The
bill
also
includes
a
key
provision
barring
additional
rounds
of
Base
Realignment
and
Closure
(BRAC),
which
protects
the
Portsmouth
Naval
Shipyard.
Portsmouth
Naval
Shipyard
does
vital
work
on
behalf
of
our
national
defense,
and
I
welcome
this
outstanding
news.
While
this
bill
is
not
everything
I
wanted,
it
represents
a
reasonable
compromise
that
both
parties
and
chambers
of
Congress
can
agree
on.

Final
Thoughts
As
2013
comes
to
a
close,
I
share
much
of
your
frustration
and
disappointment
with
the
lack
of
progress
made
by
the
113th
Congress.
Next
year,
the
challenge
facing
Washington
will
not

how
to

It
will
be
how
to
reclaim
the
American
Dream:
to
build
an
economy
where
hard

merits
fair

I
hope
that
Washington
will
build
on
recent

and
address
