WHAT. A. WEEK. Boehner though he could beat us by bashing Obama again &hellip; and
again &hellip; and
again &hellip; and
again &hellip;
But Boehner&rsquo;s secret money scheme backfired -- BIG TIME!
Today, we got a batch of new polls showing Democrats surging -- even in Republican states.
These races are BRUTALLY close, but we can win! We can fight Boehner's attacks, expand our get-out-the-vote operations, and complete a brilliant comeback!
... &hellip;but first we need 25,OOO donors to chip in before Tuesday&rsquo;s final ad buy deadline.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
