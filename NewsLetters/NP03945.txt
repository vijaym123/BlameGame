If you agree, click here to say you&rsquo;re still standing with President Obama &gt;&gt; The President saved the auto industry; brought our dependence on foreign oil and domestic emissions to historic lows; and stopped health insurance costs from ballooning out of control.
Often in the face of incredible obstruction, the President has continued to fight for us and lead us forward. Will you add your name now and say that you&rsquo;re still standing with President Obama in his final two years in office? SIGN YOUR NAME
