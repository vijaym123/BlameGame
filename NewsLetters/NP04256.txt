Congressman
Yoder on President Obama's Unconstitutional Amnesty
Plan
"The Presidents plan to grant amnesty to those who have entered
this country illegally is unconstitutional. I strongly oppose his
unilateral efforts to ignore federal law and will support any legislative
means possible to stop these actions including using the power of the
purse to defund these unprecedented
measures.
"If there was any question about the unlawful nature of this
plan, we need only to look back to President Obamas own words:
'there are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in
terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system. That for me to
simply, through executive order, ignore those congressional mandates
would not conform with my appropriate role as
President.'
"As many as 25 times, the President has said that
the maneuvers which he is taking today are not allowable under our
system of democracy. These actions ignore the will of the people who
elected and sent their representation to Washington and Congress should
use all of the tools at their disposal to prohibit these
unconstitutional acts."

Tragedy for Local
Community in Israeli Terror Attack
I was
saddened to learn that Hyman Brand Hebrew Academy (HBHA) graduate
Rabbi Kalman (Cary) Levine and Rabbi Mosheh Twersky, uncle of HBHA faculty
member Rabbi Meshulum Twersky, were killed in last week's attack in
Jerusalem. Our hearts and prayers are with the victims and their
families here in Kansas City and in Israel. I condemn this tragic act of
violence.

Visiting UPS in Lenexa, KS
Last week I had the privilege to meet employees and recognize safe
drivers at UPS in Lenexa. This UPS facility in Lenexa has more than 3000
employees during this peak Holiday season. Also, thank you to UPS for
being one of the largest employers of military veterans in the
country and making it a priority to hire veterans and reservists. I
appreciated the chance to visit with so many employees.

Sponsoring Legislation to Make College More
Affordable
I am a proud cosponsor of
H.R. 5578, the Employer Participation in Refinancing Act.
This
legislation creats a new pathway to paying off student loan debts and
creates new employer incentives.
Learn more information
here.
The Employer Participation in
Refinancing Act provides incentives to employers to subsidize student loan
refinancing for their employees in the same way employers today can
subsidize ongoing tuition
expenses.
Benefits to employees
include:
Will receive a tax-exempt benefit
of up to $5,250 per year to reduce the cost of their refinanced
loan.
Employees with good credit
may be able to refinance their federal student loan debt with private
lenders at lower interest rates while still receiving many of the same
protections provided by federal
loans.
Benefits to employers
include:
Permits employers to assist employees who already
have student loans to the same degree they can help employees with
continued education.
Helps companies
recruit and retain young, educated
talent.
Employers can deduct the subsidy provided to
employees.
