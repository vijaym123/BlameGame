Statement on
President Obama's Immigration
Proposals
11/19/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn has released the following statement in
response to reports on President Obama's immigration
proposals:
"If the President takes steps to
change the status of millions of people in this country illegally, he
will be disregarding the will of the American people and throwing
away the opportunity for a productive, bipartisan relationship with
Congress.
Many options for action will be put forward and considered
once the President has completely unveiled his plan. I am on the record
calling for the House Appropriations Committee to include language,
in all relevant appropriations legislation for the next fiscal year,
prohibiting the use of funds to implement the Presidents new amnesty
policies.
The people of the Fifth Congressional District do not
support amnesty, and I wholeheartedly agree with them. I will take all
productive steps in Congress to prevent the President from granting
amnesty via Executive
Orders."

Lamborn (CO-05)
