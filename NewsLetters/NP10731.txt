By: Rep. Paul Broun, M.D.
America once prided itself as being a land of opportunity
a place where one could rise through the ranks, build a successful business, and achieve the American dream.

While Caterpillar has stated that they have complied with all U.S. tax laws and paid everything they owe, Senator Carl Levin spent five hours during a Senate subcommittee hearing trying to show that the company - and others like it - are harming, rather than trying to boost, our economy by following the tax laws that Congress wrote.
