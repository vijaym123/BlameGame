NBC
reports there are &ldquo;more close races than we&rsquo;ve seen in a decade -- SEVEN Senate races are within three points.&rdquo;
And if Democrats win the entire Senate? Republicans say
&ldquo;it would be an unbelievable disaster. The [GOP] would be devastated.&rdquo;
In 48 hours, we&rsquo;re launching our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push -- our LAST chance to mobilize the voters we need to win. But we&rsquo;re short -- $1,790,714 short. And if we can&rsquo;t plug that hole in 48 hours, it&rsquo;ll mean fewer Democratic voters&hellip; and a possible last-second loss.
But YOU can clinch our win. Will you pitch in to our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push before the end-of-month deadline in 48 hours? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
When the difference between winning and losing could come down to a few thousand votes, EVERYTHING depends on how strong our ground game is. That&rsquo;s why this final weekend push is THE most important.
As Vice President Biden wrote you this morning,
&ldquo;The side that works the hardest in the next six days is the one that will win. Let&rsquo;s make sure it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;
Will you give to ensure the most successful final GOTV weekend EVER? We&rsquo;re counting on you! All gifts will be triple-matched until midnight!
Let&rsquo;s win this!
