Rep. Miller Presents Service Medals Honoring WWII Veteran William Netzloff, Jr.
Harrison Township, MI &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) honored the service and sacrifice of the late WWII veteran, William Netzloff, Jr., who was killed in action in 1944.
In recognition of his service, she presented
medals to Netzloff&#8217;s sister, Beverly Netzloff of Shelby Township.
&#8220;Today, we honored William Netzloff, Jr. for his selfless service to this nation during WWII,&#8221;
Miller said after the presentation.
&#8220;This long-awaited acknowledgement comes less than two weeks after this country celebrated the 70 th
anniversary of D-Day where U.S. and allied troops stormed the heavily-fortified beaches of Normandy
&#8211; a major turning point in the War. The brave troops that fought during WWII, including William Netzloff, are amongst the world&#8217;s greatest defenders of freedom and democracy. It was an honor to present Beverly with these medals on behalf of a nation eternally
thankful for William&#8217;s service.
He was truly part of this nation&#8217;s greatest generation.&#8221;
The former Mr. William Netzloff, Jr.
(1920-1944) was 23 years old and working as a farm laborer in 1943 when he was drafted to serve in the U.S. Army during WWII.
He fought in North Africa, Sicily and Rome during the War and was
fatally wounded in 1944 during the Battle of Anizo.
Originally buried in Naruto, Italy, William&#8217;s remains were later relocated in 1948 to the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Detroit.
Beverly Netzloff, William&#8217;s sister, was in high school when William was drafted
and was unable to say goodbye to him before he was killed in action.
Mr. Netzloff&#8217;s family was presented with the following service awards:
