DONATIONS NOW 4X-MATCHED With 24 hours until the election, we are opening an emergency 4X-MATCH to help us reach our vote goals. Quadruple Matched Donations Remaining:
David -- We&rsquo;re looking at the last slate of poll numbers before Election Day. And guess what?
Democrats are surging! NBC has Democrats in a DEAD-HEAT! FOX, CNN, and USA Today all have Democrats UP by 1!
Our hard work is paying off at the best time! Together we can deliver a crushing blow to Boehner and his "Say No" Republicans in tomorrow&rsquo;s election.
But we have one more obstacle to overcome.
The budget gap.
During this last week Republicans have funneled $26,000,000 into their campaigns. That's a lot of zeros.
President Obama has called us to action and we are stepping up, but we aren't there yet.
David -- Election Day is tomorrow. This is our last chance to make the difference. Can you chip in today?
