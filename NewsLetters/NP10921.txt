A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
March 31, 2014
Dear friends,
Our Veterans Deserve Better: More Veterans seek help from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for hearing loss than any other
disability facing them today. The demand for audiology services is
growing at nearly 10% per year. With limited resources, the VA is
struggling to keep up.
Veterans across the country are being forced to wait weeks, even
months, for an appointment. In Marshfield, WI, Roger, a 70-year-old
Vietnam War Veteran, sought help from the VA for his hearing loss. He
was informed he could not get an appointment for six months.
Unfortunately, Roger couldn't wait that long, so he went to his local
hearing aid specialist and was seen that day. Roger was willing to pay
out of pocket for his hearing aids but that is not an option for many
of our Veterans - nor should it have to be.
Currently, the VA is only allowed to use audiologists to provide
hearing services to Veterans. While audiology doctors are a great
resource for the VA, there are not enough of them to keep up with the
demand and needs of Veterans like Roger.
However, there is another option. Hearing aid specialists go through a
one to two year apprenticeship-training period, complete a
comprehensive written exam, and are certified by the state to fit and
sell hearing aids. They are more than qualified to support the
specialized services of audiology doctors by fitting, adjusting, and
making minor repairs to hearing aids. I've introduced a bill, H.R.
3508, that would give both our Veterans and audiologists much needed
relief while conserving resources at the VA. If the provisions of this
bill are implemented, VA audiologists can turn their attention to
specialized cases and complex conditions, and people like Roger won't
have to wait six months for simple appointments to get hearing aids.
I testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee this week about
the importance of considering this legislation. Our Veterans deserve
better and I will keep you posted on the bill's progress.
We need you! Booths for April's job fair in Rice Lake are filling-up!
If you have available job opportunities, please go to Duffy.house.gov
or emailJesse Garza
for
registration information.
In addition to our traditional job fair, we are also featuring a
training workshop for those interested in the Library of Congress'
"Veterans History Project." This workshop will train volunteers on how
to record first-hand accounts of our Veterans stories so that those
experiences may be preserved for future generations. Click on the image

Today's interns, tomorrow's Members of Congress: Spring and summer
internship opportunities are available in all of our offices. If you,
or someone you know, is interested in learning about the inner-workings
of our representative body, and are at least eighteen years of age,
please send a current resume and your availability to Ryan McCormack
.
As always, thank you for the continued privilege of being your
Representative in Congress. Please continue to keep me informed of the
issues that mean the most to you and your family. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

A

from

Dear
friends,
Our
Veterans
Deserve
Better:
More
Veterans
seek
help
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
for
hearing
loss
than
any
other
disability
facing
them
today.
The
demand
for
audiology
services
is
growing
at
nearly
10%
per
year.
With
limited
resources,
the
VA
is
struggling
to
keep
up.
Veterans
across
the
country
are
being
forced
to
wait
weeks,
even
months,
for
an
appointment.
In
Marshfield,
WI,
Roger,
a
70-year-old
Vietnam
War
Veteran,
sought
help
from
the
VA
for
his
hearing
loss.
He
was
informed
he
could
not
get
an
appointment
for
six
months.
Unfortunately,
Roger
couldn&#8217;t
wait
that
long,
so
he
went
to
his
local
hearing
aid
specialist
and
was
seen
that
day.
Roger
was
willing
to
pay
out
of
pocket
for
his
hearing
aids
but
that
is
not
an
option
for
many
of
our
Veterans
&#8211;
nor
should
it
have
to
be.
Currently,
the
VA

While
audiology

there
is

Hearing
