Dear Friend,
Our veterans, service members, and their families have devoted their lives in service to our country, and as the son of a Navy veteran I know we must honor the promises made to them by helping them access the support they have earned.
Our office is here to serve those who have served us, and it has a track record of getting answers and getting results for our veterans. In the last 19 months, our office has returned nearly
$2 million
to our veterans who were owed compensation.
We're a constituent service organization which is why I want to bring the VA directly to the Hudson Valley to allow veterans and their families to have their questions answered. On
Monday, August 4th
I'll be hosting
Veterans Benefits Workshops
in both Mahopac and Goshen. The workshops will take place at the
Mahopac Public Library
from
10 AM to 12:30 PM
and at the
Orange County Emergency Services Center
from
2:30 PM to 5:00 PM .
The workshops will provide free advice and guidance for veterans and their families who need assistance filing their veterans' claims applications, completing required paperwork, and understanding VA compensation claims such as medical, service-connected disability, educational, pension, and survivor benefits.

I hope you'll come listen to experts about resources available to our veterans and their families. Although no reservation is required, you can schedule a one-on-one appointment with a Veterans Benefit Administration representative, a Veterans Advocate in my office, or for more information, please call my office at (845) 561-1259. Additionally, please be sure to bring all
applicable documentation
to assist in filing your veteran&rsquo;s compensation claims.
I hope to see you there!
Sincerely,
