Happy Thanksgiving
Dear Friend,
Thanksgiving is a time for family and a time to think about what we're
thankful for.
Please click HERE
or below to view my Thanksgiving video message to you.
I hope we take a moment this week to remember those who fought to
protect us, those who never returned, and the families who have an
empty seat at their table this Thanksgiving.
Coming from a family with 10 kids of mixed political views, I
understand that we may disagree from time to time - we may even
strongly disagree - but that's what's great about this country: even
with our differences we can agree that we live in a great nation with
much to be thankful for.
So let's get serious about protecting our Republic and its
Constitution, and preserve this great country for future generations.
As always, you can follow everything I am working on in Arizona and
Washington, D.C. through my website (http://gosar.house.gov
) on Twitter @repgosar
, or through Facebook
at Representative Paul Gosar.
Sincerely,
Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S.
Member of Congress

that's
what's
great
