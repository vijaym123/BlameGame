David -- Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s
obsessed
with Illinois.
In fact, he&rsquo;s already spent $3.3 million in the Land of Lincoln to defeat strong Democrats like Brad Schneider.
Why? Boehner can&rsquo;t stand the fact that Brad&rsquo;s fighting so hard for issues like equal pay for equal work, LGBT rights, and protecting our Great Lakes. Illinois&rsquo;s a Democratic state --
a progressive state
-- and we need to fight to keep it that way.
So, David, I&rsquo;m asking: will you chip in $5 right now to help send Brad Schneider back to Congress? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; anymore. Brad needs our help immediately.
The only thing standing in the way of a Republican victory is your support.
So please, chip in to Brad&rsquo;s campaign for Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-for-Illinois
4 days to go -- thanks for stepping up.
