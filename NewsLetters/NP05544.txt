&ldquo;We give the Republicans a 59% chance of gaining the majority.&rdquo; -
The Upshot , 10/8/2014
Dear Friend,
All the polling models give the GOP the edge in this year&rsquo;s races -- the
New York Times
says the GOP has a 59% chance of taking the Senate. Huffpost Pollster puts the GOP odds at 54%. But something&rsquo;s happening on the ground.
In races from Alaska to Georgia, Democrats are running better campaigns, and Republicans know it. For Democrats to win this year, we need to get our GOTV engine firing on all cylinders. Ground games are going to make the difference in this year&rsquo;s races. Give our organizers the resources they need by contributing $5.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
Republicans have all sorts of support from big-money outside groups. They know how to get help from the Koch brothers and Karl Rove, and they&rsquo;re counting on those groups to continue funding attack ads.
Know what I&rsquo;m counting on?
Each one of you.
Because all the Koch money in the world can&rsquo;t beat our grassroots team. Reaching our $8O,OOO goal before the FEC pre-general filing deadline will help us turn out our supporters. Give us a boost with a $5 contribution.
Thank you.
