Dear Friend,
On this Easter Sunday, Id like to wish you and your family an amazing and joyful Easter surrounded by the ones you love most.
As we pause to celebrate Gods love and sacrifice today, may we be mindful of Easters true meaning and the many blessings bestowed upon us.
Let us also remember Americas brave service members who have been separated from their loved ones as they defend our freedoms overseas.
I pray that you have a very happy Easter filled with joy and love.
God Bless,
Brian
