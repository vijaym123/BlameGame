&ldquo;Add it all up and you get a Republican party teetering on the edge of a majority -- needing six seats and with at least five either in the bag or leaning their way.&rdquo; --
Washington Post , 9/26/2014
Dear Friend,
Math may not be everyone&rsquo;s favorite subject, but with the election coming up, we should take a look at some numbers.
Amount the Koch Brothers have pledged to spend on elections in 2014: $290 million
Number of states with Americans for Prosperity field offices: 33
Chances of GOP taking over Senate: 76% (per
Washington Post ) The electoral math suggests that control of the Senate will rest on a razor-thin margin. We can&rsquo;t let Massachusetts become a GOP pickup -- get us $5 closer to our $16O,OOO October goal to keep that from happening.

Charles and David Koch, along with Karl Rove and his allies -- the forces behind groups like Americans for Prosperity and Crossroads GPS -- are
this
close to buying a Senate that will endorse their special interest agenda. And if Rove and the Kochs win, the rest of us will suffer.
A Koch-owned Senate would never address climate change. A Rove-bought Senate would vote for a return to the same disastrous policies that caused the economic crash of 2008. Losing the Senate means, at best, the loss of another two years -- two years in which we could have made progress for middle class families. The numbers don&rsquo;t lie -- we need to run hard all the way from now until November 4th. Help us keep fighting with a $5 contribution.
Thanks for your help.
