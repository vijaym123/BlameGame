Dear Friend,
Each of us or our ancestors came to America from somewhere else.
Most of those who immigrated here came in search of the opportunity to build a better life.
A big part of the reason that America has offered millions of people the opportunity to build a better life is that we operate under the rule of law.
That means the same laws apply to everyone equally.
No one
not even the President
can invent new laws on his own or ignore those that he does not like.
All of those issues are involved in the most recent controversy involving the Presidents decision to exempt three to four million people from the immigration laws and a court case brought by over 20 states contesting his actions.
As I have written before, I believe that our current immigration system is badly broken and in need of an overhaul.
That overhaul must start with enforcement, both at the border and inside the country.
No law will be taken seriously if it is not enforced.
The overhaul should also improve our legal immigration system, which is nearly impossible to navigate.
We turn away too many of the people who want to contribute to our society and make some immigration decisions based on a lottery.
Issues such as a guest worker program and what happens to the people who are in the country illegally will have to be addressed.
But they should be addressed one at a time, not in a giant bill of several thousand pages.
Anyone who disagrees with current immigration law should work with Congress to pass new laws, including the President.
Instead, President Obama announced that he would exempt millions of people from complying with the law and issue them identification documents.
Congress has been looking for ways to stop President Obamas unilateral action.
Last week, a federal court issued an injunction to stop it while the full case is heard by the courts.
As important as immigration is as an issue for the country, the rule of law is even more essential to our constitutional government.
I will keep working with my colleagues to see that President Obamas overreach is contested and that the rule of law is upheld.
