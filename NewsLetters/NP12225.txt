Friends,
Last year the nation was shocked by reports that the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) was improperly targeting groups based on political
beliefs. You may remember that a group from our area - the Wetumpka Tea
Party - was one of the groups singled out.
Despite differing politics or ideology, Americans strongly reject the
suppression of free speech by the government. This behavior by top IRS
officials eroded the public's trust in the Obama Administration and the
government as a whole.
Apparently undaunted, the Administration is now pushing new tax rules
that would essentially codify
the IRS's objectionable behavior. The rules would alter the types and
frequency of activities for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organizations. In
other words, they would attempt to limit the free speech of groups that
organize in order to petition their government.
The proposed rules are wrongheaded and ill-timed. If the Administration
believes we need to change how tax exempt status works, then it should
engage Congress in a meaningful discussion, not force administrative
rules in the middle of an election year. And can anyone blame Americans
for not trusting the IRS to implement these new rules given the way it
didn't bother to follow the old ones?
This week the House will take action to put a stop to this. We will
consider H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS
Act of 2014. The bill would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from
finalizing these new regulations until the House has completed its
investigation into the IRS scandal and the Inspector General releases
its final report.
The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act is just one on a
slate of bills this week aimed at holding the government accountable
for abuses and executive overreaches. We are calling the effort "Stop
Government Abuse Week."
Americans must be able to voice their political and religious views
without fear of reprisal from their government. Let's not forget: the
government works for the people, not the other way around.
Changes at Fort Rucker
You may have already heard, but a change in the command at Fort Rucker
is coming
. Major General Kevin Mangum, who is the current
commander at Fort Rucker, was recently nominated for promotion to
lieutenant general, and he will be assigned as Deputy Commanding
General/Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command
at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.
Gen. Mangum provided outstanding leadership at Fort Rucker during a
difficult time of severe budget constraints, including those brought on
by sequestration. As a testament to his leadership, the post received
the 2013 Commander in Chief's Award for Installation Excellence and the
2013 Chief of Staff Army Communities of Excellence Gold Award.
Gen. Mangum also offered me invaluable insight into the needs of our
deployed forces, military readiness and the future of Army aviation.
The Fort Rucker community will certainly miss Gen. Mangum, but I
congratulate him on this well-deserved promotion and wish him and his
family all the best.
The new commander at Fort Rucker is expected to be Brigadier General
Michael Lundy. General Lundy currently serves as Deputy Commanding
General, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, U.S. Army Training and
Doctrine Command at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. I look forward to getting
to know General Lundy and working with him in support of Army aviation.
The change of command is expected to occur on March 20.
The Week Ahead
Next week should be a busy week with a number of groups from Alabama
visiting our nation's capital. Next week will also mark my first
hearing with the Appropriations Committee.
As part of "Stop Government Abuse Week," the House is expected to
consider a number of bills including:
H.R. 899
- Unfunded Mandates Information and
Transparency Act of 2013,
H.R. 3865
- Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act of 2014,
H.R. 2122
- Regulatory Accountability Act of 2013,
H.R. 3308
- Taxpayer Transparency Act of 2013, and
H.R. 2531
- Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS
Requests Act.

Friends,
Last
year
the
nation
was
shocked
by
reports
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS) was
improperly
targeting
groups
based
on
political
beliefs.
You
may
remember
that
a
group
from
our
area
&#8211;
the
Wetumpka
Tea
Party
&#8211;
was
one
of
the
groups
singled
out.
Despite
differing
politics
or
ideology,
Americans
strongly
reject
the
suppression
of
free
speech
by
the
government.
This
behavior
by
top
IRS
officials
eroded
the
public&#8217;s
trust
in
the
Obama
Administration
and
the
government
as
a
whole.
Apparently
undaunted,
the
Administration
is
now
pushing
new
tax
rules
that
would
essentially
codify
the
IRS&#8217;s
objectionable
behavior.
The
rules
would
alter
the
types
and
frequency
of

for
501(c)(4)
tax-exempt
organizations.
In
other
words,
they
would
attempt

the
free

of
groups
that
organize
in
order
to
petition

The

are
wrongheaded

If
the

believes

need
to

tax
exempt

works,
then
it
should
engage
Congress
in
a
meaningful

not

And
can

Changes
at
Fort
Rucker
You
may
have
already
heard,
but
a
change
in
the
command
at
Fort
Rucker
is
coming .
Major
General
Kevin
Mangum,
who
is
the
current
commander
at
Fort
Rucker,
was
recently
nominated
for
promotion
to
lieutenant
general,
and
he
will
be
assigned
as
Deputy
Commanding
General/Chief
of
Staff
of
the
U.S.
Army
Training
and
Doctrine
Command
at
Joint
Base
Langley-Eustis,
Virginia.
Gen.
Mangum
provided
outstanding
leadership
at
Fort
Rucker
during
a
difficult
time
of
severe
budget
constraints,
including
those
brought
on
by
sequestration.
As
a
testament
to
his
leadership,
the
post
received
the
2013
Commander
in
Chief's
Award
for
Installation
Excellence
and
the
2013
Chief
of
Staff
Army
Communities
of
Excellence
Gold
Award.
Gen.
Mangum
also
offered
me
invaluable
insight
into
the
needs
of
our
deployed
forces,
military
readiness
and
the
future
of
Army
aviation.
The
Fort
Rucker
community
will
certainly
miss
Gen.
Mangum,
but
I
congratulate
him
on
this
well-deserved
promotion
and
wish
him
and
his
family
all
the
best.
The
new
commander
at
Fort
Rucker
is
expected
to
be
Brigadier
General
Michael
Lundy.
General
Lundy
currently
serves
as
Deputy
Commanding
General,
U.S.
Army
Combined
Arms
Center,
U.S.
Army
Training
and
Doctrine
Command
at
Fort
Leavenworth,
Kansas.
I
look
forward
to
getting
to
know
General
Lundy
and
working
with
him
in
support
of
Army
aviation.
The
change
of
command
is
expected
to
occur
on
March
20.

Week
