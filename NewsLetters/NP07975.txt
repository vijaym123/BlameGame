Rep. Bob Goodlatte
How Obama Can Stop the Border
Crisis
Over the
last several weeks, the surge of children, teenagers, and families &ndash; largely from Central America &ndash; attempting to enter the United States
illegally has continued to grow.
The failure of this Administration to enforce our immigration laws has lead to a disaster
of President Obama&rsquo;s own making. Now, he has asked Congress for a whopping $3.7 billion in additional funding without accountability or a plan
in place to actually stop the border crisis. No amount of resources will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if he
continues to ignore the law.
President Obama has many lawful tools at his disposal right now to stop the surge of illegal immigrants at our southern border and he should
act on these immediately. One step would be giving Border Patrol agents access to federal lands, such as national monuments and wildlife refuges,
along the border, which are currently restricted due to strict environmental rules. As a result, federal lands along the border provide drug
traffickers, human smugglers, and illegal immigrants effective routes and hiding places where authorities cannot reach them.
The Administration
should also restore agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to help enforce immigration laws and relieve some of the burden on
overwhelmed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Additionally,
the Administration should crack down on false asylum claims and
implement tougher standards for &ldquo;credible fear&rdquo;
claims, or those who
claim a &ldquo;well-founded fear of persecution&rdquo; in their home country when
trying to enter the U.S.
According to a
Department of Homeland Security
report, at least 70 percent of asylum cases contain proven or possible
fraud.
Failing to stop these cases only
encourages more people to come
to the U.S. and make similar claims. Along the same lines, the
Administration could deter false asylum claims by
detaining these
individuals while the government determines whether their case is
legitimate, rather than what are now essentially &ldquo;catch and
release&rdquo;
policies. The Administration also needs to stop releasing convicted
criminal aliens from detention.
Furthermore, President Obama needs to
demand that the Mexican government help stop this surge through
Mexico
and secure their southern border with Guatemala.
He also needs to work
with the Mexican government and the governments of Central American
countries to discourage their citizens from making the journey
northward.
As was evident on my recent
trip , the
cost of inaction is
significant.
I encourage President Obama to step up
and lead by sending a strong, public message that those who enter the
United States illegally
will be returned to their home countries and
that subjecting children to this dangerous journey will no longer be
tolerated.
These actions would
send the message that the United States is serious about
enforcing our immigration laws.
Honoring a Hero
This week, I was honored to speak on the heroic efforts of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish-born diplomat. On July 9, 1944, he set
out on a mission that would save the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews threatened by the Holocaust. On Wednesday, 70 years later, he was
posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal - the highest honor given by the Congress. Mr. Wallenberg's legacy will not be forgotten in history.
