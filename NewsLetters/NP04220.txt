Dear
David,
Today marks
National Adoption Day. Every day around the world, more and more
children find themselves living without families. By some estimates, there
are almost 200 million orphans or abandoned children in the world today.
There are more than 402,000 children in the foster care system in the
United States, and more than 10,000 of those in Missouri. Among those
children nationwide, nearly a quarter are waiting for families to
adopt them.
As a father and a member of the Congressional
Coalition on Adoption, I am proud to recognize the importance of National
Adoption Day and National Adoption Month in November. This spring, I
was honored to receive the "Champion of Hope Award," as well as
Missouri KidsFirst's inaugural "Standing with Children" Award. I'll continue
working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation that will
fix functional problems in the adoption process and that will allow
adoptions to become a bigger part of our country to help bring more
children into permanent, loving families.
As always, I encourage you to join the conversation
online by sharing your thoughts with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
YouTube , and
on
Instagram .
Sincere
regards,
