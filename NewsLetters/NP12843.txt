Dear
Friends,
This week I had the privilege of visiting one of West
Virginia's great arts and crafts institutions, Blenko Glass in Milton.
Family owned for more than 100 years, Blenko has preserved our state's
glass-making traditions and produces collectibles sold across the
country and exported around the world. These craftsmen are so skilled at
what they do, and I thank them for taking the time to teach me about
their work.
I've also spent this district work period
speaking to healthcare providers and small business owners about compliance
and implementation of Obamacare. In Parkersburg, I held a roundtable
with small business owners facing uncertainty in costs and compliance
with new Obamacare mandates. In Beckley, I visited the Raleigh Regional
Cancer Center and spoke with nurses, doctors and administrators about
the challenges they face in processing claims, ensuring patients'
treatments are covered and adapting to the new regulations being rolled
out through Obamacare.

I will be holding mobile
