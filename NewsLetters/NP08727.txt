Dear Friend,
Just last Friday, the railroad bridge in Norwalk failed, stranding
thousands of passengers. The bridge-which was built in 1896-is in
desperate need of repair. This delay as well as countless other service
delays and accidents in the last few months on Metro-North are
unacceptable. It's time to get serious about improving and updating our
aging railroads, crumbling bridges, and congested roads.
In Congress, I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, where I've focused on ensuring consistent investment in our
infrastructure, which will create jobs. We should not have to wait
until a bridge falls down or a train derails to repair Connecticut's
infrastructure.
Unfortunately, Congress voted on a bill this week that just did not
adequately address our transportation needs. I called for meaningful
changes to this bill on the House floor echoing what I've heard from
many of you as I've traveled throughout northwest and central
Connecticut.
Watch my speech here:
Even in these tough budgetary times, we need to come together to do our
job so that our bridges and roads do not fail. Our economy and our
quality of life depend on transportation systems that work. I will
continue to advocate in Congress and here in Connecticut for smart
investments to improve our transportation infrastructure and create
jobs.
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to me with your thoughts
on this or any other issue by email
or at 860-223-8412. To find out more about my
work in Congress, check out my Facebook page
or follow me on Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Esty

Dear
Friend,
Just
last
Friday,
the
railroad
bridge
in
Norwalk
failed,
stranding
thousands
of
passengers.
The
bridge&#8212;which
was
built
in
1896&#8212;is
in
desperate
need
of
repair.
This
delay
as
well
as
countless
other
service
delays
and
accidents
in
the
last
few
months
on
Metro-North
are
unacceptable.
It&#8217;s
time
to
get
serious
about
improving
and
updating
our
aging
railroads,
crumbling
bridges,
and
congested
roads.
In
Congress,
I
serve
on
the
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
Committee,
where
I&#8217;ve
focused
on
ensuring
consistent
investment
in
our
infrastructure,
which
will
create
jobs.
We
should
not
have
to
wait
until
a
bridge
falls
down
or
a
train
derails
to
repair
Connecticut&#8217;s
infrastructure.
Unfortunately,
Congress
voted
on
a
bill
this
week
that
just
did
not
adequately
address
our
transportation
needs.
I
called
for
meaningful
changes
to
this
bill
on
the
House
floor
echoing
what
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
of
you
as
I&#8217;ve
traveled
throughout
northwest
and
central
Connecticut.
Watch
my
speech
here:
Even
in
these
tough
budgetary
times,
we
need
to
come
together
to
do
our
job
so
that
our
bridges
and
roads
do
not
fail.
Our
economy
and
our
quality
of
life
depend
on
transportation
systems
that
work.
I
will
continue
to
advocate
in
Congress
and
here
in
Connecticut
for
smart
investments
to
improve
our
transportation
infrastructure
and
create
jobs.
As
always,
