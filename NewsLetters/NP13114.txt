Intelligence Oversight
Dear Friends,
This past week I introduced
H.R. 3855: The Intelligence Budget Transparency Act , a bi-partisan bill that requires top-line budgets for the 16 intelligence agencies to be made public in the Presidents annual budget request.
Ensuring our national security is an important role of the federal government and intelligence work is a critical component of that goal.
However, throwing untold amounts of money at intelligence agencies, without even knowing how much, is bad policy.
This bill gives the transparency needed to show Americans where their money goes while balancing the required secrecy that is instrumental to intelligence work.
We will not compromise our national security because we are not asking for detailed reports on all their activities. But it is appropriate for the rank-and-file members of Congress and for the American people to know the top-line budgets for these agencies.
I am also circulating a bipartisan letter to President Obama urging him to include the top-line budget numbers for intelligence agencies in his Fiscal Year 2015 budget to get this policy underway as soon as possible.
As I continue to represent you in Washington, please feel free to
contact me
and let me know your concerns; I value your input!
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
