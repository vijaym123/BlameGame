Listening to the Sixth District Veterans Coalition
On Monday, I met with 70 members of the Sixth District Veterans
Coalition and provided an update on the effort to digitize military
records, shared frustration with what seems to be a stalled
investigation in Benghazi, and discussed the recent Budget Agreement.
In particular, I wanted to discuss the provision of the Budget
Agreement that, beginning in December 2015, will adjust the rate of
annual pension increases for military retirees who have over 20 years
of service and are under the age of 60. I invited the five veterans in
the coalition who would be directly affected, as well as any other
interested members, to join a task force to examine and evaluate
several legislative proposals to address military pensions and
compensation, and return a recommendation.
If you would like information on our Veterans Coalition meetings or the
military pension task force, please contact Tyler White
in our Lexington office and we
will make sure you're included.
Honoring Camp Nelson's Historical Significance
I was honored to be a part of the ceremony designating Camp Nelson
Civil War Heritage Park in Jessamine County as a National Historic
Landmark. This is another example of the Sixth District of Kentucky's
historical richness. I applaud the diligence and hard work of those who
helped to make this dedication possible.
