Friend --
I know Ami uses the phrase &quot;as a doctor&quot; quite a bit.
But I have to tell you - as a doctor, but more importantly as a woman, I&#39;m alarmed by Doug Ose&#39;s anti-women agenda.
Frankly, what health care choices a woman decides to make is absolutely none of Doug Ose&#39;s business.
Ami trusts women to make their own medical decisions in consult with their family and their doctors -- and no one else.
Look, we can&rsquo;t let Ose speak for us. So please, give $5 or more to keep Ose&#39;s anti-women views far away from the halls of Congress.
