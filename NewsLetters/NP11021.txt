WASHINGTON, D.C .
In
a continued effort to bring news and relevant information about our
federal government back to his home district in Los Angeles,
Representative Xavier Becerra (CA-34), Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus
and Ranking Member of the Social Security Subcommittee, brings you The
Becerra Bulletin, an e-newsletter filled with facts and information
meant to stimulate thought and discussion about policy and a host of
other
issues.
BY THE NUMBERS - THE
TIME IS NOW FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM
The time is now to enact commonsense
immigration reform that reaffirms our values, advances our ideals and honors our
history as a nation of immigrants. In October 2013, House Democrats
introduced H.R. 15, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and
Immigration Modernization Act, which if enacted will secure our
borders, protect our workers, unite families by stopping the deportations,
and offer hardworking immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship.
Here's a look at the numbers on why now is the time to fix our broken
immigration system:
It has been
275 days
since the U.S.
Senate passed bipartisan immigration
reform
A bipartisan group of
200
House Members
have signed onto H.R.
15
According to the latest
report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 15 would
reduce the deficit by $900 billion
over the next
two decades
including
$200 billion
in the first
decade alone
An overwhelming majority,
81 percent
of the
American people support immigration reform with a path to citizenship (CNN,
2/2/14)
