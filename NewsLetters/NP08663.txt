Working to Improve Access to Health Care
Hi All!
I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. Last week, I worked on several
issues that I know have a major impact on the lives of Granite Staters.
For example, I introduced a bill to improve access to affordable health
care for families, and I questioned Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
officials at a Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on the importance of
improving health care for our nation's veterans.
Helping Families Afford Health Care
Recently I introduced the Family Coverage Act, a bill to fix a glitch
in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevents thousands of families
from accessing affordable health coverage. The Family Coverage Act will
help ensure that employees who do not have access to affordable
job-based coverage for their families can receive premium tax credits
to help pay for family coverage.
I've always said the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. The
'family glitch' is just one example of how this law needs to be fixed.
We need to improve access to affordable health care coverage for all
Granite State families, which is why I was proud to introduce the
Family Coverage Act. This bill would increase the number of families in
New Hampshire that have access to premium tax credits, so they can
afford high-quality health insurance. I urge the House to swiftly pass
this legislation, which could increase coverage for more than 460,000
children. Furthermore, I will continue to work across the aisle to push
fixes to the ACA, so that every Granite Stater can access the
affordable coverage they were promised when this bill was signed into
law.
Speaking at the VA Hearing
Pushing for Answers at the VA
At a Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing last week, I questioned
private health care consultants and VA officials about how to
immediately fix and solve wait time problems that have recently been
uncovered at VA medical centers across the country. Since the wait
times and secret wait lists were discovered, I have been speaking out
on the need to immediately resolve these problems and ensure that no
veteran faces any obstacle to receiving care. From bringing more
doctors in to increasing access to telemedicine and building new
clinics, VA facilities across the country must take the lead in cutting
down on bureaucracy and prioritizing quick, efficient delivery of care.
I have sought to provide strict oversight of the VA medical centers
serving New Hampshire veterans, and I am working with NH veteran
leaders to find ways to cut down on bureaucracy in the state's VA
system. I recently sent a formal letter to the New England VA Network
Director urging a complete review of wait times to ensure that no
Granite State veteran has trouble accessing the care he or she needs,
and I asked for whistleblower protection for staff who come forward
with information. Recently, I held a roundtable discussion with Veteran
Service Organizations and veteran leaders to hear about their
experiences at local VA medical centers and any issues they may have
experienced. I will continue to be in touch with veteran leaders to
help ensure the problems happening on the national level are not
occurring in New Hampshire.
Supporting the "Make It In America" plan
Rebuilding the American Manufacturing Industry
I was proud to show my continued support last week for the "Make It In
America" initiative to strengthen the American manufacturing industry.
These proposals are focused on training a 21st century workforce,
encouraging innovation, and bringing jobs back to the U.S. from
overseas. As part of this Make It In America plan, I introduced my
Workforce Development Investment Act to provide tax incentives to
businesses that partner with community colleges to strengthen workforce
development for students. This year's plan also includes my Small
Business Growth and Investment Act to free up capital to help small
businesses expand their operations.
Have a good week and thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire
such a wonderful place to live!

Working
to
Improve
Access
to
Health
Care
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
fantastic
weekend. Last
week ,
I
worked
on
several
issues
that
I
know
have
a
major
impact
on
the
lives
of
Granite
Staters.
For
example,
I
introduced
a
bill
to
improve
access
to
affordable
health
care
for
families,
and
I
questioned
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
officials
at
a
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee
hearing
on
the
importance
of
improving
health
care
for
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
Helping
Families
Afford
Health
Care
Recently
I
introduced
the
Family
Coverage
Act ,
a
bill
to
fix
a
glitch
in
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
that
prevents
thousands
of
families
from
accessing
affordable
health
coverage.
The
Family
Coverage
Act
will
help
ensure
that
employees
who
do
not
have
access
to
affordable
job-based
coverage
for
their
families
can
receive
premium
tax
credits
to
help
pay
for
family
coverage.
I&#8217;ve
always
said
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
far
from
perfect. The
&#8216;family
glitch&#8217;
is
just
one
example
of
how
this
law
needs
to
be
fixed.
We
need
to
improve
access
to
affordable
health
care
coverage
for
all
Granite
State
families,
which
is
why
I
was
proud
to
introduce
the
Family
Coverage
Act.
This
bill
would
increase
the
number
of
families
in
New
Hampshire
that
have
access
to
premium
tax
credits,
so
they
can
afford
high-quality
health
insurance.
I
urge
the
House
to
swiftly
pass
this
legislation,
which
could
increase
coverage
for
more
than
460,000
children.
Furthermore,
I
will
continue
to
work
across
the
aisle
to
push
fixes
to
the
ACA,
so
that
every
Granite
Stater
can
access
the
affordable
coverage
they
were
promised
when
this
bill
was
signed
into
law.

At

about
how
to
immediately
fix
and
solve
wait

problems
that
have
recently
been
uncovered
at
VA
medical

across
the
country.
Since
the
wait

and
secret

were
discovered,
I
have
been
speaking

on
the

I
have

and
I
am
working
with
NH
veteran

to
cut

in
the
state&#8217;s
VA
system.
I
recently
sent
a
formal

to
the
New

VA
Network
Director
urging
a
complete
review
of
wait
times
to
ensure
that
no

accessing
the
care
he
or

and
I
asked

for
staff
who
come
forward
with
information.
Recently,
I
held
a
roundtable
discussion
with
Veteran
Service
Organizations
and
veteran
leaders
to
hear
about
their
experiences
at
local
VA
medical
centers
and
any
issues
they
may
have
experienced.
I
will
continue
to
be
in
touch
with
veteran
leaders
to
help
ensure
the
problems
happening
on
the
national
level
are
not
occurring
in
New
Hampshire.
Supporting
the
&#8220;Make
It
In
America&#8221;
plan Rebuilding
the
American
Manufacturing
Industry
I
was
proud
to
show
my
continued
support
last
week
for
the
"Make
It

America"
initiative
to
strengthen
the
American
manufacturing
industry.
These
proposals
are
focused
on
training
a
21st
century
workforce,
encouraging
innovation,
and
b ringing
jobs
back
to
the
U.S.
from
overseas.
As
part
of
this
Make
It

plan,
I
in troduced
my
Workforce
Development
Investment
Act
to
provide
tax
incentives
to
businesses
that
partner
with
community
colleges
to
strengthen
workforce
development
for
students.
This
year's
plan
also
includes
my
Small
Business
Growth
and
Investment
Act
to
free
up
capital
to
help
small
businesses
expand
their
operations.
Have
a
good
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
wonderful
place
to
