Dear Friend,
The President&rsquo;s State of the Union address included a lot of positive news for our economy. We&rsquo;re seeing consistent job growth, families rebuilding their finances, and a renaissance in manufacturing and the auto industry. We&rsquo;ve created tremendous momentum, and if we keep it up, we&rsquo;ll go a long way towards digging out from the Great Recession.
But there is still more work to be done. Congress should keep focusing on creating American jobs. However, some folks in Washington have a different idea -- they want Congress to authorize the President to ram through a trade agreement that could hurt American workers and businesses. Join me and tell the new Republican Congress to put American jobs first.
Multinational trade deals are, to put it mildly, complicated. There&rsquo;s a lot of good that can come from these sorts of agreements, but there&rsquo;s also the risk of American workers being left out in the cold unless the proper protections are in place.
Right now, we don&rsquo;t even know what this proposed agreement says. It&rsquo;s being negotiated in secret, which isn&rsquo;t exactly reassuring. What we do know is that speeding this through Congress right now is a mistake. Congress needs to stay focused on job creation here at home. Sign our petition and stand up for American workers.
Thank you.
