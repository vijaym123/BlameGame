A Texas Recipe for Luck
Jeffrey Fuquay has a simple outlook on
business.
The
harder you work, the luckier you get, Jeffrey says. And he should
know
as the owner of TJ Blackburn Syrup Works, Jeffrey has seen how
nearly nine decades of hard work can turn a scrap of paper into a Texas
icon.
Fuquays grandparents, Thomas Jefferson TJ Blackburn and his wife Lurline,
started TJ Blackburn Syrup Works in Cass County, Texas in the
1920s.
The Blackburns were struggling to get by and had turned to
renting a spare bedroom in their already modest home to drifters in return
for chores and other meager payments.
One couple came through in
1927 and could offer only a scrap of paper with a misspelled Receipt
for Huney scribbled on it.
The Blackburns mixed the recipe back in their tool
shed, and with a few tweaks, came up with a signature syrup.
Word
got out among their neighbors, and soon enough people started wanting a
batch for themselves.
TJ took to the streets in his Model-T Ford
delivering freshly-jarred syrup door-to-door.
Eighty-eight years later, the
Blackburns have upgraded from four wheels to 18, and a single Model-T has
been replaced by a full-scale trucking operation.
Theyve grown
from a family mixing sugars in an old wash pot to a Jefferson, Texas,
based operation employing 65
many sharing the Blackburn
ancestry.
Their secret to
success?
Blackburns syrup is made from ribbon cane, a Southern
favorite over more common maple and honey-based varieties.
Fuquay
told the Marshall News Messenger, it has more of a bite, a real
strong flavorI can think of maybe only two other companies that still use
sugar cane.
Of course, to cater to growing demand beyond East Texas, Blackburn
Syrup Works has expanded its catalogue of sweet spreads to include honey
and maple-based syrups, as well as a variety of jams and
preserves.
And with that, the local family-owned company went national;
Blackburns syrups and jams
once carried only as far as TJs Model-T
could take him
are now sold in all 50
states.
Despite national fame, Fuquay
has kept Blackburn Syrup Works true to its Texas roots, picking most
ingredients from Texas farms.
Even the fruit that isnt grown in
Texas still is American-grown.
Another Blackburn trademark thats stood the test of
time is the iconic glass mug.
And for good reason
sales have
fallen when different types of containers have been used.
Fuquay
explained, Your eyes gravitate toward the mug, and then the quality
keeps you coming back to their sweet spreads.
Of course, over 88 years, some things
have changed: there are now sugar-free and fructose-free options to
cater to those watching their waistlines.
And not surprisingly,
theyve upgraded their plant in Jefferson quite a few times to keep up
with growing demand and technology.
What will always remain is the age-old
Texas-made quality, and the message behind the success of the Blackburn
familys syrup enterprise: as Fuquay reminds us, luck doesnt come without a
lot of hard work.
