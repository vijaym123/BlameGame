Friends,
I am sending out this e-newsletter one day early because
this weekend and next week our country honors our nations veterans.
To celebrate our veterans and their legacy many organizations,
municipalities, and civic groups are holding Veterans' Day Parades and
events.
We have put together a list of Veterans' Day
events below.
While this list is not 100 percent
inclusive, it features nearly two dozen events in our community.
I
encourage you to attend an event and thank our veterans for defending our
freedoms.
Before you review
the Veterans' Day Events in our district, I want you to know that it is
an honor to have been elected to represent you and your family in the
114th Congress.
As your Congressman-elect, I sincerely
thank you for the opportunity to serve you for two more
years.
Together, we will build on the progress we have made so
far.
We will continue recruiting new industries and business to
our district, encouraging job creators to create more high-paying jobs,
and advancing projects to improve our states water and surface
infrastructure.
Ultimately, we will work to make life easier
for American families and paychecks larger, and fairer, for
hardworking people.
Speaker
Boehner has indicated that next year the 114th Congress will act on the
Keystone Pipeline, restore the 40 hour workweek gutted by Obamacare, and
pass legislation that encourages more business to hire our veterans.
I look forward to working with my colleagues, both Democratic and
Republican, to advance all of these goals and your
priorities.
To our veterans, we will
never be able to thank you enough for your service and we will never
forget the sacrifices you made for our country.
On behalf
of South Carolinas Seventh District, we salute
you.
Again, thank you for putting your trust in me
again.
I look forward to serving you and your family in the 114th
Congress.
Have a
good week,
IN THE NEWS...
