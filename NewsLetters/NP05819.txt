Hello David Johnson --
Democrats are facing a significant fundraising shortfall that could cost us the 2014 election. Meanwhile, Boehner's cash has allowed him to launch the biggest TV ad blitz of the entire election just this week.
Your area (zip code 60659) has been identified as a signficant contributor to this problem.
David -- if you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we need you.
We need 4 donors from 60659 zip code
to answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action ASAP.
An instant triple-match is in effect until midnight tonight.
That means your donation today will be worth 3x more today than it will be tomorrow.
