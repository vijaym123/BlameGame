In June, I
asked
whether you supported the actions taken by the Administration in response to the thousands of youth crossing the border, and 92% of respondents said
no .
Since then, children and adults have continued to flood across our southern border.
Now, the President has
requested
$3.7 billion to address the surge, and the Administration is planning to
expand
the number of people granted relief from deportation and
grant
refugee status to people from Honduras before they even come to the United States.
I
continue
to oppose all forms of amnesty, and I believe that entry into this country is a privilege, not a right.
Question of the week :
Do you believe that the Administrations policies have led to the crisis at the border ?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
