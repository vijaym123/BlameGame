Friends,
I hope everyone has been staying warm this week.
I have to
admit that when I left Washington after the House adjourned last week, I
didnt necessarily think I would really need to bring my scarf and
gloves down to North
Carolina.
I, however, am certainly not about to complain too
much as I was so inspired to see thousands of people brave the
sub-zero temperatures in Washington to support the 41 st
annual
March for Life.
Each year, this is such a powerful event
and I am very sorry I was not able to attend this years important
anniversary.
Unfortunately, the March for Life also marks the
anniversary of a very tragic event in our nations historya devastating
Supreme Court decision that has led to the death of nearly 56 million
innocent children .
Roe v. Wade
threw aside the
very ideals that our nation stands uponthat all people are created
equal, and that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
This decision ripped away
these rights from the most vulnerable in our societychildren in the
womb.
As a
country, we have a moral obligation to stand up to protect the most
innocent in our society and to be a voice for those who are not given the
opportunity to speak.
Life is the most sacred, precious gift
from God .
Life begins at conception and ends with
natural death, which means it is our responsibility to care for each and
every life.
As long as I am your elected Representative,
it will be a priority of mine to fight for the end of abortion on
demand.
To that end, I cosponsored
the bipartisan
Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act
(PRENDA), H.R. 447, introduced by
Representative Trent Franks.
This would restrict sex-selection
abortion and race-selection abortion, as well as the coercion of a woman to
obtain either.
Any individual working at an abortion clinic who
carries out these disgusting practices
should be punished to the full
extent of the law.
I strongly believe it is absolutely wrong to use your
hard-earned taxpayer dollars to finance abortions and clinics that provide
them like Planned Parenthood.
Next week, the House will
vote on H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which
prohibits the use of federal funds for any abortions or any health benefits
coverage that includes coverage of abortion.
This is a
commonsense proposal I will be proud to
support.
Advances in technology and modern
medicine have deepened our understanding of the stages of pregnancy.
The facts are clear babies in the womb can feel
pain, we can detect heartbeats at earlier stages than ever before, and we
can see the growth of these precious children at each step along the
way.
This evidence should settle the debate once and for all that
abortions after 20 weeks are particularly cruel and
should be
strictly
prohibited.
Weve come a long way in shifting public opinion
on this debate, and our position is stronger now than ever before.
This is thanks entirely to all of you who have supported
and worked so hard on behalf of the pro-life movement.
One need not look no further than this weeks March for Life to see the
incredible display of compassion and support for the defense of the
unborn.
Until next week,
Richard Hudson
