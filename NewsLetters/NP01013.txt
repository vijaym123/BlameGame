Congratulations to Kathy He of Marianas High School. Her pastel and watercolor, entitled Springs Color, is the winning entry in this years Congressional Art Competition. Selected by a panel of experienced local artists, Kathys work was one of a record 43 entries in this annual showcase for the creative talents of our high school students. The Northern Mariana Islands winner will be displayed over the next year, alongside student art from the other 440 congressional districts, at the U.S. Capitol.
Kathy He wins Congressional Art Competition
The work of Marianas High School sophomore Kathy He has won this years Congressional Art Competition and will be displayed over the coming year at the U.S. Capitol. Once again, a team of local artists volunteered their time for the hard work of selecting from among a record 43 entries from Northern Marianas high school students. This is the seventh year that our islands will be represented along with art from the 440 other congressional districts. Previous winning artists are Su Jeong Kim, Krisna Balolong, Hannah Alcordo, Bryan Jose Deleon Guerrero, Aaron Tomokane and Rosanna L. Camacho. Ms. He credits the support of her teachers for encouraging her to develop her artistic skills. Her MHS art teacher Justin McAllister actually encouraged 19 of his students to submit contest entries this year. Schools around the country have cut back on music and drama and the visual arts in response to budget constraints. We are fortunate that here in the Northern Marianas we are still able to help our young people develop their creativity through the arts, which, I believe, is essential to their overall education.

Mr. Marvin Tamangided of Dr. Rita Inos Jr./Sr. High School, the Public School System 2015 Teacher of the Year, his sister SSG Nicole Tamangided, and their mother Yvonne Ulechong visited their congressional office in Washington and were taken on a staff-led tour of the Capitol. Mr. Tamangided was in DC attending the annual National Teacher of the Year program events with other extraordinary educators from around the country. They also had the opportunity to meet with President Obama at the White House. Congratulations, Marvin, and thank you for the exceptional work you do educating our children.
$310,000 awarded for Connecting Youth to Jobs
Our Public School System and local Chambers of Commerce are receiving a $310,000 grant, announced this week, to help graduating high school students be ready for employment. Connecting Youth to Jobs is a public-private partnership that matches a focused school curriculum with on-the-job training. This motivates students to finish school and ensures that qualified local workers are available to employers to support our expanding tourism industry and improving economy. The grant funds are appropriated by Congress for the Technical Assistant Program of the Department of Interior. TAP is always one of my priority submissions to the House Appropriations Committee for full funding, because the program is flexible enough to respond to innovative proposals like Connecting Youth to Jobs
a model I think can be very effective at helping young people make the transition from school to work. Congratulations to PSS and the Chambers.

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan was our guest at this weeks Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus meeting. I pressed Duncan to support my bill, H.R. 851 , which would increase the Elementary and Secondary Act Title I-A grant to our Public School System. Currently, Duncan has discretionary authority over the one percent of Title I-A funds that goes to Bureau of Indian Education and insular area schools. But he divides the money so that BIE gets $1,987 and PSS gets $1,073 per low-income student. My bill ends that disparity, by taking away the Secretarys authority and treating the NMI more like a state, and ups annual funding for PSS by $7 million. Also pictured (L-R): Al Green (D-TX), Charles Rangel (D-NY), Michael Honda (D-CA), CAPAC Chair Judy Chu (D-CA), Secretary Duncan, and Grace Meng (D-NY).
Your calls make a difference
A constituent on Saipan called recently to alert me that the Saipan Acceptance Office of the U.S. Passport Agency was no longer taking walk-in passport renewal applications. That is definitely an inconvenience for anyone in the Northern Mariana Islands who needs their passport renewed. After an inquiry by your congressional office, the Saipan Acceptance Office is once again accepting renewal applications in person. But we would not have known there was a problem, unless a constituent brought it to our attention. That constituent deserves a thank you from anyone in need of a new passport. And remember, your Congressional offices are always ready to serve you. Contact us on Saipan at 670-323-2647/8, on Tinian at 670-433-2647, on Rota at 670-532-2647 and in Washington, DC toll free at 1-877-446-3465.

The historic first address by a Prime Minister of Japan to the U.S. Congress was remarkable for his expression of remorse for the suffering caused by Japan in World War II
suffering we in the Northern Mariana Islands experienced and still remember. I was grateful to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for this acknowledgement and shook his hand after his speech to let him know of my admiration for his courage and honesty.
Work remains on Magnuson reforms
The Natural Resources Committee agreed Thursday to send H.R. 1335 to the full House for a vote. The bill reauthorizes the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which is widely agreed to have benefited those who harvest fish for business, subsistence, and sport, while at the same time protecting fish stocks for the future. I have been working with the author of H.R. 1335,
Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), to add provisions that would benefit insular area governments and indigenous fishing interests. Although our negotiations had not reached conclusion in time for this weeks committee meeting, Mr. Young told the Committee, There are some things I can accept, and he suggested that we continue to work to find areas of agreement before H.R. 1335 goes to the floor. Young, who is beginning his 22nd term, has been a strong supporter of indigenous people and the insular areas throughout his years in Congress. In fact, Young was an original cosponsor in 1996 of the first bill creating a seat in Congress
for the people of the Northern Mariana Islands.

We bid farewell this week to long-time member of the congressional office staff, Michelle Tenorio. Michelle began working for the people of the Northern Mariana Islands in 2009, the first year we were here in the House of Representatives. Michelle does a lions share of the work that directly affects individual constituents, leading tours of the U.S. Capitol, arranging visits to the White House, and preparing floor statements honoring notable persons and organizations from our islands. She is also the point person for tracking grants announced and awarded and other data-intensive jobs. And Michelle has been one of the rotating editors of the e-kilili news, sometimes staying late on Friday nights as stories are completed to make sure that all our subscribers are kept up-to-date on the work of their congressional office. Thank you, Michelle, for your dedication and all you have done.
