A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
April 6, 2014
The Chinese may be reading this: The Obama Administration announced
this week that next year it will give up the U.S.'s responsibility for
managing critical internet functions.
In response, I introduced H.R.
4398 - the Global Internet Freedom Act - which will prohibit the
President from taking this action.
As Americans, we value our Constitutional right of freedom of speech
and have promoted this value throughout the world. We should not give
up our stewardship of the internet so that the United Nations or
countries like China or Russia, that do not hold free speech in the
same regard, can have the opportunity to take control. Take a look at
this clip from Fox & Friends that further explains the situation:
House Committee passes Budget that balances.again: Following an all-day
mark-up, the House Budget Committee passed the "Path to Prosperity" FY
2015 Budget Resolution by a vote of 22-16
on Wednesday evening. Once again, we put forth a responsible Budget
Resolution that will balance in ten years. However, we cannot do it all
ourselves. We need Senator Reid and the President to make responsible
budgeting a priority as well.
In my remarks on the House Floor I offered, "we have Americans who are
young, that want opportunities, jobs and not higher taxes. If we don't
balance our budgets, they are the ones who are going to pay." A
balanced budget also makes it easier for the Federal government to help
the most vulnernable among us: "the poorest among us, who look to
government for a little bit of help -- if we have a debt crisis, we
can't be there to help them." Click on the image to watch my full
remarks:
On Deck: In case you missed it last week, I penned an op-ed about my
Veterans hearing aid bill in The Hill. Read it here
and tune-in to "Fox & Friends" this Friday
where I will discuss my bill alongside one of our American heroes, Sgt.
Matt Eversmann, who knows the frustration of working within the VA
system for hearing issues. Keep an eye on my Facebook
and Twitter
pages for more details.
Until next week, have a great week -
Sean
