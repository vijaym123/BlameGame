Wicker Unveils New Bill
to
Fight Human
Trafficking
'End Trafficking Act' Would Empower
Victims, Target
Perpetrators
No state in America is free from the stain of
human trafficking
a rampant form of slavery that seems unimaginable in
this day and age. Trafficking is not a problem faced only by faraway
countries. It exploits thousands of men, women, and children in the
United States each year. These innocent Americans are robbed of their
basic freedom to live as they choose.
Trafficking Cases on the
Rise
Human trafficking is
a persistent and evil crime. In fact, investigations and prosecutions
at the federal and state levels are on the rise. The Polaris Project,
which operates a national hotline for victims and those with
information about trafficking, estimates there were more than 5,000 potential
trafficking cases just last
year.
Children and youth are particularly vulnerable to forced labor and
trafficking for sex, often coerced through intimidation and violence by
family members, pimps, or strangers. They are abducted in their own
communities, taken from their loved ones, and
sold.
The horror stories are endless. Consider the
12-year-old runaway who was kidnapped in New York City and advertised on
a sex trafficking website. Or the 16 juveniles
ranging in age from
13 to 17 years old
rescued in a sex trafficking operation during
this year's Super Bowl. These children face unique challenges as victims,
in need of both justice and
rehabilitation.
A bill I have introduced, the "End Trafficking Act of
2014," would close current gaps in existing laws to stop trafficking and
prosecute those who perpetrate it. I believe more can be done to
address the complex issues associated with trafficking, including what
drives it and how victims can receive the counseling they
need.
A Nightmarish War on
Women
Sex trafficking affects individuals of all backgrounds and
races, but it disproportionately impacts women, both domestically and
internationally. Although news headlines often glibly refer to a "war on
women" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy
to sex trafficking
a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable
among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against
their will.
One proposal in my
bill is a court-based pilot program modeled after Hawaii's "girls
courts" and the federal drug court system. Often juvenile trafficking
victims are charged with a delinquency offense in order to be detained and
kept away from their traffickers. Many laws on prostitution do not
differentiate between adult prostitutes and children who have been
exploited for sex. These minors should be considered victims but are often
treated as offenders and fail to receive counseling and support while
in detention. Some later return to the trafficker, who often warns
their victims to distrust the police. A specialized court docket and
integrated judicial supervision would put the well-being of the victim
first, providing an opportunity for victims to return home and undergo
treatment. Detention alone does not amount to
rescue.
My bill also seeks to punish the drivers of
the problem
both traffickers and the buyers, or "johns," they serve.
First, there should be strict enforcement of laws already on the books
that prohibit the purchase of sex with minors. Second, child victims
should have a longer statutory limitations period to file a civil suit
against their trafficker. Finally, those who distribute or benefit
financially from commercial advertising that promotes prostitution
should face criminal charges. My bill would do all
three.
Inspiring Global
Action
As part of the criminal underworld, trafficking is hard to measure in
scope and magnitude. The precise number of domestic victims is unknown.
However, greater interagency cooperation and outreach can assist
efforts to understand who is affected as well as determining the most
effective ways to respond.
The
United States remains the freest, most prosperous nation in the world.
And yet, it is also a country where traffickers still find and
transit victims, putting U.S. citizens and foreign nationals at risk.
Fighting human trafficking within our borders will not completely eradicate
the problem, which affects some 21 million people worldwide. We can,
however, serve as a model for other countries to follow and better
protect those here at home.
