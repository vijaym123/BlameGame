Dear Friends,
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit today issued an
opinion today
that would allow the Environmental Protection Agency to
delay permits, which will result in lost jobs for West Virginians as
businesses struggle to operate under uncertainty.
However, I'm
pleased to announce that a bill I introduced that would fix this
issue, the Coal Jobs Protection Act, will be marked up by the House
Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee next week. As a senior member
of the committee, I am pleased to see the committee take action on
this important legislation.
The Coal Jobs Protection Act would
create clear deadlines on permitting decisions and to require the EPA
and the Army Corps of Engineers to make regulatory decisions
transparently. As the EPA and Army Corps operate now, their guidance is not
subject to public notice and comment, contradicting this
administrations stated commitment to transparency.
The Coal Jobs
Protection Act would clearly address todays decision and restore certainty to
important West Virginia industries, and I will continue to fight for
the jobs of men and women who depend on West Virginias coal
industry.
LET'S PUT WEST VIRGINIA BACK TO WORK
West
Virginians want to work, want to provide for their families, and want to
build a better future. But in todays economy, finding a job has been
very, very difficult.
That's why I'm proud to support H.R.
803, the Workforce Opportunity and Innovation Act, which would provide
direct access to career training, coordinate training resources already
available at community colleges and technical centers, and eliminate
redundant federal training programs. The House voted Wednesday to pass
this bipartisan bill 415-6.
Employers want to hire in
their communities; workers want to have the skills and training to secure
good-paying jobs in their communities. By aligning workers skills
with employers needs, we can help get West Virginia and America working
again.
I spoke on the House floor in support of this bill
and about the need to grow our economy and create opportunities for
West Virginians.
