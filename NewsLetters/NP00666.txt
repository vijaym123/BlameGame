Dear Friend,
Memorial Day is an occasion to commemorate our
fallen soldiers, men and women who gave their lives to preserve our
freedom in this country. That's why, on Monday, Northeast Georgia will lower
its flags to half-staff and raise them again at noon -- symbolic of
the sacrifices our military members have made and also the God-given
liberty we enjoy, because of their bravery.
On Monday, I'll be at Lula's
remembrance ceremony, encouraging America's next generation to appreciate the
valor of those who died in conflicts from the Civil War -- when Memorial
Day first began -- to World War II and the present day, as troops
return from Iraq and Afghanistan.
This week in
Congress, I introduced a House resolution
recognizing
the daisy as the national flower of military caregivers , the unsung
heroes of our armed forces, who will help them heal from war. And I
voted for measures to increase U.S. military veterans' access to health
care and job training.
As an Air Force Reserve chaplain, who served in Iraq, I
know the troubles many troops will encounter at home, especially when
they remember friends they left on the battlefield. On Memorial Day, our
nation will honor their service.
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
