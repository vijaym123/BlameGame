This week we announced the winner of the
2014 Congressional Art Contest . The winner this year was
Laura Vitolina from Summit Christian Academy. She won with her scratch
drawing Giraffe. It will hang in the United States Capitol for a
year. It is well worth your time to see it when you are in
Washington.
Wednesday, during the House Armed Services
Committees markup of the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), Congressman Mike Conaway offered an amendment that would make the
victims of the 2009 Fort Hood attack eligible to receive Purple
Hearts.
It was a big win for the Fort Hood Community .
The Committee adopted the amendment unanimously by voice vote showing
strong bipartisan support. The bill now has to be passed by the full
House and the Senate. I have spoken to both of our Senators about this
measure and I have high hopes that this legislation will be signed
into law this year.
Also this week the House
voted on many bills to rein in President Obamas
culture of corruption . On Wednesday, the House passed
H.Res. 574 ,
to hold Lois
Lerner, Former Director, Exempt Organizations, IRS, in contempt of
Congress ,
by a vote of 231-187 (See
Roll Call #203 ). On Thursday, May 8, 2014, the House passed
H.Res. 567 , to establish a Select Committee on the
2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, by a vote of 232-186 (See
Roll Call #209 ).
On Friday, the House passed
H.R. 10 , the
Success and Opportunity through Quality
Charter Schools Act , by a vote of 360-45 (See
Roll Call #217 ).
H.R. 10 streamlines and modernizes the
existing charter school programs under the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act into one and refocuses the new program to promote
high-quality charter schools.
Moreover, H.R. 10 allows states to use
federal funds to start new charter schools and expand and replicate
existing, high-performing charter schools and authorizes a charter
management organization grant program to support the organization's success in
replicating and expanding high-quality charter schools nationwide.
Im

on May 19 th . See you back
home!
