Small Business Week
Visits
Last week, I celebrated National Small Business Week by
visiting two Seventh District Small Businesses:
Heritage Community Bank
in Hartsville
and
Rogers
Brothers Farm Peanut Processing Facility in Lydia.
I thanked
each business for the ongoing efforts to grow our local economy and
improve our community.
At Heritage Bank, we discussed Dodd-Frank regulations impeding their
ability to lend.
We discussed a situation involving a local
church that has been active in the community for more than 50 years.
The congregation has nearly paid off the existing mortgage on the
church building and wanted to use the building as collateral in order to
build a new
Sunday
School facility.
Federal
regulations put in place by the FDIC require the church to get both
buildings appraised as one new unit, which forces the church to pay a 15
percent mortgage downpayment on both units-- the existing church and
new
Sunday
School building. This regulation makes it
incredibly hard for churches, community centers, and businesses to
expand.
Frankly, these regulations make little sense.
I plan
to meet with the American Bankers Association and my colleagues on
the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to see what we can do
legislatively to repeal these regulations and free up our community banks ability
to lend.
Today, Gil Rogers and his sons operate one of the largest modern
row crop farms in South Carolina, producing cotton, corn, peanuts,
wheat, and soybeans.
My visit to the
Rogers Brothers Peanut Farm
was nuts (pun
intended)!
Given the current water
shortage impacting Californias agriculture industry, farmers across
the country are looking for ways to innovate and adapt.
The Rogers
brothers recognize the importance of embracing new technology and
have grown their business by taking advantage of opportunities and
utilizing available resources.
Here is a picture from our farm
tour.
We are infront of a huge pile of

Myrtle Beach VA Clinic Visit
&amp; Roundtable
Out of every population
in our district, I hear complaints most often from our veterans.
Since nearly half of their concerns tend to be health care related, I
contacted Ralph Johnson VAMC and requested a tour of the Myrtle Beach
VA Clinic and a roundtable meeting to discuss how we can improve
care.
It seems that one of the issues is the lack of information
made available to veterans about VA health care coverage and services
available.
If you have questions about your health care coverage,
please contact our Myrtle Beach VA Clinic at
843-477-0177
and
request information about their new patient orientation sessions.
They hold orientation meetings often and any veteran can attend.
You can read more about my clinic visit and my thoughts on privatizing
the agency

Tune Into Carolina
Live with Tim McGinnis Today!
Last week, I stopped by the WPDE studio and taped a
district update interview with Tim McGinnis. Tim and I discussed I-73, VA
health care, immigration reform, Medicare reform, and more. The
segment airs today, Sunday, at 11:00 a.m.
It is an honor to represent you and your
family.
Have a good
week,
