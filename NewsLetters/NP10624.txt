Dear Friend,
I would like to invite you to my field hearing in Kingman on Monday.
This hearing will focus on the people, known as Downwinders, who were
exposed to ionized radiation from nuclear weapons tests and developed
cancer as a result. From 1945 to 1962, the United States conducted
nearly 200 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in Nevada, spreading
radioactive fallout over Arizona and several other states.
At this hearing, I will give an overview of the history of nuclear
weapons testing in Nevada, the law that Congress passed in 1990 to
compensate Downwinders, and the bill I introduced to make all affected
residents of Mohave County eligible for federal compensation.
Currently, only the part of Mohave County north of the Grand Canyon is
eligible for compensation.
We will also hear testimony from numerous witnesses whose lives have
been affected in more ways than one. Several of the witnesses have
developed life-threatening cancers from radiation exposure associated
with the nuclear testing commissioned by the government.
Other
witnesses have lost loved ones and countless friends. This hearing
provides a forum for their stories to be told.
Additionally, all of the testimonies, statements, and information
shared at the hearing will be submitted in to the Congressional Record
and will assist lawmakers in reforming a well-intentioned but flawed
law.
Here are the details for the time and location of the hearing:
MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2014
Downwinders Field Hearing
TIME: 10:00AM-12:00PM
LOCATION: Mohave County Board of Supervisors Auditorium
700 W. Beale St.
