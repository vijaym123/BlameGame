Dear Friend,
Our deadline for August is less than 72 hours away. Here&rsquo;s how our grassroots fundraising looks with fewer than three days to go:
Ed is counting on supporters like you to give his campaign the financial resources it needs to win.
Can you get us $5, or even $10, closer to our $55,000 goal?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
This campaign is heating up. We can&rsquo;t afford to start missing our goals now. If you don&rsquo;t want Massachusetts to elect a Republican this November,
please help us get to $55,000 before midnight on Sunday.
Thanks,
Colleen
