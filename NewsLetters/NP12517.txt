You Just Can't Make This Stuff Up
Monday, February 10, 2014
Election year politics can sometimes bring about strange results.
Without seeking Congressional approval, President Obama has yet again delayed part of Obamacares employer mandate, one of the laws major provisions.
By manipulating its implementation, the Administration is now unilaterally exempting employers with less than 100 employees from the employer mandate until 2016.
President Obama is essentially admitting that Obamacare, his signature health care law, is a house of cards in a slow state of collapse.
This act by the Administration to delay a provision of Obamacare without Congressional approval is another example of presidential overreach.
To borrow from a June 2012
Politico
story entitled "Obamas Policy Strategy: Ignore Laws" -
"'The President is using executive power to do things Congress has refused to do, and that does fit a disturbing pattern of expansion of executive power under President Obama,' said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law scholar at George Washington University Law School, known for his support of progressive causes as well as his ire at Obama for not prosecuting Bush officials in connection with alleged torture of terror suspects.
"'In many ways, President Obama has fulfilled the dream of an imperial presidency that Richard Nixon strived for. On everything from [DOMA] to the gaming laws, this is a President who is now functioning as a super legislator. He is effectively negating parts of the criminal code because he disagrees with them. That does go beyond the pale.'"
And folks, you just cant make this stuff up!
