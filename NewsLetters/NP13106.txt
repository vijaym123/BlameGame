Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
This has been a busy
week and I appreciate having the opportunity to share news from
Washington and South Carolina, as well as the work I am doing in the
United States Senate on your behalf.
A New Opportunity Agenda
This week, I was proud to introduce a new opportunity agenda to help
create a better life for Americans of all backgrounds.
When I was growing up, my now 93-year-old grandfather would hold his
newspaper at the breakfast table every day. He looked like an
executive, or a doctor, or an attorney, hoping an impressionable young
man would see the benefit of education.
But my grandfather could not read. The circumstances of life forced him
out of a segregated classroom in the third grade to a cotton field so
he could help support his family. He has now lived long enough to see a
grandson elected to Congress and a great-grandson graduate from Georgia
Tech and start graduate school at Duke.
That is the power of opportunity in America. In a single lifetime,
families can go from not being given a fair chance to read to
graduating from college. We only need a level playing field to start
from, a fair chance to succeed, and an appreciation for education and
hard work.
My opportunity agenda challenges both parties to look at economic
growth, prosperity, and education in a different way. The approaches of
the last 50 years, since the beginning of the War on Poverty, have not
produced the results that were promised. It's time for a new way
forward. Read more about my opportunity agenda here
.
I also spoke about my agenda on the Senate floor.

CHOICE Act and SKILLS Act
The first two pieces of my opportunity agenda were introduced this
week. The first is the CHOICE Act, which expands educational
opportunities for children with disabilities, children living on
military bases, and children living in impoverished areas.
As someone who grew up poor and nearly failed out of high school, I
know the importance of empowering parents and teachers to make a
difference in a child's life. Kids who succeed in the classroom have a
better chance of succeeding later in life. Education is the cornerstone
of success, and the CHOICE Act is a great first step towards ensuring
more kids across our nation have access to a great one.
The second item introduced this week was the SKILLS Act, which would
provide much-needed reforms to the government's bureaucratic maze of
workforce development and training programs. Unfortunately, too many
Americans who are looking for work simply don't have the skills they
need for jobs that are available. This reform will make job training
more immediately available and make sure our workforce investment and
development system is in a better position to assist folks who are
looking for work.
The SKILLS Act will help to ensure that training programs are doing
what they're designed to do while eliminating duplication and waste. I
believe this bill is a winner for workers, employers, and taxpayers.

Senate floor introducing these bills here

Unanswered Questions on Benghazi
On Wednesday we unfortunately learned from a new Senate report
that the terrorist attacks in
Benghazi could have been prevented. These findings are troubling and
saddening, and further advance the belief of many Americans that the
Obama administration was not prepared for the threats we face from
terrorists such as al-Qaeda.
The administration is still not providing answers to important
questions about what happened during the time surrounding and following
the Benghazi attacks. I will continue to push hard for this information
- Americans, particulary the families of those who were killed, deserve
to know the truth.
It is an honor to serve the people of South Carolina in the United
States Senate.
I appreciate hearing your feedback, and please don't
hesitate to contact my office with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

About
Tim
Constituent

News
and
Media
Friends,
Thank
you
for
subscribing
to
my
e-newsletter.
This
has
been
a
busy
week
and
I
appreciate
having
the
opportunity
to
share
news
from
Washington
and
South

as

A
New
Opportunity
Agenda
This
week,
I
was
proud
to
introduce
a
new
opportunity
agenda
to
help
create
a
better
life
for
Americans
of
all
backgrounds.
When
I
was
growing
up,
my
now
93-year-old
grandfather
would
hold
his
newspaper
at
the
breakfast
table
every
day.
He
looked
like
an
executive,
or
a

or
an
attorney,
hoping
an
impressionable
young
man
would
see
the
benefit
of
education.
But
my
grandfather
could
not
read.
The
circumstances
of
life
forced
him
out
of
a
segregated
classroom
in
the
third
grade
to
a
cotton
field
so
he
could
help
support
his
family.
He
has
now
lived
long
enough
to
see
a
grandson
elected
to
Congress
and
a
great-grandson
graduate
from
Georgia
Tech
and
start
graduate
school
at
Duke.
That
is
the
power
of
opportunity
in
America.
In
a
single
lifetime,
families
can
go
from
not
being
given
a
fair
chance
to
read
to
graduating
from
college.
We
only
need
a
level
playing
field
to
start
from,
a
fair
chance
to
succeed,
and
an
appreciation
for
education
and
hard
work.
My
opportunity
agenda
challenges
both
parties
to
look
at
economic
growth,
prosperity,
and
education
in
a
different
way.
The

results
that

CHOICE
Act
and
SKILLS
Act
The
first
two
pieces
of
my
opportunity
agenda
were
introduced
this
week.
The
first
is
the
CHOICE
Act,
which
expands
educational
opportunities
for
children
with
disabilities,
children
living
on
military
bases,
and
children
living
in
impoverished
areas.
As
someone
who
grew
up
poor
and
nearly
failed
out
of
high
school,
I
know
the
importance
of
empowering
parents
and
teachers
to
make
a
difference
in
a
child&#8217;s
life.
Kids
who
succeed
in
the
classroom
have
a
better
chance
of
succeeding
later
in
life.
Education
is
the
cornerstone
of
success,
and
the
CHOICE
Act
is
a
great
first
step
towards
ensuring
more
kids
across
our
nation
have
access
to
a
great
one.
The
second
item
introduced
this
week
was
the
SKILLS
Act,
which
would
provide
much-needed
reforms
to
the
government&#8217;s
bureaucratic
maze
of
workforce
development
and
training
programs.
Unfortunately,
too
many
Americans
who
are
looking
for
work
simply
don&#8217;t
have
the
skills
they
need
for
jobs
that
are
available.
This
reform
will
make
job
training
more
immediately
available
and
make
sure
our
workforce
investment
and
development
system
is
in
a
better
position
to
assist
folks
who
are
looking
for
work.
The
SKILLS
Act
will
help
to
ensure
that
training
programs
are
doing
what
they&#8217;re
designed
to
do
while
eliminating
duplication
and
waste.
I
believe
this
bill
is
a
winner
for
workers,
employers,
and
taxpayers.

this
legislation

Unanswered
Questions
on
Benghazi
On
Wednesday
we
unfortunately
learned
from
a
new
Senate
report
that
the
terrorist
attacks
in
Benghazi
could
have
been
prevented.
These
findings
are
troubling
and
saddening,
and
further
advance
the
belief
of
many
Americans
that
the
Obama
administration
was
not
prepared
for
the
threats
we
face
from
terrorists
such
as
al-Qaeda.
The
administration
is
still
not
providing
answers
to
important
questions
about
what
happened
during
the
time
surrounding
and
following
the
Benghazi
attacks.
I
will
continue
to
push
hard
for
this
information
&#8211;
Americans,
particulary
the
families
of
those
who
were
killed,
deserve
to
know
the
truth.
It
is
an
honor
to
serve
the
people
of
South
Carolina
in
the
United
States
Senate.
I
appreciate
hearing
your
feedback,
and
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
contact
my
office
with
any
questions
or
concerns.
