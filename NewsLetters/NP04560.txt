Remembering Our Nations
Veterans
On Veterans Day, we join all Americans in
honoring the men and women who have served in our nations armed
forces around the world.
Without their sacrifices, and those of their
families, Americans would not enjoy the freedoms we
do.
Last July, Congress gave final
approval to
H.R. 3230
the Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act
and the President signed the measure into
law on August 7.
The agreement is a strong, bipartisan first step
to addressing the health care crisis our nations veterans have been
facing for too long.
Among other things, the Act will help the VA
hire more doctors and more nurses and staff more clinics; further,
for veterans who cant get timely care through the VA, this bill will
help them get the care through non-VA
providers.
Mark Your Calendar
- Sign Up for Health Insurance this
Saturday!
Open Enrollment,
which begins this Saturday , November 15, is the time when you can
find a new Marketplace health insurance plan, keep your current plan,
or see if you can get help paying for coverage.
If you already
have coverage, its time to review your plan and decide if you want to
make changes for 2015.
If you dont take action by December 15,
2014, you could miss out on better deals and cost
savings.
If you have any questions about
enrolling for health insurance through the federal marketplace, please
call Rep. Levins Roseville office at (586) 498-7122 and we will be
happy to assist you.
Congress Returns for Lame Duck
Session
Members of the House
of Representatives and Senate return to Washington this week
following the elections for a one-month lame duck session before the 113th
Congress ends.
The House and Senate have a full plate of
unfinished work in front of them.
They must reach agreement on all the
budget bills that fund the government for 2015.
Congress must
also finalize the annual defense policy bill; in addition, the House and
Senate will very likely take action to fund military operations
against the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and also
provide additional resources to fight the Ebola
outbreak.
Levin
Urges Sustained Resources for Great Lakes
Restoration
On October 30, the
Environmental Protection Agency announced that two toxic hot spots in the Great
Lakes had been cleaned up.
One was Deer Lake in the Upper
Peninsula near Lake Superior, and the other was White Lake, which is just
north of Muskegon adjacent to Lake Michigan.
These two sites were
contaminated by decades of industrial pollution.
The Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative (GLRI) greatly accelerated the cleanup of Deer
Lake and White Lake.
Since 2010, Congress has provided over $1.6 billion for more
than 2000 restoration projects
large and small
in and around the
Great Lakes Basin.
Reps. Levin and Louise Slaughter of New York
recently circulated a
letter
to urge the Obama
Administration to include at least $300 million in funding for the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative in the Presidents next budget request to
Congress.
A bipartisan group of 42 other House lawmakers joined
us on this letter.
