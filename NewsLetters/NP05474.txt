I know it&rsquo;s late, but I need to talk to you.
Republican outside groups are spending close to $10 million to defeat me, more than any other candidate in the entire country .
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that&rsquo;s a frightening statistic -- but it&rsquo;s just a number.
No matter how much they spend, I won&rsquo;t stop fighting for the issues you care about most.
But listen, I can&rsquo;t do it alone.
With 3 hours to go until the deadline, we&rsquo;re still $2,253 short of our goal.
