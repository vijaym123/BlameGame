DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
Almost two decades
ago, a Legislative Issues Seminar was started on Capitol Hill to engage
public officials, community and business leaders, and interested
citizens from the communities that make up the Third Congressional
District.
This year we will once again continue this great tradition
with the Nineteenth Annual Third District Day in Washington,
D.C.!
An official welcome event will be held on the evening of
Tuesday, April 8, 2014.
Third District Day itself
will be held on
Wednesday, April 9
in the Gold Room,
located in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill in
Washington, D.C. The program will start promptly at 8:30am and run to
approximately 2:00pm.
Third District Day is a meaningful day-long
seminar that provides in-depth insight on a wide variety of issues
facing our District and our country. Past speakers have included George
Stephanopoulos, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Army Chief of Staff General
Ray Odierno, Judy Woodruff, the late-Senator Ted Kennedy, and Leader
Nancy Pelosi.
This is an open invitation and I encourage you
to join us for this unique opportunity to interact with key
congressional lawmakers, media personalities and administration officials and
see firsthand how the Capitol works.
If you would like to
learn more about Third District Day, or to RSVP to both events, please
visit my website at:
https://tsongas.house.gov/third-district-day-2014
I encourage you to RSVP early and to
make your travel arrangements as soon as possible. Space is limited for
this event and we will have to take RSVPs on a first come, first serve
basis.
For additional information you may contact my
District Office at (978) 459-0101.
I look forward to seeing you
in Washington, D.C. this April!
Please be sure to scroll

have been working.
As always, I hope that you continue to
provide me with your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on these or any
other subjects via my
website

Sincerely,
Niki

WIND PTC
This week I spoke on
the House Floor in support of extending the wind production tax credit.
The wind industry has proven to be beneficial for the environment,
American manufacturing, and high-skilled job creation in
Massachusetts.
As a founding member of the Sustainable Energy and
Environment Coalition (SEEC), and a member of the House Natural Resources
Committee, I have seen firsthand the positive impact clean energy
initiatives can have on our environment and our economy, boosting job
growth.
For example, in the past two years, clean energy jobs in
Massachusetts have grown by 24%, and are projected to grow another 11%
in 2014.

ARIZONA STATE LEGISLATION
Earlier
this week, the Arizona state legislature passed a bill allowing
businesses to deny services to anyone who doesn't follow the proprietors own
personal religious beliefs. The legislation is aimed at discriminating
against members of the LGBT community, but had serious implications
that could have lead to widespread discriminatory behavior, such as
against religious groups.
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer
ultimately vetoed this shortsighted bill, an action that was urged by numerous
national organizations, major corporations and an array of prominent,
bipartisan public officials. I commend the Governor for her veto, but
the simple fact that it got to her desk is
disturbing.
Our nation is stronger when we commit to defending the rights and
human dignity of all people. The Arizona law did the opposite, and in
doing so conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and the individual
liberty and freedom that our nation was founded upon. Intolerance is a
dangerous precedent to set. I will continue to work with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle, from across the country in the pursuit of
equality.
