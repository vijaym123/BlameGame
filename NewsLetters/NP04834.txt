Grants E-Newsletter
October 2014
As your Congressman, it is my privilege and honor to provide you with services to help you and your organization navigate the federal grants process. My office is working especially hard in these tumultuous economic times to make non profits, small businesses and municipalities more aware of grants and funding opportunities at the federal level.
This newsletter is designed to help you search for and apply for grants and to provide you with the most up-to-date grants resources. My office stands ready to assist you with your grants work in any way we can. In addition, we welcome your feedback and comments and encourage your suggestions on how to make this newsletter more helpful to your organization.
Below, you will find a list of recent grants awarded in my Congressional District and a list of some new federal funding opportunities. Please be sure to check with awarding agencies, as this information is subject to change. For a full list of federal funding opportunities and programs, including the newest opportunities, I encourage you to visit:
www.grants.gov
and

Should you have any questions or if you would like to learn more about the grants process, please contact my Grants Coordinator, Conor Quinn, in my District Office at (860) 278 &ndash; 8888.
All the Best,
