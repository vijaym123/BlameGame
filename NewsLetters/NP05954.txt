Greetings:
I am proud and honored to represent the great state of North Dakota as
your United States Senator and welcome an opportunity to share with you
in this periodic newsletter some of the work I'm doing in Washington on
behalf of the people of our state.
North Dakota continues to garner national attention for the tremendous
strides we are making to harness our natural resources, grow our
economy and create good jobs for our people. We can and should
duplicate this success on a national level, which is why I have been
working with my colleagues in the Senate to develop smart, common-sense
policies - such as building the Keystone XL pipeline - that will
improve our national security, grow our economy and put Americans back
to work.
This issue of our newsletter focuses on energy - a matter of critical
importance to both our state and our nation. In what follows, you can
read more about some of the energy initiatives I have been working on
to build a comprehensive, states-first energy policy for America. In
future issues, we will talk about other topical matters and important
issues of the day.
As your senator, I am working to share our state's values, ideas and
work ethic in the U.S. Senate. I hope this newsletter will serve as
another way we can communicate about the issues that impact North
Dakota and our country.
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

National Quadrennial Energy Review
Hoeven Tells DOE, DOT Secretaries a Comprehensive Energy Plan Like
North Dakota's Will Solve Infrastructure Constraints
Senator Proposed Regular Energy Review in His Domestic Energy and Jobs
Act
BISMARCK, N.D. - Senator John Hoeven, a member of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee, today told Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and a group
of energy leaders that the way to create jobs, grow the economy and
make ourselves energy independent is by developing all of the nation's
abundant resources in tandem.
"As governor, I worked for a decade to build a comprehensive energy
plan for North Dakota called Empower North Dakota. It is a true
all-of-the-above plan that did not pick winners and losers, but rather
encouraged innovation and entrepreneurship in all energy sectors, both
renewable and traditional. Our success with that plan in North Dakota
is evident from east to west. We can do the same thing on a national
scale, but we need the administration and Majority Leader Reid to work
with us," Hoeven said. "I believe we have legislation drafted and ready
to go right now that would help us realize the full potential of all of
our energy sources." Click here to read more.

BISMARCK,

&#8211;
Senator
John
Hoeven,
a
member
of
the
U.S.
Senate
Energy
Committee,
today
told
Energy
Secretary
Ernest

and
a
group
of
energy
leaders
that
the
way
to
create

grow
the

and
make

energy
independent
is
by
developing
all
of
the
nation&#8217;s
abundant
resources
in

&#8220;As
governor,
I
worked
for
a
decade
to
build
a
comprehensive
energy
plan
for
North
Dakota
called
Empower
North
Dakota.
It
is
a
true
all-of-the-above
plan
that
did
not
pick
winners
and

but
rather
encouraged
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
in

both

Our
success
with
that
plan
in
North

is
evident
from
east
to
west.
We
can
do
the
same
thing
on
a
national
scale,
but
we
need
the
administration
and
Majority
Leader
Reid
to
work
with
us,&#8221;
Hoeven
said.
&#8220;I
believe
we
have
legislation
drafted
and
ready
to
go
right
now
that
would
help
us
realize
the
full
potential
of
all
of
our
