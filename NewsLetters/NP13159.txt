Dear Friend,
Great
news! My VA CORE legislation to help end the massive VA claims backlog
has been signed into law! We have a responsibility to stand up for
veterans, and VA CORE is the kind of bipartisan, common-sense effort
that can improve their quality of life. In case you missed it,
The Arizona Republic
ran a story about this achievement. I hope you will take a moment to read and share the story below.
Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One

The Arizona Republic:
Kirkpatrick bill first from AZ signed by president this Congress
Rebekah L. Sanders, of The Arizona Republic&rsquo;s politics team, filed this post :
U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick ,
D-Ariz., recently became the first member of the state&rsquo;s House
delegation to have legislation signed into law during the 113th
Congress.
Her bill, which
she championed with other Democrats in May ,
aims to reduce the bottleneck of benefits claims for veterans. It
directs the Pentagon to provide electronic service-treatment records to
the Department of Veterans Affairs quickly after a veteran leaves the
military. Among the co-sponsors were Arizona&rsquo;s four other Democrats &mdash;
Reps. Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema, Ed Pastor and Raul Grijalva.
The legislation
passed as an amendment to the Defense Department spending bill . It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on Dec. 26.
In the
most unproductive Congress in recorded history &mdash; the number of bills
enacted in the 113th session is the lowest since 1947 &mdash; no other member
of the House from Arizona had their legislation signed into law. But
several had bills or amendments that passed the House in 2013. It
remains to be seen if the Senate will take them up.
