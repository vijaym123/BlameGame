Rubio Urges President To Send Clear
Message: We Are On Israels
Side
On Thursday, Marco delivered
a
Senate floor speech
urging President
Obama to send a clear message of support
to the State of Israel and its
government. An excerpt of the speech is
below:
Rubio: [W]hat they need from
this country is a president and a U.S.
government that aligns itself squarely
on their side. No double-talk, no fancy
diplomatic language that you can read
between the lines on. A very clear
statement. In this conflict, we
are on Israels side, and we will
support them with anything they need to
ensure their stability and their
survival.

Rubio, Warner Introduce Dynamic
Student Loan Repayment Act
Marco and Senator Mark R. Warner
(D-VA) introduced
The
Dynamic Student Loan Repayment Act
to
consolidate, simplify and improve
income-based repayment options for
federal student loans.With the
bipartisan Rubio-Warner proposal, federal
student loan payments would be
automatically adjusted based upon income.
Borrowers will be able to repay loans at
a more affordable pace and with more
manageable payments, providing relief to
those who worry about how they will repay
their debt just as they are getting
started in the workforce.
On average, todays
graduates carry nearly $30,000 in
student loan debt. But our current loan
repayment system often turns what
should be reasonable debts into
crippling payments. Some graduates are
forced to work multiple jobs, often in
fields they didnt train for,
simply to keep from defaulting on these
loans,
Rubio and Warner said in a joint
statement . Current
income-driven repayment plans are
underutilized because the system is so
complicated. Our proposal doesnt
just layer another option on top of
existing plans. Instead, it will
streamline the current repayment
options into a simpler, user-friendly
repayment plan, one that automatically
adjusts to the changes in a
borrowers income with none of
the hassle or paperwork required in the
current system.
This issue is personal for
both of us,
Rubio and Warner said .
Neither of us could have
attended college were it not for
federal student loans. We both remember
months when our paychecks were low and
we werent sure if we could make
our payments. Each of us has heard from
constituents affected by crippling
student debt. Our Dynamic Student Loan
Repayment Act will provide an
additional tool to help borrowers meet
their obligations, and this must be
part of a broader conversation about
how to make higher education more
affordable.
Last year, Rubio and Warner partnered
on another bipartisan proposal
toaddress growing concern about the
rising cost of higher education. With
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the senators
introduced The
Student
Right to Know Before You Go Act of
2013 , which would change college
reporting guidelines so future students
could compare schools graduation
rates, average college loan debt, and
future potential earnings for particular
areas of study.
Rubio: Limited Action Against Russia
Makes U.S. Threats Look Hollow
On Wednesday, Marco issued the
following statement regarding President
Obamas announcement to impose new
sanctions on Russia:
The sanctions announced today
by President Obama are inadequate. It
is shameful that in the face of
continued Russian aggression against
Ukraine, the United States and our
European allies remain unwilling to
take decisive action to impose
comprehensive sanctions against
Russias banking, energy and arms
sectors. Just in recent days, Russia
has launched attacks against Ukrainian
forces defending their sovereign
territory and increased military
assistance to separatists who are
sowing chaos and instability in eastern
Ukraine. Russias actions in
Ukraine are not targeted
or calibrated to avoid economic
repercussions. Its ongoing aggression
against Ukraine is a direct threat to
the post-World War II international
order.
In the pace and scope of U.S.
assistance to Ukraine and the
willingness to impose tough penalties
on Putin, President Obama continues to
act as if the U.S. does not have a
direct interest in the outcome of the
Ukrainian peoples struggle to
choose their own destiny. Limited
actions like those announced today make
U.S. threats look hollow. Instead of
continuing to avoid decisive action, it
is time to stand with our Ukrainian
partners, including immediate provision
of lethal assistance requested by
Ukraine, as they attempt to enjoy the
fruits of freedom.
Marco also wrote
an
op-ed for Power Line , explaining why
recent cooperation between Russia and
Cuba is a sign of growing threats in
Latin America.
Constituent Casework Corner
Grace, a resident of North Florida,
was trying to get her residency card
renewed so that her Social Security
benefits could be reinstated. She
contacted Senator Rubios office to
request assistance with the process. A
member of the staff spoke with officials
from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Service and determined additional
information was required to complete the
application. She reached out to family
members who were able to provide the
additional information needed. Grace
received her new green card and the
Social Security Administration
subsequently reinstated her benefits.

Agency Updates
IRS Warns of Pervasive Telephone
Scam
The Internal Revenue Service warned
consumers about a sophisticated phone
scam targeting taxpayers, throughout the
country. Victims are told they owe money
to the IRS and it must be paid promptly
through a pre-loaded debit card or wire
transfer. If the victim refuses to
cooperate, they are then threatened with
arrest, deportation or suspension of a
business or drivers license. In
many cases, the caller becomes hostile
and insulting.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS, heres
what you should do:
If you know you owe taxes or you
think you might owe taxes, call the IRS
at 1.800.829.1040. The IRS employees at
that line can help you with a payment
issue
if there really is such
an issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to think that
you owe any taxes (for example,
youve never received a bill or
the caller made some bogus threats as
described above), then call and report
the incident to the Treasury Inspector
General for Tax Administration at
1.800.366.4484.
If youve been targeted by
this scam, you should also contact the
Federal Trade Commission and use their
FTC Complaint Assistant
at
FTC.gov .
Please add "IRS Telephone Scam" to the
comments of your complaint.
