LEGISLATION
March 05, 2014
Dear
David,
In the past week, I invited over 100,000
North State families to join me in telephone town hall events. We
discussed a variety of topics including fixing Californias drought,
immigration, the national debt, Obamacare, and countless other issues we
face. I enjoy these events because it ensures the lines of communication
between us stays open, even 3,000 miles away!
During last
night's telephone town hall, we invited listeners to participate in an
unscientific survey by answering several poll questions. We asked our
callers to weigh in on their thoughts pertaining to federal defense
spending and water storage in California. The results are
below:
As always, I encourage all First District
constituents to share your views with me. You can send me an email
through my
website
or contact my
offices
in Oroville, Auburn, Redding, and Washington with your
questions, concerns, or requests for assistance. I look forward to hearing
from you!
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa discussing
the status of the Redding Veterans Home with Ms. Diane Vanderpot,
Undersecretary for Veterans Homes at the CA Department of Veterans
Affairs.
