Doyle E-Newsletter # 58
Dear Friend:
Congress is off to a relatively productive start this year after a
bitter, contentious 2013.
Last fall saw a government shutdown and a showdown over defaulting on
the national debt. In the end, however, all that drama resulted in a
bipartisan compromise budget plan for 2014.
This year, a little over a month into the Second Session of the 113th
Congress, we have approved legislation to carry out that budget plan
and fund the federal government for its 2014 fiscal year, and we have
enacted a clean debt limit bill without teetering on the edge of
default as we did last fall and in 2011. By avoiding a last-minute game
of chicken, Congress spared our economythe disruption and damage that
the 2011 and 2013 default crises caused to our economy
. In addition, after many delays and disagreements,
Congress approved the "farm bill" - legislation reauthorizing federal
agriculture and nutrition programs.
After the last several years, in which partisan gridlock has paralyzed
Congress, we've passed three major bills in just a few short weeks.
Given all the ups and downs of recent years, that's a pretty positive
start for this session.
On the other hand, Congress has so far failed
to raise the minimum wage or extend federal emergency unemployment
benefits to help the long-term unemployed. The rest of this newsletter
addresses what Congress has done so far this year in greater detail.
Federal 2014 Budget
After many months in which Congressional Democrats and Republicans were
at loggerheads over funding levels for many federal programs, the House
passed a Bipartisan Budget Act
in December.
I joined a majority of my colleagues in the House in voting "yes" on
this bill. It would be inaccurate to say that this budget reflected all
my priorities or that I liked every decision made in it - it was a
compromise, the result of hard negotiations to find some common ground
that bipartisan majorities could live with. It was also a return to
what's called "regular order" - procedural-speak for the way everybody
is taught in school that Congress is supposed to work - and that was a
step forward as well.
In terms of policies, this budget restored some of the cuts scheduled
under "sequestration" for 2014 and 2015. I personally believe that the
budget-cutting austerity policies that sequestration enforced have been
a drag on the economy and job creation since 2011. I have been working
since 2008 to increase federal investments in programs like education,
transportation, and research, which I believe can speed up economic
growth and job creation. Consequently, I believe that Congress should
repeal sequestration completely.
But while the Bipartisan Budget Act
didn't reflect all of my priorities, it treated those priorities better
on the whole than allowing sequestration to take full effect. That's
why I gave it my support.
The federal budget is only a blueprint for federal spending - it sets
broad spending levels by functions like Defense and Transportation. The
actual spending for government agencies and individual programs is set
in "appropriations" bills. Last month, Congress approved an "omnibus"
appropriations bill covering all the operations of the federal
government for its Fiscal Year 2014
. I voted in support of this legislation
.
Debt Limit
Last week, Congress approved legislation
that raised the debt
ceiling, enabled the US Treasury to keep paying the federal government's
bills, and prevented a catastrophic default on the national debt. I
voted in favor of this legislation
. It seems to me that after a number of
Republican Majority attempts to extract policy concessions in exchange
for enabling the federal government to pay the bills for goods and
services it had already purchased, Congress finally passed a "clean"
debt limit bill - one with no major policy "riders." I have
consistently supported the consideration and enactment of clean debt
limit bills. Failure over the last 2 years to do so has caused harm to
our economy and reduced the US Government's credit rating. I am hopeful
that such irresponsible behavior may now be behind us.
Farm Bill
After months of negotiation, a House-Senate conference committee
finally reached agreement on H.R.
2642, legislation to reform and
reauthorize federal agriculture and nutrition programs,
and the House and
Senate each approved this final version of the bill, which the
President recently signed into law. I opposed H.R. 2642, however,
because it cut $8 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program ("SNAP"), the largest federal program to reduce hunger and
malnutrition. This change will eliminate billions of meals across the
country for low-income Americans. Approximately 175,000 households in
Pennsylvania will lose an average of $65 per month in SNAP benefits,
according to the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.
While the "Great Recession" is over, there are still a lot of Americans
who are feeling its impact, and we must not abandon them.
We must look
out for the most vulnerable in our community and help them back on
their feet. I have consistently opposed cuts in federal safety net
programs for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly, and, in fact, I
have strongly supported improvements in anti-hunger and anti-poverty
programs. I could not support legislation that guarantees billions of
dollars to wealthy farmers while cutting desperately needed assistance
to some of the poorest people in our country.
Unemployment Insurance
2008, Congress authorized temporary emergency unemployment benefits to
supplement the existing Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Extended
Benefit (EB) programs.
The joint state-federal Unemployment Compensation program provides
around 26 weeks of benefits to individuals who have become jobless
through no fault of their own. The Extended Benefit program provides a
number of additional weeks of unemployment benefits in states
experiencing high unemployment. The precise number of additional weeks
provided depends on the actual level of unemployment in that state, but
EB assistance can range from 13 to 39 weeks after UC benefits run out.
In a number of economic recessions (in 1958, 1961, 1971, 1974, 1982,
1991, 2002, and 2008), Congress has authorized additional weeks of
unemployment benefits under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation
program (EUC). The additional benefits have lasted between 6 and 63
weeks.
The number of Americans who have been unemployed for more than 6 months
is still very high.
It's currently around 3.6 million people - that's
about a third of the total number of Americans who have lost their jobs
and are looking for work. Many of those Americans have been relying on
EUC benefits to survive.
Unfortunately, the authorization for the latest round of Emergency
Unemployment benefits expired in December. As a result, the House Way
and Means Committee staff estimates that 1.3 million Americans lost
their EUC benefits at that point -- and that every week, an average of
72,000 individuals lose access to unemployment benefits, so that now
more than 1.7 million Americans have lost this desperately needed
assistance.
I strongly believe that Congress should continue providing Emergency
Unemployment Compensation to the long-term unemployed until
unemployment rates get back to normal. Unfortunately, the House
Majority Leadership has refused to even allow a vote to extend
Emergency Unemployment benefits on the House Floor. I will continue to
work to enact this much-needed legislation.
Minimum Wage
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour hasn't been raised since
2007.
It has lost a lot of its purchasing power over the last 6 years.
I believe it's time to raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation
going forward. I am a cosponsor of HR 1010, a bill that would raise the
minimum wage in 3 stages to $10.10 an hour.
Millions of Americans work full-time at minimum wage jobs - and the
majority of them aren't teenagers, they're adults with their own
households. Increasingly, senior citizens who have been forced back
into the workforce to survive are working at minimum wage jobs as well.
Sadly, you can work full-time at minimum wage and still live in
poverty. I find that unacceptable. That's why I support increasing the
minimum wage, and I will keep working to pass legislation to achieve
that goal.
The Affordable Care Act is Improving Access to Health Insurance
The Affordable Care Act was enacted with my support in 2010, and it's
been phasing in
for several years now.
Many new consumer protections
have already kicked in.
Several months ago, the health insurance exchanges created by the ACA
began operating and selling health insurance to individuals and small
businesses (The roll-out of the exchanges was plagued by computer
"glitches" last fall, but the system has been upgraded and is now
functional).
Most Americans will be required by law to have health insurance
coverage by March 31 of this year (click here
for more information about your rights and
responsibilities under the ACA). Most Americans will continue to get
their health care coverage through their employer. Tens of millions
more will continue to get their coverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or
the military health care system. But millions of Americans (including
Pennsylvanians) who need health insurance can now shop for affordable
insurance policies as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Many of them
will be eligible for tax credits to help them pay for their insurance
premiums, and individuals with low incomes may also qualify for reduced
cost-sharing like co-payments.
The best place to find out more about
all these provisions of the ACA is healthcare.gov
. I encourage you to look into ways that the Affordable Care
Act could benefit you.
VA Disease Reporting Requirement
As you may recall, there was a fatal outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease
at the Pittsburgh VA in 2012. I was very concerned about this outbreak,
and I asked for official review of the incident along with other
members of Pennsylvania's Congressional delegation. The House Veterans
Affairs Committee and the VA Inspector General's Office investigated
the outbreak and made a number of recommendations to prevent a similar
outbreak in any VA facility.
One of the issues identified in the course of these investigations was
the fact that the VA does not have to report outbreaks of contagious
diseases to state and local public health agencies. This gap in our
national monitoring of contagious diseases poses an unnecessary risk to
public health and even people's lives.
I have been working with Senator Casey, Representatives Tim Murphy and
Keith Rothfus, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee to draft
legislation to close this gap in our national disease reporting system.
I'm pleased to say that the House recently approved this legislation
as part of a package of veterans benefit
improvements
with a unanimous vote.
It continues to be an honor and a pleasure to serve you.

Dear
Friend:
Congress
is
off
to
a
relatively
productive
start
this
year
after
a
bitter,
contentious
2013.
Last
fall
saw
a
government
shutdown
and
a
showdown
over
defaulting
on
the
national
debt.
In
the
end,
however,
all
that
drama
resulted
in
a
bipartisan
compromise
budget
plan
for
2014.
This
year,
a
little
over
a
month
into
the
Second
Session
of
the
113th
Congress,
we
have
approved
legislation
to
carry
out
that
budget
plan
and
fund
the
federal
government
for
its
2014
fiscal
year,
and
we
have
enacted
a
clean
debt
limit
bill
without
teetering
on
the
edge
of
default
as
we
did
last
fall
and
in
2011.
By
avoiding
a
last-minute
game
of
chicken,
Congress
spared
our
economy the
disruption
and
damage
that
the
2011
and
2013
default
crises
caused
to
our
economy .
In
addition,
after
many
delays
and
disagreements,
Congress
approved
the
&#8220;farm
bill&#8221;
&#8211;
legislation
reauthorizing
federal
agriculture
and
nutrition
programs.
After
the
last
several
years,
in
which
partisan
gridlock
has
paralyzed
Congress,
we&#8217;ve
passed
three
major
bills
in
just
a
few
short
weeks.
Given
all
the
ups
and
downs
of
recent
years,
that&#8217;s
a
pretty
positive
start
for
this
session.
On
the
other
hand,
Congress
has
so
far
failed
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
or
extend
federal
emergency
unemployment
benefits
to
help
the
long-term
unemployed.
The
rest
of
this
newsletter
addresses
what
Congress
has
done
so
far
this
year
in
greater
detail.
Federal
2014
Budget
After
many
months
in
which
Congressional
Democrats
and
Republicans
were
at
loggerheads
over
funding
levels
for
many
federal
programs,
the
House
passed
a
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
in
December.
I
joined
a
majority
of
my
colleagues
in
the
House
in
voting
&#8220;yes&#8221;
on
this
bill.
It
would
be
inaccurate
to
say
that
this
budget
reflected
all
my
priorities
or
that
I
liked
every
decision
made
in
it
&#8211;
it
was
a
compromise,
the
result
of
hard
negotiations
to
find
some
common
ground
that
bipartisan
majorities
could
live
with.
It
was
also
a
return
to
what&#8217;s
called
&#8220;regular
order&#8221;
&#8211;
procedural-speak
for
the
way
everybody
is
taught
in
school
that
Congress
is
supposed
to
work
&#8211;
and
that
was
a
step
forward
as
well.
In
terms
of
policies,
this
budget
restored
some
of
the
cuts
scheduled
under
&#8220;sequestration&#8221;
for
2014
and
2015.
I
personally
believe
that
the
budget-cutting
austerity
policies
that
sequestration
enforced
have
been
a
drag
on
the
economy
and
job
creation
since
2011.
I
have
been
working
since
2008
to
increase
federal
investments
in
programs
like
education,
transportation,
and
research,
which
I
believe
can
speed
up
economic
growth
and
job
creation.
Consequently,
I
believe
that
Congress
should
repeal
sequestration
completely.
But
while
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
didn&#8217;t
reflect
all
of
my
priorities,
it
treated
those
priorities
better
on
the
whole
than
allowing
sequestration
to
take
full
effect.
That&#8217;s
why
I
gave
it
my
support.
The
federal
budget
is
only
a
blueprint
for
federal
spending
&#8211;
it
sets
broad
spending
levels
by
functions
like
Defense
and
Transportation.
The
actual
spending
for
government
agencies
and
individual
programs
is
set
in
&#8220;appropriations&#8221;
bills.
Last
month,
Congress
approved
an
&#8220;omnibus&#8221;
appropriations
bill
covering
all
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
for
its
Fiscal
Year
2014 .
I
voted
in
support
of
this
legislation .
Debt
Limit
Last
week,
Congress
approved
legislation
that
raised
the
debt
ceiling,
enabled
the
US
Treasury
to
keep
paying
the
federal
government&#8217;s
bills,
and
prevented
a
catastrophic
default
on
the
national
debt.
I
voted
in
favor
of
this
legislation .
It
seems
to
me
that
after
a
number
of
Republican
Majority
attempts
to
extract
policy
concessions
in
exchange
for
enabling
the
federal
government
to
pay
the
bills
for
goods
and
services
it
had
already
purchased,
Congress
finally
passed
a
&#8220;clean&#8221;
debt
limit
bill
&#8211;
one
with
no
major
policy
&#8220;riders.&#8221;
I
have
consistently
supported
the
consideration
and
enactment
of
clean
debt
limit
bills.
Failure
over
the
last
2&#189;
years
to
do
so
has
caused
harm
to
our
economy
and
reduced
the
US
Government&#8217;s
credit
rating.
I
am
hopeful
that
such
irresponsible
behavior
may
now
be
behind
us.
Farm
Bill
After
months
of
negotiation,
a
House-Senate
conference
committee
finally
reached
agreement
on
H.R.
2642,
legislation
to
reform
and
reauthorize
federal
agriculture
and
nutrition
programs,
and
the
House
and
Senate
each
approved
this
final
version
of
the
bill,
which
the
President
recently
signed
into
law.
I
opposed
H.R.
2642,
however,
because
it
cut
$8
billion
from
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(&#8220;SNAP&#8221;),
the
largest
federal
program
to
reduce
hunger
and
malnutrition.
This
change
will
eliminate
billions
of
meals
across
the
country
for
low-income
Americans.
Approximately
175,000
households
in
Pennsylvania
will
lose
an
average
of
$65
per
month
in
SNAP
benefits,
according
to
the
Greater
Philadelphia
Coalition
Against
Hunger.
While
the
&#8220;Great
Recession&#8221;
is
over,
there
are
still
a
lot
of
Americans
who
are
feeling
its
impact,
and
we
must
not
abandon
them.
We
must
look
out
for
the
most
vulnerable
in
our
community
and
help
them
back
on
their
feet.
I
have
consistently
opposed
cuts
in
federal
safety
net
programs
for
the
poor,
the
disabled,
and
the
elderly,
and,
in
fact,
I
have
strongly
supported
improvements
in
anti-hunger
and
anti-poverty
programs.
I
could
not
support
legislation
that
guarantees
billions
of
dollars
to
wealthy
farmers
while
cutting
desperately
needed
assistance
to
some
of
the
poorest
people
in
our
country.
Unemployment
Insurance
2008,
Congress
authorized
temporary
emergency
unemployment
benefits
to
supplement
the
existing
Unemployment
Compensation
(UC)
and
Extended
Benefit
(EB)
programs.
The
joint
state-federal
Unemployment
Compensation
program
provides
around
26
weeks
of
benefits
to
individuals
who
have
become
jobless
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
The
Extended
Benefit
program
provides
a
number
of
additional
weeks
of
unemployment
benefits
in
states
experiencing
high
unemployment.
The
precise
number
of
additional
weeks
provided
depends
on
the
actual
level
of
unemployment
in
that
state,
but
EB
assistance
can
range
from
13
to
39
weeks
after
UC
benefits
run
out.
In
a
number
of
economic
recessions
(in
1958,
1961,
1971,
1974,
1982,
1991,
2002,
and
2008),
Congress
has
authorized
additional
weeks
of
unemployment
benefits
under
the
Emergency
Unemployment
Compensation
program
(EUC).
The
additional
benefits
have
lasted
between
6
and
63
weeks.
The
number
of
Americans
who
have
been
unemployed
for
more
than
6
months
is
still
very
high.
It&#8217;s
currently
around
3.6
million
people
&#8211;
that&#8217;s
about
a
third
of
the
total
number
of
Americans
who
have
lost
their
jobs
and
are
looking
for
work.
Many
of
those
Americans
have
been
relying
on
EUC
benefits
to
survive.
Unfortunately,
the
authorization
for
the
latest
round
of
Emergency
Unemployment
benefits
expired
in
December.
As
a
result,
the
House
Way
and
Means
Committee
staff estimates
that
1.3
million
Americans
lost
their
EUC
benefits
at
that
point
--
and that
every
week,
an
average
of
72,000
individuals
lose
access
to
unemployment
benefits,
so
that
now
more
than
1.7
million
Americans
have
lost
this
desperately
needed
assistance.
I
strongly
believe
that
Congress
should
continue
providing
Emergency
Unemployment
Compensation
to
the
long-term
unemployed
until
unemployment
rates
get
back
to
normal.
Unfortunately,
the
House
Majority
Leadership
has
refused
to
even
allow
a
vote
to
extend
Emergency
Unemployment
benefits
on
the
House
Floor.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
enact
this
much-needed
legislation.
Minimum
Wage
The
federal
minimum
wage
of
$7.25
an
hour
hasn&#8217;t
been
raised
since
2007.
It
has
lost
a
lot
of
its
purchasing
power
over
the
last
6
years.
I
believe
it&#8217;s
time
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
and
index
it
to
inflation
going
forward.
I
am
a
cosponsor
of
HR
1010,
a
bill
that
would
raise
the
minimum
wage
in
3
stages
to
$10.10
an
hour.
Millions
of
Americans
work
full-time
at
minimum
wage
jobs
&#8211;
and
the
majority
of
them
aren&#8217;t
teenagers,
they&#8217;re
adults
with
their
own
households.
Increasingly,
senior
citizens
who
have
been
forced
back
into
the
workforce
to
survive
are
working
at
minimum
wage
jobs
as
well.
Sadly,
you
can
work
full-time
at
minimum
wage
and
still
live
in
poverty.
I
find
that
unacceptable.
That&#8217;s
why
I
support
increasing
the
minimum
wage,
and
I
will
keep
working
to
pass
legislation
to
achieve
that
goal.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
Improving
Access
to
Health
Insurance
The
Affordable
Care
Act
was
enacted
with
my
support
in
2010,
and
it&#8217;s
been
phasing
in
for
several
years
now.
Many
new
consumer
protections
have
already
kicked
in.
Several
months
ago,
the
health
insurance
exchanges
created
by
the
ACA
began
operating
and
selling
health
insurance
to
individuals
and
small
businesses
(The
roll-out
of
the
exchanges
was
plagued
by
computer
&#8220;glitches&#8221;
last
fall,
but
the
system
has
been
upgraded
and
is
now
functional).
Most
Americans
will
be
required
by
law
to
have
health
insurance
coverage
by
March
31
of
this
year
(click
here
for
more
information
about
your
rights
and
responsibilities
under
the
ACA).
Most
Americans
will
continue
to
get
their
health
care
coverage
through
their
employer.
Tens
of
millions
more
will
continue
to
get
their
coverage
through
Medicare,
Medicaid,
or
the
military
health
care
system.
But
millions
of
Americans
(including
Pennsylvanians)
who
need
health
insurance
can
now
shop
for
affordable
insurance
policies
as
a
result
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
Many
of
them
will
be
eligible
for
tax
credits
to

VA
Disease
Reporting
Requirement
As
you
may
recall,
there
was
a
fatal
outbreak
of
Legionnaire&#8217;s
Disease
at
the
Pittsburgh
VA
in
2012.
I
was
very
concerned
about
this
outbreak,
and
I
asked
for
official
review
of
the
incident
along
with
other
members
of
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
Congressional
delegation.
The
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
and
the
VA
Inspector
General&#8217;s
Office
investigated
the
outbreak
and
made
a
number
of
recommendations
to
prevent
a
similar
outbreak
in
any
VA
facility.
One
of
the
issues
identified
in
the
course
of
these
investigations
was
the
fact
that
the
VA
does
not
have
to
report
outbreaks
of
contagious
diseases
to
state
and
local
public
health
agencies.
This
gap
in
our
national
monitoring
of
contagious
diseases
poses
an
unnecessary
risk
to
public
health
and
even
people&#8217;s
lives.
I
have
been
working
with
Senator
Casey,
Representatives
Tim
Murphy
and
Keith
Rothfus,
and
the
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
to
draft
legislation
to
close
this
gap
in
our
national
disease
reporting
system.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
say
that
the
House
recently
approved
this
legislation
as
part
of
a
package
of
veterans
benefit
improvements
with
a
unanimous
vote.
It
continues
to
be
an
honor
and
a
pleasure
to
serve
you.
