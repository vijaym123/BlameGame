Happy New Year
Dear Friend,
Happy New Year! As we head in to the second session of the 113th
Congress, I wanted to reach out to you to learn more about your
priorities. It is an honor giving a voice to the people of Alameda and
Santa Clara Counties in Washington.
As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am in a
unique position to advocate for Silicon Valley priorities in government
spending programs. In that role, I have successfully secured nearly a
billion dollars of federal investments in our district.
While I will continue to work hard to make progress on all the
important issues listed below, I would love to know - what do you want
Congress to address in 2014? Check all that apply.
Investing in our innovation economy
Reforming the debt
limit process
Expanding STEM Education Opportunities
Enhancing
Social Security
Curtailing the NSA and protecting privacy rights
Getting Veterans' the Benefits they have earned
Reducing Income inequality
Ensuring Healthcare Reform is
a success
Protecting all Americans' Civil Rights
Enacting
Comprehensive immigration reform
Expanding Marriage equality
Guaranteeing Educational
equity
Fighting climate change
Repairing and upgrading our
transportation infrastructure
