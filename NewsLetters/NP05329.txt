Dear Friend,
You can't watch more than 5
minutes of national news without hearing about the ebola
outbreak.
While there's no need to panic, this is a very serious matter
and I want you to be assured it has my attention.
In
the meantime, I have a short survey question for you. I'm hearing
from many Georgians who believe we need a flight ban for those planes
arriving in the U.S. from ebola-stricken countries. Do you agree?
Let me know below:
Do you believe the United States
should put in place a ban on flights from countries that have reported an
outbreak of ebola? Do
you believe the U.S. should put in place a ban on flights from
ebola-stricken nations? Yes No Not sure if it would help or
hurt *By
