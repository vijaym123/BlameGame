Dear Friends,
Today, we
celebrate Veterans Day. Its a day we set aside to honor our true American
heroes who have served in the military to protect our great
nation.
I come from a family with deep roots in our
Military. I was an Air Force Pilot for 14 years, which I really do feel was
the coolest job in the world. My father served as a pilot in World
War II and 4 of my 5 brothers also served in the
military.
I have always said that the military is the greatest
incubator for leadership and I believe some of the best men and women in
our country have worn the military
uniform.
This Veterans Day, I am incredibly humbled to pay tribute our nations
veterans. Its because of their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their
families, that we are able to enjoy the freedoms of the United States of
America.
Last week, I paid tribute to
Veterans in a speech on the House Floor. Click on the picture below to watch
