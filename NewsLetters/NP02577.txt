Dear
Friend,
February was another busy (and cold!) month
in Washington.
I'd like to give you a brief update on what
happened this month as well as things to look for in the near
future.
First, and perhaps most importantly, the House passed a
full repeal of Obamacare.
Many folks have criticized us for doing
so because we've done this in the past.
This time was different.
This time we have a Republican-controlled Senate that will
actually take up the bill.
I'm looking forward to
that.
The Senate followed the House in passing the Keystone XL
Pipeline bill and we sent it to the President's desk. This week, the
President vetoed the bill.
Stay tuned...
This month,
we returned to our "regular" schedule of spending three weeks in
Washington and one back home.
The media often criticizes us for that
and reports that we are "off work."
That couldn't be further
from the truth.
I believe one of my most important jobs is to stay
in touch with folks back home who I represent.
So I spent last
week traveling the district.
It was a great opportunity to meet
with folks, tour a few local businesses, and even speak to an
upper-level government class at Wofford College.
I think the trouble with
the politicians who "go Washington" is that they never go back
home.

process

Carlisle to discuss manufacturing issues
One thing you can look for in the coming
weeks is a discussion on the Authorization of Military Force the
President has requested to fight ISIS.
I'm glad the President has
decided to ask Congress for the authority to fight ISIS.
I look
forward to debating the merits of the authorization and ultimately voting
on it.
I'll keep you posted.
Sincerely,
Congressman Mick Mulvaney
