Dr. Smith Goes to Washington It was an honor to
welcome
Dr. Bryan Smith, Senior Pastor of First Baptist Church of
Roanoke, to Washington on Wednesday to serve as guest chaplain and deliver the opening prayer for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Dr. Smith&rsquo;s prayer offered us guidance and wisdom for
the tasks before us that day. A
video
of the prayer and my remarks is available
below:
1) Dr. Smith gives the prayer. 2) The Smith family meets with Reps. Bob
Goodlatte, Robert Hurt, &amp; Morgan Griffith. Click

Protecting
American citizens from
terrorist threats both at home and abroad is a
fundamental role of the federal government. However, despite Libya&rsquo;s
long history of unrest and
ongoing terrorist threats coming from the
country, the Executive Branch has proposed reversing a longstanding
prohibition against Libyans entering
the United States to work in
aviation maintenance, flight operations, or to study or train in
nuclear-related fields. This shift in policy is
misguided and ignores
reality. Last
fall, the House
Judiciary Committee learned of the Administration&rsquo;s
plan to lift the prohibition, which was originally put in place in the
1980s after a wave
of terrorist incidents involving Libyans. The
Administration justifies lifting this ban by claiming the United States&rsquo;
relationship with Libya
has since &ldquo;normalized.&rdquo; However, our
relationship with Libya is anything but normal. A year-and-a-half ago,
U.S. Ambassador Christopher
Stevens and three other Americans were killed when terrorists stormed the U.S. Consulate in
Benghazi and set it ablaze. The terror threat continues
and numerous
news reports document recent terrorist incidents coming from Libya.
In
order to shed more light on why the Administration thinks we should
change our longstanding policy towards
Libya, the House Judiciary
Committee&rsquo;s Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security and the
House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee&rsquo;s Subcommittee on
National Security held a joint
hearing
this week.
More
answers are needed from the Administration on why they want to act now.
Instead of reversing
a 30 year precedent, I would encourage the
Administration to turn their attention to bringing those behind the
Benghazi attacks to justice. I will
continue seeking these answers from
the Administration and urge them not to change these immigration rules
related to Libya.
