Friends,
Providing for the common defense of this country is one of our most
fundamental duties. All you have to do is turn on the news to see how
real the threats to our security are. Our military must be ready to
respond to any global threat, and it's our job to make sure they have
the resources to prepare. That's why the House passed the Defense
Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2015.
I'm proud that this bill delivers funding for new Lakota helicopters to
modernize the training fleet at Fort Rucker. The Army Aviation Center
of Excellence will benefit from these newer aircraft as it carries out
its critical training mission.
The Army's aircraft realignment plan is far from complete, but the
Lakota allocation within the House-passed FY 2015 Defense
Appropriations bill is a positive step.
Overall, the bill includes $491 billion in funding for the Department
of Defense, $4.1 billion more than FY2014 levels and $200 million more
than the President's budget request. In true bi-partisan fashion, the
bill passed by a vote of 340-73.
Last Week in Washington
I had the honor of meeting with one of the few living Congressional
Medal of Honor recipients, Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter and his
family. In the midst of a firefight, Cpl. Carpenter threw himself onto
a nearby grenade, sacrificing his body for the lives of his fellow
Marines.
After being nearly killed in the blast, Kyle was revived and has spent
the last two and a half years healing and rehabilitating. Because he
was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, Kyle was rewarded with our
country's highest honor.
I also enjoyed meeting with the Alabama Road Builders Association to
talk about the future of the Highway Trust Fund. It is always a
pleasure to speak with my constituents in my Washington office and hear
about the issues that are important to them.
While on her summer break, my daughter Margaret came with me to
Washington for a few days. Every year, each of my children get to spend
a week or two with Mom in Washington. It is a joy for me to have them
with me, but also a great experience for them in their young lives.
That's particularly true for Margaret, our nine-year-old, who has
studied government in her History class. How special for her to get to
see her mom do the things she's learning about in school. It was also
really fun to have her rooting on our team
in the Women's
Congressional Softball game on Wednesday night.
The Week Ahead
This week the House of Representatives will consider a number of bills
that are important to help lower costs for consumers and ensure
national energy security.
H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America that Works
Act, would increase onshore and offshore energy production, harnessing
the resources we have here in America.
H.R. 6, the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act is a bi-partisan
bill that would expedite exports of liquefied natural gas to American
allies.
The House is also expected to consider a number of bills under
suspension, including:
H.R. 4631, the Autism CARES Act of 2014
H.R. 1281, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or a member of my
staff if we can ever be of help to you. It is an honor to serve as your
representative in Congress.
Sincerely,
Washington DC

Friends,
Providing

All

Our

and
it&#8217;s
our

That's

the

the

for
Fiscal

I&#8217;m
proud
that
this

delivers
funding
for

The

the

Last
Week
in
Washington
I
had
the
honor
of
meeting
with
one
of
the
few
living
Congressional
Medal
of
Honor
recipients,
Marine
Corporal
Kyle
Carpenter
and
his

In
the

of
a

Cpl.
Carpenter
threw
himself
onto

the

Kyle
was

I

a

While
on
her
summer

my

Margaret
came
with
me
to
Washington
for
a
few
days.
Every

each
of

spend
a
week
or
two
with
Mom
in
Washington.
It

a

also
a

for

That's

for
Margaret,
our

who
has

How
special
for
her

It
