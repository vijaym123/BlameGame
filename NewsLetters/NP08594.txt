Dear Friend:
This was a productive week in
Washington, and I wanted to take some time to share with you some of the good
things weve done.
From continuing our
work to make sure our veterans are taken care of, to working across the aisle
to protect ROTC programs like the one we have at Georgia Regents, there was a
lot going on in the House.
To start, I was proud to join
with my Republican colleague from Louisiana, Rep. Bill Cassidy, to
introduce a bipartisan resolution calling on the Attorney General to appoint a Special Prosecutor
to investigate the evidence of fraud reported in the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) audit released last week. According to that report, some
managers within the VA instructed their staffs to falsify records to make wait
times appear shorter.
While some
veterans died waiting for care, VA bureaucrats covered up the fact that they
were kept waiting, and for how long. That is a national disgrace.
Our resolution asks the Department of Justice
to fully investigate whether these instances were criminal, and to prosecute all
violators to the fullest extent of the law.
Also this week, I
worked with Rep. Dan Benishek from Michigan on a bipartisan amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill .
Our
amendment temporarily protects ROTC programs in Georgia and across the country from
unnecessary closures.
The Army named our
program at Georgia Regents University (GRU) the best in the country, yet they tried
to close it down because it didnt meet new criteria set forth by the
Army.
Thats like changing the rules in
the middle of the game, and doing so in a way that disqualifies the best team
in the nation.
Thats not only unfair,
its just not smart.
We have to work to make sure
programs like GRUs are given the opportunity to meet new criteria, especially
when theyve done such a good job of complying with all program guidelines so
far.
The amendment we passed this week
helps to make that happen.
Our work to improve the VA is
ongoing, but as you can see, were staying on top of it. I want to hear from
you on this, and any other issue, so please be on the lookout for our next
series of "Congress on the Corner" town hall meetings next week.
As always, if I can be of any
help, please dont hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
