Week in Review
The last couple of weeks have
provided me both the opportunity to
return home and visit with my
fellow Nevadans, as well as work on
important legislation back in
Washington, D.C.
Last week, I attended the
groundbreaking of Interstate 11
(I-11), an interstate that could
eventually link Mexico to Canada
through Nevada and Arizona.
Building this key piece of
infrastructure has been a focus of
mine and seeing the first steps
toward achieving this reality was
very exciting. I-11 is important
for our state and important to me.
Because of this, I am pushing key
legislation to ensure further
progress on I-11. Last year, over
40 million visitors came to the
Silver State, supporting almost
400,000 jobs. This designation of
I-11 connects the two most populous
cities in America without an
existing freeway already between
them. It has the potential to open
even more markets for tourism and
trade, which will improve our
economy and create jobs.Read
more about my legislation
here .
I also was provided the
opportunity to address the Nevada
Legislature. During my address, I
discussed topics such as national
defense, veterans, commerce,
infrastructure, tax reform, and the
economy, all important to Nevadans.
It was nice to spend some time in
familiar territory and the place I
grew up. You can read my remarks
here .
Yucca Mountain was a topic of
debate during my time back in the
state. A Congressional delegation
led by members of the House of
Representatives Energy and Commerce
Committee toured Yucca Mountain but
refused to invite a Nevada-based
state expert to participate. For
this reason, I sent a
letter
to the Department of Energy
Secretary, Ernest Moniz, requesting
a state expert be included on the
tour. If this truly was a
fact-finding trip, there would have
been no better person to accompany
this group than a local expert from
the state readily available to
answer questions and speak to the
complications of the Nevada site. I
am disappointed this golden
opportunity was squandered into
nothing more than a poorly
disguised political gimmick.
Nevadans have made their intentions
clear, we simply do not want
nuclear waste stored at Yucca
Mountain. No amount of political
pomp and circumstance will change
that. Read more

This last week was spent back on
Capitol Hill. I introduced
legislation with Congressman
Cresent Hardy (NV-04), easing
restrictions on eastern Nevada
land. The legislation provides
Lincoln County, Nye County, White
Pine County, and the City of
Mesquite the flexibility for
responsible long-term growth while
at the same time strengthening
conservation efforts in the area.

By the way, April is the Month
of the Military Child. It is
important we thank not only the
brave men and women that protect
our freedom, but also their
families making so many sacrifices,
particularly their children who go
months without seeing a parent.
Thank you to all Nevada military
children for your service.
As your United States Senator, I
will continue to represent your
voice on Capitol Hill.
