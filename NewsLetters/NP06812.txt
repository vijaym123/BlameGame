Caring for Our Veterans
The delays and the problems we have seen at the VA are totally
unacceptable, and I know I join many voices when I say that the brave
men and women who have served our country deserve the very best care we
can give them.
I wrote an op-ed this week discussing what has been
done so far and steps for the future.

Interested in a U.S. Senate Internship?
My office is now accepting applications for the fall season!
Interns
are an integral part of the office, and have the opportunity to learn
first-hand how Congress works.
Internships are for undergraduate and
graduate students, and are available in the Washington, DC, North
Charleston, Greenville, and Columbia offices.
Hours can be flexible to
accommodate students' course schedules, and duties include research,
special projects, answering phones and additional opportunities
depending on office location.
Interested students should call (202)
224-6121 or email internships@scott.senate.gov to learn more.
Ice Bucket Challenge
I was nominated to do the ice bucket challenge!
While I enjoyed
completing the challenge and the fun of nominating and being nominated,
helping to fight a devastating disease is our real focus.
The power of
people to come together and raise a tremendous amount of money and
awareness to help our fellow man is incredible, and reminds us of how
much we have to be thankful for.
