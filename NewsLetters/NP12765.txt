ICYMI: Air Force Sergeants Association
Endorses Heller Bill to Extend Unemployment
Insurance Extension, Repeal Military
Retiree Cuts
Issues Letter of Endorsement
(Washington, D.C.)
The Air
Force Sergeants Association, a non-profit
organization representing the professional
and personal interests of active duty,
retired and veteran Total Air Force and
their families, has written to Senator Dean
Heller (R-NV) announcing its support for
the
Responsible Unemployment
Compensation Extension Act of 2014 (S.
1931) . The bill, authored by Senator
Heller, would pay for the repeal of recent
cuts in the military retiree cost-of-living
adjustment in addition to fully paying for
an extension of unemployment insurance
benefits.
I am honored that the Air Force
Sergeants Association has endorsed the
Responsible Unemployment Compensation
Extension Act, which ensures that our
veterans receive the benefits they earned
in service to this country. No longer can
we sit back and watch as Congress
jeopardizes the promises made to our
military retirees and their
families, said Senator
Dean Heller .
The bill, which was introduced earlier
this month, is based on a package that
Heller and seven Republicans filed as a way
to fully pay for extending unemployment
benefits during consideration of S.
1845. Following the Senate
Majoritys rejection of that
alternative, the Senators introduced the
legislation as a stand-alone
bill.
Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Kelly
Ayotte (R-NH), Dan Coats (R-IN), Lisa
Murkowski (R-AK), Johnny Isakson (R-GA),
and John Hoeven (R-ND) cosponsored the
bill. The
American Legion
has
also endorsed this legislation.
Earlier this week, Senator Heller joined
Mark Begich (D-AK), veterans, military
families, and the Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans of America (IAVA)
at a press conference
which called for total repeal of the
military retirement cuts.
