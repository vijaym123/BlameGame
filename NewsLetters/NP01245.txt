NEWSROOM
April 24, 2015
WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week marked just over
100 days of the 114th Congress ! In that
time, the House has passed dozens of bills that address a broad
spectrum of issues, from increasing tax freedom
and
moving closer to North American energy independence, to growing small
businesses and supporting our veterans. In fact, according to
an independent
study , the first 100 days in the 114th Congress have produced
dramatically more legislative activity and efficacy than the 113th and 112th
Congress While we have a lot of work in front of us yet, I am proud
of what weve accomplished and of the 67 bills that weve passed to
date
eight of which have been signed into law. But were just getting
started, and throughout the 114th, House Republicans will continue
working hard on your behalf, passing solutions that address your
priorities and growing an opportunity economy
from
the ground up.
On
Tuesday, in addition to the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act
( S. 535 ) and the Ensuring Patient
Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act ( H.R.
471 ) which passed by voice vote, the House passed
H.R. 1195 , the Bureau of Consumer
Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act, by a vote of 235-183 ( Roll Call #167 ). H.R. 1195 creates a Small
Business Advisory Board at the Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection (CFPB) and codifies two other advisory committees that have already
been created by the CFPB: the Credit Union Advisory Council and the
Community Bank Advisory Council. Additionally, H.R. 1195 requires the
CFPB Director to appoint at least 15-20 members to each board or council
and sets forth eligibility criteria for such
appointments.
On
Wednesday, the House passed
H.R.
1560 , the Protecting Cyber Networks Act. H.R.
1560 enables private companies to share a limited category of information
with each other and civilian entities of the federal government on a
voluntary basis for cybersecurity purposes. Additionally, the bill
protects privacy by prohibiting the government from forcing private
sector entities to provide information to the government, requires
companies to remove personal information before they share cyber threat
indicators with the government and perform a second check for personal
information, limits private-to-private sharing to only cyber threat
indicators and defensive measures to combat a threat, imposes
strict restrictions on the use, retention, and searching
of
any data
voluntarily shared by the private sector with the government, provides
liability protection for private companies that monitor an information
system or share or receive cyber threat indicators or defensive
measures, and provides for strong public and congressional oversight.
Finally, this legislation does not shield a company from willful
misconduct in the course of sharing cyber threat
indicators and enforces privacy and civil liberties protections by permitting
individuals to sue the federal government for intentional privacy violations in
federal court. H.R. 1560 passed by a vote of 307-116 ( Roll Call
#170 ).
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 1731 , the National
Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015. H.R. 1731 encourages
voluntary information sharing about cyber threats, with liability
protections, between and among the private sector and Federal government. The
bill also includes numerous provisions to ensure the protection of the
privacy of American citizens and that shared cyber threat information
is solely used for cybersecurity purposes. Specifically, the
bill designates the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (NCCIC) at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the
lead civilian portal for voluntary cyber threat information sharing,
enhances the capabilities of the DHS Chief Privacy Officer and Officer
for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, ensures the NCCIC complies with
all civilian laws that protect Americans privacy and civil liberties,
requires private companies to scrub and remove personal information
unrelated to the
cybersecurity
risk before sharing with NCCIC or
other private entities, ensures that cyber threat information is used
solely to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks and enhance the nations
cyber defenses, provides liability protections to companies for the
voluntary sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures and
conduct network awareness of their own information systems, allows
companies to operate defensive measures and conduct network awareness on
information systems they own or operate, and preserves public-private
partnerships to ensure ongoing collaboration on
cybersecurity . It passed by a vote of 355-63 ( Roll Call #173 ).
