Dear Friend,
As Americans take stock of the current state of the world, its obvious that our nation faces a number of challenges.
While I have no doubt that American exceptionalism and enterprise will readily overcome these challenges, the lack of strong leadership from the president has made our nation a more uncertain place.
As I listen to feedback from my constituents, I recognize that the events in Middle East have been at the forefront in the minds of many.
The brutality of ISIS reminds us that not everyone in the world respects human life, liberty, and dignity.
If we are to ensure that Americas interests are protected, the president must present a detailed strategy to defeat ISIS and allied terror groups.
If this strategy requires military action, the president must present this strategy to the peoples representatives for an up-or-down vote.
The Middle East is not the only area of the world occupying our attention.
Unfortunately, the tragic West African Ebola epidemic has hit home.
I have been frustrated by the Obama administrations slow response in making sure Ebola is kept outside the country.
I have joined my colleagues in calling on the president to institute immediate travel restrictions, enhance airport screenings, and develop quarantine measures for individuals who have traveled to, or from, the West African countries that have been impacted by this horrific epidemic.
The most effective way to stop Ebolas spread is to ensure it doesnt hit our shores in the first place.
Its time for the president to formulate a detailed plan that clearly and pragmatically protects U.S. interests from these foreign threatsbefore they become domestic threats.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
