Dear Friends,
Here in the 14th Congressional District, we are fortunate enough to have a substantial portion of the Golden Gate National Recreation Areas&rsquo; (GGNRA) beautiful national parks, where we can walk our dogs, hike, picnic, and enjoy the breathtaking landscapes the Bay Area has to offer. Communities in the Bay Area have long been a part of the various management plans that shape the way we utilize this public space.
As you may know, the National Park Service (NPS) released a Draft Dog Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement for public review in January 2011. During this time, they accepted over 4,500 comments, some of which expressed concerns about limitations the plan would have on dog owners in the GGNRA.
Due to the high level of public concern with the Draft Dog Management plan, the Park Service announced that they would be developing a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to take into consideration additional data studies and alternatives. The GGNRA recently released that Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, but it included very few or no changes to the alternatives.
Many of you have called my district office complaining that the plan allows no off-leash dog walking anywhere in San Mateo County and that it severely limits dog walking in areas where dog walking had previously occurred for decades. Eighty percent of San Francisco&rsquo;s Ocean Beach would ban off-leash dog walking, where currently 100 percent is open to off-leash dog walking. In my opinion, this plan doesn&rsquo;t strike the right balance between environmental conservation and recreational use.
I find these figures unacceptable.
Because of your concern that comments were not fully taken into account when drafting the proposed plan, I will convene a public forum with the National Park Service and community stakeholders on Thursday, January 30th 2014 from 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. at the Stern Grove (Trocadero) Clubhouse in San Francisco.
Please sign up
here .
We will have a meaningful discussion with user groups and park management about the plan and address the issues many of you have raised.
After the forum, there will be an opportunity to formally submit comments to GGNRA officials.
