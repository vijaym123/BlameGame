ISSUES
LEGISLATION
September 21, 2014
Dear
David,
On Wednesday,
the House voted to authorize the Pentagon to train and arm moderate
groups of the Syrian opposition to aid in the battle against the Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). While the President did ask for this
limited authority, this amendment mandates that this authority must
come with a detailed strategy and rigorous Congressional oversight. The
Obama Administration is required to provide detailed reports on
planning, implementation, and efforts to ensure our weapons do not end up in
the wrong hands. In addition, this amendment does not provide new
spending for this program and makes clear the President does not have a
blank check to send out troops into Syrian or Iraq.
As our
Country continues to determine the best strategy to combat and
ultimately defeat ISIS, I want to hear from you. Please take a moment to answer
the below questions so I can hear your thoughts on this ongoing
situation.
Do you believe ISIS poses
a serious threat to American personnel and interests in the Middle
East? Yes No Need More Information Do you believe Congressional
oversight over any action taken to combat ISIS should be
required? Yes No Need More Information

should use airstrikes against terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq
and Syria?
