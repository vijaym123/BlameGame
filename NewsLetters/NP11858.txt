Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
Members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the
Constitution, which requires us to be dedicated to protecting the
liberty of the people.
I approached the major issues Congress dealt
with this week with this responsibility in mind.
First, my Oversight & Government Reform subcommittee held two important
hearings regarding the abuse of power by the IRS.
On Wednesday, our
committee heard from a number of witnesses with extensive experience in
federal investigations who echoed the call by a number of committee
members, including myself, for the appointment of a special prosecutor
to investigate the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS.
Given
that the President has already publicly prejudged the investigation
(declaring there was not a "smidgen of corruption") and that the DOJ
official in charge of the investigation is a major Obama donor who has
not interviewed the victims, a well-respected special prosecutor would
be a good first step in gaining the confidence of the American people
regarding the quality of the investigation.
On Thursday, our committee examined the new proposal by the IRS to
place draconian new restrictions on the ability of social welfare
groups to operate under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Incredibly, every member of the panel -- including an analyst from the
ACLU as well the witness requested by the subcommittee's
pro-restriction Democratic minority -- agreed that the proposal is so
overbroad that it would significantly curtail core First Amendment
freedoms.
Fortunately, this week the full House passed a bill, the Stop Targeting
of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act, that will stop this
unconstitutional IRS proposal.
Unfortunately, Senator Harry Reid is
likely to place this where he leaves most every bill the House sends to
the Senate: in his trash can.
This is because Reid supports using to
IRS as a weapon to curtail political speech and issue advocacy --
especially speech and advocacy he disfavors.
The bottom line is the
IRS has no business being the speech police and this proposed rule must
be stopped.
The House also passed a bill this week to reform the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB has vast powers over the American
economy, yet it is not accountable to traditional legislative,
judicial, and executive checks.
Despite the agency's wide-reaching impact, the courts lack the ability
under the law to review agency actions in an effective way. Our
government is built upon a system of checks and balances; allowing an
agency to live outside the bounds of traditional forms of
accountability is not consistent with our constitutional tradition.
That is why I offered an amendment (which passed the full House) to the
legislation to restore accountability to the CFPB by subjecting the
actions of the CFPB to traditional judicial review.
One of the reasons I offered my amendment to make the CFPB accountable
is my concern with the agency engaging in a massive data collection
project
regarding
the financial transactions of the American people. Does anybody think
it is a good idea to allow an unaccountable government bureau to engage
in data-mining against Americans on such a massive scale?
Rep. DeSantis testifying before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on
the necessity of his Faithful Execution of the Law Act.
Finally, on Wednesday I had the opportunity to testify before the House
Judiciary Committee in support of my Faithful Execution of the Law Act
, which I anticipate being considered on the House
floor next month. In the course of my testimony, I pointed out the
problems with the rationales frequently offered in support of the
President's conduct. Watch the video of my testimony by clicking here.
Congress possesses all legislative powers, yet the President has
frequently delayed or amended duly-passed laws without congressional
authorization. My Faithful Execution of the Law Act will bring more
transparency to government by making the administration justify
non-enforcement policies to the American people, thereby elevating the
issue of constitutional authority as a part of the public debate.
Our
constitutional system is designed to safeguard individual liberty; when
the constitutional order gets out of whack our freedoms become less
secure.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Members
of
Congress
take
an
oath
to
support
and
defend
the
Constitution,
which
requires
us
to
be
dedicated
to
protecting
the
liberty
of
the
people.
I
approached
the
major
issues
Congress
dealt
with
this
week
with
this
responsibility
in
mind.
First,
my
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform
subcommittee
held
two
important
hearings regarding
the
abuse
of
power
by
the
IRS.
On
Wednesday,
our
committee
heard
from
a
number
of
witnesses
with
extensive
experience
in
federal
investigations
who
echoed
the
call
by
a
number
of
committee
members,
including
myself,
for
the
appointment
of
a
special
prosecutor
to
investigate
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups
by
the
IRS.
Given
that
the
President
has
already
publicly
prejudged
the
investigation
(declaring
there
was
not
a
"smidgen
of
corruption")
and
that
the
DOJ
official
in
charge
of
the
investigation
is
a
major
Obama
donor
who
has
not
interviewed
the
victims,
a
well-respected
special
prosecutor
would
be
a
good
first
step
in
gaining
the
confidence
of
the
American
people
regarding
the
quality
of
the
investigation.
On
Thursday,
our
committee
examined
the
new
proposal
by
the
IRS
to
place
draconian
new
restrictions
on
the
ability
of
social
welfare
groups
to
operate
under
section
501(c)(4)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
Incredibly,
every
member
of
the
panel
--
including
an
analyst
from
the
ACLU
as
well
the
witness
requested
by
the
subcommittee's
pro-restriction
Democratic
minority
--
agreed
that
the
proposal
is
so
overbroad
that
it
would
significantly
curtail
core
First
Amendment
freedoms.
Fortunately,
this
week
the
full
House
passed
a
bill,
the
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act,
that
will
stop
this
unconstitutional
IRS
proposal.
Unfortunately,
Senator
Harry
Reid
is
likely
to
place
this
where
he
leaves
most
every
bill
the
House
sends
to
the
Senate:
in
his
trash
can.
This
is
because
Reid
supports
using
to
IRS
as
a
weapon
to
curtail
political
speech
and
issue
advocacy
--
especially
speech
and
advocacy
he
disfavors.
The
bottom
line
is
the
IRS
has
no
business
being
the
speech
police
and
this
proposed
rule
must
be
stopped.
The
House
also
passed
a
bill
this
week
to
reform
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB).
The
CFPB
has
vast
powers
over
the
American
economy,
yet
it
is
not
accountable
to
traditional
legislative,
judicial,
and
executive
checks.
Despite
the
agency&#8217;s
wide-reaching
impact,
the
courts
lack
the
ability
under
the
law
to
review
agency
actions
in
an
effective
way.
Our
government
is
built
upon
a
system
of
checks
and
balances;
allowing
an
agency
to
live
outside
the
bounds
of
traditional
forms
of
accountability
is
not
consistent
with
our
constitutional
tradition.
That
is
why
I
offered
an
amendment
(which
passed
the
full
House)
to
the
legislation
to
restore
accountability
to
the
CFPB
by
subjecting
the
actions
of
the
CFPB
to
traditional
judicial
review.
One
of
the
reasons
I
offered
my
amendment
to
make
the
CFPB
accountable
is
my
concern
with
the
agency
engaging
in
a
massive
data
collection
project
regarding
the
financial
transactions
of
the
American
people.
Does
anybody
think
it
is
a
good
idea
to
allow
an
unaccountable
government
bureau
to
engage
in
data-mining
against
Americans
on
such
a
massive
scale?
Rep.
DeSantis
testifying
before
the
U.S.
House
Judiciary
Committee
on
the
necessity
of his
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act.
Finally,
on
Wednesday
I
had
the
opportunity
to
testify
before
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
in
support
of
my
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act ,
which
I
anticipate
being
considered
on
the
House
floor
next
month.
In
the
course
of
my
testimony,
I
pointed
out
the
problems
with
the
rationales
frequently
offered
in
support
of
the
President's
conduct.
Watch
the
video
of
my
testimony

Congress
possesses
all
legislative
powers,
yet
the
President
has
frequently
delayed
or

congressional
authorization.
My
Faithful
Execution
of
the

will
bring
more
transparency
to
government
by

the
