URGENT: 24 HOUR DEADLINE Hillary Clinton is asking for your help to rescue Democrats in deadlocked races. Donate $5 before our final end of month deadline.
We have good (ok, AMAZING) news:
-- A new Fox News poll shows a SHOCKING surge for Democrats.
-- Democratic enthusiasm has jumped by 11 points in the last 2 weeks.
-- We're even leading in red states like Nebraska and Arkansas!!! This is a HUGE opportunity:
we can shock the world and beat the Republicans on their home turf. We can't pass this up!
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
The election is in just 5 days. But if we can bring in 13,OOO donations today, we can expand our get-out-the-vote operation in time for Election Day. Can you chip in $5 or more to help us get-out-the vote (and STUN the Republicans on Election Day)?
