The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of May 19 - 23, 2014
This week, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015. The NDAA is the annual mechanism that
ensures that our nation's military is sufficiently equipped to protect
us at home and abroad. As we approach Memorial Day, I was proud to vote
in favor of this important bill to support those who have selflessly
sacrificed for our nation.
In addition to addressing military readiness, supporting our men and
women in uniform, and prioritizing many other critical policies, I am
particularly pleased that the NDAA will allow the victims and families
of the 2009 Fort Hood attack to be eligible to receive the Purple Heart
Medals that they deserve. To read the NDAA, click here

The USA FREEDOM Act
Over the past few years, we have seen a vibrant debate over the
importance of striking an appropriate balance between protecting every
Americans' civil liberties and providing our intelligence agencies with
the tools necessary to ensure our national security. This week the
House passed the USA FREEDOM Act
,
legislation that reforms intelligence-gathering programs to end bulk
collection of Americans' telephone and electronic communication
records, implements limits on what information the federal government
can gather, and provides more transparency for the American people. I'm
pleased that these reforms go even further to secure the civil
liberties of the American people than President Obama's plan and was
proud to support the USA FREEDOM Act this week.
Veterans Affairs Accountability Act
In response to the recent news of mismanagement at the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), the House passed the Department of Veterans
Affairs Accountability Act of 2014
this
week.
This important bill would give the VA Secretary greater
authority to fire employees and remove them from SES service due to
poor performance.
The VA scandal highlights a systemic lack of accountability that cannot
be tolerated. The reports of preventable veteran deaths and allegations
of "secret" wait lists are unconscionable.
Our VA serves millions of
brave men and women who have sacrificed for our nation and they deserve
the highest standard of medical care and family support services
available. I will continue to support efforts to uncover the truth
about these unacceptable incidents and increase transparency to prevent
further abuse.
Welcoming TX-32 Students
This week, I had the opportunity to welcome students from Akiba Academy
of Dallas and Lakewood Elementary to Washington.
I enjoyed talking to
them about my role as a Member of Congress and the importance of
serving others.

Sincerely,
Pete Sessions

The
USA

Act
Over
the
past
few
years,
we
have
seen
a
vibrant
debate
over
the
importance
of
striking
an
appropriate

between
protecting
every

go
even

of
the
American
people
than
President

was

Veterans
Affairs
Accountability
Act
In
response
to
the
recent
news
of
mismanagement
at
the
Department
of
Veterans

(VA),
the
House
passed
the
Department
of

bill
would
give
the
VA
Secretary
greater

The

highlights
a

that
cannot
be
tolerated.
The
reports
of
preventable
veteran

and
allegations

are
unconscionable.
Our
VA

and
they
deserve
the
