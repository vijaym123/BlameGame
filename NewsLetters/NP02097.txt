In case you werent able to tune in on Thursday, I wanted to pass along the clip of my discussion with Neil Cavuto on Fox News about the Presidents
comment
that he should have closed GITMO on his first day in office. You can watch the exchange
here , or by clicking the image below.
I will continue to push back on the Administrations actions that put politics above national security, and personal priorities above the interests of the American people.
Yours in service,
Randy
