Rubio Comments On Venezuela
Sanctions Announcement
Marco commented on Mondays
Obama Administration announcement of
financial sanctions being implemented
against human rights violators in
Venezuela. The Administrations
announcement comes almost a year after
Marco first proposed the sanctions and
nearly three months after President Obama
signed into law
S.
2142, the Venezuela Defense of Human
Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 ,
which Rubio co-authored.
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the announcement:
The human rights crisis in
Venezuela is getting worse every day,
and these long overdue financial
sanctions are important steps to hold
Nicolas Maduro's regime
accountable.
The U.S. government should
expand the sanctions against more
Venezuelan human rights abusers,
including General Vladimir Padrino
Lopez, the commandant of the Venezuelan
Armed Forces and minister of defense.
Among his offenses, General Padrino
signed the recent order authorizing
lethal force against peaceful
demonstrators, an order which left a 14
year old boy dead. This general should
be on this list, but the administration
inexplicably left him off.
Even as I welcome this round
of sanctions, I question why President
Obama is simultaneously moving to lift
sanctions on Cuba, which has played a
direct role in sowing unrest in
Venezuela and has a human rights record
even worse than the Maduro regime.
Human rights violations in Venezuela
stem directly from what the Cuban army
and intelligence agency have taught the
Chavez-Maduro regime.
The authoritarian system that
Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro have
imposed in Venezuela have destroyed its
economy and any semblance of democratic
order in the country. Maduro has ruined
lives through both the misery his
system has inflicted, but also the
lives his regime has cut short in
response to demonstrations over the
past year. As long as Maduro and his
thugs remain in power, economic
conditions and human rights will
continue to worsen in Venezuela."
Marco will chair a Senate hearing on
the ongoing crisis in Venezuela next
Tuesday. More information on the hearing

Rubio Warns Of The Threat Putin
Poses To NATO And Russias
Neighbors
During a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing Tuesday, Marco
warned
the Obama Administration
of the
ongoing threat Russian President Vladimir
Putins goals pose to NATO and the
ceasefire efforts in Ukraine. An excerpt
of the remarks is available below:
I think the goal Putin has
here, its not just about
Ukraine. Its about completely
reorganizing the post-Cold War,
post-Soviet era order in Europe. And
its not just about Ukraine. And
in that context, thats why he
wants to weaken and divide and perhaps
even force NATO to fall apart. In fact,
hes questioned why we even need
a NATO anymore since there is no more
Soviet Union. As part of furthering
that goal, hes openly said that
they believe need to establish a sphere
of influence, and not just throughout
the former Soviet space, but also in
former Warsaw Pact-type countries.
This whole talk about
protecting Russian speakers, this is
just an excuse that he puts out there
as a justification before the
international community from moving
forward. But ultimately their goal,
their ultimate goal, is to carve out,
to reorder the post-Soviet order in the
region, and to carve out for Russia a
strategic space for themselves of
influence. And so, in light of that,
why should we have any hope that these
ceasefires are actually going to hold,
given we know what his ultimate goal
is?

Senators Urge Administration To
Demand Release Of Americans Held In
Iran
Marco and Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) led
a group of 19 Republican senators in
urging the Obama Administration to demand
the unconditional release of American
citizens unjustly imprisoned in Iran.
In a
letter
to Secretary of State John Kerry , the
senators highlighted the cases of three
American citizens who are languishing in
Iranian jails, in addition to former FBI
Agent Robert Levinson, a Floridian who
disappeared
eight
years ago
in Iranian territory
while on a business trip. Levinson is one
of the longest held American citizens in
history. The senators urged Secretary
Kerry to discuss these cases in his
communications with Iran and demand their
unconditional release.
It is unacceptable that as the
United States engages with Iran, human
rights violations at the hands of
Iranian officials go unchecked and
Americans languish in Iranian jail
cells,
the senators wrote . We
urge you to discuss these imprisoned
Americans and demand their
unconditional release as you engage in
discussion with Iranian
officials.
The Iranian government, which
is unjustly punishing Mr. Rezaian,
Pastor Abedini, and Mr. Hekmati and
refusing to assist the search for Mr.
Levinson, must be held accountable for
its actions,
the senators added . Once
again, Irans government is
showing they will spare no means to
stifle dissent and use innocent
Americans as political
pawns.
Rubio Comments On Military
Helicopter Crash Off Florida Coast
On Wednesday, Marco issued the
following statement regarding the deadly
military helicopter crash off the coast
of Florida:
The news out of Northwest
Florida this morning is heartbreaking
following a deadly training accident
near Eglin Air Force Base. This tragedy
brings into sharp focus the sacrifices
made by our military personnel no
matter where they serve. It reminds us
of how not a single day in uniform is a
routine one, given the sacrifices and
risks that our militarys men and
women face every day.
My wife Jeanette and I pray
for those who are missing and those we
have lost today, for their families,
and the entire military community. I
thank all our service members from
Eglin, the Coast Guard and all first
responders who have been leading the
search and recovery efforts in
difficult weather and with heavy
hearts. We send our condolences to the
people of Louisiana and North Carolina,
who had several National Guardsmen and
Marines from Camp Lejeune involved in
todays helicopter crash. Earlier
today, I expressed my condolences and
support to military officials at Eglin
Air Force Base.
Military training is
inherently dangerous but it is
essential to maintain readiness and the
most capable fighting force in the
world. When incidents like this occur
at home or in a theater of war all
Americans feel the loss.
