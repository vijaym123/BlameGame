Representative Frankel with members of the Palm Beach County National
Guard at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan after discussing how Congress
can support our local troops.
Dear Friend,
As my first year as your representative comes to a close, this is a
valuable opportunity to update you on my work and hear from you.
Please take a minute to fill out this brief survey
and see some of the progress we've made
together for South Florida and our community.
Strengthening the Economy
Congress needs
to work cooperatively to strengthen our economy and
help businesses create jobs. This will require both public and private
investment in infrastructure, education, and research in order to
compete in a global market. Working with colleagues from both parties,
as a member of the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I am
advancing improvements to Port Everglades and our most precious
wetlands, the Everglades. These projects will mean thousands of new
jobs in South Florida and a healthier environment.
Working for Veterans and to Curb Sexual Assault in the Military
As the mother of a United States Marine War veteran, I know well the
bravery and sacrifices made by those who serve in our military. We must
make sure that our returning veterans and their families receive the
assistance and benefits that they deserve, with minimum
hassle and red
tape. That's why I joined my colleagues in voting to support a bill
that would add more Veteran Administration employees to reduce the
disability claims backlog.
My amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act will require a
special military panel to assess the problem of rape and sexual assault
in our military and improve the prosecution process. Responding to a
constituent issue, we secured an agreement to require the Coast Guard
to improve their treatment of victims of sexual assault.
Preserving Social Security and Medicare
Social Security and Medicare are historically important programs,
allowing Americans to retire in dignity. I will continue to look for
ways to secure these programs for years to come, while opposing any
proposals that privatize, reduce benefits, or otherwise weaken this
sacred commitment we've made to seniors who have paid into these
programs for decades.
Foreign Affairs
In a bipartisan response to the tragic Benghazi attack, I worked with
colleagues to adopt a request by then-Secretary Hillary Clinton that
would protect Americans serving abroad in our embassies. The language
was included in the Military Construction and VA Appropriations Act.
Keeping a nuclear weapon out of the hands of Iran is a top priority,
too. I passed an amendment to the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act, which
will put more attention on the issue of women's and human rights
violations in that country.
Women's Issues
I am a proud cosponsor of the Women's Health Protection Act. If passed,
it would invalidate state laws that interfere with women's access to
safe abortions and establish a legal test for all future attempts by
state legislatures to restrict women's health care.
Share your opinion and answer this brief survey
, so that I can better serve you.
Always,
Lois Frankel
