Dear Friend,
Last week, radical Islamists carried out terrorist attacks in Paris and once again reminded us all that not everyone in the world respects human life, liberty, and dignity.
Despite our continued advancement and progress, the world is still filled with many who choose terror rather than peace, many who seek to silence rather than engage, and many who seek subjugation rather than liberty.
We must stand firm in our beliefs and always fight against this regressive way of life.
Both here and abroad, the United States and its allies must be vigilant and stand up to extremism.
Freedom must never be sacrificed.
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the French community as they mourn this terrible tragedy.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
