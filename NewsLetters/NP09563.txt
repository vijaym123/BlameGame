Congressman Lamborn Highlights Job Opportunities in the American
Energy Manufacturing Sector
5/20/14
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn held a hearing of his Energy and Mineral Resources
Subcommittee on
American Energy Jobs: Opportunities for American
Manufacturing.
American manufacturing is currently growing
as companies take advantage of growth in the American energy sector.
Studies show that by the end of the decade, unconventional oil and
natural gas production will create over 3 million jobs. In order to
maintain this growth, it is critical that policies are not enacted that
place roadblocks in the way of domestic energy
production.

hearing
"With the increasing
attractiveness of the U.S. manufacturing environment, the United States is truly
on its way to becoming a center of global manufacturing.
However, we cannot take this economic growth for granted as these benefits
are not guaranteed.
It cannot be ignored that this growth is
largely attributed to energy production on state and private
land."
"The Obama
Administration continues to advance policies that block, overregulate, or
simply prohibit increased U.S. energy production inhibits the accompanying
downstream economic benefits from energy production.
Due to the
Administrations actions of blocking off land to energy production,
delaying permit approvals, retroactively canceling leases and an
unreliable regulatory environment, energy companies are actively fleeing and
avoiding public land in favor of private and state land for energy
development.
Similarly, if these policies continue, we will see
manufacturers again flee our shores in search of more friendly and
reliable manufacturing environments
taking American jobs with
them."
