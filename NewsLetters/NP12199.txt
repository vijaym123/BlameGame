Rubio Condemns ObamaCare Raid On
Medicare Advantage
Marco condemned the Obama
administrations announcement to cut
payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) in
order to fund ObamaCare.
In a
video
message
, he pointed to the
administrations raid on MA as the
latest example that the health care law is
unsustainable, condemning the impact these
cuts will have on millions of seniors
across the country, particularly in
Florida.
Reducing payments to Medicare
Advantage providers is going to constrain
provider networks, its going to
cut benefits, its going to
increase seniors
co-payments,
Rubio said . This is going
to hurt seniors of all backgrounds and
income levels, and our state of Florida
is going to be especially hurt by
this.
Big business and unions are
getting relief, health insurance
companies are going to get their
taxpayer-funded bailout when ObamaCare
fails, but no one is standing up to
protect seniors who are going to be hurt
by this raid on Medicare
a raid
thats being used to pay for the
rest of ObamaCare,
Rubio added . Its
wrong. And its another reason why
this law needs to be repealed and
replaced.
Rubio Condemns Violence In Ukraine
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and Select Committee on
Intelligence, issued the following
statement regarding the ongoing crisis in
Ukraine:
Twenty five years after the
people in the then-captive nations of
Eastern Europe changed world history, we
again see Ukrainians taking to the
streets to demand nothing more than the
right to independently chart the future
course of their nation and a better life
for themselves and their
children.
Ukrainians have made clear that
they want the opportunity to be governed
free of corruption and Russian pressure.
I strongly condemn the Yanukovych
government resorting to violence rather
than dialogue and compromise with the
opposition.
I urge the Obama Administration
to use every diplomatic means at its
disposal, including sanctions, to bring
accountability to those involved in acts
of violence throughout Ukraine.
Its also imperative that the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
Congress move quickly to approve the
Global Human Rights Act, which would
strengthen the Presidents ability
to impose these punishments.
Ukraines future lies in
Europe, not Vladimir Putins
Russia. America stands with those who
seek freedom even at great risk to their
own security. The world is watching the
Yanukovych governments
response.
Rubio Comments On Ongoing Venezuela
Crisis
On Thursday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding the ongoing crisis in
Venezuela:
The situation in Venezuela is
growing more violent and deadly, as
innocent Venezuelans demanding their
freedoms and greater accountability from
the government are being met with
government-organized armed repression and
violence.
I am sickened by the images
Ive seen of young people being
maimed, jailed and even killed by
Nicols Maduros thugs. The
world is watching, and every
government-backed thug thinking about
carrying out orders against innocent
Venezuelans should really think about the
eventual consequences that will come with
their actions. There are cameras
everywhere, and they will be held
accountable for following the
orders of an increasingly illegitimate
government thats proving it can
only remain in power through repression
and violence.
America should not stand idly
as Venezuelas government tramples
on the Inter-American Democratic Charter
that all nations in our hemisphere,
except Cuba, have endorsed. I am troubled
about the failure of other democratically
elected governments in Latin America to
publicly stand by the mass peaceful
demonstrations of students and other
civilians and against Maduros
governments brutal repression of
the marchers.
As pro-democracy leader
Leopoldo Lopez sits in jail, we should
demand his immediate and unconditional
release, along with others who have been
unjustly imprisoned for demonstrating
against the Venezuelan government. We
should demand that the government refrain
from attacking its opponents.
The Administration should use
every diplomatic means necessary to draw
attention to the courageous efforts of
Venezuelans, the cowardice of
Maduros government, and impose
sanctions on those planning and actively
participating in repressive and violent
acts.
Im glad President Obama
finally spoke about the situation
yesterday, and he should take concrete
actions that make clear we stand for
peace in Venezuela and against a
government that represses its people. He
should make clear his support for the
Global Human Rights Act, which awaits for
Congress approval and would
provide his administration with
additional means to combat gross human
rights violations like what weve
seen in Venezuela.
I am proud to represent a state
where thousands have worked tirelessly to
raise awareness about the situation in
Venezuela and be a voice to the world for
those who Nicols Maduros
government seeks to silence. With several
peaceful demonstrations planned across
Florida this weekend, I stand in solidarity
with those efforts and with the courageous
people in Venezuela who want a better
future for themselves and their
country.

Rubio: 5
th
Anniversary Of Failed
Stimulus Plan Is Proof Big Government Is
Not The Answer
To mark the 5
th
anniversary of the failed
stimulus plan, Marco pointed to the
mounting $17.3 trillion government debt,
slow economic growth and disappointing
unemployment reports as proof that massive
government spending is not the solution to
our nations economic problems.
In a
video
message
, he highlighted the need for real
solutions that control Washingtons
spending, while also incentivizing a
vibrant free enterprise system that
empowers people with the skills needed to
takeadvantage of the
opportunitiesof the 21
st
century.
If you recall five years ago,
the notion was that if the government
spent all this money
that, by the
way, was borrowed that somehow the
economy would begin to grow and create
jobs. Well, of course, it clearly
failed,
Rubio said . Five years
later, underemployment is still too high,
the number of people that have dropped
out of the workforce is astounding,
unemployment remains stubbornly high and
our economy isnt growing fast
enough
proof that massive
government spending, particularly debt
spending, is not the solution to our
economic growth problems.
Heres what would be a
solution: A vibrant free enterprise
economy and a people with the skills and
the education needed to take up those
jobs that a vibrant free enterprise
economy would create. Thats what
our policy makers should be focused on
policies that bring our tax code,
our regulations and our massive $17
trillion debt under control,
Rubio added . Sadly,
thats not what were getting
from the White House, thats not
what were getting from this
administration.
