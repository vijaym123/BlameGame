For kids, summertime should mean food, friends and fun. But for many, summer can be a time of uncertainty about where and when they&rsquo;ll have access to healthy food.
The No Kid Hungry campaign offers a summer texting service for families to text 'Food' to 877-877 to find a free summer meal site for kids and teens near them.
The service is free to use and offers many options in Colorado's 7th district.

Constituent Success Story: River Thompson
&ldquo;Big thanks to Mr. Perlmutter&rsquo;s team of office deputies in confirming my status as an American citizen. Enjoying my time in the wonderful countries of Italy and France would&rsquo;ve been a lost cause without the immediate help of the lovely Suzette Davis. Thanks again.&rdquo;
