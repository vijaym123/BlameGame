Community Service Thanksgiving Week
Susan Metsker, Cate Stark, Congressman Yoder, Cheyne
Worley, and Heidi Cashman
My staff and I enjoyed our time
serving others at the Salvation Army's KCK Citadel &amp; Harbor Light
Village last week. At this location the Salvation Army offers food to
those in need daily. As we consider the many blessings afforded us, my
staff and I felt it was in that same spirit to help others. I'm
especially thankful for all our local service organizations who help our
friends and neighbors most in need.
For more information please visit the Salvation Army website
here.
Visiting Indian Hills Middle School
It was a
privilege to meet and visit with so many 7th graders last week at Indian
Hills Middle School in Prairie Village. We discussed the three
branches of government, how laws are made, and current issues facing our
country. These are well-informed students, and I want to thank Social
Studies Teacher Judith Schieszer for the invitation and Dr. Scott
Sherman, Principal, for his leadership.
KC Chamber Dinner
It's
always a pleasure meeting with the leaders and members of the Greater
Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. Their mission is to "p rovide leadership to help business grow and
Kansas City prosper
making KC the best place to live, work, start a
business and grow a business."
The theme for this
year's annual dinner was " For KC, By KC," which plays off
of the company created by the guest speaker. The keynote for this
event was
Daymond John, CEO and Creator of FUBU
("For Us By Us"), and star of Shark Tank on ABC.
Learn more about the Kansas city chamber and the businesses they
represent here.

Small Business Saturday
This past Saturday was "Small Business Saturday." It was a great day to
shop local! As we continue to shop this holiday season, let's all
remember to support small businesses. They're the backbone of our
economy.
Across the country small businesses employ more than 64% of
the workforce according to the U.S. Small Business
Administration.

Meeting with Mayor Mark Holland
Last week I sat down and met with Mark Holland, Mayor/CEO of
the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas. He
shared with me his vision for redeveloping Downtown KCK, and we
discussed working together to solve problems for our shared
constituency.
Fact of the
Week
I am a proud cosponsor of The ABLE Act (H.R. 647), which the
House plans to consider this week.
ABLE is short for
" Achieving a Better Life
Experience." This legislation would
establish tax-exempt ABLE accounts which help those
with disability make their every day living expenses more affordable.
These accounds could be used to pay for education, housing,
transportation, and other essential expenses.

legislation.
