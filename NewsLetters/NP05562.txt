&ldquo;The fight for control of the Senate is stable and tight, with Republicans maintaining the inside track to a majority.&rdquo; -
New York Times , 10/5/2014
Dear Friend,
Election Day is about three weeks away, and Democrats across the country know what it&rsquo;s going to take to win. We&rsquo;re going to triumph or fail based on our get-out-the-vote efforts -- it&rsquo;s as simple as that.
Turnout operations cost money, and we depend on supporters like you to help defray those costs. With so little time left before November 4th, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss our fundraising goals. We need to raise $8O,OOO before our FEC pre-general election filing deadline coming up this Wednesday. Give $5 and get us a little closer to our target.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;ve always known that this year would be tough for Democrats. We&rsquo;re defending Senate seats in states where we lost in 2012 -- and that was never going to be easy. But our commitment to the ground game is starting to bear fruit.
In tight races from Alaska to Georgia, Democrats are counting on grassroots power to propel us to victory in November. Contacting all those voters, identifying our supporters, and getting folks to the polls is a massive -- and expensive -- operation. You can help our GOTV efforts here in Massachusetts. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford and help Democrats win.
Thanks.
