Health Care Coverage Tax Information
If you received
qualifying health care coverage
for each month of the year in 2014:
You will simply check a box on your tax return to indicate that everyone (you, your spouse, or your dependents) listed on the front of the return received coverage for the entire year.
If you purchased health care coverage through
Covered California :
You should have received a Marketplace Statement Form 1095A, similar to a W-2, from Covered California in early February. You will use this information to fill out Tax Credit
Form 8962 . If you received a health care subsidy through Covered California, you must claim the credit on your tax return to verify the projected income you submitted on your application. By completing
Form 8962 , you can also see whether you are eligible for the
premium tax credit .
If you did not have health care coverage for all or part of 2014:
If you or anyone that you filed with did not have qualifying health care coverage for any month of 2014, you will need to either claim an exemption with
Form 8695 ; or,
if you do not qualify for an exemption, you will owe the
shared responsibility payment . The payment is the greater amount of either:
1 percent of your
household income , or
$95 per adult and $47.50 per child, limited to a maximum of $285
If you are a small business owner:
If you employ less than 25 full time employees and cover at least 50 percent of the cost of single health care coverage for each of your employees, you may be eligible for the
Small Business Health Care Tax Credit .
