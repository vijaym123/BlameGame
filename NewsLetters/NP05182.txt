HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Tax identity theft may be a problem for NMI residents - We want to put you on the alert that Northern Mariana Islands residents may be vulnerable to identity theft being used for tax fraud. Your congressional office has received notice of identity thieves using Social Security or other personal information from NMI residents to fraudulently claim federal income tax refunds from the U.S. Treasury. Identity theft of this kind has already affected hundreds on Guam and it looks to be spreading to our islands as well. Because most residents of the Northern Marianas do not file a federal income tax return this form of identity theft may go completely unnoticed. But those who receive a federal benefit tied to reported income, such as Social Security or Medicaid, may see an unexplained change in those benefits that could signal there is an identity theft problem. Notice from the Internal Revenue Service that you have a balance due or that collection actions are being taken against you for a year you did not file a federal income tax return could also mean a problem. If you suspect that you are a victim of identity theft, contact the IRS Local Taxpayer Advocate in Honolulu at 808-566-2950, or visit http://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/help-federal-agency to request assistance from your congressional office.
Social Security benefits increase 1.7 percent - The Social Security Administration announced this week that monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits will increase 1.7 percent in 2015. The 1.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will begin in January 2015 for Social Security beneficiaries. Increased payments to SSI beneficiaries will begin on December 31, 2014. The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the increase in the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Northern Marianas College's Current Issues class invited me in this week to answer their questions about what they think are the important issues facing us. I reported on the $4 million increase in federal funding for education that kicked in this year. We also discussed some of the less understood aspects of immigration, such as the H visa cap exemption and its relevance to development plans for our islands and the E-2C visa that temporarily grandfathered investors who were originally allowed in under CNMI immigration law. I am trying to extend both policies before they expire on December 31. Thanks, NMC students, and Go Proas!
$89,983 awarded for Maternal and Child Health Services - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded the Commonwealth's Divison of Public Health Services $89,983 for Maternal and Child Health Services. DPH will utilize the funds for the health care of pregnant women, mothers, infants, and children, especially children with special needs. Congratulations to DPH!
