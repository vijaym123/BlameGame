I hope you are staying cool from these HOT August temps. As
always we are praying for some rain. I am back home for the month of
August and boy is it great to be home! I have been busy, speaking at many
community events, touring several of our area businesses and talking
to the media. The next few weeks will remain busy as I continue meeting
with my neigbhors, discussing what is important to you. I will take
all of the information I receive back with me to Washington in
September. Thank you again for sending me to D.C. to cast a vote on your
behalf. I am truly blessed to serve such a great district! Please take a
look at some of the things I've been up to while at
home.
