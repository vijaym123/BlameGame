watch. Local Veteran Receives French Legion of Honor The soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy on
June 6, 1944, saw some of the most intense fighting of World War II.
Among them on D-Day was Robert L. Sales of Madison Heights, a member of the
Virginia National Guard Company B, 116th Infantry.
After coming under fierce attack in the first wave of the invasion, Mr. Sales made his
way to the seawall.
He was the only man from his landing craft to survive the landing and went on to continue fighting on the front lines.
Thanks to his selfless service, the citizens of France were given hope of once again living in freedom.
It was this heroic
service that earned Mr. Sales the French Legion of Honor nearly 70 years after the Allied invasion.
He was one of six World War II veterans to
receive the French Legion of Honor directly from French President Francois Hollande at a recent ceremony in Arlington. The French Legion of Honor is France&rsquo;s highest distinction and is presented
as an expression of gratitude for aiding in efforts to liberate France from enemy forces.
Those eligible for the medal must have fought in one
of the major French liberation campaigns, which includes the D-Day landing at Normandy. As a member of &ldquo;The Greatest Generation,&rdquo; Mr. Sales joined the Virginia National Guard in
1941.
The actions of Mr. Sales throughout his service in World War II also earned him America&rsquo;s deepest gratitude and well-deserved
military honors, including the Silver Star and the Purple Heart.
As we recognize the valiant service of Mr. Sales, we are reminded of all service members who have made tremendous sacrifices and our
responsibility to honor them every day.
I extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Sales on receiving the French Legion of Honor, and I am
grateful for his service, and the service of all of our veterans, in the defense of this great nation. This message was generated from an unattended mailbox. Should you
