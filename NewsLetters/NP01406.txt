Dear Friend,
Its April 15th, Tax Day, and youre probably giving a sigh of relief knowing that tax season is finally over.
And who could blame you?
This year alone, American taxpayers and businesses will spend about 7.6 billion hours complying with the 75,000 page U.S. tax code.
With those numbers, its no surprise that three-quarters of respondents to a survey I conducted said they needed to hire a professional tax-preparing service just to file.
The overly complex tax code is eating up our resources, our money, and our precious time.
A simpler, fairer and flatter tax structure is the solution to this problem.
That means more money in your pockets, less time spent filing taxes, and putting an end to the special interest loopholes that unfairly create winners and losers.
It also means freeing up American businesses to spend more time innovating, saving, and investingand less time trying to get special tax preferences.
This week, the House voted to permanently repeal the Death Tax, a law that unfairly taxes the fruits of a lifetime of hard work and takes a heavy toll on families, small businesses, and farms.
The Death Tax was originally intended to be a temporary source of defense funds during World War I and it is long overdue for repeal.
We also passed a number of bills to make the IRS more transparent and accountable, and to ensure those who have delinquent tax debt cannot get jobs or contracts with the federal government.
Ive spoken to countless New Jersey families who are desperate for tax relief.
They have seen the middle class overlooked too many times, and I remain committed to fighting for their future.
Its time to fix our broken tax code and replace the outdated rules with a pro-growth tax system, built upon the tenets of simplicity, fairness, and efficiency.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
