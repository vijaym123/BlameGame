Senators Press Holder On Status Of
U.S. Fugitives In Cuba, Threats To
Legal System From Concessions To
Regime
In light of President Obamas
decision to transfer three convicted
foreign intelligence agents in federal
custody to Cuba, Marco, along with
Senators David Vitter (R-LA) and Ted Cruz
(R-TX) pressed Attorney General Eric
Holder for answers on the status of U.S.
cop killers and other fugitives that the
Castro regime is harboring, as well as
the threats posed to the U.S. legal
system by the administrations
unilateral concessions to Cuba, including
its possible removal from the State
Sponsors of Terrorism List.
In
a
letter to Holder , the senators
highlighted Holders
responsibilities as the nations
chief law enforcement officer, and
questioned the legality of normalizing
relations with Cuba despite knowing that
the Castro regime continues to harbor
convicted criminals and domestic
terrorists in Cuba.
As Attorney General, you
serve as our countrys chief law
enforcement officer. You are expected
to ensure the credibility of the
American legal system and as well as
help to protect and defend the American
people,
the senators wrote . We
were thus troubled to learn that you
played a role in the Presidents
decision to transfer three convicted
foreign intelligence agents from
federal custody to Cuba.
As you know, in addition to
their infiltration of the
Cuban-American community for espionage,
one of the individuals in question was
convicted of conspiracy to commit
murder related to the downing of
civilian planes operated by the U.S.
humanitarian group Brothers to the
Rescue in international
airspace,
added the senators .
Another issue that falls under
your Departments jurisdiction is
the effort to seek the return of
fugitives from justice who have fled to
other countries.
As the facts of these cases
show, the actions of the individuals in
question have deprived some Americans
of their lives and affected the lives
and well-being of countless
others,
the senators
wrote .Attempting to
gloss over the facts of their crimes
against the United States is an insult
to the values and ethics of our
judicial system and those same ideals
that you, as our nations chief
law enforcement officer, are supposed
to uphold.
In
a
letter to Secretary of State John
Kerry , Marco called on the Obama
Administration to not normalize relations
with Cuba without progress being made on
key issues. And in light of the
administrations failure to keep
its promise to consult Congress prior to
its efforts to normalize U.S. relations
with Cuba, Marco called on the
administration to fully consult Congress
regarding ongoing nuclear negotiations
with Iran. Watch his exchange with Deputy
Secretary of State Antony Blinken

Rubio Comments On State Of The Union
Address
Marco issued the following statement
regarding Tuesday nights State of
the Union Address:
President Obama tonight
bragged about how the economy is doing
better. But too many people are not
experiencing it because theyre
stuck between low wages and a high cost
of living. To lift more Americans into
the middle class, we need to move
forward with a 21
st
century agenda that
ensures an equality of opportunity, not
one that doubles down on outdated
proposals to tax and spend
more.Theres no bigger
priority for me than helping all of our
people achieve the American Dream, and
the only way thats going to
happen is by working together to bring
our innovation economy, higher
education system, retirement policies,
safety net programs and national
defense into the 21
st century.
The American people are long
overdue to have a president stand
before Congress and the nation and
acknowledge reality: that the 20
th century is gone.
That taxing successful people,
overregulating job creators and pouring
more money into outdated government
programs doesnt actually help
struggling people achieve the 21st
century American Dream. That saying
wars are over isnt enough to
keep us safe.That whether it be
on the battlefield, in cyberspace or at
the negotiating table, we need a strong
and engaged America that stands up for
our values and is ready to defeat those
who threaten our way of life. And that
implementing new immigration policies
that havent even been passed
into law only makes lasting reform more
elusive.
Instead of trying to
manipulate our tax code to punish
success, President Obama should work
with Congress to fundamentally reform
our tax code in ways that will grow our
entire economy and provide relief to
all families. Instead of rewarding
repressive, anti-American regimes like
Cuba and Iran with undeserved
concessions that legitimize and enrich
them, he should condition normalized
relations on real, irreversible results
that protect U.S. national security
interests, safeguard human rights and
ensure greater political
freedoms.
Rubio Meets With Florida
Participants Of 42
nd
Annual March For Life
On Thursday, Marco met with pro-life
supporters from South Florida who
participated in the annual March for Life
in Washington, D.C. His blog post about
the visit is below:
Every year, thousands of Americans
come together to defend the defenseless
and stand for human life at the annual
March for Life in Washington, D.C. And
every year, I am proud to support these
efforts and the simple truth that all
human life is sacred. Today, I had the
honor of meeting with a group of about
55 South Florida students and pro-life
supporters, as well as seminarians from
St. Vincent De Paul, of Boynton Beach.
I commend everyone who marched today at
the 42nd annual March for Life, and all
those who continue to protect the lives
of the innocent and unborn.
