Affordable Care Act Update
Dear Friend,
Lately there have been a lot of headlines about the computer glitches
at www.healthcare.gov
, the federal government's web site where people can access the
Health Insurance Marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act (aka
"Obamacare"). The state Marketplaces opened for business on October
1st, and consumers were supposed to be able to access them through the
www.healthcare.gov
web site, but most visitors to the web site (myself included)
got a lot of error messages and couldn't set up an account or compare
health insurance plans in their area.
These are serious problems - the site is far too slow and it crashes a
lot - but technicians are working on it 24 hours a day, and it's
getting better every day. Odds are that the web site will be running
properly in plenty of time to allow uninsured Americans to purchase
health insurance through it before the December 15th deadline for
coverage that would start January 1st.
Many Republicans in Congress have talked up these problems to argue
that the Affordable Care Act is a disaster and should be repealed or
delayed. I believe that this is just their latest effort to undermine
the landmark health care reform law enacted in 2010.
It's important to remember that the Affordable Care Act is not just a
web site; it's much more than that - it's a comprehensive reform of our
nation's health insurance system, and many of its provisions have
already been rolled out. For example:
. It prohibits abusive insurance industry practices like
discrimination on the basis of gender and pre-existing conditions,
annual and lifetime caps on benefit pay-outs, and cancelling your plan
because you became seriously ill.
. It requires insurance plans to provide preventative care like
screenings and vaccinations for free.
. It offers uninsured Americans tax credits to make their
health insurance premiums more affordable.
. It phases out the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit
"donut hole," which is saving many seniors across the country hundreds
if not thousands of dollars a year. And on top of that,
. It allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance
plan until they turn 26 years old.
The hype we're hearing from Congressional Republicans is similar to
what people said about the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit
back when it was set up in 2006. It was more unpopular than the
Affordable Care Act is today
(it had a 21 percent favorable
rating, compared with 35 percent for the ACA today) and folks said that
the "D" in
Medicare Part D stood for "Disaster." These headlines give
a good indication of the magnitude of the problems that plagued the
Medicare Part D rollout back then.
But the problems with the program were fixed within several months, and
by 2012, according to a poll cited in USA Today, most seniors thought
Medicare Part D was a great program that saved them a lot of money on
their prescription drugs. Other well-liked federal programs also had
teething pains - Social Security, Medicare, and SSI
, for example. Should we have repealed them because they had rocky
starts? Of course not. I think the same thing is going to be true about
the Affordable Care Act. Only time will tell.
The big difference between then and now is that back in 2006, both
parties worked together to fix the problems with the new Medicare Part
D program - whereas today, I think that the Majority in the House today
is doing whatever if can to discredit and dismantle the Affordable Care
Act rather than work constructively to fix the rollout problems that
are nearly inevitable with any major program.
The Administration has said that the www.healthcare.gov web site will
be fixed by the end of November
. I will continue to monitor the
Administration's efforts to roll out the www.healthcare.gov
web site and do whatever I can to help make any needed changes
in the program.
It continues to be an honor and a pleasure to serve you. Please feel
free to e-mail me to share your thoughts or to request assistance in
dealing with the federal government by going to my web site,

Until next time, I am

Affordable
Care
Act
Update
Dear
Friend,
Lately
there
have
been
a
lot
of
headlines
about
the
computer
glitches
at
www.healthcare.gov ,
the
federal
government&#8217;s
web
site
where
people
can
access
the
Health
Insurance
Marketplaces
set
up
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(aka
&#8220;Obamacare&#8221;).
The
state
Marketplaces
opened
for
business
on
October
1st,
and
consumers
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
access
them
through
the
www.healthcare.gov
web
site,
but
most
visitors
to
the
web
site
(myself
included)
got
a
lot
of
error
messages
and
couldn&#8217;t
set
up
an
account
or
compare
health
insurance
plans
in
their
area.
These
are
serious
problems
&#8211;
the
site
is
far
too
slow
and
it
crashes
a
lot
&#8211;
but
technicians
are
working
on
it
24
hours
a
day,
and
it&#8217;s
getting
better
every
day.
Odds
are
that
the
web
site
will
be
running
properly
in
plenty
of
time
to
allow
uninsured
Americans
to
purchase
health
insurance
through
it
before
the
December
15th
deadline
for
coverage
that
would
start
January
1st.
Many
Republicans
in
Congress
have
talked
up
these
problems
to
argue
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
a
disaster
and
should
be
repealed
or
delayed.
I
believe
that
this
is
just
their
latest
effort
to
undermine
the
landmark
health
care
reform
law
enacted
in
2010.
It&#8217;s
important
to
remember
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
not
just
a
web
site;
it&#8217;s
much
more
than
that
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
a
comprehensive
reform
of
our
nation&#8217;s
health
insurance
system,
and
many
of
its
provisions
have
already
been
rolled
out.
For
example:
&#8226; It
prohibits
abusive
insurance
industry
practices
like
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
pre-existing
conditions,
annual
and
lifetime
caps
on
benefit
pay-outs,
and
cancelling
your
plan
because
you
became
seriously
ill.
&#8226; It
requires
insurance
plans
to
provide
preventative
care
like
screenings
and
vaccinations
for
free.
&#8226; It
offers
uninsured
Americans
tax
credits
to
make
their
health
insurance
premiums
more
affordable.
&#8226; It
phases
out
the
Medicare
Part
D
prescription
drug
benefit
&#8220;donut
hole,&#8221;
which
is
saving
many
seniors
across
the
country
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
dollars
a
year.
And
on
top
of
that,
&#8226; It
allows
young
adults
to
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan
until
they
turn
26
years
old.
The
hype
we&#8217;re
hearing
from
Congressional
Republicans
is
similar
to
what
people
said
about
the
Medicare
Part
D
prescription
drug
benefit
back
when
it
was
set
up
in
2006.
It
was
more
unpopular
than
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
today
(it
had
a
21
percent
favorable
rating,
compared
with
35
percent
for
the
ACA
today)
and
folks
said
that
the
&#8220;D&#8221;
in
Medicare
Part
D
stood
for
&#8220;Disaster.&#8221;
These
headlines
give
a
good
indication
of
the
magnitude
of
the
problems
that
plagued
the
Medicare
Part
D
rollout
back
then.
But
the
problems
with
the
program
were
fixed
within
several
months,
and by
2012, according
to
a
poll
cited
in
USA
Today,
most
seniors
thought
Medicare
Part
D
was
a
great
program
that
saved
them
a
lot
of
money
on
their
prescription
drugs.
Other
well-liked
federal
programs
also
had
teething
pains
&#8211;
Social
Security,
Medicare,
and
SSI ,
for
example.
Should
we
have
repealed
them
because
they
had
rocky
starts?
Of
course
not.
I
think
the
same
thing
is
going
to
be
true
about
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
Only
time
will
tell.
The
big
difference
between
then
and
now
is
that
back
in
2006, both
parties worked
together
to
fix
the
problems
with
the
new
Medicare
Part
D
program
&#8211;
whereas
today,
I
think
that
the
Majority
in
the
House
today
is
doing
whatever if
can
to
discredit
and
dismantle
the
Affordable
Care
Act
rather
than
work
constructively
to
fix
the
rollout
problems
that
are
nearly
inevitable
with
any
major
program.
The
Administration
has
said
that
the
www.healthcare.gov
web
site
will
be
fixed
by
the
end
of
November .
I
will
continue
to
monitor
the
Administration&#8217;s
efforts
to
roll
out
the
www.healthcare.gov
web
site
and
do
whatever
I
can
to
help
make
any
needed
changes
in
the
program.
It
continues
to
be
an
honor
and
a
pleasure
to
serve
you.
