winning piece will hang in the U.S. Capitol for one year, and the
runners up along with the winner of the People's Choice Award will hang

Protecting Ohio Coal Jobs, Reducing Government Waste
At a time when Americans are in need of a strong economic recovery,
Ohio simply cannot afford to suffer more job losses as a result of this
Administration's attack on coal and the affordable domestic energy that
it creates. This past week, I voted in favor of H.R. 2824, the
Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America
Act. Not only will this bill curb this Administration's wasteful
spending, it will also remove the threat of new job-crushing federal
regulations. Thanks to new technologies, Ohio coal power is cleaner and
more efficient than it has ever been. It is important to protect the
environment while preserving jobs at the same time. Read more HERE

Four Years Later
This past Sunday marked the fourth anniversary of the Affordable Care
Act, and it was nothing to celebrate. Instead, we were reminded of the
many broken promises, countless delays, and unilateral changes the
President has made to his signature health care law since he signed it
into law on March 23, 2010. Read more from this week's column HERE
