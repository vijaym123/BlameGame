I
supported legislation to audit the Federal Reserve because the public is
owed a greater understanding of the Federal Reserves
activities.
A number of questions have arisen about the internal operations and
lack of transparency of the Federal Reserve System.
An audit
would ensure that the Federal Reserve is held accountable to taxpayers
for its actions.
The
Federal Reserve Transparency
Act
(H.R. 24) would give Congress and the public greater
understanding of the Federal Reserves activities and increase
accountability.
On September 17, 2014, my House colleagues and I voted to pass
this bipartisan legislation by a vote of 333-92.
The
Federal Reserve Transparency Act
would require the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) to audit the Federal Reserve, opening Federal
Reserve operations to enhanced scrutiny and congressional oversight in
an effort to provide taxpayers with a greater understanding of the
Federal Reserves activities.
The information revealed in an audit
could then provide the basis for additional reforms to the Federal
Reserve System.
The Constitution of the United States charges
Congress with the duty to coin money and regulate its value.
Since the
Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , Congress has chosen to do
this through the Federal Reserve System.
Since that time a
number of questions have arisen about the internal operations of the
Federal Reserve, and many people have expressed concerns that Congress has
delegated too much of its responsibility to the Federal Reserve.
I believe it is important for the United States to maintain a strong
and stable currency on which our economy can rely.
It is
imperative that the Federal Reserve be held accountable for its
actions.
An audit of the Federal Reserve will provide taxpayers with the
transparency they have been demanding.
