News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Typically, when I sign off this letter each week, I end it with an
appeal to the reader that if you have an idea or a concern, to please
let me know. I wanted to give you all a little proof this week that it
really does help.
A few months back, a constituent of mine named David Chilbert sent me
an email explaining a few thoughts he had on our national parks.
Specifically, he said that senior citizens currently have access to a
lifetime pass for our national parks, available for a fee. Active duty
members of the military also enjoy free access to our parks. So Mr.
Chilbert asked, why not create a special pass for veterans, again
available for a nominal fee, that would enable them to have lifetime
free access? I frankly didn't have a good answer for why not. Couldn't
think of any. So I set about drafting a piece of legislation to create
exactly such a pass. As it would happen, yesterday morning, I had the
privilege of testifying before the committee that oversees our national
parks. They invited me because they are considering including my bill
as a provision in one of their bills.
Now, it's always hard to predict the chances of success for any given
piece of legislation. The vast, vast majority of the thousands of bills
introduced each Congress never even get consideration in a committee.
Much less passed by the House committees, then the full House, and the
Senate committees, and the full Senate and signed into law by the
President. But I'm hopeful for this one. It's entirely possible that
one day soon, the veterans of this great nation may be able to enjoy
for a lifetime the very national parks that they fought to defend.
Had Mr. Chilbert not sent me that email, that probably wouldn't be the
case. So to Mr. Chilbert, on behalf of the veterans who (potentially)
will be able to utilize this pass, thanks for reaching out.
I can't speak for other member of Congress, but I can promise you that
when you send me an email, I see it. It may take me a little while to
respond and I may not always agree with your conclusions, but I do take
your input seriously...
As for the floor activity this week - we are in the midst of moving a
few pieces of legislation that will improve the way we do budgeting up
here in Washington. It's not the flashiest legislation in the world,
but suffice it to say, there are some of us who don't think that
increasing spending by an amount less than anticipated should be
treated as a cut by our official government accounting department. In
other words, you can't increase spending and say you cut spending at
the same time.
I don't want to take up too much of your time right
now, so I'll save the specifics for when we wrap everything up next
week. Until then, if there's something that you think I should be aware
of, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
(Your) Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
Typically,
when
I
sign
off
this
letter
each
week,
I
end
it
with
an
appeal
to
the
reader
that
if
you
have
an
idea
or
a
concern,
to
please
let
me
know.
I
wanted
to
give
you
all
a
little
proof
this
week
that
it
really
does
help.
A
few
months
back,
a
constituent
of
mine
named
David
Chilbert
sent
me
an
email
explaining
a
few
thoughts
he
had
on
our
national
parks.
Specifically,
he
said
that
senior
citizens
currently
have
access
to
a
lifetime
pass
for
our
national
parks,
available
for
a
fee.
Active
duty
members
of
the
military
also
enjoy
free
access
to
our
parks.
So
Mr.
Chilbert
asked,
why
not
create
a
special
pass
for
veterans,
again
available
for
a
nominal
fee,
that
would
enable
them
to
have
lifetime
free
access?
I
frankly
didn&#8217;t
have
a
good
answer
for
why
not.
Couldn&#8217;t
think
of
any.
So
I
set
about
drafting
a
piece
of
legislation
to
create
exactly
such
a
pass.
As
it
would
happen,
yesterday
morning,
I
had
the
privilege
of
testifying
before
the
committee
that
oversees
our
national
parks.
They
invited
me
because
they
are
considering
including
my
bill
as
a
provision
in
one
of
their
bills.
Now,
it&#8217;s
always
hard
to
predict
the
chances
of
success
for
any
given
piece
of
legislation.
The
vast,
vast
majority
of
the
thousands
of
bills
introduced
each
Congress
never
even
get
consideration
in
a
committee.
Much
less
passed
by
the
House
committees,
then
the
full
House,
and
the
Senate
committees,
and
the
full
Senate
and
signed
into
law
by
the
President.
But
I&#8217;m
hopeful
for
this
one.
It&#8217;s
entirely
possible
that
one
day
soon,
the
veterans
of
this
great
nation
may
be
able
to
enjoy
for
a
lifetime
the
very
national
parks
that
they
fought
to
defend.
Had
Mr.
Chilbert
not
sent
me
that
email,
that
probably
wouldn&#8217;t
be
the
case.
So
to
Mr.
Chilbert,
on
behalf
of
the
veterans
who
(potentially)
will
be
able
to
utilize
this
pass,
thanks
for
reaching
out.
I
can&#8217;t
speak
for
other
member
of
Congress,
but
I
can
promise
you
that
when
you
send
me
an
email,
I
see
it.
It
may
take
me
a
little
while
to
respond
and
I
may
not
always
agree
with
your
conclusions,
but
I
do
take
your
input
seriously...
As
for
the
floor
activity
this
week
-
we
are
in
the
midst
of
moving
a
few
pieces
of
legislation
that
will
improve
the
way
we
do
budgeting
up
here
in
Washington.
It&#8217;s
not
the
flashiest
legislation
in
the
world,
but
suffice
it
to
say,
there
are
some
of
us
who
don&#8217;t
think
that
increasing
spending
by
an
amount
less
than
anticipated
should
be
treated
as
a
cut
by
our
official
government
accounting
department.
In
other
words,
you
can't
increase
spending
and
say
you
cut
spending
at
the
same
time.
I
don&#8217;t
want
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time
right
now,
so
I&#8217;ll
save
the
specifics
for
when
we
wrap
everything
up
next
week.
Until
then,
if
there&#8217;s
something
that
you
think
I
should
be
aware
of,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out.
Sincerely,
Rich

Congress
