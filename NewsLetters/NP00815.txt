Recognized as National Leader in Clean Water Advocacy
On April 14th, I was awarded the National Environmental Achievement for Federal Public Service Award (NEAA) by the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA). The annual award is given to current or former elected or appointed public officials at the local, state and federal level of government who have demonstrated exemplary commitment and service to their community, the environment and to NACWA.
Having clean, affordable water is fundamental for our local communities to be successful. I'm incredibly honored and humbled to receive this award today, and will continue working with Republicans and Democrats to ensure our local communities' water supply is abundant and protected.

Supporting Equal Pay for Equal Work
Even in our great state of Minnesota, women earn only 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. That is why on April 14th, Equal Pay Day, I called for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. Equal Pay Day acknowledges that it took over three-plus months into 2015 for women's wages to finally catch up to wages earned by men in 2014. More must be done to close the wage gap that still exists between women and men and I am dedicated to correcting this injustice.

Audit the Pentagon
Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) and I led a broad bipartisan coalition of over 70 Members of Congress in sending a letter to Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter regarding his commitment to making the Department of Defense (DoD) fully auditable and his strategy to achieve this goal.
Conducting an audit of the Pentagon would help our nation tremendously, and work to find savings by rooting out waste and inefficiencies at the Department of Defense, rather than by reducing troop pay. I've been pushing the Department of Defense to continue moving forward with audit readiness for some time now, but words from Congress alone will not ensure its completion: the Secretary's leadership in this effort is paramount. I look forward to working with him as we move forward in this most important endeavor.

Promoting American Manufacturing and Jobs
On April 30th, I signed a discharge petition to bring the reauthorization of the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank up for a vote in the House. The Ex-Im Bank promotes American manufacturing, protects hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, and provides American businesses and workers with the certainty they need to compete in the global marketplace. Without reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank will shut down on June 30, hurting businesses right here in southern Minnesota.
We must do all we can to ensure that American businesses and manufacturers have the opportunity to compete in a growing world marketplace, and the Export-Import Bank is a large part of that effort. That is why I signed onto this discharge petition. The Export-Import Bank has overwhelming support and needs to be brought to the floor immediately. Doing so will renew our commitment to American manufacturing, revitalize Main Street, and work to create good paying, middle-class jobs right here at home.

Avian Flu Virus
This March, H5 avian influenza strains began infecting poultry flocks in Minnesota and throughout the Midwest. This is a trying time for many of our producers. I am constantly monitoring
the current situation and actively working to provide support to our farmers.
It is important to stress that the USDA has repeatedly emphasized that
poultry is safe for consumption .
