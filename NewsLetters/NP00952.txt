Fellow Illinoisans,
Today, too many hardworking American
families are barely making ends meet. And
largely its because these workers and
their families rely on the dismal pay of
minimum wage jobs. In Illinois alone, 400,000
workers earn the minimum wage. Of those,
100,000 live below the poverty line.
If you work full time in America, you
should be able to provide for your family,
but thats impossible with
todays federal minimum wage set at
$7.25 per hour. Working 40 hours per week at
that rate translates to about $15,000 per
year
$3,000 below the poverty level
for a family of three.
Roberts story
Last year, I met Robert who worked six
days a week at $8.25 per hour at a local car
dealership doing a little bit of everything
basically your traditional handy man.
But it was not enough to make ends meet.
Robert
working full time
had
to tell his family they had to leave their
home and move into a shelter.
During the recession, Robert participated
in the Put Illinois to Work
program that helped Robert earn $10.00
per hour. It seems like a modest bump in pay,
but it made a difference. Robert was able to
move his family out of the shelter. They once
again had their own home. They were paying
their bills and stopped receiving government
support programs.
Raise the Wage Act
All across the country, we have seen
overwhelming momentum to raise wages for our
workers. A national poll released this year
showed 75% of Americans supporting a minimum
wage above $12 per hour. Twenty-nine states
and the District of Columbia, as well as 21
cities and counties, have already increased
their minimum wage above the federal rate,
including Illinois and Chicago.
Last week, I joined my colleagues
including Senator Patty Murray of Washington,
the lead Democrat on the Senates
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee
in introducing the Raise
the Wage Act which would increase the
national minimum wage to $12 per hour over
the next five years and then index the wage
to inflation. The bill would also gradually
phase out the $2.13 tipped minimum wage to
match the regular minimum wage.

This would mean that a full-time worker
making minimum wage will earn almost $25,000
a year. In Illinois alone, 1.6 million
workers
about 28% of the
states workforce
would see an
increase in wages by an average of $3,200 a
year.
We know that when low wage workers earn
money, they spend it. They buy food, clothes
for the kids, and pay utility bills. The
Raise the Wage Act would lift millions out of
poverty and give families more money to put
back into our economy.
