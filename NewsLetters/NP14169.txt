Legislation
Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
Our domestic affairs have been roiled by the implementation of the 2010
health care law.
Of course, this is the first major piece of
legislation in more than 80 years to be enacted on a purely partisan
basis.
Laws such as the Social Security Act, Eisenhower's interstate
highway bill, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and President Ronald Reagan's
economic recovery program all passed with overwhelming bipartisan
support
.
(For example, the Social Security Act received support from 96% of the
Democrats and 81% of the Republicans in the House in 1935; the Civil
Rights Act garnered the support of 81% of the Republicans and 60% of
the Democrats in the House in 1964.)
What makes the partisan origins of ObamaCare even more problematic is
that the law was passed based on false pretenses.
First, Americans
were promised by the President and members of Congress that "if you
like your plan, you can keep it.
Period."
The result has been mass
cancellations and millions of Americans being forced by law to purchase
different, government-approved policies, making this a deception of
momentous proportions.
Indeed, the Obama administration itself
estimated
- in a report buried in the Federal Register in June 2010 -
that up to 93 million Americans would not be able to keep their plans
under ObamaCare.
Second, Americans were promised by the President and members of
Congress that they could keep their doctor if they liked their doctor.
This, too, is false.
This op-ed
by a
stage four cancer patient provides an example.
Third, the President habitually promised
that ObamaCare would lower health
insurance premiums to the tune of $2500 in savings per year for the
average family.
This promise is belied by the significant premium
increases
being shouldered by Americans across the nation.
Finally, the President claimed that his plan represented "universal
coverage."
Hardly.
According to the Congressional Budget Office (a
nonpartisan outfit that tends to underestimate the negative effects of
big, comprehensive bills) by the year 2023, there will still be 31
million Americans
without any health insurance
coverage.
The bottom line is that this is a major mess.
This week, testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform confirmed that the administration recklessly launched
Healthcare.gov knowing that the site had not undergone sufficient
testing or been certified as being secure. In case you missed it, you
can watch my questioning at the hearing by clicking here.
Many Americans are finding their health care upended due to ObamaCare.
Chris from New Smyrna Beach shared with my office that his health care
plan - which meets his needs and he would like to keep - will be
cancelled. The cheapest plan offered is more than double in price,
which his family cannot afford. This is a story that has unfortunately
been echoed across the district. ObamaCare is precipitating the loss of
insurance for millions of Americans - essentially forcing them to use a
substandard system against their will - in a clear violation of the
repeated promise that Americans could keep their plans.
That is why last month I introduced the If You Like Your Health Care
Plan You Can Keep It Act
to
mitigate some of the damage caused by ObamaCare by indefinitely
grandfathering in current health care plans. It is disappointing - but
not surprising - that instead of working with Congress to pass the If
You Like Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act and provide relief
to American families, the President purported to suspend the law
unilaterally, which is inconsistent with the Constitution's separation
of powers and with the President's duty to "take care that the laws be
faithfully executed."
On Friday, the House voted on similar legislation that will override
the ObamaCare provisions that are forcing policy cancellations. This is
an issue that I have been working diligently on and I commend the House
for passage of the Keep Your Plan Act. Nearly 40 Democrats joined House
Republicans in support of the Keep Your Plan Act, but unfortunately the
President has once again put his pride before the well-being of the
American people and threatened to veto this critical legislation.
The unraveling of ObamaCare is just beginning.
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me
on Facebook

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Our
domestic
affairs
have
been
roiled
by
the
implementation
of
the
2010
health
care
law.
Of
course,
this
is
the
first
major
piece
of
legislation
in
more
than
80
years
to
be
enacted
on
a
purely
partisan
basis.
Laws
such
as
the
Social
Security
Act,
Eisenhower&#8217;s
interstate
highway
bill,
the
1964
Civil
Rights
Act
and
President
Ronald
Reagan&#8217;s
economic
recovery
program
all
passed
with
overwhelming
bipartisan
support .
(For
example,
the
Social
Security
Act
received
support
from
96%
of
the
Democrats
and
81%
of
the
Republicans
in
the
House
in
1935;
the
Civil
Rights
Act
garnered
the
support
of
81%
of
the
Republicans
and
60%
of
the
Democrats
in
the
House
in
1964.)
What
makes
the
partisan
origins
of
ObamaCare
even
more
problematic
is
that
the
law
was
passed
based
on
false
pretenses.
First,
Americans
were
promised
by
the
President
and
members
of
Congress
that
&#8220;if
you
like
your
plan,
you
can
keep
it.
Period.&#8221;
The
result
has
been
mass
cancellations
and
millions
of
Americans
being
forced
by
law
to
purchase
different,
government-approved
policies,
making
this
a
deception
of
momentous
proportions.
Indeed,
the
Obama
administration
itself
estimated
&#8211;
in
a
report
buried
in
the
Federal
Register
in
June
2010
&#8211;
that
up
to
93
million
Americans
would
not
be
able
to
keep
their
plans
under
ObamaCare.
Second,
Americans
were
promised
by
the
President
and
members
of
Congress
that
they
could
keep
their
doctor
if
they
liked
their
doctor.
This,
too,
is
false.
This
op-ed
by
a
stage
four
cancer
patient
provides
an
example.
Third,
the
President
habitually
promised
that
ObamaCare
would
lower
health
insurance
premiums
to
the
tune
of
$2500
in
savings
per
year
for
the
average
family.
This
promise
is
belied
by
the
significant
premium
increases
being
shouldered
by
Americans
across
the
nation.
Finally,
the
President
claimed
that
his
plan
represented
&#8220;universal
coverage.&#8221;
Hardly.
According
to
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
(a
nonpartisan
outfit
that
tends
to
underestimate
the
negative
effects
of
big,
comprehensive
bills)
by
the
year
2023,
there
will
still
be
31
million
Americans
without
any
health
insurance
coverage.
The
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
major
mess.
This
week,
testimony
before
the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
confirmed
that
the
administration
recklessly
launched
Healthcare.gov
knowing
that
the
site
had
not
undergone
sufficient
testing
or
been
certified
as
being
secure.
In
case
you
missed
it,
you
can
watch
my
questioning
at
the
hearing
by
clicking here.
Many
Americans are
finding
their
health
care
upended
due
to
ObamaCare.
Chris
from
New
Smyrna
Beach
shared
with
my
office
that
his
health
care
plan
-
which
meets
his
needs
and
he
would
like
to
keep
-
will
be
cancelled.
The
cheapest
plan
offered
is
more
than
double
in
price,
which
his
family
cannot
afford.
This
is
a
story
that
has
unfortunately
been
echoed
across
the
district.
ObamaCare
is
precipitating
the
loss
of
insurance
for
millions
of
Americans
&#8211;
essentially
forcing
them
to
use
a
substandard
system
against
their
will
&#8211;
in
a
clear
violation
of
the
repeated
promise
that
Americans
could
keep
their
plans.
That
is
why
last
month
I
introduced
the
If
You
Like
Your
Health
Care
Plan
You
Can
Keep
It
Act
to
mitigate
some
of
the
damage
caused
by
ObamaCare
by
indefinitely
grandfathering
in
current
health
care
plans.
It
is
disappointing
&#8211;
but
not
surprising
&#8211;
that
instead
of
working
with
Congress
to
pass
the
If
You
Like
Your
Health
Care
Plan
You
Can
Keep
It
Act
and
provide
relief
to
American
families,
the
President
purported
to
suspend
the
law
unilaterally,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
Constitution&#8217;s
separation
of
powers
and
with
the
President&#8217;s
duty
to
&#8220;take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.&#8221;
On
Friday,
the
House
voted
on
similar
legislation
that
will
override
the
ObamaCare
provisions
that
are
forcing
policy
cancellations.
This
is
an
issue
that
I
have
been
working
diligently
on
and
I
commend
the
House
for
passage
of
the
Keep
Your
Plan
Act .
Nearly
40
Democrats
joined
House
Republicans
in
support
of
the
Keep
Your
Plan
Act ,
but
unfortunately
the
President
has
once
again
put
his
pride
before
the
well-being
of
the
American
people
and
threatened
to
veto
this
critical
legislation.
The
unraveling
of
ObamaCare
is
just
beginning.
