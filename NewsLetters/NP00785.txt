SIGN YOUR NAME &gt;&gt;
David,
A recent independent study certified that the Pioneer ACO program initiated by the Affordable Care Act has saved Medicare $400 million.
That&rsquo;s a
remarkable
result. In just the two-year pilot stage, this program has shown to dramatically cut health care costs while improving the quality of care for our seniors.

In addition to providing over 16 million people with quality affordable health care, the ACA is also saving hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
