Recommitting to Our Veterans
Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have
deployed 2.6 million servicemembers from our military to fight in both
countries - and many of them have been sent back for multiple tours. As
most of these troops have returned home, we have created a new, younger
generation of veterans who we absolutely must support - just as we do
veterans of past generations and wars.
In North Dakota, all of us have husbands, wives, parents, or neighbors
who have answered the call to serve because we understand the
importance of defending our country. There's a tradition of service
rooted in North Dakota's history, and we look out for each other - no
matter what. With one of the highest rates of military service in the
country, we should be grateful every day - not just today - for our
servicemembers' and veterans' selfless dedication and sacrifice for all
of us.
This Memorial Day is a reminder of our commitments to all of them. We
honor those who are deployed across the globe to preserve and protect
our freedom, recommit to protecting our veterans, and support the
families of all servicemembers and veterans. Most importantly, we
remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. To all of them, we are
forever in debt.
During my time in the Senate, I have been a staunch advocate for our
veterans. It has been a privilege to push for better health care
access, improve the awareness of PTSD, and make sure veterans and
servicemembers of all eras have access to the benefits they deserve.
But there is still so much to do. Have no doubt that I will continue to
fight for our veterans, and the benefits and support they courageously
earned.
Today is a day that we all stand underneath one flag to honor those we
have lost and remember those who leave behind their families to fight -
not just for themselves and their loved ones, but to make sure
generations of Americans yet to come can live in freedom.
Thank you to those who have protected us in the past, and the men and
women keeping us safe today. And Godspeed to those who will be called
to defend us in the future.

Recommitting
to
Our
Veterans
Since
the
beginning
of
the
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
we
have
deployed
2.6
million
servicemembers
from
our
military
to
fight
in
both
countries
-
and
many
of
them
have
been
sent
back
for
multiple
tours.
As
most
of
these
troops
have
returned
home,
we
have
created
a
new,
younger
generation
of
veterans
who
we
absolutely
must
support
-
just
as
we
do
veterans
of
past
generations
and
wars.
In
North
Dakota,
all
of
us
have
husbands,
wives,
parents,
or
neighbors
who
have
answered
the
call
to
serve
because
we
understand
the
importance
of
defending
our
country.
There's
a
tradition
of
service
rooted
in
North
Dakota's
history,
and
we
look
out
for
each
other
-
no
matter
what.
With
one
of
the
highest
rates
of
military
service
in
the
country,
we
should
be
grateful
every
day
-
not
just
today
-
for
our
servicemembers'
and
veterans'
selfless
dedication
and
sacrifice
for
all
of
us.
This
Memorial
Day
is
a
reminder
of
our
commitments
to
all
of
them.
We
honor
those
who
are
deployed
across
the
globe
to
preserve
and
protect
our
freedom,
recommit
to
protecting
our
veterans,
and
support
the
families
of
all
servicemembers
and
veterans.
Most
importantly,
we
remember
those
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
To
all
of
them,
we
are
forever
in
debt.
During
my
time
in
the

I
have
been
a
staunch

for
our

It
has
been
a

to
push
for

access,
improve
the
awareness
of
PTSD,
and
make
sure
veterans
and
servicemembers
of
all
eras
have
access
to
the
benefits
they
deserve.
But
there
is
still
so
much
to
do.
Have
no
doubt
that
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
our
veterans,
and
the
benefits
and
support
they
courageously
earned.
Today
is
a
day
that
we
all
stand
underneath
one

to
honor
those
we

and

for

and
their

but
to
make
sure
generations
of
Americans
yet
to
come
can
live
in
freedom.
Thank
you
to
those
who
have
protected
us
in
the
past,
and
the
men
and
women
keeping
us
safe
today.
And
Godspeed
to
those
who
will
be
called
to
defend
us
in
the
future.
