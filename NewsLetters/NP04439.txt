Dear Neighbor,
We're back in Washington, working on the real issues facing the American people during the &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; session of Congress. We'll begin our third full term in January representing the people of Western New York and the Finger Lakes.
People want change, and we hope that the President, and the House and Senate Democrats will be able to work together with the GOP Congress to find common ground on the issues we face. There&rsquo;s an opportunity to do something historic here and we went to Washington to do big things, to solve America&rsquo;s problems.
Our top priorities this session is getting the bipartisan Revitalization and Manufacturing Innovation Act (RAMI) signed into law by the President, ensuring the House passes a clean, bipartisan continuing resolution, and passing bipartisan immigration reform legislation.
What would you like to see accomplished before the New Year? Let us know by visiting our

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO APPROVE KEYSTONE PIPELINE
Today we
voted
in support of H.R 5682, a bill that will require the executive branch to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline through the central U.S. The House of Representatives took another step forward on a critical infrastructure project that will create over 42,000 fair jobs, that American consumers and workers will benefit from, lower energy costs and provide reliable and affordable North American energy.
NY STATE SET TO AID COMMUNITIES HIT BY FLOODS
We&rsquo;re thrilled to see that our local communities will get the fair
funding and resources they need to rebuild in the wake of devastating
floods. New York State will minimize the financial impact on local taxpayers by alleviating local governments of their entire required share of FEMA Public Assistance Program for counties affected by floods earlier this year.
Directly following the flooding, Reed
contacted
Governor Cuomo&rsquo;s office to encourage the Governor to apply for federal assistance if the state is unable to respond effectively on its own.
Reed visited the areas hit hardest by flooding including the Village of Penn Yan in Yates County and Camp Good Days in Branchport to see the damage firsthand.
P.S - we visited local Veterans Days events across throughout the district.
