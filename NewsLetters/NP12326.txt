Priorities for 2014
Tuesday, February 18, 2014
Dear Friend,
With the beginning of the Second Session of the 113th Congress, I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts on some of the big issues
facing our nation.
I hope you&rsquo;ll
complete this brief survey
and tell me
what issues Congress should prioritize and work together on to tackle this year.
Additionally, I invite you to stay in touch with me through
Facebook
and
Twitter ,
and to sign up to receive my
e-newsletters .
You'll be able to get the latest updates on my work on the Central
Coast and in Washington&mdash;and give me your thoughts on current topics.
Thank you for taking the time to share your views.
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
