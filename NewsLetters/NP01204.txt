The Conservative Case for Investment in
Research
Click here to read the full article that appeared on Saturday's front
page of the
Kansas City Star .
Diseases like
cancer, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons know no political parties,
regional differences, or what the effects of sequestration are. They affect
all of us indiscriminately, killing more Americans each year than any
war. Cancer will kill almost 600,000 Americans in 2015 alone. Another
700,000 Americans will die with Alzheimers disease. Close to 500,000
people in the United States have Parkinsons. Providing adequate
funding for researching cures promotes a culture of life. It is a moral
issue.
But Im making the case for increased funding at
National Institutes of Health (NIH) on conservative principles, not
only from a moral standpoint but an economic one as well. This
isn't something states or local communities can do. No neighborhood
association is going to cure cancer. Private sector companies do not have
the heft to fund research of this magnitude. Thus, the federal
government has a unique role to play in this arena, and paying for more
critical research at NIH will simply involve reprioritizing our investments
for our future.
Medical costs
associated with treating cancer are expected to top $200 billion
annually by 2020. In 2014, we spent only $5.3 billion on cancer research at
NIH. Medical costs associated with Alzheimers disease are expected to
jump to a staggering $1.1 trillion annually by 2050. To put that
figure in perspective, it would be nearly one-third of our entire federal
budget this year, which included only $562 million for Alzheimers
research. Finally, Parkinsons disease had an economic impact on the US
economy of $10.8 billion last year alone. We spent what amounts to
around one percent of that figure
$139 million
on
research.
Not investing billions today and costing
ourselves trillions tomorrow is penny-wise and
pound-foolish. Simply put, if the United States doesn't take up its historic role of
funding research to cure cancer, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's no one
will. With a 17-month-old daughter, I know she and her generation are
counting on us to cure these diseases and save lives for generations to
come.
Email Privacy Act
Click here to
watch a YouTube video of Congressman Yoder's testimony before the Rules
Committee.
Last week, I tried unsuccessfully to
have the
Email Privacy Act
- my bill that would require a warrant for the government to
read our emails - moved to the floor as an amendment to pending
cybersecurity legislation. Unfortunately, the House Rules Committee voted
the amendment out of order, but we will continue our quest to uphold
the Constitution and protect Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.

Polis in
IJReview.
100 Days
The House finished its first 100 days last week, and while
there is still much work to do, were off to a good start. The House
has passed dozens of bills to increase tax freedom, move closer to
North American Energy independence, grow small businesses, fight human
trafficking, support our veterans, and so much
more.
A recent report by the Bipartisan Policy Center
found that , The first three months of
the 114th Congress showed a burst of energy, with Congressional
committees reporting bills in higher numbers than during recent
Congresses.
Under Republican leadership in the
House and Senate, things are different in Washington, and theres data
to prove it:
Weve passed 62 bills, which more than
doubled the 25 passed in the first 100 days of the 113th Congress and
is twice as many as the 31 passed in the 112th
Congress.
Of these bills, eight have gone on to pass the Senate. All eight of
those bills have been signed into law.
This marks the
second most productive first 100 days where Republicans have been in
control of the House in decades, behind only the 106th Congress where 14
bills were enacted.
To top it off, our committees have been
more efficient than the previous three Congresses. In this Congress,
7.6 percent of bills have passed out of committee compared to 3.9
percent in the 113th, 3.4 percent in the 112th and the 40-year historical
average of 6.6 percent.
Military Construction
and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill
Last week, the
House Appropriations Committee passed the
2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
Appropriations Bill . This bill provides $76.6 billion for the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as military construction
projects for our troops, their families, and our military bases. It also
increases oversight at the VA, tracks regional VA offices' performance,
and provides funding to clear the VAs claims
backlog.
Provides $76.6 billion in discretionary funding for FY
2016 for the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as military
construction projects for our troops, their families, and our military
bases
$4.6 billion over FY15 funding level and $1.2 billion
below the Presidents request
$68.7 billion in
discretionary funding for Veterans programs, including benefits, health care,
housing, and job training
$7.7 billion for military
construction
$48.6 billion for VA medical services to
care for 6.9 million patients, including important funding for
suicide prevention, traumatic brain injury, and mental
health
Increases oversight at the VA, tracks regional VA offices'
performance, and provides funding to clear the VAs claims
backlog
The funding allocated in this bill ensures that we are
keeping the promise to our nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their
families. I was proud to vote in favor of its
passage.
Energy and Water Appropriations Bill
The House
Appropriations Committee also passed the
2016 Energy and Water Appropriations
Bill
with my support. This bill responsibly prioritizes spending and provides
$35.4 billion for national defense nuclear weapons activities, the
Army Corps of Engineers, various programs under the Department of Energy
(DOE), and other related agencies. It spends $633 million less than
the President's Budget Request.
Provides
$35.4 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Energy, Army
Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and other related
agencies
$1.2 billion above FY15 funding level and $633 million
below the Presidents request
$12.3 billion for the
Department of Energys nuclear security program to maintain the U.S.
nuclear deterrence posture and the safety of our nuclear
stockpile
$5.6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers for navigation
projects, flood and storm damage reduction, and dam safety
improvements
$1.178 billion from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
to reduce the backlog of dredging needs
$10.3 billion
to advance our all-of-the-above energy strategy to advance research
and development on fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy
programs
$1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation to manage
water resources
Includes important provisions that
prohibit jurisdictional expansion or other changes to the Clean Water
Act
The money allocated in this bill will facilitate the
infrastructure needed to keep Americans safe, fund the Army Corps of
Engineers' various public works projects, help drive America towards
energy independence, grow our economy, and alleviate suffering from
droughts in Kansas and around the country.
Project Eagle Head Start
I enjoyed meeting with
Dean Olson, President and CEO of The Family Conservancy (TFC), and Head
Start leaders who are working to serve over 50,000 children and
families in the greater metro area. Earlier this year, the Family
Conservancy was awarded an Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grant that
will allow TFC to expand high quality early learning opportunities for
even more infants and toddlers and their families in our community. I
look forward to working with TFC to promote opportunities to encourage
families to talk, read, and play with our children every
day.
I was also able to visit a classroom at
Project Eagle Head Start and read a book with my new preschool friends.
Thank you to Heather Schrotberger, Director at Project Eagle, and Jessica
Haremza, Educare site director, for showing me around the classrooms
and Kelli Roehr and Audra Bush, the hardworking educators who let me
join their classroom as a guest
reader.
Earlier this year, National Head Start Association (NHSA) presented
me with the PROMISE Award for my strong support of the Head Start
program during my tenure in Congress. It was the first year NHSA has given
out the award, coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of the program
being created by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
1965.
Letter to CDC Director
In March, 31 students at
Olathe Northwest
tested
positive for tuberculosis . This is a highly infectious, but
preventable disease.
Recently, I sent a letter to Center
for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden expressing my
concerns about the outbreak and requesting a breakdown on CDC's
efforts to track and prevent communicable diseases like
tuberculosis.
Bob
Dole
Great to visit with Bob Dole on the plane back
from DC last week. He was on his way to receive an award in Kansas
City from the Harry S. Truman Library &amp; Museum.
Fact of the Week
Federal funding for
research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is down 22% in constant
dollars compared to its funding level in 2003.
