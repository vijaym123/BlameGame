Dear Friend:
Today, I joined 24 of my Senate colleagues in asking President Obama to establish a Special Envoy for LGBT human rights within the State Department to coordinate U.S. efforts to combat international violence and discrimination against LGBT people worldwide. To learn more and read our letter, please click

Nearly eighty nations have laws that criminalize homosexuality or promote homophobia. This past year alone, two countries - Uganda and Nigeria - passed horrific new laws that can result in life imprisonment for LGBT men and women. This disturbing trend is not just a danger to the LGBT community, it is an affront to human rights everywhere. Please know that as the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee dedicated to the protection of human rights, I will continue to champion the fundamental human dignity of all people, regardless of sexual orientation.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
