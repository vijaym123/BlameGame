On Eve of Ted Stevens Day, Congressman Young Shares Message with Alaskans
Today I share this message with you to honor the life and legacy of the late Senator Ted Stevens and to commemorate the fourth Saturday in July, Ted Stevens Day:
As Alaskans gather to celebrate the 4th Ted Stevens Day, I am filled with emotion and sentiment for my good friend and former colleague Senator Ted Stevens. Throughout my travels in the state, its clear to me that Ted remains a major inspiration for Alaskans from Ketchikan to Nome and everywhere in between. His presence still surrounds us, not just in his many accomplishments, but in the vision he set forth for our states bright future.
I was proud to call Ted my friend, and often look back to reflect on our time together as we worked to defend the Alaskan people from outside attacks. Ted was a force to be reckoned with, his passion and dedication for our people, our policies and principals is something I will never forget.
On the day of his memory, I encourage all Alaskans to celebrate as Ted would have wished, by getting outside our homes and enjoying the great state he helped build. Whether its time on the water, in the air, or simply in good company of friends and family, I know Ted would be proud to see us Alaskans taking time to get out and play.
God bless and I wish you all a very enjoyable Ted Stevens Day.
