News from Representative Lou Barletta
We May Have Lost a Battle, but We Haven't Lost the War
Sunday, March 9, 2014
On March 3, the Supreme Court refused to hear the City of Hazleton's
case, which was in defense of an ordinance I passed while I was mayor.
We said that if you are a landlord or employer, the city would suspend
your business license if you knowingly rented to, or hired an illegal
immigrant.
I am deeply disappointed in that decision, especially given conflicting
rulings by two different Circuit Courts, one regarding Hazleton's
ordinance and one on a similar law in Fremont, Nebraska.
Fremont's
law, very much the same as Hazleton's but slightly more stringent, has
been upheld by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, while the 3rd Circuit
had struck down Hazleton's.
I am at a loss to explain why the Supreme
Court has opted not to settle this obvious conflict in Circuit
decisions.
Simply put, if Hazleton were in Nebraska or somewhere else within the
8th Circuit, instead of Pennsylvania, the city would be able to enforce
its law.
But for the unfortunate fact of geography, the law of the
land in the Midwest is deemed unconstitutional in Pennsylvania.
I blame the federal government.
If our immigration laws were enforced,
localities would not be compelled to take matters into their own hands.
It's why I am firmly opposed to any legislation that hints at amnesty
for illegal immigrants, and stand in favor of the SAFE Act, which would
codify states' and localities' abilities to enforce federal immigration
laws.
In the end, we have two Circuit Court rulings in conflict, and the
Supreme Court should do its job to resolve it.
I have always been a
strong advocate for immigration enforcement, but last week's ruling
will spur me to have an even louder voice.
From Washington...
ENSURING THE FULL PROTECTION OF OUR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL
On February 10, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final
regulations regarding the Employer Mandate Provision of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), including a section on our nation's volunteer
firefighters and emergency medical personnel.
The final rule uses the same definition of a "bona fide volunteer" as
my bill, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders
Act (H.R. 3979).
Importantly, it ensures the hours worked by these
volunteers will not cause them to be treated as full-time employees
under the Employer Mandate Provision.
I am pleased the IRS decided to treat volunteers as actual volunteers
and not full-time employees.
This is positive news.
At the same time,
I remain deeply concerned with the Administration's constant disregard
of the legislative process, especially when it involves the ACA.
In civics class, we all learned that the Legislative Branch makes the
laws and the Executive Branch enforces them - not the other way around.
The president should not be able to change the law as he goes along.
To ensure the president keeps his promise to the American people, I
expect H.R. 3979 to be on the floor for a vote by the full House next
week, most likely Tuesday afternoon.
If passed, this would guarantee a
level of permanency that these regulations cannot provide to the brave
men and women who put their lives on the line for the safety of our
communities.
STOPPING GOVERNMENT ABUSE
During the last week of February, the House passed a series of bills
seeking to reign in government overreach and stop federal bureaucrats
from hurting hardworking American families.
From simply allowing an
individual to unlock their cell phone to stopping the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) from targeting law abiding citizens, the House is working
to ensure the government returns to its original intent: working for
the American people, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, today our government is not working for the American
people as it should. Instead, government overreach is becoming the new
normal in Washington and it's costing American families their hard-
earned paychecks and threatening their liberties.
The American people
deserve better.
We must work to restore their trust in our government
with smarter spending, less executive overreach and regulation, and the
protection of their rights as citizens of this great nation.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT:
Immigration Update
No one is denying that our nation's immigration system is broken and
needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, the immigration proposal recently
unveiled by House leaders bears an uncanny resemblance to a "piecemeal"
repackaging of the disastrous Senate plan. If it talks like a duck and
walks like a duck, it's a duck.

House Homeland Security Committee Hearing
On February 26, I had the opportunity to talk with the newly confirmed
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson about his vision for the future
and our nation's security.
Of course, protecting our homeland from
those who wish to do us harm remains a top priority.

VISITORS FROM THE DISTRICT
On February 27, I had the pleasure of meeting with members from the
Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol, including Cadet 2nd Lieutenant
Austin Cackovic from Harrisburg.
We discussed the importance of
aerospace education, cadet programs, and emergency services.

WELCOMING HOME JAYSON TERDIMAN
On March 2, along with the Berwick Community, I welcomed Jayson
Terdiman home from the Sochi 2014 Olympics.
He placed 11th in the
double luge and 6th in the team relay event.
It was an honor to have
one of our own represent the United States of America in these
legendary games.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT:
Tax Day is Right around the Corner
With April 1 quickly approaching, I wanted to remind those filing
federal tax returns that my district offices have 2013 federal tax
forms and filing instructions available (1040, 1040A, 1040EZ). To
request these materials or for more information, please contact one of
my district offices. For additional tax filing information and

Legislative Update
COSPONSORED LEGISLATION:
*	Stop This Overreaching Presidency Resolution (H.Res.442), which
would direct the House to institute legal action to require the
President to comply with the law.
*	Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act (H.R. 3747), which
would specifically exclude from taxable income any property tax benefit
received and up to a certain amount per year for all other nominal
payments to volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel. This would
reinstate and increase the exclusion for benefits provided to volunteer
firefighters and emergency medical responders by raising the base from
$360 to $600 annually and extending the coverage through 2016 tax year.
*	Veterans Entrepreneurs Act of 2013 (H.R. 3725), which would
provide a tax credit to qualified veterans and their spouses who
purchase a franchise, worth up to 25 percent of the total franchise fee
and capped at $100,000.
This legislation will lower the financial
barriers to entering the franchise industry for veterans, benefiting
not only veterans but their families and the economy as a whole.
*	Patients' Access to Treatments Act of 2013 (H.R. 460), which
would prevent insurance agencies from imposing higher co-payments or
coinsurance for medications in the specialty drug tier (Tier IV) than
what they charge for a non-preferred brand drug tier (Tier III).
This
increases access to life-saving drugs for patients who are suffering
from life chronic conditions.
LETTERS SENT TO:
*	Signed a joint certificate of recognition for the 50th
Anniversary Celebration of the Harrisburg Area Community College.
*	Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator
Marilyn Tavenner expressing concerns with the 2015 Advance Notice on
payments for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans,
which could have a negative impact on beneficiaries.
*	General Reynolds, along with Rep. Marino and Senator Toomey,
asking him to consider bringing the First Marine Corps District
Recruiting Headquarters to Tobyhanna Army Depot.
This decision will
not only benefit the 100 marines and their families that will be
stations there, but Northeastern Pennsylvania as a whole.
IMPORTANT VOTE: PASSAGE OF DEBT CEILING LEGISLATION
On February 11, the House passed legislation to suspend the debt
ceiling through March 15, 2015. With our national debt now well over
$17 trillion dollars, I could not in good conscience vote for a bill
that would extend our borrowing limit without reductions elsewhere.
Historically, debt limit legislation has been paired with other
budgetary bills intended to reduce deficits.
In 2010, the House
demanded a dollar-for-dollar match in deficit reduction for increasing
the debt limit, and they accomplished it.
Last year, I sided with the American people and voted to reopen the
government because I truly believed we could achieve spending
reductions during the debt ceiling debate.
Regrettably, we get no
meaningful savings in this bill to suspend the debt limit.
I have four daughters, and if one of them came to me and asked for help
making payments on her credit card, I would help her out.
What I
wouldn't do is help her raise that credit card limit.
At some point,
we need to draw a line in the sand and take the credit card back from
the federal government.
The American taxpayers deserve the certainty that comes with a balanced
budget and commonsense spending reductions.
Thanks to Washington's
unsustainable spending problem, each American citizen currently owns
almost $55,000 of our nation's debt.
They shouldn't have to endure
this burden weighing on their shoulders.

*	Federal agencies
*	Federal grants
*	Military and veterans issues
*	Service academy nominations
*	Tours and tickets in Washington, D.C.
*	Internships

News
from
Representative
Lou
Barletta
We
May
Have
Lost
a
Battle,
but
We
Haven't
Lost
the
War
Sunday,
March
9,
2014
On
March
3,
the
Supreme
Court
refused
to
hear
the
City
of
Hazleton&#8217;s
case,
which
was
in
defense
of
an
ordinance
I
passed
while
I
was
mayor.
We
said
that
if
you
are
a
landlord
or
employer,
the
city
would
suspend
your
business
license
if
you
knowingly
rented
to,
or
hired
an
illegal
immigrant.
I
am
deeply
disappointed
in
that
decision,
especially
given
conflicting
rulings
by
two
different
Circuit
Courts,
one
regarding
Hazleton&#8217;s
ordinance
and
one
on
a
similar
law
in
Fremont,
Nebraska.
Fremont&#8217;s
law,
very
much
the
same
as
Hazleton&#8217;s
but
slightly
more
stringent,
has
been
upheld
by
the
8th
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals,
while
the
3rd
Circuit
had
struck
down
Hazleton&#8217;s.
I
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
the
Supreme
Court
has
opted
not
to
settle
this
obvious
conflict
in
Circuit
decisions.
Simply
put,
if
Hazleton
were
in
Nebraska
or
somewhere
else
within
the
8th
Circuit,
instead
of
Pennsylvania,
the
city
would
be
able
to
enforce
its
law.
But
for
the
unfortunate
fact
of
geography,
the
law
of
the
land
in
the
Midwest
is
deemed
unconstitutional
in
Pennsylvania.
I
blame
the
federal
government.
If
our
immigration
laws
were
enforced,
localities
would
not
be
compelled
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands.
It&#8217;s
why
I
am
firmly
opposed
to
any
legislation
that
hints
at
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants,
and
stand
in
favor
of
the
SAFE
Act,
which
would
codify
states&#8217;
and
localities&#8217;
abilities
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws.
In
the
end,
we
have
two
Circuit
Court
rulings
in
conflict,
and
the
Supreme
Court
should
do
its
job
to
resolve
it.
I
have
always
been
a
strong
advocate
for
immigration
enforcement,
but
last
week&#8217;s
ruling
will
spur
me
to
have
an
even
louder
voice. From
Washington...
ENSURING

On

10,
the
Internal

issued
final

the
Employer
Mandate
Provision
of
the
Affordable

a

our
nation&#8217;s

firefighters
and
emergency
medical
personnel.
The
final
rule
uses
the
same
definition
of
a
&#8220;bona
fide
volunteer&#8221;
as
my
bill,
the
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act
(H.R.
3979).
Importantly,
it
ensures
the
hours
worked
by
these
volunteers
will
not
cause
them
to
be
treated
as
full-time
employees
under
the
Employer
Mandate
Provision.
I
am
pleased
the
IRS
decided
to
treat
volunteers
as
actual
volunteers
and
not
full-time
employees.
This
is
positive
news.
At
the
same
time,
I
remain
deeply

with
the

should
not
be
able
to
change
the
law
as
he
goes
along.
To
ensure
the
president
keeps
his
promise
to
the
American

I
expect
H.R.
3979
to
be
on
the
floor
for
a
vote
by
the
full
House
next

most
likely
Tuesday
afternoon.
If

this
would
guarantee
a

that
these

the
brave

House
demanded
a
dollar-for-dollar
match
in
deficit
reduction
for
increasing
the
debt
limit,
and
they
accomplished
it.
Last
year,
I
sided
with
the
American
people
and
voted
to
reopen
the
government
because
I
truly
believed
we
could
achieve
spending
reductions
during
the
debt
ceiling
debate.
Regrettably,
we
get
no
meaningful
savings
in
this
bill
to
suspend
the
debt
limit.
I
have
four
daughters,
and
if
one
of
them
came
to
me
and
asked
for
help
making
payments
on
her
credit
card,
I
would
help
her
out.
What
I
wouldn&#8217;t
do
is
help
her
raise
that
credit
card
limit.
At
some
point,
we
need
to
draw
a
line
in
the
sand
and
take
the
credit
card
back
from
the
federal
government.
The
American
taxpayers
deserve
the
certainty
that
comes
with
a
balanced
budget
and
commonsense
spending
reductions.
Thanks
to
Washington&#8217;s
unsustainable
spending
problem,
each
American
citizen
currently
owns
almost
$55,000
of
our
nation&#8217;s
debt.
They
shouldn&#8217;t
have
to
endure
this
burden
weighing
on
their
shoulders. How

How
You
Can

remain
convinced
that
some

America's
problems
