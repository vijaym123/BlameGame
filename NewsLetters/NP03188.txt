Friend ,
Thank you for helping us kick off our 2016 campaign with a strong start. Without you, none of this would be possible, and I&#39;m glad to know that I have you standing with me in these early days.
As we start a new session of Congress, I am excited about what is to come.
Just this week, as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as Co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, I had the honor and privilege to travel to India with President Obama to meet with Prime Minister Modi and discuss strengthening and expanding the U.S.- India relationship. Doing so will benefit both our nation and our local agricultural region as we look to open markets for our goods overseas.
We have a lot to accomplish in the coming year and I hope we are able to get more people back to work with good paying jobs, ensure college is affordable for everyone, and rise above the partisan gridlock. With your help, I am confident we can get this done.
Thanks again for your support.
Be well,
Ami
