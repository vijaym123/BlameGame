Dear Friend:
In honoring our fallen heroes this Memorial Day, we are reminded of the
debt of gratitude that is owed to the brave men and women who have
sacrificed so much in defense of our country.
On this special day,
please join me in thanking a veteran, praying for our active duty
troops, and remembering the fallen.
While we may never be able to repay the debt that is owed to them, too
many veterans are not receiving the attention and assistance they have
undoubtedly earned.
As you may have heard, the Veterans Affairs (VA)
Department is under fire over reports that veterans died as part of a
secret waiting list to cover up lengthy delays in VA medical care.
Regrettably, I believe this news is part of a larger pattern of
mismanagement and a lack of accountability at the VA.
In the wake of these recent news reports, please take a brief moment to
answer the following question so I can hear your thoughts on this
important topic and provide you updates on the issues that matter most
to our district.
I will be sharing the results in our next newsletter -
so stay tuned.
Do you think the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki should
resign over reports that veterans died while awaiting treatment on
secret waiting lists?
Yes
No
