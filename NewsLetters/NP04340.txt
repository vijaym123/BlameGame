Dear Friend,
Yesterday, I was selected to serve as the next Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the first Texan--Republican or Democrat--to do so. I am grateful for the opportunity and also mindful of the responsibility it entails. The men and women who serve our nation in the military deserve the full support and backing of the Congress and of the country. Providing that support will be my top priority.
As I explain in the video mailbox that you can watch below, this opportunity is only possible because of the help and support I have received over the years from my family, employers and mentors, co-workers, my official and campaign staffs, and especially from the people of the 13th congressional District of Texas. I am extremely grateful for the confidence they have shown in me and will do my best to live up to the responsibilities of this position on their behalf.
