We Need Local Control of Ontario Airport
As you may have seen or read in the news, I recently responded to the
offensive comments made by a Los Angeles airport official, who referred
to our region as the "inbred Inland Empire."
The comments, made by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) chief operating
officer Steve Martin, were discovered in emails revealed recently in
court filings that were reported by the Los Angeles Times. Obviously,
Mr. Martin's comments are offensive, highly unprofessional, and I
believe he should be terminated.
I also sent Federal Aviation Administration Administrator (FAA) Michael
Huerta, a native Inland Empire resident, a letter
regarding the comments made
by Mr. Martin and asked him as our FAA Administrator to exert any
influence he has to prevent LAWA from deliberately reducing airline
service and inflicting more economic harm on the Inland Empire.
The attitude and biases of high ranking LAWA officials makes it crystal
clear that they do not have the best interest of the Inland Empire in
mind. Rest assured, I am committed to doing everything in my power to
help achieve local control of Ontario Airport.
I spoke with CBS News about the comments and you can watch the

Local Angels in Adoption
The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's Angels in Adoption
program honors individuals, couples, and organizations that have made
extraordinary contributions on behalf of children in need of families.
It was my honor to nominate my constituents, Reggie and Tamara Doss,
for an Angels in Adoption award. They are a compassionate couple and
inspiring members of our community.
