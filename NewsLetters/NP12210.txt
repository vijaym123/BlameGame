You Should Go!
Now berthed at Nauticus in Norfolk, the Battleship Wisconsin is one of the largest and last battleships ever built by the U.S. Navy.
She was laid down on 25 January 1941; launched on 7 December 1943; and commissioned on 16 April 1944.
You can tour the deck and interior of this incredible ship and see first-hand a piece of American history that earned five battle stars during WWII.
