As we celebrate Memorial Day, we must pause and honor the selfless actions of our nations service members who bore the ultimate cost of preserving Americas freedom, men and women who are currently serving in our nations armed forces, veterans, and their families. While we enjoy this holiday weekend, I encourage you to take a moment to thank a service member in our community, visit a local cemetery, or provide assistance to our honorable veterans who have served our nation with dignity and respect.
