Friends,
When driving around the Palmetto State and
country, you've probably seen cars sporting bumper stickers with a black and
thin blue line emblem. These stickers are displayed to commemorate
fallen police officers and show camaraderie for our nation's law
enforcement officials.
It is said the "thin blue
line" represents law enforcement personnel and the two black lines
represent public citizens and criminals. There is a thin (blue) line
separating criminals from the public and our brave police force is
charged with making sure the two lines do not meet.
As we conclude law
enforcement appreciation week, I would like to say thank you to our
men and women in
blue.
Prepare for the Worst, Pray for the
Best
There is no denying that our country faces national security
threats from terrorist groups and aggressive foreign regimes. Radical
leaders spend every waking hour plotting against our nation and our
way of life.
Fortunately, we are home to the most sophisticated
military in the world.
Our troops are skilled, innovative, and
well equipped for any
situation.
To continue keeping
American families safe and secure, the House of Representatives passed the
National Defense Authorization Act last week.
This bill
authorizes funding for our national defense and ensures that our military
leaders have access to the resources they need to continue protecting our
country.
We also
passed legislation that requires the Obama Administration to seek
Congressional approval for the nuclear deal Secretary Kerry and President
Obama are brokering with Iran. Both Chambers of Congress have agreed the
American people should have a say in this deal and congressional
approval would guarantee their
input.
SC WWII &amp; Korean War Vets Visit
DC
Last week, some of the very troops that
secured our freedom traveled to our nation's capital to visit their
memorials and pay tribute to their fallen comrades. The Honor Flight group
also included Medal of Honor Recipient Kyle Carpenter.
What a
special trip and heart touching tribute. God bless these
heroes!
Regulating
Puddles?
The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent power grab will leave
you dumbfounded. The agency attempted to enact regulations that would
allow them to regulate runoff water, rain puddles, and ditches.
Many Seventh District farmers and concerned citizens contacted our
office about this ridiculous regulation. I am pleased to let you know
that last week the House passed legislation to block the EPA's Waters of
the United States regulation. Thank you to our farmers and community
for speaking out against this needless
rule.
