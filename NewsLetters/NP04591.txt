Forbes, Lamborn Praise Revision of Air Force Policy
Washington, D.C.
- Representatives J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) and Doug Lamborn (CO-05) issued the following statement in response to an announcement from the United States Air Force that they have revised Air Force Instruction 1-1:
The Air Forces new policy more clearly reflects the priority of religious freedom in our Constitution and in the conscience protections for servicemembers and chaplains that Congress passed in the National Defense Authorization Act. Whereas the old language was misleading and confusing for Commanders to apply, these revisions point to well-established standards for protecting religious expression. We are grateful to General Welsh and Chaplain Stendahl for their leadership in revising this policy, and hope that this new language will better aid commanders in maintaining the high standard that our Nation has always had for protecting freedom of religion for our men and women in uniform.
