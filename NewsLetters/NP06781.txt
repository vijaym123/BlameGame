David -- we're so inspired by you.
Up until today, we were having an awful week. We just couldn't compete with Karl Rove's Obama-bashing ad blitz. It's the furthest we've been behind all year.
But then President Obama emailed you -- and you stepped up!
That's 40,627 online donations since this morning. It's almost unbelievable!!!
We just need 10 more donations from 60659 zip code in the next 48 hours to completely close the gap.
David Johnson Answered President Obama's call-to-action? NO DONATION
