Each fall, we get to watch
the leaves change and are
reminded just how beautiful
Delaware truly is. During
this time, its
important to take a moment to
think about what we can each
do to help preserve this
natural beauty for
generations to come.
Thats why today and
every November 15th,
Im proud to join folks
across the U.S. in
celebrating America Recycles
Day.
As co-chair of the Senate
Recycling Caucus, I strive to
be a friend of the
environment by not only
recycling in my personal
life, but also by raising
awareness of the economic
benefits of recycling, how it
lowers our energy consumption
and how it can help keep our
environment clean. Yesterday,
I was honored to join my
friend, Senator John Boozman,
at an event highlighting
America Recycles Day. I took
this opportunity to show
industry leaders, experts and
just about anyone else who
would listen how Im
rabid about recycling!
On November 14th, Senator
Carper joined Senator
Boozman, co-chair of the
Senate Recycling Caucus,
at an event
highlighting America Recycles
Day.
In a geographically-small
state like Delaware,
its important to
remember that we are limited
for space and its not
smart to use what we do have
just for landfills.
Thats why I take
simple steps every day like
composting at home and in my
office because I know each
little bit of effort can make
a huge difference if we all
work together.
I hope you join me on
America Recycles Day to think
about your environmental
impacts, become better
stewards, and spread the word
about the benefits of
recycling.
Reduce, Reuse,
