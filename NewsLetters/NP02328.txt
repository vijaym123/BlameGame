The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
voted February 26th to reclassify broadband Internet as a
telecommunications service and regulate it as a public utility under Title
II.
The bottom line here is the FCC adopted Great Depression-era
regulations to regulate the Internet.
Under the change,
the FCC will soon subject both hardwire and wireless broadband service
providers to increased strict federal oversight of open Internet
services.
Before the FCC vote, broadband Internet was classified as
an information service preventing burdensome regulations upon
broadband service providers.
The independent FCC panel of five
unelected, party-line appointed bureaucrats voted 3-2 to move forward
with the rule despite the plan being withheld from the public before the
vote.
Also, a number of congressional investigations have been
launched in recent weeks looking into any undue influence President
Obama and his administration may have had in the independent agencys
promulgation of the rule, which would be a breach of legal protocol.
The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology, which I am a member, has been working on a
legislative solution under the direction of subcommittee Chairman Greg
Walden to achieve an open Internet.
Our far more transparent approach
would achieve open Internet policies such as preventing throttling
of select content and disallowing paid prioritization of content while
avoiding the services reclassification under Title II.
Our
plan would continue a light regulatory approach and is a stark contrast
to the FCC action, which many fear lays the groundwork for future
regulations of the Internet.
The Internets foundation is
based upon a system of individuals, organizations, private and
public networks.
These networks are paid for in a variety of
different ways, and most are private property.
I believe that those who
own and maintain those systems should stipulate how their property is
used.
The last thing we need is heavy-handed government
intervention from bureaucrats who have a limited understanding about what the
Internet should become, what services it should provide or how those
services should be delivered to the public.
