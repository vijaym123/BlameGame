Do you agree with the President's decision in his proposed budget to
close tax loopholes enjoyed by only the wealthy and well-connected?
Yes - It is unfair for the wealthy and well-connected to enjoy special
tax breaks, especially as millions of middle class Americans are still
struggling to get by
Maybe - Closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and well-connected is a
start, but he should instead create a simpler and fairer tax code for
all Americans, regardless of their economic status.
No - His budget plan is irresponsible

The month of March is recognized as National Women's History Month.
Women make up just over half of our population; and whether it is
through policy or activism, women must have equal economic opportunity,
equal pay, and equal representation to that of men.
I have said it before, and I will say it again: When women succeed,
America succeeds.
I encourage you to visit www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov
to learn more about just a few of the women who have
contributed to the progress of our nation.
The President's Proposed Budget
I am encouraged that the President's budget includes proposals to
invest in infrastructure, job training, advanced manufacturing,
preschool, and other critical areas that will help move America
forward. Most importantly, the President lays out a way to pay for
these plans by closing tax loopholes enjoyed by only the wealthy and
well-connected.

Climate Change: Case Closed
On Wednesday, the House voted on the Electricity Security and
Affordability Act, which, if signed into law, would unfortunately
prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from creating or
enforcing any rule establishing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards
under the Clean Air Act for new fossil fuel-fired power plants unless
separate GHG emission standards were also established for coal and
natural gas plants. It would also reverse decades of precedent and
practice, barring the EPA from requiring pollution standards on coal
plants, some of the dirtiest and most polluting in the nation.
I believe this bill missed a critical opportunity to provide
much-needed protections for our climate, especially as we learn more
and more about the potentially devastating effects of climate change.
That is why I introduced, along with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, an
amendment that would accept the scientific finding of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) that greenhouse gas pollution is "contributing
to long-lasting changes in our climate that can have a range of
negative effects."
Regrettably, the bill passed without our amendment, on a vote of
229-183. However, I had a chance to speak on the House Floor before the
vote in favor of the passage of our amendment:

Two million and counting.
On December 28 of last year, Congress failed to renew emergency
unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who have been
struggling to find work. These are Americans who have exhausted all of
their options, and who must rely on this temporary safety net in order
to put food on the table and a roof over their head while they spend
their days searching for work. It was irresponsible and heartless for
Congress to let these benefits expire.
>From December 28 to March 8, it is estimated that 339,101 Californians
lost their unemployment benefits as a result of the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation program's expiration. We must renew the
program for these Californians, and for the 1.6 million more Americans
who are suffering due to Congress' inaction.
Coffee and Conversation
I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join me later
this month for a cup of coffee and conversation in Long Beach about the
issues facing our community and nation. I will be providing a
Congressional update to attendees and, as always, will answer your
questions.
I hope to see you there!

Long Beach Students Say "No" To Fracking
Congratulations to Emma Larson, Michaela Capps, and Sarah Highducheck,
freshmen at Long Beach Poly High School, Grand Prize winners in C-SPAN's
national 2014 C-SPAN StudentCam competition for their video entitled,
"Earth First, Fracking Second." This documentary will air on C-SPAN at
6:50 a.m. ET and throughout the day on April 29, 2014.
These three talented high school students got it right: Hydraulic
fracturing must be regulated for the protection of our environment and
our communities.

Second."
"Mark-up"
When a bill is introduced by a Member of Congress, it is then referred
to the relevant House Committee. For example, a bill that relates to
veterans' benefits would be referred to the House Committee on Veterans'
Affairs. Once the bill is received, the Committee convenes and its
members offer and vote on proposed changes to the bill's language,
known as amendments. Most mark-ups end with a vote to send the new or
"marked-up" version of the bill to the floor for the full House to
consider.
What do you think is the best form of clean energy for California?
(respondents could select more than one answer)
Wind - 20.5%
Solar - 70.6%
Hydro - 11.3%
Advanced biofuels - 0.0%
Geothermal - 10.3%
None - clean energy is
unrealistic for California - 11.7%
I do not know - 7.7%

Two

On
December

Congress
failed
to
renew
emergency

for
the
millions
of
Americans
who
have
been

are

It
was
irresponsible
and
heartless
for
Congress
to
let
these

expire.
From
December
28
to
March
8,
it
is

Californians
lost
their

When

it
is

For

the

its
