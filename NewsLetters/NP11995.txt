Senator Stabenow Helps Steer New Manufacturing Hub to Michigan
President Obama Signs the 2014 Farm Bill at Michigan State
University
U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate
Manufacturing Caucus, was at the White House this week when the
President announced a $140 million public-private partnership to build a
high-tech manufacturing research innovation hub in Southeast Michigan.
The American Lightweight Materials Manufacturing Innovation Institute
will focus on bringing next-generation lightweight metals to market for
use in cars, trucks, airplanes, and other commercial, personal, and
military vehicles. "Today's announcement is great news for Michigan's
growing manufacturing economy," said Stabenow. "This public-private
partnership will build on the great work already being done by our
manufacturers, workers, and universities to help create thousands of
Michigan jobs. Major investments like this will help ensure that we
continue creating high-tech, cutting-edge jobs and training our workers
with the right skills to fill them."

Growing Local Fruits and Vegetables All Year Round
With Eastern Market as a backdrop, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow,
Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, announced $150,000 in
financial assistance to increase the availability of locally grown
produce. The funding will help construct seasonal high tunnels, also
called "hoop houses," which are greenhouse-like structures that protect
crops from severe weather. Hoop houses are made of ribs of plastic or
metal pipe covered with a layer of plastic sheeting and are easy to
build and maintain. "Thanks to increasing demand for more locally grown
food, urban agriculture is taking off. Today's announcement will help
farmers sell more fruits and vegetables directly to families, schools,
and restaurants," Stabenow said.
