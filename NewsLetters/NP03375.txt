Blocking Obama's Unconstitutional Executive Amnesty Plan
Earlier this week, I voted along with a majority (236-191) of the House
to approve the Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Security Appropriations bill
as well as amendments to the bill that will prevent the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) from carrying out President Obama's executive
actions regarding illegal immigration.
The House sent President Obama a message that his attempt to grant
amnesty through unconstitutional executive actions is an affront to the
democratic process that has served our nation well for more than two
hundred years. My constituents want and expect to see the rule of law
followed, regardless of who is in office. I have and I will continue to
oppose the President's executive overreach at every opportunity.

Commuter Alert
The "Main Street Squeeze" in Corona begins Tuesday! The 91 Freeway
eastbound on-ramp at Main St. in Corona will be CLOSED for fifteen
months. Also, Main St. will be narrowed to 2 lanes in each direction
under the freeway. This will allow new bridges to be built and Main St.
to be lowered and widened to accommodate the 91 Freeway expansion. Plan
accordingly and don't forget our local businesses near the freeway.
