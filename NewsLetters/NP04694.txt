Friends,
The American people took to the polls last week, exercising
their constitutional right to vote and forcing Washington to
listen . People across the country who are still trying to find
good-paying jobs and coming up empty- handed are fed up. Families in our local
communities who are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make
ends meet have lost hope. Small business owners who are unable to
grow, create jobs and hire more people because of government red tape and
a sluggish economy are frustrated. The people spoke with a resounding
voice.
Folks overwhelmingly agree that Washington isnt
working.
Americans are tired of a
government that fails to deliver solutions and fumbles its most important
tasks like providing our veterans the care they deserve. They dont
feel confident in the future or the Obama Administrations ability to
lead.
Because of the Presidents liberal agenda, folks have no
hope that things will change.
I share your frustration. You
deserve a government that works just as hard as you do instead of one
that continues to kick the can down the road on the important issues
were facing.
Our country is headed in the wrong direction,
but
because you have spoken, we can turn things
around.
Last week, you made your voice
heard. I want to thank you for once again instilling your trust in me to
help get our country back on track.
It is truly an honor to
serve you in Congress, and I am humbled you have given me the opportunity
to be your voice in Washington for another two years.
Serving
as your Representative is the greatest responsibility entrusted to
me. I will never take lightly your confidence and support. Weve
accomplished a lot together thus far, but theres still a lot of hard work
ahead of us.
Our country is at a critical
crossroads, and I am hopeful that public servants of all parties and
across every level of government will put politics aside, come to the
table and offer real solutions. We are going to have to tackle the tough
decisions to change course, but its not too late.
We just
have to roll up our sleeves and get to work together.
I cant
promise you that Republicans and Democrats will agree on every issue or
every vote, but I pledge to you that I will always put you first.
I will continue to listen to your concerns and priorities, be as
accessible as possible and work as hard as I can to represent
you.
I remain committed to restoring opportunity and advancing
meaningful solutions that return control back to North Carolina and away from
Washington.
There will be some tough
decisions ahead, but you can trust me to stand on our shared principles
and fight for a better America with a smaller, more efficient
government, a stronger economy that creates good-paying jobs, and a sound
foreign policy that protects our shores and makes the world a safer place.
Because you have spoken, our future will be brighter than our
past. Tomorrow will be better than
today.
Until next
week,
Richard Hudson
