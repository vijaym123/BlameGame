Airbag recall may affect some NMI vehicles - Certain models of Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi vehicles sold in the Northern Mariana Islands may be subject to a recall because of defective airbags. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently announced the recall and identified the Northern Marianas as one of the geographic areas of special concern because the defective Takata airbags are more prone to failure in areas with consistently high temperatures and humidity. The agency urged owners of impacted vehicles to contact their dealer's service department and make arrangements for repair as soon as possible. A complete list of affected vehicles listed by make, model, and year of manufacture is available at http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/Vehicle-owners-with-defective-airbags-urged-to-take-immediate-action. Owners may also look up their vehicle identification number on manufacturers' websites to confirm whether the vehicle has an open recall that needs to be addressed.
Value of NMI commercial fish catch up 33 percent - The landed value of the commercial fish catch in the Northern Mariana Islands reached $807,437 in 2013, a 33 percent increase over the previous year. The commercial haul was 341,150 pounds in total, a 29 percent increase over 2012. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released the NMI data this week as part of the agency's annual report on commercial landings. Not surprisingly over half the value came from various species of tuna. Mahi and snapper were also important to the total value of the harvest. Commercial fishing in the Northern Marianas is growing faster than in the rest of the country. Overall, U.S. landings increased 2.5 percent, and the value of the catch increased 7.6 percent. The NOAA report is available at http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/fus/fus13/index.

Ironwood Saipan held a groundbreaking ceremony this week for 80 new, energy-efficient, affordable housing apartments in Gualo Rai yesterday. The project is financed by Low Income Housing Tax Credits granted by the Northern Marianas Housing Corporation. Commonwealth government officials, Ironwood representatives, Father Ryan Jimenez, and I were on hand at the ceremony to kick start construction that will bring much needed affordable housing options to many working families.

American Memorial Park tennis courts reopen Saturday - Tennis players on Saipan will be able to enjoy the renovated American Memorial Park courts weeks ahead of schedule. The National Park Service announced this week that the rehabilitation is complete and the courts will open on Saturday, November 8. Earnings from the AMP Trust Fund paid for the work. The Trust was set up under terms of the Covenant, using a $2 million payment from the U.S. government for a 50 year lease of areas of Tanapag Harbor. The Covenant requires the proceeds of the Trust to go solely for development and maintenance of the Park. Congress also provides funding directly. For fiscal year 2014, Congress appropriated $1.6 million for the operation and maintenance of the American Memorial Park.
$114,552 awarded for State and Community Highway Safety Grant - The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has announced the award of $114,552 to the Commonwealth's Department of Public Safety. Section 402 State and Community Highway Safety Grants provide funds to states and territories to improve driver behavior and reduce deaths and injuries from motor vehicle-related crashes. Congratulations to the Department of Public Safety.
