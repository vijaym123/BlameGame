Taking steps to improve veteran care
Amid disturbing reports that more than 57,000 of our nations veterans have yet to receive an appointment with the VA, I wanted to share an update from Congress on steps Im taking to address the issue.
Today, Republicans and Democrats joined together to pass the
Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014
that would allow veterans to get care outside of the VA system.
This bill, HR 4810, specifically allows veterans who resides more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility, or have experienced extensive delays for an appointment, to access non-VA care. Under this bill, the VA must report to Congress on its efforts to improve care to veterans. It also suspends bonuses for VA employees for two years.
We've made a promise to provide health care for our nation's veterans, but the VA has clearly broken that promise. The revelations about manipulated wait times and veterans being denied care for months on end are totally shameful. Just yesterday, reports were released about the wait times at the Portland VA, which serves the majority of Southwest Washington, ranking this facility as the fifth worst in the country. Its unacceptable that there are veterans in our region who have been waiting up to 80 days for a primary care appointment.
There is a lot more work that needs to be done to fix the systemic problems throughout the VA, but todays vote is a start to make sure veterans are receiving the health care they deserve.
If you are a veteran who is having trouble accessing your benefits, my office is here to help. Please call (360) 695-6292 or visit my website
