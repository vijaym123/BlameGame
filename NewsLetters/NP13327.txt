*Unfortunately, the technical glitches that have plagued the online
Obamacare portal, Healthcare.gov, have extended to our
government-endorsed e-newsletter service provider! Please note the previous email
survey Congressman Hultgren attempted to send using their services
experienced technical difficulties and was unable to record constituent
responses. We apologize for the inconvenience this failure caused.
For those who tried to
answer the survey, we would be grateful if you would be able to
answer the questions again via our website. Please click
here
to take the survey. Even if you are already subscribed to the
newsletter, please enter your email address at the top so we can
accurately log your
responses.
For those who havent had a chance yet, we look forward to
hearing from you as well. Just click
here
to
participate.
Thank you! --Congressman Hultgrens
staff.
