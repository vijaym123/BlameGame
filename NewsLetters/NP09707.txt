Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Monday Visits in the 10th
With Congress out of session Monday, I spent the day making visits across the 10th District.
My first stop was at another of the District's high performing charter schools, Mountain Island Charter in Mount Holly.
During the visit I was led on a tour of the school by students Maris and EG and then met with a group students to discuss their experience at Mountain Island.
Later, I was led on a tour of the school's new gym by school administrators.
Following the visit to Mountain Island Charter, I visited Laxness Corporation's Gaston County facility.
Located in Dallas, the Gaston plant produces high-tech plastics used in place of metal components in cars.
After the visits in Gaston County, I headed up to Catawba County where I
presented a SAFER grant check
to the Conover Fire Department.
The grant of over $225,000 will be used to hire three new full-time firefighters.

National Charter School Week
This past week was National Charter School Week.
In recognition, I took to the House floor to speak about my experiences visiting local 10th District charter schools.
In the past few weeks I have visited three charters across the district, from Mount Holly to Shelby to Asheville.
At each I saw a different educational style but similar goals, challenging students and their parents to stay involved in the education process.
Click the image below to see my full remarks on the charter visits and my comments in support of HR 10, the House-passed legislation that will expand access to high-quality charters across the country.
Treasury Secretary Lew Testifies
This past Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew appeared before the House Financial Services Committee for his annual testimony on the state of the global economy.
Amid bipartisan concern about the process, I used my five minutes of questions to discuss Secretary Lew's role as Chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and their role in determining which financial institutions are designated as systemically important to the financial system.
