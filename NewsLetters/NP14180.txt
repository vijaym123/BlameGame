Friends,
Last week, Speaker Boehner appointed me to the Conference
Committee for the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA).
I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve our countrys
water infrastructure and champion South Carolinas
ports.
Before you sent me to Washington to represent
you, I was not a parlimentary procedure expert and would have thought a
"Conference Committee" was another lavish federal conference.
It is actually the opposite.
I have
put together a brief WRRDA Q&amp;A to breakdown exactly what a
Conference does, what a Conferee is, and how my participation in the
Conference Committee will affect you, your family, and the entire Palmetto
State.

Q: What is a Conference
Committee?
A: A Conference Committee is bipartisan group of
Representatives and Senators that come together to work out the differences
in their respective chamber's bills. The reconciled legislation is then
sent to the Presidents desk.
Q: How many
members are on the WRRDA Conference Committee?
A:
For this particular legislation, the committee is made up of 36
members8 from the Senate and 28 from the House. See picture below for House
Republican Conferees.
Q: How are Conferees selected?
A: Conferees are selected based on the
individual experiences and areas of expertise that a Member can bring to the
table in order to discuss, debate, and determine the final form of a
piece of legislation.
Q: When will the WRRDA
Conferees meet?
A: The Republican House Conferees met
last Friday for an overview. I am hopeful that we meet as an entire
Conference Committee before the end of the
year.
