The latest projection: 50 Democrats - 50 Republicans. This election is on a razor&rsquo;s edge and there are only NINE days left!!
60 MINUTES UNTIL THE FINAL-PUSH GET OUT THE VOTE FUNDING DEADLINE.
Pitch in and we&rsquo;ll TRIPLE-MATCH it. &gt;&gt;
Friend -- The latest projection: 50 Democrats - 50 Republicans. This election is on a razor&rsquo;s edge and there are only NINE days left!!
We&rsquo;re polling AHEAD of the Republicans, but we&rsquo;re in danger of having EVERYTHING ripped away in an instant.
Tomorrow, we&rsquo;re launching our MOST AGGRESSIVE Get Out The Vote Push in history, but we must fill a $34,500 budget hole BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT to fully fund it. We need just two more donations from your zip code -- 60659 -- to close the gap!
Friend, will you pitch in so we can keep the Democratic surge going for the next NINE days? Just 60 minutes left till the deadline -- we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If we meet this goal, we&rsquo;ll have an ARMY of canvassers, callers, and poll watchers ready to go TOMORROW. It&rsquo;s the kind of plan that will leave Republicans IN TEARS on November 5th!
Will Karl Rove have another election night meltdown on FOX News? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out!
PITCH IN BEFORE MIDNIGHT TONIGHT &gt;&gt;
