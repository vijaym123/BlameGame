VISITING DC
April 04, 2014
Yesterday, I joined 10 other members of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence in voting to declassify the Detention
and Interrogation Report.
Since 2012, I have been deeply
concerned about the factual inaccuracies contained within this report,
including inaccurate information relating to the details of the
interrogation program and other information provided by detainees.
I
had hoped that the authors of the report would ensure that the American
public was provided facts, not fiction.
I am extremely
disappointed in the flawed and biased results of their
work.
However, I voted to declassify the report to give the American people the
opportunity to make their own judgments.
I am confident that they
will agree that a 6,300 page report based on a cold document review,
without a single interview of Intelligence Community, Executive Branch,
or contract personnel involved, cannot be an accurate representation
of any program, let alone this one.
Based on what I have
learned as a member of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, I
firmly believe that the CIAs detention program saved lives and played a
vital role in ensuring that our nation had the intelligence it needed
to successfully combat al-Qaida in the days following 9/11 and in
the years since that fateful day.
In other news,
Wednesday was World Autism Awareness Day, the kick-off to National Autism
Month.
I have spoken several times about the importance of doing
what we can to support
individuals with disabilities and their
families, which is why we must pass the ABLE Act.
The
ABLE Act, introduced by Senator Casey and myself, would allow families
with disabled children, including those with autism, to save using a
529 college savings account to prepare for their childs lifetime of
expenses.

Also important to
Americans health is the tax on lifesaving medical devices, a policy which
makes no sense if we are trying to make health care more affordable.
During a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee, I explained why
this wrongheaded policy directly affects Americans health and quality of
life.

Finally, tomorrow our
nation celebrates Gold Star Wives Day.
This day provides an
opportunity to honor the members of Gold Star Wives of America, a
volunteer organization that has assisted widows and survivors of fallen
military members since it was founded in 1945, and thank them for their
untiring efforts.
Members of Gold Star Wives, both women and men,
have lost someone extremely important to them in service to our country,
yet they still have compassion to serve others.
Our nation owes
these individuals and families a huge debt of gratitude, so I
ask that you honor any Gold Star Wives you may know tomorrow and thank
them for their patriotism, service, and sacrifice.

Sincerely,
Richard Burr
