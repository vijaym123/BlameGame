In November 2013, the Supreme Court decided to hear the cases of
Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Store, Inc.
and
Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius , involving two family-owned businesses seeking to operate their companies in a manner consistent with their religious beliefs.
These cases were brought in response to a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Affordable Care Act, known as the HHS mandate, which forced family business owners to choose between their convictions and their businesses by requiring all employee health plans to cover contraceptives that may cause abortions, at no cost to the patient.
The mandate offered a very limited religious employer exemption, and as a result, would have forced many religious hospitals, charities, and universities to choose between their faith or face crushing fines under the Affordable Care Act.
Employers who omit just one drug face fines of $36,500 per year per employee, but employers who offer no insurance whatsoever would only be fined $2,000 per employee per year.
This week, the Supreme Court held that the HHS mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a law protecting religious freedom that was passed by Congress in 1993 with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Question of the week:
Do you agree with the 5-4 Supreme Court decision that the government cannot force family businesses to provide a service that the owners of a company say violate their religious beliefs?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
