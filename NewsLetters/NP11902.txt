Dear Friend,
Tomorrow, I'll be joining President Obama in New Britain to discuss
raising the federal minimum wage. And later this week, I'll be hosting
a telephone town hall to hear from you and our neighbors on this topic
and any others that may be on your mind. More information on how to get
tickets to the President's event and how to sign-up for my town hall is
below.
Last week, I participated in a passenger rail safety hearing on Metro
North, which I've been calling for since the fatal accidents and
service delays last year.
I also spoke out against a harmful bill that would delay and weaken all
federal regulations, including those that protect consumers, save
taxpayer money, and keep our children safe. Just as it's ridiculous to
say that all regulations are good, it's also ridiculous to say that
they're all bad. Instead, I offered an alternative. You can see my
speech here:
President Obama Coming to New Britain to Promote Raising the Minimum
Wage
I'm pleased to join President Obama at Central Connecticut State
University in New Britain tomorrow to promote raising the federal
minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. Hardworking families across
Connecticut deserve a fair wage that reflects the value of their work
and that keeps pace with rising costs. No one working full time should
have to raise their family in poverty.
I'm proud to be a coauthor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which would
raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2017. This is
about fairness-Connecticut is helping lead the country on fair wages.
We in Connecticut shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing when
other states are in a race to the bottom.
Limited tickets (one per person) for the President's event will be
offered today, Tuesday, March 4, from 4 to 8 p.m. at the Detrick
Gymnasium in Kaiser Hall at 1615 Stanley St., New Britain. Doors will
open tomorrow at 11:30 AM.
Sign up for my Telephone Town Hall
On this Thursday night, I'll be holding a telephone town hall to
discuss raising the federal minimum wage, take your questions, and hear
your feedback. I'll be joined by a representative from the U.S.
Department of Labor. To make sure you're on the call, sign-up at
http://esty.house.gov/teletownhall
by tomorrow, Wednesday, March 5, at 5 pm. I'm looking
forward to hearing from you.

Hearing on Metro North
As a member of the House Transportation Committee, I've been calling
for a hearing on rail safety since Metro North's fatal accidents and
service delays last year. This past Wednesday, the committee held the
hearing. I spoke directly with top federal railroad officials to get
their commitment to work quickly with Connecticut to ensure Metro North
provides safe, reliable train service for commuters. On-time, safe rail
service is critical to our state's economy.
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out by email
or at 860-223-8412. I look forward to hearing
from you.
