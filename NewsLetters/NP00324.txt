 lifts the arbitrary cap on Medicaid grants to American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, so there is ample federal funding to cover everyone below the federal poverty level. The local Medicaid match drops to about 20 percent, compared to 45 percent now. And insular area hospitals could be compensated for the disproportionate share of uninsured and Medicaid patients served, as are hospitals in states. The local match for Medicare drug benefits would be waived and a tax paid to the U.S. Treasury by local insurers, as part of the Affordable Care Act, would go to insular governments instead. I worked with Mr. Pierluisi on details of the bill and am an original cosponsor.

Help with CUC bills for low-income families in the Northern Mariana Islands jumped 400 percent after 2013, as the result of your congressional office's lobbying of then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.
Change in LIHEAP continues to pay off
The Department of Health and Human Services released the final distribution of this year's Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds to the Commonwealth on Thursday, bringing the fiscal 2015 total to $213,354. LIHEAP helps about 400 of our low-income families pay CUC and cover other energy expenses. The grant is now four times higher than in 2013, making more families eligible and doubling the average monthly benefit. After I introduced legislation in 2011
and then actively lobbied HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to use her administrative authority, she made the decision to lift the grant
to the maximum allowed by federal law. With poverty levels in the insular areas from three to five times the national average and the price of electricity two to four times more than most Americans pay it only makes good sense to raise our LIHEAP funding. I also support increasing LIHEAP nationwide.
House increases Sexual Assault Services, Byrne JAG funding
The House passed the fiscal 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriation
this week with increases to two programs important to the Northern Mariana Islands. The Sexual Assault Services program went up 17 percent. The Commonwealth received $88,071 in 2014, after I successfully doubled our allocation in this program for the Northern Marianas in Public Law 113-4 . The CJS appropriation also raises Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, 35 percent. The 2014 grant to the Commonwealth was $228,929. In my Member's requests to the House Appropriations Committee I recommended the increased funding for both programs, which I consider especially important with the apparent increases in crime occurring in our villages.
House approves flawed fisheries bill
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is rebuilding depleted fish stocks and revitalizing our nation's fishing economy. Legislation the House passed Monday on a 225-152 party line vote, however, risks back-sliding on that progress. For instance, H.R. 1335
cuts the public out of decisions by forcing the approval of fishery management plans without the full benefit of National Environmental Policy Act analysis. I offered an alternative, along with Rep. Jared Huffman (D-California), that simply fine-tunes Magnuson by allowing electronic monitoring to lower costs for commercial fishers, making the regional management councils-like our own WESPAC-more transparent and open to the public, and increasing recognition for subsistence fishing. Our amendment was defeated for now. But I will continue working, as Magnuson moves through the legislative process, to uphold the traditional respect for life in the ocean that our own life as island people has depended upon for millennia.

Indigenous activists from Samoa banished to Saipan in 1909 will be honored with a traditional farewell ceremony by the Northern Marianas Humanities Council later this month. To add to the commemoration of these political exiles I spoke on the House floor
and placed their story in the Congressional Record . The Samoan Chiefs, above, were photographed on the German warship Jaguar departing for Saipan. (Photo: National Library of New Zealand)
