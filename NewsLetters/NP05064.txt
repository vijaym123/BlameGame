Dear Friends,
I know of no other place more beautiful than Pennsylvania, especially in autumn. To celebrate that beauty, I&#39;m hosting a fall photo contest on
Facebook ,
Twitter , and
Instagram . Submit your favorite photo with your first name, hometown, and photo location to
photos@casey.senate.gov . You may also submit your photo on Twitter or Instagram by tagging #CaseyContest and mentioning @SenBobCasey.
We&#39;ll select a few of our favorite submissions and post them to
Facebook . The photo that receives the most &#39;likes&#39; will be used as my Facebook cover photo for the rest of the year. Please submit your photos by November 2nd to be considered!
Luis from Laflin submitted this winning photo last year!
I look forward to seeing your beautiful photos!
Sincerely,
Bob Casey
Note: photos will be cropped to fit the cover photo dimensions of 851 px by 315 px
