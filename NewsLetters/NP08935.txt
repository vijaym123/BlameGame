Dear Friends:
After five long years, I am pleased to join the
American people in welcoming home Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl.
Although I am happy for Sgt. Bergdahl and his family, I am also deeply
worried about the consequences of this prisoner swap.
The White
House has established a dangerous precedent by exchanging Sergeant
Bergdahl for five senior Taliban leaders who were being held in
Guantanamo Bay. The United States has a long-standing policy of not
negotiating with terrorists, and I am deeply troubled the Obama administration
not only broke this policy, but also did so without the notification or
consent of Congress, as required by law.
The individuals
released by the Obama administration were involved at a very high
planning level, in both Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We know that two of these
prisoners had very close ties to Osama Bin Laden, and the other three
have very close ties to Mullah Omar, the current Taliban
leader.
The conditions of the prisoner swap dictate that The Taliban
Five are to remain in Qatar for a year and that the Qataris will be
responsible for monitoring them. I have no confidence whatsoever in the
capability of the government of Qatar to effectively monitor
individuals like these. There is a thirty percent recidivism rate of either
known GITMO detainees or suspected detainees who have reengaged in the
battle, and I guarantee that all five of these individuals are going to
reengage in the battle.
Theyre going to wake up every morning,
just like they used to before they were sent to GITMO, and think of
ways to kill and harm Americans.
Taliban leadership has
insisted on the release of these five individuals since the beginning of
the Bergdahl negotiations, and I was outraged to learn that the Obama
administration gave these terrorists what they wanted. These men are not
soldiers; they are dangerous terrorists and President Obama should
have treated them as such.
In addition to explaining why he
did not notify Congress of this prisoner exchange, President Obama
needs to explain to the American people why he thought he was justified in
releasing these terrorists. He needs to explain the risks associated
with transferring these individuals and why they will never face
justice for their past actions.
I sent a letter to the
President this week , calling on him to immediately declassify each
ofthe Taliban Fives 2009 assessments and let the American people know
what each of these individuals was accused of, why they were being
held at Guantanamo, and what this administration found in each of their
annual reviews. (See More

If the
American people had this information, they would agree we should not
be returning these terrorists back to the fight.
I will
continue to monitor this grave situation, and work towards declassifying
the information we have about these terrorists.
Very truly
yours,
