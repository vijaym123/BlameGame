Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
February 27, 2015
Dear Friends,
Today, I took action against the president's overreach on amnesty by
voting for a measure to reverse the president's November 2014
immigration executive actions
. The measure needed 60 votes to pass, but
unfortunately failed by a vote of 57 to 42.
I also voted to keep language in the Department of Homeland Security
funding bill that overturns the president's immigration executive
overreach. I am very disappointed the Senate voted to remove this
provision from the funding bill.
It is important that the administration does not receive a blank check
on Department of Homeland Security funding because it would allow
President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty to move forward. We need an
immigration policy that works, and we want to once again be a
government of checks and balances, not a government of executive
orders.

VA Issues
One of my first priorities as chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee is to provide health care to our veterans in the most timely
and seamless way we can, and I am going to dedicate and commit my
service as chairman to working toward that goal. Yesterday, I called on
the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve accountability and
transparency within the agency in order to best serve our nation's
veterans through the Veterans' Choice Act
.
This act was not designed to be a replacement, but it was designed to
help deal with a problem that existed in the administration of
delivering veterans' healthcare -- in appointments, in timeliness and
in proximity to specialized care that veterans often times need.
At a committee hearing held yesterday, on the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget
for Veterans' Programs, I raised serious concerns over the
administration's proposal to divert funds from critical reforms
currently being implemented to improve access to care at VA health
centers across the country.
Video of Thursday's hearing is available online here

End Modern Slavery
Even though slavery is illegal, human trafficking and modern slavery
exist in more than 165 countries, including the United States. To help
put an end to this illicit industry, the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations passed The End Modern Slavery Initiative Act of 2015,
and I hope that the Senate will act quickly to stop this
growing evil.
I was proud to co-sponsor this bill, which would establish a private,
non-profit grant-making institution, which would fund programs outside
the United States that will help recover victims, prevent trafficking,
and enforce laws to punish individual and corporate offenders of modern
slavery.?
Congressional Gold Medal to Selma Marchers
On Thursday, the Senate passed legislation to award the Congressional
Gold Medal to the participants of the 1965 civil rights march from
Selma to Montgomery, Ala
. I am pleased that Congress has taken this
step to award the participants of the march from Selma to Montgomery,
Alabama, for their brave actions, which changed our nation's history.
Fair Tax
It's time that we simplify our tax code, abolish the IRS, and create a
simpler way to pay your fair share.
In a hearing of the Finance Committee on "Tax Reform, Growth and
Efficiency" on Tuesday, I questioned officials and highlighted the
economic benefits of the Fair Tax Act of
2015
, which I co-sponsored earlier this year. This legislation would repeal
all federal individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll
taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes and gift and estate
taxes, and replace those with a personal consumption tax on all retail
sales of new goods and services that would raise the same dollar amount
of revenue that current taxes raise.
ISIL
As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I continue to
participate in discussions for the best strategy to confront the threat
posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
, or ISIL. On Wednesday, I questioned retired U.S. General
John Allen, who was appointed by President Obama to coordinate the
international coalition to counter ISIL on our military strategy to
defeat and eliminate this evil.
I believe Congress must carefully
review the president's proposal to ensure that any authorization meets
the military's needs in order to successfully fulfill its mission to
defeat ISIL.
Net Neutrality
I am disappointed in the FCC's decision to adopt, by a vote of 3-2, new
regulations that reclassify broadband Internet services as
telecommunications services subject to Title II of the Communications
Act of 1934. The decision for stricter government regulation over the
triumph of freedom and innovation that is the Internet raises serious
concerns, and Congress will be taking a look at this ruling and whether
legislative action is needed to keep the Internet open and free.?
Keystone XL Pipeline
On Tuesday, the president unfortunately followed through on his promise
to veto the Keystone XL jobs and infrastructure bill. This decision
means the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs and impedes our
opportunity for energy independence as a nation. I hope the Senate will
override this veto and send it back to him so he can rethink this
terrible decision and approve Keystone XL pipeline once and for all.
Clarke County Superintendent Named 2015 National Superintendent of the
Year
Dr. Phillip A. Lanoue, superintendent of the Clarke County School
District in Athens, Ga., was named the 2015 National Superintendent of
the Year
this week by the School Superintendents Association.
His efforts earned him a wonderful award and recognition from his
peers, and also bring honor to the administration and students of
Clarke County School District as well as to our entire state.

I

End
Modern
Slavery
Even
though
slavery
is
illegal,
human
trafficking
and
modern
slavery
exist
in
more
than
165
countries,
including
the
United
States.
To
help
put
an
end
to
this
illicit
industry,
the
Senate
Committee
on
Foreign
Relations
passed
The
End
Modern
Slavery
Initiative
Act
of
2015 ,
and
I
hope
that
the
Senate
will
act
quickly
to
stop
this
growing
evil.
I
was
proud
to
co-sponsor
this
bill,
which
would
establish
a
private,
non-profit
grant-making
institution,
which
would
fund
programs
outside
the
United
States
that
will
help
recover
victims,
prevent
trafficking,
and
enforce
laws
to
punish
individual
and
corporate
offenders
of
modern
slavery.?
Congressional
Gold
Medal
to
Selma
Marchers
On
Thursday,
the
Senate
passed
legislation
to
award
the
Congressional
Gold
Medal
to
the
participants
of
the
1965
civil
rights
march
from
Selma
to
Montgomery,
Ala .
I
am
pleased
that
Congress
has
taken
this
step
to
award
the
participants
of
the
march
from
Selma
to
Montgomery,
Alabama,
for
their
brave
actions,
which
changed
our
nation's
history.
Fair

It's
time
that
we
simplify
our
tax
code,
abolish
the

and

fair

In
a

of
the

on

I
questioned
officials
and
highlighted
the
economic
benefits
of
the
Fair
Tax
Act
of
2015 ,
which
I
co-sponsored
earlier
this

This
legislation
would
repeal
all
federal
individual
income
taxes,
corporate
income
taxes,
payroll
taxes,
self-employment
taxes,
capital
gains
taxes
and
gift
and
estate
taxes,
and
replace
those
with
a
personal
consumption
tax
on
all
retail
sales
of
new
goods
and
services
that
would
raise
the
same
dollar
amount
of
revenue
that
current
taxes
raise.
ISIL
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Committee
on
Foreign
Relations,
I
continue
to
participate
in
discussions
for
the
best
strategy
to
confront
the
threat
posed
by
the
Islamic
State
in
Iraq
and
the
Levant ,
or
ISIL.
On
Wednesday,
I
questioned
retired
U.S.
General
John
Allen,
who
was
appointed
by
President
Obama
to
coordinate
the
international
coalition
to
counter
ISIL
on
our
military
strategy
to
defeat
and
eliminate
this
evil.
I
believe
Congress
must
carefully
review
the
president's
proposal
to
ensure
that
any
authorization
meets
the
military's
needs
in
order
to
successfully
fulfill
its
mission
to
defeat
ISIL.

that
reclassify
broadband
Internet
services
as

subject
to
Title

of
the

of

The
decision
for
stricter
government
regulation
over
the
triumph
of
freedom
and
innovation
that
is
the
Internet
raises
serious
concerns,
and
Congress
will
be
taking
a
look
at
this
ruling
and
whether
legislative
action
is
needed
to
keep
the
Internet
open

Keystone
XL
Pipeline
On
Tuesday,
the
president
unfortunately
followed
through
on
his
promise
to
veto
the
Keystone
XL
jobs
and
infrastructure
bill.
This
decision
means
the
loss
of
tens
of
thousands
of
American
jobs
and
impedes
our
opportunity
for
energy
independence
as
a
nation.
I
hope
the
Senate
will
override
this
veto
and
send
it
back
to
him
so
he
can
rethink
this
terrible
decision
and
approve
Keystone

once
