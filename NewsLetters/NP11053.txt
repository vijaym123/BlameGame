Dear Friend,
Most of us, if we haven't finished filing our
taxes, are probably working on it now.
We're about to see just how
much of our hard-earned money is going into the hands of an agency
that's under investigation, and for very good reasons.
A few
days ago, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen
appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee . He just took office in December, and it was his
first time answering for the IRS targeting scandal that was uncovered
last year.
I asked Commissioner Koskinen to make
resolving this scandal and restoring the trust of the American people
his priority .
See that full exchange
here .
We've got to keep government accountable.
That's why I make it a priority to keep you informed of what's
happening in Washington and in Georgia.
I hope you'll do the same for
me by
sending me an
e-mail
any time you think there's something I should
know.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
Protecting Our Religious Freedom
The night before the Supreme Court began hearing oral
arguments in the Hobby Lobby case against the HHS contraception mandate,
Congressman Collins and his colleagues spoke on the House floor about
the real issue at stake: our right to practice our religious beliefs
regardless of what anyone else--especially a misguided healthcare
law--has to say about it.
