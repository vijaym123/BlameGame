Dear Friend,
I wanted to share with you an op-ed
that I
co-wrote with seven of my colleagues including Majority Leader Eric
Cantor and Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. Two weeks ago, we traveled to
Asia to visit with world leaders, tour U.S. military installations and
meet with our diplomatic teams in Japan, South Korea and China.
As the chairman of the State Foreign Operations Appropriations
subcommittee and the vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations
subcommittee this trip was an opportunity to discuss the U.S.
relationship with these key partners in Asia, as well as for me to
highlight Fort Worth and our local defense industry. While in Japan I
met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss the significance of the
Joint Strike Fighter and the Osprey, both of which are locally built.
North Texas plays a critical role in supporting our allies in Asia and
this trip was a chance to reinforce that message with our partners in
this vital part of the world.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress
Leading globally: Why America cannot keep the peace alone
By Eric
Cantor, Paul Ryan, Pat Meehan, Mac Thornberry, Kay Granger, Kristi
Noem, Aaron Schock, Paul Cook
(CNN) -- The United States is a Pacific power. Not only do millions of
Americans live in states that border or are firmly rooted in the
Pacific, more than 300,000 military service members and civilians who
support them are stationed throughout the Pacific.
Countless American businesses and farmers also rely on access to this
expanding market that has become an engine of global economic growth.
In addition to reflecting our values, our foreign policy must reflect
the fact that our own prosperity and security is intimately linked with
that of the Asia-Pacific.
Having just returned from this critical region, we heard directly from
senior U.S. military commanders, along with key leaders in Japan and
Korea, about the desire for bolstering alliances that have been the
cornerstone of stability in Asia. We also met senior Chinese officials
in Beijing and U.S. business leaders in Shanghai about potential
opportunities and challenges accompanying China's dramatic rise.
Asia's continued economic growth is not certain, and the region is
threatened by a despotic and volatile North Korean regime armed with
nuclear weapons. Many nations are concerned that China will use its
growing economic and military power to coerce its neighbors.
Our allies and adversaries alike have seen how America failed to
enforce its redline in Syria, and they are questioning whether we have
the resolve to respond decisively to challenges in Asia.
Our partners are watching America's response to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. They fear allowing an assault on Ukraine's territorial
integrity to stand will invite challenges to the established
international order and fuel already tense maritime territorial
disputes that threaten stability in Asia.
For decades, America has deterred threats to peace in Asia, and they
worry America lacks the commitment and capabilities to back its threats
with action.
America cannot lead in the region if it is thousands of miles away. The
indispensable symbol of American strength and leadership is the U.S.
carrier fleet. Protecting key international shipping lanes -- vital to
our own economic stability -- has long been a central mission of the
U.S. Navy. But it is a mission that requires the forward basing of
significant American naval resources, most importantly aircraft
carriers like the U.S.S. George Washington.
We were honored to board the GW at its forward port facility in Japan
and visit its crew. This aircraft carrier is due for a mid-life
overhaul, but the Administration's proposed budget doesn't include
funding for this much needed service, putting the future of the GW and
the 11-carrier fleet in jeopardy.
Our military commanders were clear about the need for the unique power
projection capabilities provided by our aircraft carrier fleet. These
commanders know our allies and adversaries alike are watching to see if
America allows its military superiority to wither, and struggle every
day to reassure their counterparts throughout the region.
America cannot keep the peace alone -- nor have we. Our allies have
welcomed American military forces on their soil for decades, allowing
the United States to project military power far from our shores and
enhancing our security here at home. We are encouraged by the desire of
these allies to contribute more to regional security, but much work is
needed to help them bolster their defenses, encourage greater
coordination among them, and reassure our allies and adversaries alike
of our enduring commitment to Asia.
The sheer economic dynamism of Asia is impressive, and more than half
of the world's population lives there. It is important for America's
economy that billions of Asian consumers are able to more easily
purchase our goods, services, and agricultural products. This is why we
support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is needed not only
to facilitate greater trade across the Pacific, but also to firmly
establish the economic rules of the road for the 21st Century. A trade
agreement based on mutually beneficial terms will promote real economic
growth and real jobs here at home.
We saw in China the stunning scope of economic growth that has lifted
millions out of poverty and bolstered our own economic fortunes. But we
were also struck by the absence of political and religious freedom in
China.
While in Shanghai, we learned of the plight of a Catholic bishop under
house arrest for refusing to be subservient to the Communist Party. And
we visited a synagogue that by government edict is only open on high
holy days, just a few times a year. We believe that with economic
freedom there should also be political freedom, and we call upon the
Chinese government to respect the universal human rights of its own
citizens.
America has a bright future in Asia, but only if we seize it.
Our trip coincided with President Obama's own visit to the region. Both
Republicans and Democrats delivered similar messages about the
importance of our alliances in Asia and our commitment to the region.
Now we must back our words with actions.
Unless the United States reinvests in its military, strengthens its
alliances, and displays strong leadership, we will see increased
threats, greater risk of instability, and economic turbulence in a
region of pivotal importance to America's future.

--
The
United
States
is
a
Pacific
power.
Not
only
do
millions
of
Americans
live
in
states
that
border
or
are
firmly
rooted
in
the
Pacific,
more
than
300,000
military
service
members
and
civilians
who
support
them
are
stationed
throughout
the
Pacific.
Countless
American
businesses
and
farmers
also
rely
on
access
to
this
expanding
market
that
has
become
an
engine
of
global
economic
growth.
In
addition
to
reflecting
our
values,
our
foreign
policy
must
reflect
the
fact
that
our
own
prosperity
and
security
is
intimately
linked
with
that
of
the
Asia-Pacific.
Having
just
returned
from
this
critical
region,
we
heard
directly
from
senior
U.S.
military
commanders,
along
with
key
leaders
in
Japan
and
Korea,
about
the
desire
for
bolstering
alliances
that
have
been
the
cornerstone
of
stability
in
Asia.
We
also
met
senior
Chinese
officials
in
Beijing
and
U.S.
business
leaders
in
Shanghai
about
potential
opportunities
and
challenges
accompanying
China's
dramatic
rise.
Asia's
continued
economic
growth
is
not
certain,
and
the
region
is
threatened
by
a
despotic
and
volatile
North
Korean
regime
armed
with
nuclear
weapons.
Many
nations
are
concerned
that
China
will
use
its
growing
economic
and
military
power
to
coerce
its
neighbors.
Our
allies
and
adversaries
alike
have
seen
how
America
failed
to
enforce
its
redline
in
Syria,
and
they
are
questioning
whether
we
have
the
resolve
to
respond
decisively
to
challenges
in
Asia.
Our
partners
are
watching
America's
response
to
Russia's
invasion
of
Ukraine.
They
fear
allowing
an
assault
on
Ukraine's
territorial
integrity
to
stand
will
invite
challenges
to
the
established
international
order
and
fuel
already
tense
maritime
territorial
disputes
that
threaten
stability
in
Asia.
For
decades,
America
has
deterred
threats
to
peace
in
Asia,
and
they
worry
America
lacks
the
commitment
and
capabilities
to
back
its
threats
with
action.
America
cannot
lead
in
the
region
if
it
is
thousands
of
miles
away.
The
indispensable
symbol
of
American
strength
and
leadership
is
the
U.S.
carrier
fleet.
Protecting
key
international
shipping
lanes
--
vital
to
our
own
economic
stability
--
has
long
been
a
central
mission
of
the
U.S.
Navy.
But
it
is
a
mission
that
requires
the
forward
basing
of
significant
American
naval
resources,
most
importantly
aircraft
carriers
like
the
U.S.S.
George
Washington.
We
were
honored
to
board
the
GW
at
its
forward
port
facility
in
Japan
and
visit
its
crew.
This
aircraft
carrier
is
due
for
a
mid-life
overhaul,
but
the
Administration's
proposed
budget
doesn't
include
funding
for
this
much
needed
service,
putting
the
future
of
the
GW
and
the
11-carrier
fleet
in
jeopardy.
Our
military
commanders
were
clear
about
the
need
for
the
unique
power
projection
capabilities
provided
by
our
aircraft
carrier
fleet.
These
commanders
know
our
allies
and
adversaries
alike
are
watching
to
see
if
America
allows
its
military
superiority
to
wither,
and
struggle
every
day
to
reassure
their
counterparts
throughout
the
region.
America
cannot
keep
the
peace
alone
--
nor
have
we.
Our
allies
have
welcomed
American
military
forces
on
their
soil
for
decades,
allowing
the
United
States
to
project
military
power
far
from
our
shores
and
enhancing
our
security
here
at
home.
We
are
encouraged
by
the
desire
of
these
allies
to
contribute
more
to
regional
security,
but
much
work
is
needed
to
help
them
bolster
their
defenses,
encourage
greater
coordination
among
them,
and
reassure
our
allies
and
adversaries
alike
of
our
enduring
commitment
to
Asia.
The
sheer
economic
dynamism
of
Asia
is
impressive,
and
more
than
half
of
the
world's
population
lives
there.
It
is
important
for
America's
economy
that
billions
of
Asian
consumers
are
able
to
more
easily
purchase
our
goods,
services,
and
agricultural
products.
This
is
why
we
support
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
(TPP),
which
is
needed
not
only
to
facilitate
greater
trade
across
the
Pacific,
but
also
to
firmly
establish
the
economic
rules
of
the
road
for
the
21st
Century.
A
trade
agreement
based
on
mutually
beneficial
terms
will
promote
real
economic
growth
and
real
jobs
here
at
home.
We
saw
in
China
the
stunning
scope
of
economic
growth
that
has
lifted
millions
out
of
poverty
and
bolstered
our
own
economic
fortunes.
But
we
were
also
struck
by
the
absence
of
political
and
religious
freedom
in
China.
While
in
Shanghai,
we
learned
of
the
plight
of
a
Catholic
bishop
under
house
arrest
for
refusing
to
be
subservient
to
the
Communist
Party.
And
we
visited
a
synagogue
that
by
government
edict
is
only
open
on
high
holy
days,
just
a
few
times
a
year.
We
believe
that
with
economic
freedom
there
should
also
be
political
freedom,
and
we
call
upon
the
Chinese
government
to
respect
the
universal
human
rights
of
its
own
citizens.
America
has
a
bright
future
in
Asia,
but
only
if
we
seize
it.
Our
trip
coincided
with
President
Obama's
own
visit
to
the
region.
Both
Republicans
and
Democrats
delivered
similar
messages
about
the
importance
of
our
alliances
in
Asia
and
our
commitment
to
the
region.
Now
we
must
back
our
words
with
actions.
Unless
the
United
States
reinvests
in
its
military,
strengthens
its
alliances,
and
displays
strong
leadership,
we
will
see
increased
threats,
greater
risk
of
instability,
and
economic
turbulence
in
a
region
of
pivotal
importance
to
America's
future.
