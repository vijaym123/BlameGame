THE 12TH DISTRICT
|
LEGISLATION
Dear
David,
Fighting for Veterans
A Year-Round
Job
This past week, I was fortunate to go to a
number of events around my district to celebrate Veterans Day, and
honor our true American heroes. Veterans put their own lives at risk to
protect the liberties and freedom we as Americans enjoy every
day.
Gus
Bilirakis discusses issues facing our nations Veterans, like timely access
to care.
Get Our
Veterans COVERed
A startling twenty-two
Veterans commit suicide every day. It is unacceptable that more American
servicemembers die from taking their own lives than on the battlefield.
This alarming fact inspired me to introduce the COVER Act, which would
examine potential benefits in incorporating complementary alternative
therapies for PTS, such as outdoor sports therapy, hyperbaric oxygen
therapy, accelerated resolution therapy, and service dog therapy. My
bill is supported by the American Legion and Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans of America (IAVA).
When it comes to mental health treatment, one size does not fit all.
While many Veterans thrive under traditional treatment, some may not
respond to this type of care. We must provide access to alternative forms
of therapies that work the best.
Overseeing the Department of Veterans
Affairs
Rep. Bilirakis listens intently to testimony from VA Deputy
Secretary Gibson
Recently signed into law, the Veterans Access, Choice, and
Accountability Act increases access to care by allowing Veterans unable to
secure an appointment at a VA facility within 30 days, or for those who
reside more than 40 miles from the nearest VA medical facility, to seek
care at a non-VA facility. It also authorizes the hiring of more
physicians and medical staff at VA facilities.
Additionally, this
important law manages corruption and misconduct by authorizing the firing
or demotion of senior executives.
It is a positive first step
in the process of ending the culture of mediocrity at the VA, and this
week,
I participated in a hearing
to assess
the VAs progress in implementing the important measures in the
Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act.
As Vice-Chairman of the Veterans Affairs
Committee, I take my work seriously.
For me, honoring and
serving our nations Veterans is not about one day out of the year
it
is a year-round job.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress
