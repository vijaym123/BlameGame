Friend,
We did it. We hit our $5,000 goal before the April deadline and had every dollar matched by our group of supporters.
I never doubted the strength and resolve of our team even when our donors called yesterday and told me we wouldn&rsquo;t make it. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.
The national Republicans have already targeted me, yet my focus remains on changing the culture in Washington.
The bitter partisan gridlock has stalled the progress we have made thus far, even though we should be working together to move our country forward.
Our country deserves better and this is why elections matter.
Thanks again for your encouragement and support.
Be well,
Ami
