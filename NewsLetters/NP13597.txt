End of Year Message from Congressman Cook
With my first year in Congress coming to a close, I want to thank you
and say it has been an honor to represent you so far in the Eighth
Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to represent my constituents in
Washington.
This past year, I've seen a lapse in government appropriations and
incredible confusion with health care. I'm frustrated by this but not
discouraged. I will continue to work with anyone, to do what's best for
the Eighth District and the nation. Despite these challenging times in
Washington, we've have made progress in number of areas from creating
jobs to veteran's services.
I'm committed to expanding our economy and creating new good paying
jobs. Every year, federal agencies issue dozens of regulations that are
estimated to cost taxpayers $100 million each. I voted in support of
the "Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013"
(REINS Act). The REINS Act prevents federal agencies from issuing these
costly, complex, and ineffective regulations by requiring approval from
Congress. I also supported the "Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform
Act," which speeds up the process of creating pipelines, just like the
Keystone Pipeline, to take advantage of America's natural gas boom.
This will create tens of thousands of American jobs, and a major boost
to the economy and will bring us closer to energy independence.
One of the most crucial steps I've taken to rein in government has been
fighting against Obamacare and for real health care reform. Real heath
care reform should save Americans money and ensure access to better
care, but Obamacare does neither. Soaring premiums and cancelled plans
have led to chaos among the tens of millions of Americans who were
promised that they could keep their existing plans. According to
California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, approximately one million
Californians are set to lose their existing health insurance under
Obamacare. That is why I've voted to repeal, delay, and defund
Obamacare, while supporting a market-based plan that would allow
uninsured Americans to buy insurance and guaranteeing that people with
insurance can actually keep it.
With over 22,000 people in the district receiving Veteran's Benefits,
I've worked to improve and protect those benefits. I've also worked to
pass the "Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization Act"
(HVRP). This legislation reauthorizes a program offering grants to
organizations that assist veterans with job training and placement. The
Government Accountability Office found that 63 percent of homeless
veterans enrolled in HVRP programs were able to find employment as a
result of this program.
I've also dedicated time to my "Prioritizing Urgent Claims for Veterans
Act," which passed out of Congress unanimously. This legislation
ensures that veterans most in need of benefits and care will not get
lost in the extensive claim backlog. There are too many veterans that
can't access the benefits they desperately need. This bill would
decrease net direct spending by $412 million over the next four years.
When sequestration threatened military tuition assistance, I
immediately cosponsored legislation to restore those benefits.
Education allows our service members to acquire the skills they need to
get good jobs when they transition to civilian life.
Last summer, as student loan interest rates doubled, I voted for the
Student Loan Certainty Act to keep interest rates low for students.
This vital bill ensures that students aren't buried by soaring interest
rates on their loans after graduation. Thanks to this bipartisan
effort, nearly 11 million college students will save an average of
$1,500 per year.
As I begin my second year as your representative, I want to continue to
focus on making government more efficient and putting Americans back to
work through job creation. I've heard from you about the importance of
properly managing our natural resources, reining in government
spending, and safeguarding veterans' benefits and I will continue
fighting for these goals. I'm committed to growing our economy and
making this great country better for our children and grandchildren.
I want to wish you and your family a happy holiday season. Please keep
our service members and their families in your thoughts and prayers as
you gather with loved ones in the coming weeks. They're serving our
nation far away from their families and in harm's way. They put their
lives on the line to protect our freedoms and for this we are
especially grateful.
My office is always open to you. If you have any questions or need help
with a federal agency, please call my district office at 760-247-1815.
My staff has worked with thousands of constituents over the past year
on issues ranging from veterans' claims to passports to Social Security
and Medicare. They are there, just as I am, to help you.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you and I look forward to
continue working for you next year!

End
of
Year
Message
from
Congressman
Cook With
my
first
year
in
Congress
coming
to
a
close,
I
want
to
thank
you
and
say
it
has
been
an
honor
to
represent
you
so
far
in
the
Eighth
Congressional
District
in
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives.
I&#8217;m
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
represent
my
constituents
in
Washington.
This
past
year,
I&#8217;ve
seen
a
lapse
in
government
appropriations
and
incredible
confusion
with
health
care.
I&#8217;m
frustrated
by
this
but
not
discouraged.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
anyone,
to
do
what&#8217;s
best
for
the
Eighth
District
and
the
nation.
Despite
these
challenging
times
in
Washington,
we&#8217;ve
have
made
progress
in
number
of
areas
from
creating
jobs
to
veteran&#8217;s
services.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
expanding
our
economy
and
creating
new
good
paying
jobs.
Every
year,
federal
agencies
issue
dozens
of
regulations
that
are
estimated
to
cost
taxpayers
$100
million
each.
I
voted
in
support
of
the
&#8220;Regulations
from
the
Executive
in
Need
of
Scrutiny
Act
of
2013&#8221;
(REINS
Act).
The
REINS
Act
prevents
federal
agencies
from
issuing
these
costly,
complex,
and
ineffective
regulations
by
requiring
approval
from
Congress.
I
also
supported
the
&#8220;Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Permitting
Reform
Act,&#8221;
which
speeds
up
the
process
of
creating
pipelines,
just
like
the
Keystone
Pipeline,
to
take
advantage
of
America&#8217;s
natural
gas
boom.
This
will
create
tens
of
thousands
of
American
jobs,
and
a
major
boost
to
the
economy
and
will
bring
us
closer
to
energy
independence.
One
of
the
most
crucial
steps
I&#8217;ve
taken
to
rein
in
government
has
been
fighting
against
Obamacare
and
for
real
health
care
reform.
Real
heath
care
reform
should
save
Americans
money
and
ensure
access
to
better
care,
but
Obamacare
does
neither.
Soaring
premiums
and
cancelled
plans
have
led
to
chaos
among
the
tens
of
millions
of
Americans
who
were
promised
that
they
could
keep
their
existing
plans.
According
to
California
Insurance
Commissioner
Dave
Jones,
approximately
one
million
Californians
are
set
to
lose
their
existing
health
insurance
under
Obamacare.
That
is
why
I&#8217;ve
voted
to
repeal,
delay,
and
defund
Obamacare,
while
supporting
a
market-based
plan
that
would
allow
uninsured
Americans
to
buy
insurance
and
guaranteeing
that
people
with
insurance
can
actually
keep
it.
With
over
22,000
people
in
the
district
receiving
Veteran&#8217;s
Benefits,
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
improve
and
protect
those
benefits.
I&#8217;ve
also
worked
to
pass
the
&#8220;Homeless
Veterans
Reintegration
Program
Reauthorization
Act&#8221;
(HVRP).
This
legislation
reauthorizes
a
program
offering
grants
to
organizations
that
assist
veterans
with
job
training
and
placement.
The
Government
Accountability
Office
found
that
63
percent
of
homeless
veterans
enrolled
in
HVRP
programs
were
able
to
find
employment
as
a
result
of
this
program.
I&#8217;ve
also
dedicated
time
to
my
&#8220;Prioritizing
Urgent
Claims
for
Veterans
Act,&#8221;
which
passed
out
of
Congress
unanimously.
This
legislation
ensures
that
veterans
most
in
need
of
benefits
and
care
will
not
get
lost
in
the
extensive
claim
backlog.
There
are
too
many
veterans
that
can&#8217;t
access
the
benefits
they
desperately
need.
This
bill
would
decrease
net
direct
spending
by
$412
million
over
the
next
four
years.
When
sequestration
threatened
military
tuition
assistance,
I
immediately
cosponsored
legislation
to
restore
those
benefits.
Education
allows
our
service
members
to
acquire
the
skills
they
need
to
get
good
jobs
when
they
transition
to
civilian
life.
Last
summer,
as
student
loan
interest
rates
doubled,
I
voted
for
the
Student
Loan
Certainty
Act
to
keep
interest
rates
low
for
students.
This
vital
bill
ensures
that
students
aren&#8217;t
buried
by
soaring
interest
rates
on
their
loans
after
graduation.
Thanks
to
this
bipartisan
effort,
nearly
11
million
college
students
will
save
an
average
of
$1,500
per
year.
As
I
begin
my
second
year
as
your
representative,
I
want
to
continue
to
focus
on
making
government
more
efficient
and
putting
Americans
back
to
work
through
job
creation.
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
you
about
the
importance
of
properly
managing
our
natural
resources,
reining
in
government
spending,
and
safeguarding
veterans&#8217;

and
I
will
continue
fighting
for
these
goals.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
growing
our
economy
and
making
this
great
country
better
for
our
children
and
grandchildren.
I
want
to
wish
you
and
your
family
a
happy
holiday
season.
Please
keep
our
service
members
and
their
families
in
your
thoughts
and
prayers
as
you
gather
with
loved
ones
in
the
coming
weeks.
They&#8217;re
serving
our
nation
far
away
from
their
families
and
in
harm&#8217;s
way.
They
put
their
lives
on
the
line
to
protect
our
freedoms
and
for
this
we
are
especially
grateful.
