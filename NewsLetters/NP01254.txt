My Letter Requesting a Hearing on Body Cameras
On Wednesday, I wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles
Grassley (R-IA) and Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey
Graham (R-SC), requesting a hearing on the use of body-worn cameras by
law enforcement officers.
I believe that the deployment of body-worn cameras will provide
increased protections for both law enforcement officers and those they
serve. I understand that there are multiple and complex questions
surrounding the use of body cameras, including privacy concerns, data
retention and disclosure issues, and the effects of recording on
community relationships.
It is essential that we explore these and
other concerns as we foster a national discussion on body-worn cameras
at a public hearing in Congress.
I am pleased that Senator Grassley and Senator Graham have agreed to
hold the hearing. I will keep you all posted with additional
information.
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
My colleagues and I unanimously voted on passage of S.178, Justice for
Victims of Trafficking bill. The bill holds traffickers accountable and
further criminalizes those who are responsible for abusing helpless and
vulnerable children. It is necessary for us to help those who are
voiceless and suffering from these horrible crimes.
I am glad the United States Senate passed this very important bill so
we can bring justice to thousands of victims across our nation.
I am
proud to support this bipartisan legislation.
Loretta Lynch Confirmation
After the passage of the human trafficking bill, we were able to vote
on the confirmation of U.S. Attorney General Nominee, Loretta Lynch,
yesterday.
Ms. Lynch has demonstrated tremendous intellect, a willingness to be a
strong federal prosecutor and a proven record of commitment to public
service, but her confirmation to be our nation's top law enforcement
officer does not exist in a vacuum.
Her views on the important issues
facing our nation, like immigration, the Affordable Care Act, and how
to best protect our homeland, mattered greatly and weighed heavily on
my decision.
At the end of the day, Ms. Lynch demonstrated that she will not be the
independent voice that our country needs at the Department of Justice,
and therefore I cannot support her confirmation to become the next
Attorney General.
Thanks again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
