After 69 Year Pursuit, Son Receives
Purple Heart Medal On Behalf Of WWII
Vet Father
August 23, 2014

Danville, VA-- One Danville man is
living proof that with hard work and
persistence you can achieve your goal, no
matter how tough it seems.
Lafayette McKinney Jr. has been on a
mission to get a Purple Heart medal for his
father, and 69 years after his father was
wounded, McKinney's mission ended this
week.
McKinney's Father, Lafayette McKinney
Senior, passed away back in 1991. Although
McKinney knew his father wouldn't
personally receive the medal, he said it's
something he just had to do to show respect
and honor to his dad that sacrificed so
much.
It was a day Lafayette McKinney Jr.
didn't think would ever come. The day his
late father, Lafayette McKinney Sr., would
be honored with a Purple Heart.
"He was denied it all the other times,"
McKinney said.
McKinney Sr. served as a combat medic in
World War II. Then after four years in the
military, one bullet ended his career.
"April 8th, 1945 he was working on
wounded soldiers and was shot in the back,"
McKinney explained.
After being released from the hospital
he returned home to Danville, and the
mission started.
"When he was discharged he made a
request about rewards and medals because
he'd been separate from his unit and he was
denied anything," McKinney said.
His father's incorrect military records
made it difficult to receive the medals
he'd earned. Eventually he was able to
cross two things off the list, a bronze
star and combat medical badge.
"But His records weren't amended at that
time," McKinney said.
That, and the fact that the National
Archives fire that destroyed millions of
military records, made McKinney Senior's
pursuit for the Purple Heart much
harder.
"He died in 1991 and I've been pursing
this ever since," McKinney said.
Finally came the light at the end of the
tunnel, after working with Congressman
Robert Hurt's office. 69 years later, the
mission is complete.
"I can't tell you how proud I am. I'm
basking in his glory. I can't imagine what
he did and went through so it's special to
me," McKinney said.
Congressman Hurt's office also had
McKinney Senior's military records fixed
and awarded him other medals.
McKinney said it was a tough feat, but
he kept going because he knew it was
something very special to his dad.
