Defunding President Obama's Executive Actions

to watch my remarks on defunding the president's executive actions on immigration
Simply put: securing the border and stopping executive amnesty is a national security priority. We must stop the Presidents damaging actions right now, before they take further root and magnify the growing constitutional crisis that we are facing.
The House passed vital funding legislation for the Department of Homeland Security today, including a number of important provisions that block President Obama's continued unconstitutional actions.
This legislation is specifically targeted to
d efund the presidents unconstitutional, executive actions on immigration in their
entirety
by eliminating all funds -- anywhere in the budget -- for implementation of the President's unauthorized actions.
This includes executive orders, memos, prosecutorial discretion, and future actions the President may take while ignoring Congress.
Additionally, it ensures no federal benefits to those covered by the President's executive amnesty and makes clear that the use of funds is legal immigration and border enforcement.
This is the action our nation needs: its what the American people want.

FOX News: House votes to overturn Obama immigration actions; bill now goes to Senate
The House voted 237-190 on legislation to fund the Homeland Security Department through the rest of the budget year to the tune of $40 billion. But as part of that legislation, Republicans approved provisions to gut the president's immigration directives.
One amendment would undo executive actions Obama announced in November that provided temporary deportation relief, and offer work permits, to some 4 million illegal immigrants. Another amendment would cancel Obama's 2012 policy that's granted work permits and stays of deportation to more than 600,000 immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as kids.
Republicans say Obama's moves amounted to an unconstitutional overreach that must be stopped.
