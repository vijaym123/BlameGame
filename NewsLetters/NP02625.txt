Throughout their entire lives, productive, hardworking Americans pay taxes on what they earn. To have to pay taxes again, on the inheritance they are leaving behind to their children, is unfair.
Thats why I cosponsored a bill ( H.R. 173 ) to repeal the death tax. Rather than trying to tax our way to prosperity, the federal government should instead focus its efforts on creating an environment that encourages job growth and returns more of the American taxpayers hard-earned money back in their pockets.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I will continue to oppose tax increases, and fight for a fairer, more straight-forward tax code. You can read more about my work on this issue
