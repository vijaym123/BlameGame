Dear Friends,
I invite you to join me for
Strong Start 2014! &ndash; Inicie Fuerte 2014! , a
FREE
informative and inspirational morning to discuss women&rsquo;s economic advancement at the Onetta Harris Community Center in Menlo Park on Saturday, January 25, 2014 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Alicia Aguirre, council member and former mayor of Redwood City, will be our special guest. You will also have access to valuable resources to help you with financial security, food and nutrition, childcare, job training programs, housing and worker rights.
Women have come a long way since the historic Seneca Falls Convention 165 years ago, the first women&rsquo;s rights convention that addressed women in social, economic and political life and resulted in the Declaration of Sentiments. But our work to achieve full equality is far from done, for example, women still only earn 77 cents for every dollar a man is paid for the same
work, or 2/3 of minimum wage workers are women, or 89 percent of the U.S. workforce does not have paid family leave through their employer. To correct such inequalities and injustices, some of my Congressional colleagues and I have developed
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds: An Economic Agenda for Women and Families . Our goals are equal pay, work and family balance and access to childcare.
