Democratic Headquarters is at full
RED ALERT
As of YESTERDAY, the White House sees impeachment as a serious threat:
Let&rsquo;s be clear: impeachment is COMPLETELY without merit. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Boehner&rsquo;s Tea Party Republicans won&rsquo;t do it. REPUBLICANS WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO DESTROY BARACK OBAMA&rsquo;S PRESIDENCY We simply can&rsquo;t let this happen without a fight. The vote to sue Obama on the House floor is coming up THIS WEEK.
If we want to fight back, we HAVE to get to the $2,OOO,OOO mark this weekend.
