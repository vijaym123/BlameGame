Upcoming Hearing
June 9, 2014
Last week Members of Congress and the public were made aware of the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from terrorist captivity. As has been the case whenever one of our own comes home safely to us, we all rejoice. I am relieved that the Bergdahl familys ordeal has come to a happy conclusion.
With that being said, we as the elected representatives of the people have a responsibility to our constituents and our troops still in harms way in Afghanistan to get to the bottom of this deal with the Taliban.
I am particularly troubled by the release of five senior Taliban leaders, men with the blood of many on their hands, and the implications for our deployed forces. I am no less concerned that the Administration broke a national security law, passed with bipartisan support and signed by the President, in transferring these detainees.
To begin the process of getting answers for the American people, I have invited Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to testify on Wednesday, June 11 th . The subject of this hearing will be the May 31, 2014 transfer of five senior Taliban detainees.
In the meantime, I invite you to read the summary and bill language of Section 1035 from the FY14 NDAA, which is the section that was violated by the Administration:
