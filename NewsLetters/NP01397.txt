David --
We&rsquo;ve heard it from Republican after Republican -- from Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s shrugs to Ted Cruz&rsquo;s outright denials:
And it always leads to the same place:
Republicans refuse to take action on climate change.
They&rsquo;re single-handedly holding up progress on addressing the biggest threat to our planet. It&rsquo;s embarrassing -- and it couldn&rsquo;t be more irresponsible.
This Earth Day, will you join Democrats to tell the GOP to stop denying climate change?
It&rsquo;s no wonder so many Republicans refuse to acknowledge climate change. Where would they be without the Big Oil polluters who fund their campaigns?
But with enough pressure from voters, we can overcome even the Koch brothers -- and we can get Republicans to drop their dangerous and unscientific position.
Will you add your name to tell the GOP you&rsquo;re not buying their denials?
