Dear
Friend,
Just minutes ago, I was sworn in to the
114th Congress to start my third term in the House of Representatives. I
want to thank you for the faith and trust you have placed in me as we
continue the work of building an America that works for all citizens.
This year we face a variety of challenges that we must address to
ensure the strength and equality of our great nation.
These
challenges include renewing the Voting Rights Act so that all citizens
voices are heard in the political process regardless of their racial and
ethnic backgrounds. Anyone who believes in the fundamental right to
vote for all Americans must support efforts to advance this bill and
join the conversation about how to protect voters from the real threats
they are facing right now. Inaction is not an option. Silence is not
an option. Every day that Congress fails to live up to its
constitutional obligation to protect every Americans right to vote gives a free
pass to those who would deny that right.
Increasing the
minimum wage to allow every hard working American the ability to provide
for their family and give a much needed boost to our economy is long
overdue. No one who works hard every day and plays by the rules should
live in poverty, but today a single mother with two children who works
full-time and earns the minimum wage lives below the poverty line.
Raising the minimum wage would help both workers and the overall economy
generating $22 billion in increased economic activity and creating
85,000 additional jobs.
Revamping our criminal justice
system to keep our streets safe while we redirect wasted money and stop
wasting lives must also be addressed. Our prisons are overcrowded and
they impose significant costs to you, the taxpayer. We should make smart
reforms that will reduce the number of individuals in our prison
system while at the same time encouraging inmates to acquire skills to join
the 21st century labor force upon their release.
Reforming
our broken immigration system so that we can strengthen our economy
and secure our borders will also be a priority. I think we can all
agree that our current immigration system is untenable.
Over a year
ago, the Senate passed a comprehensive, bipartisan solution, but we
have only seen delay after delay in the House. Because House Republicans
have refused to act, the President laid out his plans to address one
of the biggest economic and humanitarian issues of our time. The
Executive actions by the President are welcome but they are not a complete
solution and do not excuse the House from addressing this
issue.
As we begin work in this new Congress I want to ensure that the
closing of the Pledge of Allegiance rings true to everyone who calls
the United States home. That we are one nation, under God, indivisible
with liberty and JUSTICE FOR ALL!
