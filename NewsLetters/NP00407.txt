Friend,
Are we going to make it? Our donors are asking if we have what it takes to hit our goal.
Everyone at Team Bera believes we can hit our $5,000 goal before midnight tomorrow, but we can&rsquo;t waste anymore time.
Will you chip in $5, $25, or whatever you can and have your impact doubled?

Our resolve and strength as a team has been battle tested in one of the closest and most expensive Congressional races in the country
and we know what we can accomplish when we set our minds to something.
We can do this but time is not on our side&mdash; help us reach our goal by
pitching in $5 or more before midnight tomorrow and have your contribution doubled.
Only $2,178 to go.
Thanks again,
Team Bera
P.S. The team is already working long hours and weekends to prepare for 2016 and if you could pitch in a couple dollars today that would be a huge help!
