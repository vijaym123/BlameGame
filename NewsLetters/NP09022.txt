Dear
friends,
As drivers of employment, innovation, and growth, small businesses
are the foundational pillar of our nations economy.
As such, I
proudly support South Floridas small businesses and those throughout
the United States.
The U.S. Census Bureau recently reported that
small businesses represent 97 percent of employers in the United
States
highlighting just one of the myriad ways these businesses drive
our economic growth while also employing hardworking individuals in the
United States.
Unfortunately, however, Obamacare and a
host of other unnecessary regulations prevent small businesses from
realizing their fullest potential; often, these regulations
disproportionately harm small business.
The Small Business Administration
a U.S. government agency
details the inequitable distribution of
regulatory costs: small businesses pay 36 percent more in regulatory
costs and 67 percent more to comply with tax codes than do large
firms.
Obamacare alone increased 91 percent of small businesses
healthcare costs, with one in four small firms reporting cost increases of at
least 20 percent.
These regulations are unfair to
American small businesses.
We should not punish the sector that has
provided 65 percent of new jobs over the past 17 years, pioneered
critical innovation by way of patents, and helped the United States climb
out of the Great Recession of 2008.
As we work to recover from
the recent economic downturn, a nimble private sector is becoming more
and more necessary to our overall financial well-being.
The
threat of unnecessary regulation is detrimental to the future of both my
hometown and the global community.
South Floridas economy is
dynamic and forward-looking
I hope we can reach a compromise that
rewards those who have done so much to better these United
States.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
