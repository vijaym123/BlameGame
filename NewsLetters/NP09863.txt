Dear Friend,
This week, I joined several colleagues to introduce H.R. 4574, the
Strengthening Mental Health in Our Communities Act of 2014
. This legislation renews our
commitment to improving the lives of individuals and families impacted
by mental illness, and it makes comprehensive improvements to our
mental health system. Our legislation increases support for
community-based services, expands research, and advances innovative
treatments into mental health. This effort marks an important
opportunity to advance the conversation on mental health, and I am
proud to work to strengthen this system.
The Affordable Care Act is working
House Republicans' latest attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) came
up short this week. On Wednesday, the Energy and Commerce's
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations - on which I serve as
Ranking Member - heard directly from the nation's largest health
insurance companies on the status of the ACA.
House Republicans intended to highlight their deliberately misleading
questionnaire to insurance companies to make it appear that people who
have signed up for health insurance are not paying their premiums. In
my opening statement, I debunked their analysis and made it clear why
it skewed the ACA's performance - which is stronger than people have
been lead to believe.
Despite these political attacks, the Affordable Care Act is working and
making a real difference for people in Colorado and across the country.
A recent poll conducted by Gallup shows that in the last six months,
the number of adults without insurance has dropped by about 20%. Thanks
to the Affordable Care Act, there are more than 11 million Americans
and nearly 130,000 Coloradoans with insurance today than 6 months ago.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has once again said that
the Affordable Care Act has slowed inflation, saved billions of
dollars, and even reduces the deficit.
It is my belief that we should have a meaningful conversation about how
this law is functioning -- and then work together to identify and fix
the flaws. That will make a real difference in people's lives in
Colorado and across the nation.
As always, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up-to-date on the latest news from Washington and in Colorado. Also,
you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can read
my positions on issues and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While you're there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about
what matters most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to share
this email with your friends, family, and neighbors so that they too
can be a part of this important dialogue.
Sincerely,
Diana DeGette

Contact Dear

This

I
joined
several

the

House
