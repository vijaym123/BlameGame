Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Tuesday, there was a great showing of community support at four different locations around the district as I unveiled a mock check representing the taxpayer savings from my office this year. Over the past three years that I have had the privilege of representing Central Florida in Congress, I have cut waste and returned significant portions of the money appropriated to run my office. For too long, Washington has allowed the flawed principle of if its appropriated
spend it, to influence the way that the federal government operates. This practice rewards waste instead of rooting it out.
This year, I was able to cut nearly $400,000.00 of waste from my office expenses, bringing the grand total of taxpayer savings from the last three years to over $1,250,000.00.

Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to deliver the keynote address for the Lake-Sumter Metropolitan Planning Organizations annual Horizon Awards dinner. It was great to see so many local leaders who were recognized for their commitment to building the economy and benefitting the community by providing transportation projects and support.
Transportation is the bedrock of our economy, and I was also privileged to deliver the opening remarks at TEAMFLs board meeting last Friday morning as they explored ways to benefit the economy through public-private transportation partnerships.

On Thursday morning, I spoke at the We Are Golf breakfast and discussed the economic impact that the golf industry has on the state of Florida. The Professional Golfers Association has held their annual trade show at the Orange County Convention Center for the last 30 years, and I was glad to welcome them to Central Florida. You can see a portion of
my interview on the Golf Channel here .

Constituent Corner:
A few months ago, a constituent from Astatula contacted my office after receiving news that their veteran benefits were significantly lowered. As we worked with the constituent and Lake County Veteran Service Office, it was discovered that the constituent had failed to notify the VA that they had moved into an assisted living facility. We obtained the necessary documentation regarding this change, and submitted it. Last month, my office received notification that the constituent would receive the correct monthly amount, as well as a substantial check for the benefits that they should have received.

Legislative Update:
Two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that funded the 2014 fiscal year. Completion of this legislation clears the way for the House of Representatives to return to the process of regular order, where 12 separate spending bills can be considered one at a time, thoroughly debated during Committee hearings, amended by the Members of Congress, and then voted on by the full House and Senate. The House and Senate would then work out their differences in a conference committee before the final version is voted on and sent to the President. Although Washington has strayed from this process in recent years, they now have no excuse not to return to regular order and avoid the dysfunction that has gripped Washington.
On my recent interview with Channel 13, I discussed regular order and the benefits and stability it can provide. You can
