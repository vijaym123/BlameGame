NEWS FROM WASHINGTON
The Christmas Season is a reminder to give thanks for all the blessings in our lives, both big and small. As we celebrate with friends and family this month, let us remember to observe the true meaning of Christmas, as well as pray for the safety of our brave troops serving overseas. Their selflessness and sacrifice allow the rest of us to observe our holidays in peace. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude. From my family to yours, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
In the spirit of the season, I've recorded a special message. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to serve your family this year. Click
