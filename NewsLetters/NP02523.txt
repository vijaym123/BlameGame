Statement on
President Obama's Keystone Pipeline
Veto
2/24/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following statement in
response to President Obama's veto of the Keystone Pipeline
project.
President Obama has wasted a
golden opportunity to create economic growth and to provide greater
energy security by vetoing the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Rather than accept the will of a bipartisan majority in Congress, the
President has thrown away 42,000 jobs and over $3 billion of GDP growth.
Because of President Obamas desire to placate extreme, left-wing
environmentalists, he is ruining an easy opportunity to put millions of
Americans to work and show that he cares about expanding economic
opportunity for all Americans.
