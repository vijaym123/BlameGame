Dear Friends,
In the wake of a
troubling Department of Veterans Affairs audit that revealed lengthy wait
lists at VA hospitals across the country, I'm taking action in the U.S.
House of Representatives to help our veterans receive timely
care.
On Tuesday, I voted yes to pass bipartisan emergency
legislation to allow veterans facing long wait times to receive paid-for
health care at non-VA facilities. H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care
Act, passed the House 426-0.
The Veterans Access to Care Act
would require the VA to allow a veteran to receive care at non-VA
facilities at the departments expense if the veteran cannot get an
appointment within the VAs wait time goals or if the veteran lives more
than 40 miles from a VA medical facility. This provision would expire two
years after the bills enactment.
It would also ban all
bonuses for VA employees from fiscal years 2014 to 2016 and require an
independent assessment of the Veterans Health Administrations
performance.
No veteran should be waiting months for a first
appointment with the VA, and yet thousands are on waiting lists in West
Virginia and across the nation. Veterans need alternatives to waiting for
care from the VA, and I have long supported allowing veterans to
access care closer to home. This legislation will give veterans the ability
to go elsewhere for care at the VAs expense, and I hope the VA will
take swift action to restore veterans trust in its hospitals and
care.
I am troubled by the delays in care highlighted in the VA
audit, particularly at the VA hospital in Clarksburg. I will continue
to work with our VA hospitals to identify the reasons for these
backlogs and how we can help ensure that all veterans are receiving the
care they need and deserve in a timely fashion.
WEST VIRGINIA VFW
CONFERENCE
On Friday, I
had the opportunity to address the West Virginia Veterans of Foreign
Wars annual conference in Huntington, where I spoke about the VA's
ongoing issues and what I'm doing in Congress to help our veterans. I want
to thank the VFW for inviting me to attend and giving me the
opportunity to meet so many brave West Virginians.
WOMEN'S HEART
HEALTH
On Wednesday, I introduced a bipartisan resolution
promoting women's heart health. Women lead busy lives juggling their
responsibilities to their families and jobs, and taking care of their heart
health is often not a priority.
Heart disease kills
more women than all forms of cancer combined, and younger women are
dying at an increased rate from cardiovascular disease. But heart disease
does not have to be inevitable
women of all ages should discuss
their risk factors for heart disease with their physicians.
My
resolution recognizes the risks of cardiovascular disease and
promotes preventative heart screenings for women. Awareness efforts like this
resolution help to ensure that more women will be educated about the
dangers of heart disease, will make time to care for their health, and
will take preventative steps to protect their hearts and
lives.
I spoke on the House floor Wednesday in support of my resolution
and encouraged all women to talk to their doctors about their heart
health.

BOYS STATE AND GIRLS
STATE
Hundreds of motivated,
hardworking high school students from across West Virginia are learning
about leadership and public service at the American Legion Mountaineer
Boys State in Weston and Rhododendron Girls State in Wheeling. I spoke to
students at both Boys State and Girls State in the past week and am
so inspired by their desire to improve their communities and serve
their state. I wish them all the best as they pursue their
dreams!
Thank you
