In Video Statements, Rubio Welcomes
House Passage Of Venezuela Sanctions
Bill
On Wednesday, Marco welcomed passage by
the U.S. House of Representatives of
S.
2142, The Venezuela Human Rights and
Defense of Civil Society Act , which
would apply targeted visas and financial
sanctions against individuals who have
participated in acts of violence or human
rights abuses against peaceful
demonstrators in Venezuela. Having also
passed in the Senate on Monday evening, the
bill now awaits the Presidents
signature to become law.
Marco issued the following
video
statement :
With these sanctions, we can
end the days of Venezuelan regime
officials and thugs repressing innocent
Venezuelans in their day jobs and then
coming to Florida to live in the lap of
luxury and splurge Venezuelas
wealth. This is the first step to address
human rights violations in Venezuela, and
it will be a blow to the hypocrites in
Nicols Maduros regime who
talk a lot about socialist sacrifice but
who themselves are immune from its
failures and live in a fantasy world of
gold-plated iPads and fancy cars, even
though most Venezuelans cant even
find basic necessities like food and
toilet paper.
Although passing this sanctions
legislation is important, its only
the first step in our work supporting the
human rights and democratic aspirations
of the Venezuelan people. As
Venezuelas economy and society
further deteriorates under the weight of
an incompetent, unaccountable and
repressive government, failed socialist
economic system and dropping oil prices,
I believe we are going to see even more
repression from Maduros
regime.

ICYMI: Miami Herald: Rubio Welcomes
End Of Baseless U.S. Department Of
Education Investigation Into Florida
Bright Futures Scholarship
On Thursday, Marco welcomed the end of
the U.S. Department of Educations
baseless investigation into Floridas
Bright Futures Scholarship. He weighed in
on the issue in an article for
The Miami Herald
. An excerpt of the article is
below:
Florida did not violate
anti-discrimination laws by using
standardized test scores to award Bright
Futures scholarships, the U.S. Department
of Education has found.
The departments Office for
Civil Rights had been investigating the
Bright Futures program, which awards
college scholarships based on grade point
average and SAT or ACT scores. The probe
was based on allegations that the
eligibility criteria had the effect of
discriminating against Hispanic and
African-American students.
But federal authorities found
insufficient evidence of a legal
violation and concluded the
investigation Wednesday, according to a
memo addressed to Florida Education
Commissioner Pam Stewart and obtained by
the Herald/Times.
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida
Republican who opposed the probe, said he
was glad federal authorities had ended
the baseless
investigation.
The Bright Futures program has
helped thousands of Floridas top
students finance their college educations
and given them the foundation for
successful careers, Rubio said in
a statement.

ICYMI: Rubio: Congress Must Enable The
President To Stop The Islamic State
On Friday, Marco weighed in on the
importance of enabling the president to
defeat the Islamic State (IS) in
an op-ed
for
The Washington Post
.
An excerpt of the piece is
below:
It is clear that our efforts to defeat
the Islamic State have been inadequate.
Half-measures will not work against a
growing threat from radical Islamists
that are uniting fractured terrorist
groups around the world under one
banner.
Over the past six months, as the Obama
administration has continued to develop
its strategy for defeating the group, our
enemies have not been standing still. The
Islamic State now reaches from North
Africa through the Middle East, Pakistan
and South Asia and into Southeast Asia.
Libya, with its absence of government
control and its vast stocks of weapons,
has become a particularly deadly
terrorist haven that is allowing the
Islamic State to broaden its map, gain
strength and plot attacks against Europe
and the United States.
This week, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee debated an
authorization to use military force
against the Islamic State. But instead of
giving the president what he needs to win
this struggle, many in the Senate seem
more focused on telling him what he
should not do. They argue that we need to
place conditions on the types of force
that can be used or impose a timeline by
which victory must be achieved.
Yet the threat is growing by the day.
Beyond the Americans who have already
been brutally slaughtered at its
members hands, the Islamic State
is actively developing its ability to
target civilians in lone
wolf attacks in Europe and the
United States. Its continued spread
across the Middle East is alarming. It is
imperative that the United States and our
European and Arab partners join together
to stop this threat before it advances
farther.

Rubio Delivers Remarks Honoring
Floridas Pearl Harbor Veterans
On Monday, Marco
delivered
remarks
on the floor of the U.S. Senate
to commemorate the 73
rd
anniversary of the attack on
Pearl Harbor. Monday marked the 73
rd
anniversary of the U.S.
entering World War II.
According to official estimates, there
are approximately 140 Pearl Harbor veterans
currently residing in Florida. Marco
highlighted three of these Pearl Harbor
veterans and their stories. An excerpt of
the speech is below:
Yesterday, at events all around
Florida and across the country, America
marked the 73rd anniversary of the attack
on Pearl Harbor
a day known for
its tragedy, but also for its role in
shaping the destiny of what has come to
be called The Greatest Generation.
Its a generation that faced
challenges unlike any seen before or
since. It saw a decade of widespread
prosperity crumble into the deepest
depression in American history, and it
saw the deepest depression in American
history give way to the deadliest war in
human history.
The scope of hardship, destruction,
and wickedness they faced was exceeded
only by the strength and valor with which
they responded. Theirs is a generation
that truly saved the world. I dont
think any other generation at any time
can have that said of them with the same
bluntness.
Today that generation passes its
stories on to us. They are our parents
and our grandparents; our ancestors and
our heritage. Their stories are emblems
of strength that inspire us as we meet
our challenges in this new century.
