Divert field, NMI National Guard, pay raise, sexual assault all part of new defense law - On Thursday, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2014, which contains important provisions specific to the Northern Mariana Islands. $29.3 million will be available for a divert airfield in the NMI to use if Guams Andersen Air Force Base is closed by weather or war. But I also worked with the House Armed Services Committee to place limits on the money because of the question of siting: Tinian or Saipan? I think we decided long ago that Tinian is the preferred location for military expansion in our islands, but the Air Force has other ideas. So, at my request the Committee report directs the Air Force to work with the Governor to find a mutually agreeable resolution to this siting issue; and the law bars any expenditure of the $29.3 million until Congress gets a look at all the alternatives that have been considered.
The NDAA also gives the Defense Department 180 days to report to Congress on the feasibility of a Northern Marianas National Guard, just like Guam and all of the other states and territories, except American Samoa, have. We have 16 of our people deployed with the Guam National Guard
and returning safely home soon. So, clearly, there is an interest. But do we have enough people for a full Guard unit? Do we have the needed infrastructure? Will our local legislature support establishing a Northern Marianas National Guard? These are the questions the report will answer. I introduced legislation in 2011 to set up an NMI unit. If the feasibility study comes back positive, we could push towards that goal. We should know by June 25.
Besides these Northern Marianas specific provisions the annual defense authorization makes some other changes worth noting: Our military personnel will be getting a 1 percent raise. And the new law addresses the issue of sexual assault in the military, which is a problem that seems to be increasing and puts anyone in the armed service
men and women, including our people from the Northern Marianas
at risk. The new law bars commanders from overturning jury convictions in assault cases; and it mandates dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted
all steps in the right direction.
