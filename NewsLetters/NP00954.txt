Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
Honoring Colonel Powell
I had a wonderful evening Thursday at a dinner honoring Colonel Charles Powell. Col. Powell and his wife, Joanne, are close friends and it was a joy to be there to celebrate as he was named a Texas Southwest Council Distinguished Citizen. Col. Powell's life of service and sacrifice exemplifies the type of citizens we need to emulate and the citizen we all ought to aspire to be. Congratulations and happy birthday to an extraordinary man.
Remembering Victory in Europe Day
We live in a time that is unparalleled to any in history. We live in a world built upon sacrifices that should never be taken for granted, yet today, it is taken for granted. Our commitment to freedom and justice cannot last without further sacrifices, and I fear that on this May 8th, new and dangerous threats are mounting. It is my hope that this next generation will learn the lessons of the Greatest Generation and that when challenges rear their ugly head, we won't shrink back but instead surge forward to meet them. This all starts with remembering.
Town Hall Meetings this Week
Thanks to everyone who came out to the five town hall meetings this week. I really enjoyed getting to hear about the issues that are most important to the constituents of the 11th district. Here are a few pictures from this week's town hall meetings:

I really enjoyed my visit to Midland High School Monday. I got to talk with some of the members of the baseball team, and they presented me with a baseball jersey and cap to wear in this year's Congressional Baseball Game. I'm looking forward to representing Midland ISD at this year's game!

Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
