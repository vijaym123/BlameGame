Carper's Connection
January 17, 2015
Dear Friends,
It seems like nearly every day we learn of another major data breach or
cyber-attack - from Target and Sony Pictures to the U.S. Postal Service
and the White House. The severity of these cyber intrusions can range
from a minor inconvenience to serious damage. While some bad actors are
looking to target our pocketbooks and bank accounts, others are
targeting our critical infrastructure and looking to do physical harm.
In response to this growing threat, President Obama this week rolled
out a series of initiatives to boost our cybersecurity and consumer
protection in the digital age. His Cybersecurity Legislative Proposal
includes:
*	Enabling Cybersecurity Information Sharing
*	Modernizing Law Enforcement Authorities to Combat Cyber Crime
*	National Data Breach Reporting
The president's proposal calls for better communication and
coordination between the government and the private sector. This
process, called information-sharing, ensures that businesses and other
organizations large and small can quickly get help in preventing cyber
attacks and data breaches and protecting consumers when an attack or
breach does happen.
The president's proposal is a step in the right direction in developing
a 21st century response to this 21st century threat. It also serves as
an important call to action for Congress to act on cyber security and
data breach legislation.
Last Congress, I was proud to work with my colleagues
across the aisle, and in both houses of Congress, to pass four
cybersecurity bills into law
. These bills, which passed through the Committee
on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs under my chairmanship,
take important steps toward building a readied response against the
evolving cyber threats we face today. But we have a lot more work to
do.
I will soon be re-introducing a bipartisan bill I have long championed
to create a national standard for data breach prevention and
notification. I will also continue to work with colleagues on
legislation that seeks to improve the sharing of cybersecurity
information between government and industry. Both of these efforts are
critical steps in our effort to better protect our nation's citizens
and businesses, and I pledge to do all I can to get both bills to the
president's desk in this Congress.
I always enjoy having the opportunity to share my thoughts with
Delawareans - but more important, I appreciate hearing the thoughts of
Delawareans like you. As always, I welcome hearing your views on these
issues, or any other, through email or by contacting me on Twitter
