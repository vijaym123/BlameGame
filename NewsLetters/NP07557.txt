It&rsquo;s Saturday, and we&rsquo;re in the office freaking out.
Can you blame us after what's happened in the last couple days? THURSDAY:
House Republicans authorized a vote to sue a sitting president: it&rsquo;s never happened in U.S. HISTORY. YESTERDAY:
The White House announced they believe this lawsuit could lead to impeachment. TODAY:
We&rsquo;re in the middle of an unprecedented attack on the President. We&rsquo;re doing all we can -- but we can&rsquo;t afford to cut corners. We have to fight back with everything we&rsquo;ve got.
That means we need to reach $2,OOO,OOO by tomorrow night ($432,616 to go). We just can&rsquo;t see that happening unless you chip in.
Can you take just a minute out of your Saturday to have the President's back?
