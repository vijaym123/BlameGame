Dear Friend,
I voted on Thursday to create a select committee to investigate the
September 11, 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi. Had the Obama
administration told the truth about Benghazi, there wouldn't be a need
for this select committee. But the President and his team decided to
lie about the cause of the attack. They decided to blame America first
and give a pass to the terrorists.
Hillary Clinton infamously dismissed the deaths of four brave Americans
killed in a terrorist attack by hysterically yelling 'what difference
does it make.' It makes a big difference. Why didn't we have
intelligence about the attack? Why was the diplomatic mission so
lightly guarded in such a dangerous area? Why did the President and
Mrs. Clinton refuse to call for military back up? Why did they create a
lie about an Internet video instead of just telling the truth? Why did
they lie to Congress about responding to a subpoena? The American
public deserves the truth. The truth, Mrs. Clinton, always matters.
The fact that the White House was forced to release the smoking-gun
emails to a watchdog group after Congress has been requesting these
documents for nearly two years makes me wonder what else they're
hiding. The administration's unwillingness to tell the truth about the
events that occurred before, during and after that tragic night is
completely unacceptable. The American people and the families of the
four heroes who died in Benghazi deserve no less than the whole truth,
and it is my hope that this select committee will, at last, provide it.

Holding Lois Lerner and the IRS Accountable
As an employee of the federal government, Lois Lerner took an oath to
support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Her behavior,
however, was directly contradictory to the Constitution. As a former
public servant, Mrs. Lerner has an obligation to give the American
people answers as to why their government chose to target specific
groups based on their political ideologies. The House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee, on which I serve, subpoenaed Mrs. Lerner
to provide those answers, but she refused to comply by asserting her
right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment. However, before
pleading the Fifth, she declared her innocence, thereby waiving her
right to remain silent. She has since continued her refusal to testify,
which is why I voted
on Wednesday to hold her in contempt of Congress.
To watch a clip of my speech on the floor of the House prior to this
vote, click HERE
or below.
Americans have understandably lost confidence in the federal government
due to the slew of President Obama's scandals, including the IRS
targeting scandal. In order to restore their confidence, the government
must vigorously investigate these abuses and hold the responsible
individuals accountable. To date, no one has been held accountable for
the targeting of conservative organizations by the IRS. To remedy that
sad fact, I also voted on Wednesday to demand that Attorney General
Eric Holder appoint a special prosecutor to lead this investigation so
that there will be a singular focus on uncovering the truth and
prosecuting the perpetrators.
Attempting to silence and intimidate any group for their political
beliefs is contrary to the freedoms of speech and assembly guaranteed
by the First Amendment to the Constitution. There is no question that
the IRS targeted conservative groups in an attempt to stifle their
political activities. The only remaining questions are who instigated
the targeting, whether the White House was involved, who should be
fired and who should go to jail. To read more, click HERE

No First Class Travel Using Taxpayer Funds
Yesterday, I, along with three of my colleagues, introduced the If Our
Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act (H.R. 4632),
which would prohibit members of Congress from flying first class using
taxpayer funds. This bill is a continuation of my efforts to eliminate
waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. It's a very simple
bill. All it does is prohibit members of Congress from using taxpayer
funds to purchase first class airfare. At a time of massive deficits
and with a national debt in excess of $17 trillion, members of Congress
should not be using taxpayers' hard-earned money to buy luxury airline
seats. If members of our military can't fly first class using taxpayer
funds, neither should members of Congress. Click HERE

Creating Certainty and Fostering Job Creation
The United States tax code is broken and overly complex. In 1913, when
the tax code was first created, it was 400 pages long. The current tax
code now exceeds 70,000 pages and is a bureaucratic nightmare that
punishes job creators, stifles economic growth and discourages
investment.
The United States already has the highest corporate tax rate in the
world and allowing important pieces of the tax code, like the research
and development tax credit, to expire on a regular basis creates
further uncertainty. Businesses are left to make long-term plans around
short-term laws, which discourages American innovation and prevents
small businesses and job creators from hiring new employees and
investing in their companies. I voted for a bill on Friday that will
finally make the research and development tax credit permanent, giving
businesses the certainty they need to expand their operations and
create much-needed jobs. Click HERE

Reforming the VA
I wrote an op-ed for The Arizona Republic that outlines recent efforts
I led to bring much-needed reforms to the Veterans Administration.
Recent revelations about the Phoenix VA made it clear that we must
introduce transparency and accountability into this massive bureaucracy
so that our veterans, who served this country with honor and bravery,
receive the health care they've earned. Click HERE

Government Waste of the Week
$150 per gallon: the price that the Department of Defense paid for jet
fuel made from algae in an attempt to be "green." That's more than 64
times the price of regular fuel.

Dear
Friend,
I
voted
on
Thursday
to
create
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
September
11,
2012
terrorist
attacks
in
Benghazi.
Had
the
Obama
administration
told
the
truth
about
Benghazi,
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
this
select
committee.
But
the
President
and
his
team
decided
to
lie
about
the
cause
of
the
attack.
They
decided
to
blame
America
first
and
give
a
pass
to
the
terrorists.
Hillary
Clinton
infamously
dismissed
the
deaths
of
four
brave
Americans
killed
in
a
terrorist
attack
by
hysterically
yelling
'what
difference
does
it
make.'
It
makes
a
big
difference.
Why
didn&#8217;t
we
have
intelligence
about
the
attack?
Why
was
the
diplomatic
mission
so
lightly
guarded
in
such
a
dangerous
area?
Why
did
the
President
and
Mrs.
Clinton
refuse
to
call
for
military
back
up?
Why
did
they
create
a
lie
about
an
Internet
video
instead
of
just
telling
the
truth?
Why
did
they
lie
to
Congress
about
responding
to
a
subpoena?
The
American
public
deserves
the
truth. The
truth,
Mrs.
Clinton,
always
matters.
The
fact
that
the
White
House
was
forced
to
release
the
smoking-gun
emails
to
a
watchdog
group
after
Congress
has
been
requesting
these
documents
for
nearly
two
years
makes
me
wonder
what
else
they're
hiding.
The
administration's
unwillingness
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
events
that
occurred
before,
during
and
after
that
tragic
night
is
completely
unacceptable.
The
American
people
and
the
families
of
the
four
heroes
who
died
in
Benghazi
deserve
no
less
than
the
whole
truth,
and
it
is
my
hope
that
this
select
committee
will,
at
last,
provide
it.

Holding
Lois
Lerner
and
the
IRS
Accountable
As
an
employee
of
the
federal
government,
Lois
Lerner
took
an
oath
to
support
and
defend
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States.
Her
behavior,
however,
was
directly
contradictory
to
the
Constitution.
As
a
former
public
servant,
Mrs.
Lerner
has
an
obligation
to
give
the
American
people
answers
as
to
why
their
government
chose
to
target
specific
groups
based
on
their
political
ideologies.
The
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee,
on
which
I
serve,
subpoenaed
Mrs.
Lerner
to
provide
those
answers,
but
she
refused
to
comply
by
asserting
her
right
to
remain
silent
under
the
Fifth
Amendment.
However,
before
pleading
the
Fifth,
she
declared
her
innocence,
thereby
waiving
her
right
to
remain
silent.
She
has
since
continued
her
refusal
to
testify,
which
is
why
I
voted
on
Wednesday
to
hold
her
in
contempt
of
Congress.
To

a
clip
of
my
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
House
prior
to
this
vote,
click

or

Americans
have
understandably
lost
confidence
in
the
federal
government
due
to
the
slew
of
President
Obama's
scandals,
including
the
IRS
targeting
scandal.
In
order
to
restore
their
confidence,
the
government
must
vigorously
investigate
these
abuses
and
hold
the
responsible
individuals
accountable.
To
date,
no
one
has
been
held
accountable
for
the
targeting
of
conservative
organizations
by
the
IRS.
To
remedy
that
sad
fact,
I
also
voted
on
Wednesday to
demand
that
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
to
lead
this
investigation
so
that
there
will
be
a
singular
focus
on
uncovering
the
truth
and
prosecuting
the
perpetrators.
Attempting
to
silence
and
intimidate
any

for
their
political

is
contrary
to
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
assembly
guaranteed
by
the
First

to
the
Constitution.
There
is
no
question
that
the
IRS
targeted
conservative
groups
in
an
attempt
to
stifle
their
political
activities.
The
only
remaining
questions
are
who
instigated
the
targeting,
whether
the
White
House
was
involved,
who
should
be
fired
and
who
should
go
to
jail.

No
First
Class
Travel
Using
Taxpayer
Funds
Yesterday,
I,
along
with
three
of
my
colleagues,
introduced
the
If
Our
Military
Has
to
Fly
Coach
Then
so
Should
Congress
Act
(H.R.
4632),
which
would
prohibit
members
of
Congress
from
flying
first
class
using
taxpayer
funds.
This
bill
is
a
continuation
of
my
efforts
to
eliminate
waste,
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
federal
government.
It's
a
very
simple
bill.
All
it
does
is
prohibit
members
of
Congress
from
using
taxpayer
funds
to
purchase
first
class
airfare.
At
a
time
of
massive
deficits
and
with
a
national
debt
in
excess
of
$17
trillion,
members
of
Congress
should
not
be
using
taxpayers'
hard-earned
money
to
buy
luxury
airline
seats.
If
members
of
our
military
can't
fly
first
class
using
taxpayer
funds,
neither
should
members
of
Congress.

Creating
Certainty
and
Fostering
Job
Creation
The
United
States
tax
code
is
broken
and
overly
complex.
In
1913,
when
the
tax
code
was
first
created,
it
was
400
pages
long.
The
current
tax
code
now
exceeds
70,000
pages
and
is
a
bureaucratic
nightmare
that
punishes
job
creators,
stifles
economic
growth
and
discourages
investment.
The
United
States
already
has
the
highest
corporate
tax
rate
in
the
world
and
allowing
important
pieces
of
the
tax
code,
like
the
research
and
development
tax
credit,
to
expire
on
a
regular
basis
creates
further
uncertainty.
Businesses
are
left
to
make
long-term
plans
around
short-term
laws,
which
discourages
American
innovation
and
prevents
small
businesses
and
job
creators
from
hiring
new
employees
and
investing
in
their
companies. I
voted
for
a
bill
on
Friday
that
will
finally
make
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
permanent,
giving
businesses
the
certainty
they
need
to
expand
their
operations
and
create
much-needed
