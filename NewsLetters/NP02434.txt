Wicker Troubled by
Absence of U.S. Leadership
as Global
Threats Multiply
Under Obama's Watch, 2014 Was Most
Lethal
Year on Record for
Terrorism
Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper has summed up today's global threats this way:
"Unpredictable instability is the new normal."
In an assessment
to the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 26, he noted that
last year there were more deaths from state-sponsored mass killings,
more people displaced from their homes, and a higher rate of political
instability than we have seen in decades.
It was the most lethal
year for global terrorism since 1970, when the data was first
compiled.
Such a state of affairs is a
searing indictment of President Obama's foreign policy team, which has
presided over six years in which America has become decidedly less
safe and less secure.
Moreover, the Administration seems blind to
these harsh realities.
Secretary of State John Kerry recently
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that "we are actually living in
a period of less daily threat to Americans and to people in the world
than normally; less deaths, less violent deaths today, than through
the last century."
Apparently, Director Clapper and Secretary
Kerry did not get the same memo.
Lessons of a Failed
'Reset'
It is clear that the
Obama Administration's record of foreign policy missteps has
diminished the projection of U.S. strength and power.
On pressing
national security issues, the President has naively believed the hollow
promises of adversaries and wrongly impaired the support of allies.
Nowhere is this more evident than
the Administrations attempt to "reset" relations with Russia six
years ago.
President Vladimir Putin has made a mockery of U.S.
capitulations, boldly increasing his aggression and blatantly ignoring the
rule of law and basic human rights.
His acts of defiance
include the invasion and annexation of part of Ukraine, support for the
brutal regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and the development of
missiles banned by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty.
Curbing Iran's Nuclear
Aims
With little time to forge his legacy, President Obama is
again attempting to make a deal with an unreliable nation.
The
goal of ongoing multilateral negotiations is to prevent Iran from
acquiring a nuclear weapon, but concerns have already been raised that the
Administration might be too generous in its concessions, allowing the
volatile nation to fulfill its nuclear aims.
A bad deal would severely jeopardize security in
the region and could spell disaster for Israel, which remains one of
Americas closest allies.
I am hopeful that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will reiterate these serious implications during
his address to a joint session of Congress on March 3.
Given the long-standing relationship
between Israel and the United States, it is unfortunate that Mr.
Netanyahu's upcoming speech has garnered such indignation from the
Administration, which went so far as to call it "destructive" to bilateral
relations.
The security of all Israelis remains crucial to U.S.
interests and to the entire region, especially considering that Iranian
leaders have suggested that the state of Israel should be
"eliminated."
Supporting Israel's
Security
Prime Minister Netanyahu deserves the opportunity to
outline his concerns to lawmakers about Iran and escalating Islamic
extremism.
Despite veto threats from President Obama, Congress
continues to discuss whether Iran should face tougher sanctions if an
agreement that limits its nuclear capabilities is not reached by the
March deadline.
Members are also deeply involved in developing a
strategy to defeat the barbaric Islamic State, which has launched a
campaign of terror across the Middle East.
Why shouldn't America hear
about these urgent issues from a trusted friend in the
region?
An honest look at today's threats and
the need for U.S. leadership are critically important to global
security and stability at this pivotal time.
Director Clapper was frank
in his testimony that addressing current challenges would not be
easy, noting that "pervasive uncertainty makes it all the harder to
predict the future."
But America can succeed, if we demonstrate the
fortitude and resolve necessary to defend freedom and to stop those who
threaten it.
