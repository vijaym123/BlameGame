Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was a busy week back in Washington with several pieces of good news
in efforts my office has taken to protect Kentuckians from the harmful
effects if the Obama Administration's over regulation. I appreciate the
opportunity to update you on my efforts to promote a more productive
economic environment.
IRS Heeds My Call to Protect Volunteer Firefighters From Misguided
Obamacare Provision
On Wednesday, I spoke on the House floor
about
how just that morning, despite a windchill of negative 5 degrees,
firefighters in Anderson County, Kentucky, rushed to the aid of fellow
citizens to battle a barn fire that was threatening to spread to a
nearby home. As their equipment and even the water froze in the extreme
temperatures, these brave firefighters courageously took shifts to
protect their community.
It is not unusual for these heroic men and women to routinely perform
acts of bravery. It is also not unusual for them to hold pancake
breakfasts or chili dinners simply to raise enough money to pay their
electricity bills.
These volunteer companies were concerned about being forced to provide
coverage under Obamacare's costly employer mandate, which Anderson
County Fire Chief Mike Barnes warned could force them to lay off
heroic, life-saving personnel and leave communities like Lawrenceburg,
Kentucky, in Anderson County, without adequate fire protection.
The IRS Listened to Us!
Thankfully on Friday, we finally received word from the IRS that they
heeded my call to protect volunteer firefighters from this misguided
Obamacare provision!
I welcome Friday's long-awaited announcement from the IRS that
emergency services volunteers will not forced to be counted as
full-time employees under the Obamacare employer mandate.
I will continue my fight to hold this Administration accountable in all
areas of government. I am pleased that we were able to protect our
volunteer firefighters from yet another misguided provision of
Obamacare that would have had serious implications for Kentucky
communities.

Empowering Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma
Last year, I met with many constituent groups, including one
representing survivors of military sexual trauma who shared their
stories and concerns that the support and care provided by VA
healthcare system does not always match their specific needs.
In response, I have introduced the H.R. 3775, the Military Sexual
Assault Victims Empowerment Act, also known as the Military SAVE Act,
which would empower survivors of military sexual trauma to select their
own care providers. I look forward to discussing the legislation I
introduced tomorrow at a non-partisan event in Frankfort.

would allow military sexual trauma victims to select providers"

Securing Full Payment for Kentucky Farmers
This week, we received great news that the USDA will honor its
commitment to Kentucky's tobacco growers and provide the full amount of
their final tobacco payment.
After learning of the proposed cuts and speaking with several farmers
in the Sixth District, I took action to reverse the proposed 7.2
percent reduction of the final payments announced by the USDA scheduled
for January 2014. I joined a bipartisan group of Representatives on a
letter addressed to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Sylvia Burwell
expressing opposition to the proposed cuts
. Following our initial letter, I stayed in close contact with
both the USDA and OMB over the holidays reminding them of the
importance and timeliness of this decision and urging them reinstate
full payments to tobacco growers.
On Monday, the USDA responded to my office stating that full payments
will be made available to tobacco growers and the sequester cuts would
no longer be applied.
This news was well received by farmers across Kentucky, prompting the
following statement from Mark Haney, President of Kentucky Farm Bureau:
"On behalf of our organization and the many tobacco farmers in the
Commonwealth, I would like to thank Senator Mitch McConnell and
Congressman Andy Barr for their steadfast support in Washington, D.C.,
to encourage this course of action. The entire Kentucky delegation's
investment of time and communication with leadership from the Office of
Management and Budget and the USDA has proven successful, and our
member families that were relying on a full payment can now return to
focusing on their fields instead of their finances."
I will continue to advocate on behalf of Kentucky's signature
industries and for farmers across the district in Washington, DC.
Working to Create a Better Environment for Job Creation
There are dozens of jobs bills that have already passed the House and
are collecting dust in the Democratic-run Senate. These include the
SKILLS Act I supported, which would help long-term unemployed get
training often needed to re-enter the workforce, and the REINS Act,
which is a critical tool in the battle against job-destroying
overregulation.
As the Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel reported
Thursday, "The Republican House in fact passed more than 200 bills in
2013. Some were minor, and others drew only GOP votes. But nearly a
dozen were bipartisan pieces of legislation that drew more than 250
Republicans and Democrats to tackle pressing issues" including jobs
bills, patent reform, prioritizing funding for pediatric research, and
streamlining regulations for pipelines.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

Thank you and have a great week!

After
learning
of

and
speaking
with
several

in
the
Sixth

I
took
action
to
reverse
the
proposed
7.2
percent
reduction
of
the
final
payments
announced
by
the
USDA
scheduled
for
January
2014.
I
joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
Representatives
on
a
letter
addressed
to
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
and
the
Director
of
the
Office

Sylvia
Burwell
expressing
opposition
to
the
proposed
cuts .
Following
our
initial
letter,
I
stayed
in
close
contact
with
both
the
USDA
and
OMB
over
the
holidays
reminding
them
of
the
importance
and
timeliness
of
this

and
urging
them
reinstate

On
Monday,
the

responded

my
office
stating
that
full
payments
will
be
made
available
to
tobacco
growers
and
the
sequester
cuts
would
no
longer
be
applied.
This
news
was
well
received
by
farmers
across
Kentucky,
prompting
the
following
statement
from
Mark
Haney,
President
of
Kentucky
Farm
Bureau:
&#8220;On
behalf
of
our
organization
and
the
many
tobacco
farmers
in
the
Commonwealth,
I
would
like
to
thank
Senator
Mitch
McConnell
and
Congressman
Andy
Barr
for
their
steadfast
support
in
Washington,
D.C.,
to
encourage
this
course
of
action.
The
entire
Kentucky
delegation&#8217;s
investment
of
time
and
communication
with
leadership
from
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
and
the
USDA
has
proven
successful,
and
our
member
families
that
were
relying
on
a
full
payment
can
now
return
to
focusing
on
their
fields
instead
of
their
finances.&#8221;
I
will
continue
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
Kentucky&#8217;s
signature
industries
and
for
farmers
across
the
district
in
Washington,
DC.
