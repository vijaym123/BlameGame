7th DISTRICT
May 09, 2014
Dear
Friends:
It was another busy week. Starting Monday in the District, I
hosted a meeting with key Orange and Seminole County leaders to help
establish local and federal priorities for the balance of the year. On
the horizon, we are working to expand I-4 beyond the current 21-mile
project, use technology to better move traffic on our congested local
roads and corridors and keep the Baldwin Park VA Clinic and medical
facility open and serving our
veterans.
In Washington, the agenda was equally busy with floor action
relating to the creation of a Select Committee on the 2012 terrorist
attacks in Benghazi and dealing with the Lois Lerner matter concerning
the IRSs targeting of Conservative groups. I also participated in a
hearing in the House Oversight Committee concerning the culture of
personnel mismanagement and the tremendous waste, fraud and abuse at the
EPA and chaired a hearing on recent legislation by the DC Government to
decriminalize marijuana and the mixed signals the Administration
sending Americans and law enforcement on this
issue.
