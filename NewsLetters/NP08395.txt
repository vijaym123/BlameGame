VISITING DC
June 27, 2014
Tuesday, I joined my Senate colleagues and members from the
House to discuss legislation which would address the deeply rooted
problems at VA. It is now time for us, in partnership with VA, to begin to
repair the damage that has resulted from the systemic failures that
have undermined the trust veterans had placed in VA. Most importantly,
we must ensure that veterans get the appointments they need from the
doctor of their choice, provide the transparency needed to do an
apples-to-apples comparison with non-VA hospitals, and start reforming the
system and changing the culture to ensure no veteran ever again dies
while waiting for the care they needed. Click below or visit

Youtube: Senator
Burr's Opening Remarks during the Veterans' Affairs
Conference
Senator Coburn released a new report on the VA that is
incredibly informative and adds to the narrative that some of us in the Senate
have been voicing for years -- there are widespread, systemic
failures that plague the Department of Veterans Affairs health care
system.
The culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management
and accountability is simply reprehensible.
I urge you to take
the time to read this report
you can find it
here .
This week, I
joined Senator King in releasing to the public a discussion draft that
would reform federal student loan repayment programs. Graduates today
face a maze of federal student loan repayment programs from which to
choose that often leave students confused about which programs best
fits their needs. Furthermore, through years of ad hoc changes and
expansions outside of Congressional authorization, little has been done to
ensure taxpayers are likewise best served. The King/Burr Discussion
Draft addresses these issues by consolidating many of the benefits of
current repayment programs into a single simplified income-based
repayment option.
Senator King and I are introducing this
discussion draft instead of legislation so we can receive feedback from the
public
student borrowers, our Congressional colleagues, experts in the
field, or anyone else who can bring to the table thoughtful
discussion on how to best help our students.
I understand how daunting it
can be to finish school and face the uncertainty of unemployment, on
top of the anxiety of how to repay student loans.
It is my hope
that we will receive robust feedback in the coming months to better
this draft and inform Congress as we begin Higher Education Act
reauthorization efforts.

During the past couple of weeks, more information about the IRS scandal has
come to light, including the missing emails from Lois Lerner and
the targeting of a United States Senator by the IRS.
I
joined the rest of the Finance Committee Republicans in writing several
letters this week to Attorney General Eric Holder, Treasury Secretary
Jack Lew, and Federal Election Commission (FEC) Commissioner Lee E.
Goodman.
We wrote [a]s Republican members of the Finance
Committee, we are determined to get to the bottom of what happened at the
IRS and why it happened.
To date, the Committees investigation
has largely consisted of evaluating information provided by the
IRS.
Unfortunately, following the IRS recent pattern of misleading the
Committee and failing to provide accurate and timely information, we
now need to look outside of the IRS.
You can read the
letter to Department of Justice
here , the letter to
Treasury
here , and the letter to FEC is
here .
Finally, this week I joined HELP Committee
Senators Harkin, Alexander, and Casey in a letter to the CDC pressing
them for details about possible anthrax exposure at a CDC lab.
In our letter we expressed serious concerns and questions with respect
to the protocols and procedures that were followed at the biosafety
labs and were also concerned that the Committee, which oversees the
CDC and biomedical research, was not informed promptly of the incident.
You can read the full text of the letter
here.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
