-- the election is 7 days away
-- Republicans are spending $8 million to defeat Brad -- and every piece of data shows his race deadlocked with Bob Dold
David, Brad has been a mentor and friend to me since we first got down to Washington. He's an example of the very best in public service -- someone who puts the people back home first and doesn't let partisanship get in the way of progress.
I refuse to see someone like Brad fall to GOP special interests because we didn&rsquo;t do enough when we had the chance. So I&rsquo;m asking: Will you join me in supporting Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign for Illinois? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
These are the final 7 days of the election. Make them count.
Stand with Brad so he can keep standing up for us in Washington. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Chip-In
