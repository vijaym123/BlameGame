Dear Friend,
It is
my honor to serve and represent the vibrant and diverse business
community of the Fifth Congressional District. In recent days, I have met
with so many owners and employees of companies that serve multiple
sectors. I spent time meeting with over six dozen local and regional
manufacturing companies at the first annual Southern Colorado Manufacturing
Expo. I visited the cutting edge development and testing center for
global bicycle manufacturer SRAM. I received a tour from the team at
Colorado Springs Utilities to see firsthand the progress being made on
the monumental Southern Delivery System water delivery engineering
project. From aerospace to the Hollywood film industry, and everything in
between, we are the home to so many amazing companies that provide
jobs to tens of thousands and vital products to people all over the
world.
I will continue to
support our local businesses with my votes in Washington by supporting
lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations. That's why the National
Association of Manufacturers has given my voting record for this
session of Congress a 97% rating. The more we are able to unleash the full
economic potential of our local businesses, the healthier our local
economy and job market will
be.
It is a privilege to serve you in our nation's
capital.
Please let me know if you
require any assistance with a federal government agency by contacting
my local office at (719) 520-0055.
Sincerely,
Policy Recap
This week, I joined 353 of my fellow Members of Congress in
sending a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry expressing serious
concern about Irans refusal to fully cooperate with the International
Atomic Energy
Agency.
Text of the
Letter
Dear Mr.
Secretary:
As the United States prepares for the
resumption of negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran to achieve a
comprehensive nuclear agreement, we remain deeply concerned with Irans refusal
to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
As you know, the IAEA has sought information on the potential
military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program, in particular
information about Irans extensive research and development of a nuclear
explosive device.
For several years,
the IAEA has attempted to work with Iran to resolve this central
issue, but Tehran has refused.
Last November, the IAEA and Iran
concluded a Framework for Cooperation in which Iran agreed to work with
the IAEA, including by providing satisfactory information in response
to IAEA inquiries within mutually agreed deadlines.
Nevertheless,
in its September 5, 2014 report, the IAEA stated that Iran had failed
to meet its latest deadline, even as it continued to demolish
structures and construct others at the Parchin military base, where
clandestine nuclear-related activities have reportedly taken
place.
We believe that Irans willingness to
fully reveal all aspects of its nuclear program is a fundamental test of
Irans intention to uphold a comprehensive agreement.
As you
wrote in the Washington Post earlier this summer, if Irans nuclear
program is truly peaceful, its not a hard proposition to prove. The only
reasonable conclusion for its stonewalling of international
investigators is that Tehran does indeed have much to
hide.
We are concerned that an agreement that accepts
Irans lack of transparency on this key issue would set the dangerous
precedent that certain facilities and aspects of Irans nuclear program
can be declared off limits by Tehran, resulting in additional
wide-ranging restrictions on IAEA inspectors, and making effective
verification virtually impossible.
A
resolution of this issue is also essential to establishing a baseline
regarding the status of the Iranian nuclear program.
Accurate
predictions of the period of time needed by Iran to assemble a weapon and
assessments of Irans compliance cannot be made without highly reliable
information obtained from an unrestricted inspection and verification
regime.
Such a baseline is also critical to developing more
precise estimates on the time it would take Iran to develop a nuclear
weapons capability without detection.
We would like to achieve a negotiated solution to the Iranian
nuclear crisis.
As negotiations resume, we urge you to carefully
monitor Irans cooperation with the IAEAs inquiry.
As you have
written, there is a discrepancybetween Irans professed intent with
respect to its nuclear program and the actual content of that program to
date.
We agree with your assessment that these issues cannot
be dismissed; they must be addressed by the Iranians if a
comprehensive solution is to be reached.
An agreement that effectively
prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability demands
transparency on the extensive research and development work that Iran has
undertaken in the past.
Recently, House Speaker John Boehner released a
letter he has sent to VA Secretary Bob McDonald calling for action on
an independent audit of the VA healthcare system. I commend Speaker
Boehner for reaching out directly to the VA Secretary on behalf of the
strong VA reform legislation that I supported last month. Sadly, the
trust between veterans and the VA has been placed in serious jeopardy.
Thats why it is so critical to have an independent audit of our VA
healthcare system. This audit is required by law and the VA needs to stop
delaying in implementing this important step. We cannot make progress
toward real VA reform without
it.
Text of the Speaker's
Letter
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Veterans across the country deserve access to timely, quality
health care. Transforming the Department of Veterans Affairs from an
outdated government bureaucracy to a 21st Century model of service and
responsiveness is essential to achieving that goal. With this objective in
mind, I write to express my support for the independent assessment
required under the legislation that recently passed both the House and
Senate, and to emphasize the importance of providing veterans with an
evaluation that is both effective and truly
independent.
As I and other House leaders told
President Obama in a letter earlier this year, the VA is a system that needs
to be fundamentally transformed in order to meet its mandate of service
and care to our nations veterans. I am encouraged the president has
chosen as the new VA secretary a strong leader with decades of
experience in the private sector, which is necessary to oversee the kind of
dramatic change that is needed and long
overdue.
As I know you are aware, the Veterans Access,
Choice, and Accountability Act (H.R. 3230) requires an independent
assessment of the health care delivery systems and management processes at
the VA. This top-to-bottom audit requires you to enter into a contract
with one or more entities to examine every aspect of hospital care and
medical services provided by the VA. The audit is a critical component
of the new law and will help identify long-term reforms to improve
the quality and access to care for our
veterans.
The intent of the independent assessment is to gain
valuable feedback that can be used to help transform the VA into an
effective, 21st Century model of service. Accordingly, it is critical
that the review rely not on traditional government consultants, but on
private sector entities with experience in the successful delivery of
modern, quality health care.
Including private sector health care entities who may
collectively benchmark their health systems with the VA will help identify
variances between the strengths and weaknesses of the existing systems.
The entities should, of course, be recognized leaders of excellence in
quality and timely health care
delivery.
Congress acted to provide the VA with additional resources
and the authority to hold senior officials accountable in the wake of
the VA scandal.
But passage of this law is just the beginning.
The independent assessment is a step toward fully understanding the
systemic problems and ultimately transforming the VA from top to bottom
and into the system veterans deserve.
It must be conducted by
individuals who are both truly independent of the existing system and
versed in the knowledge of how effective, modern health care delivery
systems are run.
I look
forward to your response as we work to improve the care and services our
veterans deserve.
Sincerely,
John
Boehner
Speaker
What's Happening in the Fifth Congressional
District
VETERANS
ISSUES
It was an honor and a privilege to take part in the official opening
of the new VA Clinic in Colorado Springs. This expanded facility will
provide care to thousands more veterans in the Pikes Peak region.
Thank you to everyone who made this event and facility possible. It is a
small way that we can repay what we owe to our brave
veterans.
With expanded staff, square
footage, and options for care, this new Super Clinic will help cut back on
the trips Southern Colorado veterans have to make to Denver for
medical care. The clinic telephone number will remain the same at (719)
327-5660 or (800) 278-3883 to schedule appointments or to inquire about
your medical needs.
Please contact the Veterans Crisis
Hotline if you are having thoughts of harming yourself at (800) 273-8255.
The hotline is available 24 hours, 7 days a week.
The
following services will be offered in the new clinic: MRI, CT, ultrasound,
and x-ray services as well as the Veterans Benefits Administration
(VBA) will be located on the first floor. Optometry, Audiology,
Pharmacy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Laboratory, Compensation
and Pension, CWT, Homeless, and the Pre and Post-Surgical Clinic will
also be located on the first floor. Primary Care services, OEF/OIF,
wound care, and MOVE classroom will be located on the second floor.
Dental, Mental Health, and Substance Abuse Clinics will be located on the
third floor.
Colorado Springs Transit will provide a bus stop
on Centennial Blvd. For more information please view details at
www.coloradosprings.gov
or call (719)
385-7433.

It was a pleasure visiting the local Chapter 1
of The Retried Enlisted Association to give an update on the latest
from Congress. Thanks to the attendees for the great questions and
dialogue.
Thank you to Carlos Urias, Director of Military Services, and the
whole team at Cedar Springs Hospital for sitting down with me for a
comprehensive discussion on the PTSD issues we are facing locally.
Cedar Springs is a powerful community resource, please visit
www.cedarspringsbhs.com
for more
information.
While its only right
for the brave whistleblowers who have experienced retaliation in
Phoenix and around the country to have these injustices corrected, that
alone will not encourage others to come forward when necessary or deter
managemen t from retaliating in the future. If the VA
truly takes whistleblower complaints seriously and will not tolerate
retaliation and veteran trust is to be rebuilt, those responsible for
retaliation must be held accountable. In the Phoenix case, the VA has
failed to show veterans that theyve held anyone accountable. Ill
continue to work with my colleagues on the House VA Committee to ensure
those responsible are held accountable, not rewarded for their
actions.
SUPPORTING LOCAL
BUSINESSES
I attended the opening day of the inaugural
Southern Colorado Manufacturing Expo. Presented by Ent Business Banking in
association with Colorado Business Bank, Action Machines, Century Link
Business, and Mazak, the expo is a showcase designed to bring the local
manufacturing community together to demonstrate the products and
goods manufactured throughout the region
from aerospace, to electronics,
to food and beverage, to lifestyle, to bioscience, and to industrial
and consumer items.
It
was wonderful to meet with the owners and employees of over six dozens
manufacturing businesses here in Southern Colorado and the Pikes Peak
region. This new expo will be a fantastic way to highlight our robust
local manufacturing sector. From 3-D printing to large scale
machining, and everything in between, our community is home to almost every
kind of manufacturing imaginable. I will continue to work hard in
Congress to support business friendly policies designed to make things easier
for American
manufacturing.

TOURING THE SOUTHERN DELIVERY
SYSTEM
Thank you to Colorado Springs
Utilities CEO Jerry Forte and his team for the comprehensive tour updating me
on the progress of the Southern Delivery
System.
OBAMACARE
One year ago, Obamacare enrollment
started and thats when the lies started to be revealed. We were promised
for years that if we liked our healthcare plan we would be able to keep
it, that was not true. The entire healthcare network of America was
unraveled and disrupted to serve two percent of the population. That
simply should not have happened. Thats why my colleagues and I have
voted, and will continue to vote, to repeal and replace Obamacare with
solutions oriented to serve small businesses and the free market
economy, such as H.R. 3121, the American Healthcare Reform Act. Healthcare
decisions should be made by you and your doctor, not by faceless
bureaucrats in Washington DC.
FIGHTING
EBOLA
The Secretary of Defense
announced that approximately 160 engineers from Fort Carson will be
deploying in late October to Africa in support of U.S. efforts to help
contain the Ebola virus.
The engineer companys primary mission will
consist of constructing Ebola treatment units that will house
patients and healthcare providers as they combat this serious global threat
that can only be contained through a combined international effort. All
of us in Colorado Springs are proud of these men and women in uniform
who will be helping those in need in Africa. As these servicemembers
step forward once again to answer our nations call, please keep them
in your thoughts and prayers for a safe
return.
OFFICE
MEETINGS
I hosted three informative meetings in my local
office. First up was the team from the Alzheimer's Association of
Colorado. Next was Dr. John Cook and the team at Indigenous Ministries. They
currently have an ongoing relief project to help the Christian
refugees in Iraq. Finally, I met with Roz Duman and Alan Farb from the
Colorado Coalition for Genocide Awareness and Action. Thank you to each of
these organizations for taking the time to inform me on their
important efforts.

implementation:
Leonard Johnson
- With the
possibility of Ebola spreading, it's going to be real interesting
here in the near future to see which one does better, my private
insurance or the ones waiting in line for help that will never
come.

The Obummer Care plan is a straight violation of our basic rights,
but I guess that doesn't matter to some...
Carol Lamb

NOTHING is more
important than our health. Without it, we can't work or can't do much
else for that matter. NOT everyone can be on unemployment benefits!
The working class pays, and pays, and pays, and pays. This is ONE
reason we need to KEEP our ESTABLISHED
freedoms.
