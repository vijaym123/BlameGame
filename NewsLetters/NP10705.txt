Duluth to D.C., We Work to Improve Minnesota's Airports
Dear Friend,
Our parents and grandparents demonstrated great vision in building
airports to serve and help northern Minnesota grow, and I'm determined
to pay that vision forward to coming generations.
To that end, last week I was honored to help step up efforts to secure
a $30 million expansion for the second runway at Duluth International
Airport by escorting Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner
Solon, representatives of the 148th Fighter Wing, the Minnesota
National Guard, the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans, and the
Duluth Chamber of Commerce to meetings with top officials from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Pentagon.
The expansion is necessary to accommodate Minnesota's National Guard in
Duluth, as well as commercial and private activity, while the airport
undergoes greater renovations. After those meetings, I'm very
optimistic we can get this done.
Meanwhile, the House was passing a Republican budget that would cut
funding for regional airports in Hibbing, Brainerd, International
Falls, Bemidji, Grand Rapids, and several other Minnesota cities.
How incredibly short sighted and destructive that would be!
Along with Duluth International, our regional airports generate
good-paying jobs for middle-class families by making northern Minnesota
accessible to tourists, business, and commerce from across our nation
and around the world. That's why I've worked so hard to improve runways
and enhance safety for travelers, workers, and communities.
I hope you will take time to watch this short news clip about our
meetings at the FAA and the Pentagon:
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
_____
Ryan Budget Attacks Jobs, Medicare, Middle Class
Last week, the House Majority passed the Ryan Budget - an attack on the
middle class that puts Medicare, jobs, and our economic recovery in
jeopardy in order to give huge tax breaks for millionaires and giant
corporations that ship American jobs overseas. It's time for a budget
that acknowledges the true foundations of our nation's freedom,
opportunity, and prosperity - acknowledging that our generation owes
its success to past generations' investments in education,
transportation, health, science, and basic research. We must not be
afraid to invest in our great nation and its people. Click here
or on the image above to watch
what I told my colleagues on the Floor of the House the day before the
budget passed.

K-College, Range Goes High-Tech
There's simply no better investment we can make than to provide our
students with every high-tech advantage to prepare them for the jobs of
the future. So I'm delighted to announce that schools on Minnesota's
Iron Range will soon receive state-of-the-art video teleconferencing
rooms and video equipment for two community colleges and twelve K-12
schools throughout the Arrowhead Region.
The goal of this project, made possible through a $300,000 U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Rural Development grant, is to create a
network of classrooms from kindergarten to college to share information
and learning, immersing students of all ages in video technology and
introducing them to a wider range of topics. Read our press release

Serving Our Troops With Honor (And Dinner)
Pausing for a photo with the good members of the Serving Our Troops
organization (and my grandson, Mitchell, in the front), last week.
I was so proud to pledge my support for the Serving Our Troops
organization, a group of dedicated Twin Cities restaurants, business
and non-profit owners, retired police, firefighters, and community
members who cook and serve delectable steak dinners for our active
military and National Guard, to welcome them home from abroad or to
send them off with a full belly.
Serving Our Troops has served more than 75,000 steaks since its
founding ten years ago, and this expression of love and gratitude by
those here at home for the men and women who protect us abroad is truly
overwhelming. Grasping the difficulty and the importance of what they
are willing to sacrifice - and throwing them a dinner in their honor -
is the least we can do to show our gratitude and appreciation for the
men and women whom we send into harm's way.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Duluth
to
D.C.,
We
Work
to
Improve
Minnesota's
Airports
Dear
Friend,
Our
parents
and
grandparents
demonstrated
great
vision
in
building
airports
to
serve
and
help
northern
Minnesota
grow,
and
I&#8217;m
determined
to
pay
that
vision
forward
to
coming
generations.
To
that
end,
last
week
I
was
honored
to
help
step
up
efforts to
secure
a
$30
million
expansion
for
the
second
runway
at
Duluth
International
Airport
by
escorting
Minnesota
Lieutenant
Governor
Yvonne
Prettner
Solon,
representatives
of
the
148th
Fighter
Wing,
the
Minnesota
National
Guard,
the
Minnesota
Assistance
Council
for
Veterans,
and
the
Duluth
Chamber
of
Commerce
to
meetings
with
top
officials
from
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
and
the
Pentagon.
The
expansion
is
necessary
to
accommodate
Minnesota's
National
Guard
in
Duluth ,
as
well
as
commercial
and
private
activity,
while
the
airport
undergoes
greater
renovations.
After
those
meetings,
I&#8217;m
very
optimistic
we
can
get
this
done.
Meanwhile,
the
House
was
passing
a
Republican
budget
that
would
cut
funding
for
regional
airports
in
Hibbing,
Brainerd,
International
Falls,
Bemidji,
Grand
Rapids,
and
several
other
Minnesota
cities.
How
incredibly
short
sighted
and
destructive
that
would
be!
Along
with
Duluth
International,
our
regional
airports
generate
good-paying
jobs
for
middle-class
families
by
making
northern
Minnesota
accessible
to
tourists,
business,
and
commerce
from
across
our
nation
and
around
the
world.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
worked
so
hard
to
improve
runways
and
enhance
safety
for
travelers,
workers,
and
communities.
I
hope
you
will
take
time
to
watch
this
short
news
clip
about
our
meetings
at
the
FAA
and
the
Pentagon:
Have
a
great
week.
Sincerely,
Ryan
Budget
Attacks
Jobs,

Middle

Last

the

our
economic
recovery
in

in

to
give
huge
tax
breaks
for
millionaires
and
giant
corporations
that
ship
American
jobs
overseas.
It's
time
for
a

that
acknowledges
the
true

of
our
