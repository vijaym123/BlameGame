Dear Friend,
June is Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Month, a time to raise public
awareness of PTSD and its effective treatments so that everyone can help
those affected by PTSD.
PTSD is an anxiety disorder
resulting from exposure to a single traumatic event or multiple traumatic
events.
For members and veterans of our Armed Forces, that
traumatic event can often include sustaining a
traumatic
brain injury (TBI ).
The vice chief of staff for the Army has
testified that brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
and other brain-related maladies make up a majority of combat-related
health problems, with physical injuries to the rest of the body
representing only about 11% of the injuries suffered in combat.
It is
estimated that
20 percent
of those who
served in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom experience some form of
PTSD.
On May 22 nd , 2014, I voted for the passage
of the
2015 National Defense Authorization
Act .
The bill requires the Department of Defense
(DOD) to provide person-to-person mental health screenings once during
each 180-day period in which a service member is deployed.
It also
provides for an assessment of the transition of care for
post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, including changes to
pharmaceutical treatment plans and the coordination of DOD programs that
address TBI and the psychological health of
members.
Additionally, this week Congress passed
H.R.1098,
Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act .
This
bill requires the directors of the Centers for Disease Control and the
National Institutes of Health, in consultation with the secretaries of
Defense and Veterans Affairs, to submit a report to Congress within
two years of reauthorization identifying recommendations on TBI
surveillance efforts for veterans which have been adopted and those which have
not.
The report will also include a description of the plans to
address recommendations that have not been
adopted.
Greater awareness of PTSD and TBI can help eliminate the negative
stereotypes that keep many people from pursuing treatment.
For those
living with PTSD, knowing there are PTSD treatments that can improve their
quality of life will make it easier for them to seek needed
care.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families
like yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing
from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please
let me know
areas you
find especially interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
