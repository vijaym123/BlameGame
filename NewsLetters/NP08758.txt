HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01CF8739.B81D7E60]
President signs law lowering NMI cost-share for Army Corps projects - The Northern Marianas will pay a smaller local share for Army Corps projects in the islands as a result of President Obama's signing of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
on Tuesday. The new law contains my provision that requires the Corps to increase a waiver of the local cost-share for U.S. territories, adjusting for inflation over the last three decades. The old waiver set in 1987 was $200,000; the new waiver is estimated to be at least $400,000. This means Corps projects will go forward without the Commonwealth first having to come up with $400,000 of local funds. Projects in development for the NMI include the Saipan Lagoon Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration, which should improve water quality and the reef habitat of near-shore areas of the lagoon by containing run-off. I sought a special congressional appropriation, or "earmark," of $250,000 for the lagoon restoration in fiscal 2011. But the Republican majority in the House of Representatives banned earmarks before my request could be funded. In the end we got a better deal: that earmark would have been a one-time benefit, but the change in local cost-share that the President signed is a gift that will keep giving every time the Corps goes to work in our islands.

Raising food stamp benefits, the summer feeding program for Northern Marianas students, and the on-going feasibility study for adding the NMI to the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, were on the agenda, when Regional Administrator Jesus Mendoza visited the congressional office in Washington this week. Mr. Mendoza, center, is responsible for SNAP, school meals, WIC and all the U.S. Department of Agriculture's nutrition programs in the west coast states, as well as Hawai'i, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Accompanying Mr. Mendoza were FNS staffers, Scott Carter, Kristin Caulley, Brenda Mutuma and Anthony Wilson II.
House approves bill to speed bank deposits - Funds deposited in most Northern Marianas banks could be available sooner under terms of a bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday. H.R. 1679 , introduced by American Samoa Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega (D), adds both American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands to provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act. The Act already applies to all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and allows the Federal Reserve Bank to set rules for how quickly customers get access to funds they deposit in banks. Some constituents have complained to me about delays in getting their money after they deposit a check at a Northern Marianas bank. And none of our local banks objected to meeting the national standards. So when the opportunity arose this week to move the bill, we did. H.R. 1679 passed the House by voice vote without dissent. The bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.
House and Senate move to expand access to medical care for veterans - Spurred into action by 23 deaths linked to delayed appointments at Veterans Affairs health facilities, the House and Senate both passed legislation this week to improve veterans access to medical care. The House passed H.R. 4810 , the Veterans Access to Care Act, which I co-sponsored. The bill requires the VA to pay for care from a non-VA provider for eligible veterans, requires an independent review of care provided at VA medical facilities, and requires the VA to submit a plan of action based on that review. The Senate legislation , too, allows enrolled veterans to get help from non-VA providers and also authorized hiring more heath care providers for VA facilities. The rush to act leaves both House and Senate bills in need of further refinement over the coming days; but some action is better than no action when it comes to serving the veterans who have served our country.

FY15 appropriations bills continue to advance - The fiscal 2015 appropriations process continued to move forward this week. We highlight the legislative action and funding decisions important to the Northern Mariana Islands:
*
The House of Representatives passed a $52 billion Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, H.R. 4745 , $1.8 billion less than in FY14. This is mixed news for the three largest HUD programs in the Northern Marianas. The Tenant-Based Rental Assistance program - Section 8 Vouchers - is increased $328 million over the current year. But Project-Based Rental Assistance goes down $170.6 million. And the Community Development Block Grant, although dropping $30 million nationwide, remains the same for the territories, which get a fixed $7 million set-aside. The T-HUD appropriation also keeps transit formula grants at the FY14 level of $8.6 billion, so the Commonwealth grant should be the same as this year's $812,806.
*
At the committee level, House appropriators approved $491 billion in defense spending for 2015, an overall increase of $4.1 billion. But the Formerly Used Defense Sites program lost $54 million, a 20 percent cut. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the FUDS clean-ups, allotted $4 million this year for NMI projects.
*
The House Appropriations Committee also reported the FY15 spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Two programs that provide the largest funding for the Northern Marianas remain unchanged: The Committee recommended $100 million for the Port Security Grant program, which brought the NMI $946,000 last year, and $350 million for Emergency Management Performance Grant funds, which gave us $863,000.

Vacationing in Washington, DC, Ms. Mina Minami and her two sons, William and Edward stopped by their congressional office this week and toured the U.S. Capitol. The boys, who are students at Mount Carmel School, were born in the Northern Marianas; and this was the first trip to the U.S. mainland for all three. Thank you all for visiting.
More time needed to decide how to protect corals - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has postponed a decision on whether to list 29 corals found in the NMI as threatened or endangered species. The decision, originally expected this week, will now be delayed until the end of summer to allow more time to review available information. Listing under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act would mean increased protection for the corals. Coral reefs are essential to our island community. They support subsistence and commercial fishing by providing safe breeding areas. They protect our shorelines from storms. And they attract hundreds of thousands of tourists to the Marianas each year. To avoid potential resource conflicts, however, I have asked NOAA to give careful consideration to all possible conservation measures and take into full account the work that states and territories are already doing to protect our corals .
NOAA reopens public process to nominate marine sanctuaries - The public may now nominate areas of America's oceans or Great Lakes to be considered as national marine sanctuaries. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its final rule
this week, reopening nominations and setting out the criteria NOAA will use to evaluate recommended areas. Designation of a marine sanctuary, typically a multi-year process, takes account of many factors, including the complexity of the area, the level of support from those who use it, and the availability of agency resources to manage a new responsibility. In 1995 the agency closed nominations for new sanctuaries so it could focus on managing the existing sanctuary system. But over the last two decades Members of Congress, state and tribal governments, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions have continued to recommend possible marine sanctuaries, eventually leading NOAA this week to reopen a formal process of nomination and selection.
$764,545 to CHCC for childhood mental health - Children with emotional disturbances and their families will benefit from the $764,545 awarded to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation this week. The grant is one of only 19 expected nationwide in fiscal 2014 under the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with Serious Emotional Disturbances program authorized by Congress in U.S. Public Law 102-321. The grant supports development of individualized service plans for children or adolescents under age 22, who are diagnosed with a serious mental or behavioral disorder, and helps pay for a case manager to assist each of them and their family. Congratulations to Project Director Reyna Saures and the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation.
