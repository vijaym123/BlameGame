Former Secretary of Defense Energizes Morris Chamber of
Commerce
I had the honor and pleasure today of introducing former
Secretary of Defense William Cohen to the more than 600 people
attending todays 93 rd
Annual Meeting Luncheon of the Morris
County Chamber of Commerce.
Secretary Cohen kept the
capacity crowd riveted with his 25 minute talk highlighting many of the
serious national defense challenges facing the United States
today.
He focused specifically on Chinas growing military might and on the
increasing instability in the Middle East.
The former Secretary
diplomatically but firmly discussed why President Obamas actions
last fall regarding the situation in Syria have not helped advance the
cause of peace and freedom in the region.
At the conclusion of his
remarks, the crowd rose as one to give Secretary Cohen a well-earned
ovation.
As the new chairman of the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee, I found Secretary Cohens insights particularly
valuable.
As my committee gets ready to begin its work of
determining the spending for the upcoming fiscal year of the Department of
Defense and the nations intelligence efforts, the Secretarys message
will certainly help inform my efforts to ensure that when it comes to
protecting the United States, we must make every dollar
count.

The
United States Stake in Ukraine
This week saw new
outbreaks of violence in the Ukraine, a nation with strong ties to
northern New Jersey. After two months of rallies the capital of Kiev
against President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to reject a deal for closer
integration with the European Union, Ukraine's protests appear to be
spreading across the country.
Americans are witnessing the
Ukrainian people reassert their independence, as is their right,
Rodney said.
The United States has a real stake in developments in
this part of Europe and the Administration should warn Russia not to
interfere in the events now unfolding in Ukraine.
This is a matter
for the Ukrainian people to decide.

This Weeks Salute: Kay
Zufall
We mourn the passing of Kay Zufall last
week.
Kay and her husband, champions of affordable healthcare,
established the Zufall Health Center in Morris County.
Rodney told the
Morris County
Daily Record
this week,
Kay and Bob Zufall devoted their professional and personal lives and
resources to serving those most in need of health services.
In
the heart of Dover for many years, their freestanding health center has
served families with no health insurance, especially mothers and
children, and families of limited English language skills, with basic
medical and dental needs, immunizations, regular physicals and a whole
array of preventive services. Their selflessness encouraged other doctors
and healthcare professionals to volunteer to serve the
neediest.
