We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude. We've all heard a
lot in the news lately about problems in the VA health care system with
unacceptable long waiting lists and some veterans dropped off lists
altogether to make the waiting lists look better. In the past month or
so, I have held townhall meetings in Dayton, Cincinnati, Toledo and
Columbus to hear from our veterans about their care and how to improve
it.
I recently voted in favor of the Veterans' Access to Care
through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014
. It's a long name for a bill with a pretty simple purpose.
I want to make sure that when the VA and the government can't help our
veterans, that they have opportunities to go outside of the system and
take advantage of other options. In other words, it gives our veterans
a choice. It also updates the VA's dysfunctional information technology
systems and brings them into the 21st Century. And it increases
accountability at the VA by allowing the Secretary to more easily fire
people who are letting our veterans down.
We also need to do more to provide for our veterans' mental health
needs. I have introduced the
Mental Evaluation Parity for
Servicemembers (MEPS) Act
, legislation that will improve the way the military
identifies and assesses mental health issues. I have also focused on
access to mental health services for our veterans. I recently had the
opportunity to visit the Columbus VA Ambulatory Care Center and talk
with their Director of Mental Health Services and see the work they are
doing on expanding mental health access for our rural veterans.
Finally, this year we marked the 70th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion
in Normandy. As the invasion was underway, Franklin Roosevelt shared a
powerful prayer with the nation. I worked with members of the Senate on
both sides of the aisle, and Congressman Bill Johnson in the House, to
draft legislation that would add that powerful prayer to the World War
II Memorial in Washington
. I'm happy to report that this legislation passed the
Senate on the eve of the anniversary. Just this week, it passed the
U.S. House of Representatives. It is now headed to the President's desk
for signature. At no cost to the taxpayer, my bill will immortalize
this extraordinary prayer on the World War II Memorial so it becomes a
permanent reminder of the sacrifice of not just those who fought in
World War II, but also of the men and women who fight for us today and
all those who lay down their lives for the cause of liberty.
Recent Visits Around Ohio
Had a productive tour of GM Powertrain in Defiance. Impressed by their
high-tech jobs.
I participated again in the 11.5 mile kayak race at the 13th Annual
Paddlefest on the Ohio River.
Toured City Gospel Mission's expansion in Cincinnati. I was pleased to
be able to help them clear Washington red tape
and continue with their planned expansion. They provide up to
130,000 meals per year to Cincinnati's poor and homeless.
Held a townhall meeting with veterans at American Legion Post 72 in
Clermont County.
Visited Battelle in Columbus to discuss the Digital Accountability and
Transparency Act
(DATA Act),
bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA)
that was recently signed into law.
I heard from community leaders
about how the law helps those in Central Ohio using opportunities in
data analytics to drive economic growth and spur job creation.
Had a quiet moment at the moving new Ohio Holocaust & Liberators
Memorial at the Statehouse.
Honored to deliver the University of Toledo College of Medical and Life
Sciences commencement and receive an honorary degree. Congrats to the
Class of 2014!

We
owe
our
veterans
a
tremendous
debt
of
gratitude.
W e&#8217;ve
all
heard
a

in
the
news
lately
about
problems in
the
VA
health
care
system
with
unacceptable
long
waiting
lists
and
some
veterans
dropped
off
lists
altogether
to
make
the
waiting
lists
look
better.
In
the
past
month
or
so,
I
have
held
townhall
meetings
in
Dayton,
Cincinnati,
Toledo
and
Columbus
to
hear
from
our
veterans
about
their
care
and
how
to
improve
it.
I
recently
voted
in
favor
of
the
Veterans&#8217;
Access
to
Care
through
Choice,
Accountability,
and
Transparency
Act
of
2014 .
It's
a
long
name
for
a
bill
with
a
pretty
simple
purpose. I
want
to
make
sure
that
when
the
VA
and
the
government
can't
help
our
veterans,
that
they
have
opportunities
to
go
outside
of
the
system
and
take
advantage
of
other
options.
In
other
words,
it
gives
our
veterans
a
choice.
It
also
updates
the
VA's
dysfunctional
information
technology
systems
and
brings
them
into
the
21st
Century.
And
it increases
accountability
at
the
VA
by
allowing
the
Secretary
to
more
easily
fire
people
who
are
letting
our
veterans
down.
We
also
need
to
do
more
to
provide
for
our
veterans&#8217;
mental
health
needs.
I
have
introduced
the
Mental
Evaluation

(MEPS)
Act ,
legislation
that
will
improve
the
way
the
military
identifies

assesses

I

Finally,
this

I&#8217;m

Just
