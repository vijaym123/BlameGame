Weekly Update
As I speak with constituents
around the First District about the issues important to them, energy is
often near the top of the list. Folks are deeply concerned about our
dependence on foreign sources of energy, and the lack of diversity in
our nations energy infrastructure. I share these concerns, and I
proudly voted for legislation recently to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline
(H.R. 5682). The Keystone XL Pipeline is a project that has been
awaiting approval by the Obama Administration for years now and that has
the potential to create a significant number of jobs for Americans. The
bill passed with bipartisan support in the House but unfortunately
failed to pass in the Senate.
Approval of this pipeline is a
critical part of an all-of-the-above energy policy, one in which we
are exploring all options to ensure energy security in this country. I
believe it is possible to both harness our natural resources, as well
as preserve them for future generations. I will continue to push for
the Keystone XL Pipelines approval and advocate for energy policies
that include responsible development of oil and natural gas as well as
alternative forms of energy, such as renewables.
I was also
proud to vote for another piece of legislation that would generate
increased economic activity and domestic job creation. The Promoting New
Manufacturing Act (H.R. 4795) would streamline the EPA permitting
process used for construction of new U.S. factories or on existing ones.
Too many of these projects are currently slowed down by unnecessary red
tape related to Clean Air Act compliance. The delays caused by this
antiquated process are hindering the ability of businesses to expand and
hire more workers. Again, I believe we can grow our manufacturing
base and our nations economy in an environmentally-responsible
way.
No single solution exists to get our economy rolling again, but
I often hear folks in the First District say that the biggest problem
they see is excessive government interference. If the government
would just get out of their way, they could grow their businesses and, in
turn, grow our economy. I will continue to support legislation like
H.R. 4795 so that we can enable our businesses to jumpstart the economy
and help us advance toward an economic renaissance.
The
main streets of Virginias First District are full of ideas to get our
economy back on track, and your feedback is critically important to me
as I serve you. I can be reached by telephone at
