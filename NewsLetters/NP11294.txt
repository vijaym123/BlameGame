PRESS RELEASE
Johnson stands in support of every Americans' First Amendment Right
Washington, DC
Congressman Sam Johnson (R-TX) released the following statement as the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in the cases
Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.
and
Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius.
Its shameful to know that after numerous waivers, delays and changes made to Obamacare over the past four years; the only mandate the Obama Administration will strictly implement involves forcing religious groups and businesses like Hobby Lobby to violate deeply held personal beliefs.
This is America - a nation founded on freedom of religion.
My hope is that the Justices will stand firmly by our Constitution and protect every Americans right to exercise religious freedom.
