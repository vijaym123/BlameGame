Friends,
More Americans are using the internet
than ever before.
Whether you go online to stay in touch with
friends, share pictures with family, conduct business, purchase music,
watch a movie, share recipes, or look up directions, the internet has
become a resourceful part of our lives.
Before the internet
became intertwined with our daily lives, state and local government
proposed taxing internet access.
Recognizing that
taxing the internet would slow its growth and limit Americans access,
Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) in 1998.
This legislation prohibited states from imposing new taxes on internet
access.
(To be clear, ITFA did not exempt online sales from
taxation.)
Since ITFA was enacted, internet growth has exploded.
Today you can access the internet for free at McDonald's, your local
library, and coffee shops. Some cities have even made free internet
access available city-wide.
The ban on taxing internet access
enacted in ITFA is set to expire November 1, 2014.
To
prevent this from happening and ensure that access to the internet
remains free, I cosponsored the Permanent Tax Freedom Act (H.R.
3086).
I am glad to inform you that the House of Representatives
passed the Permanent Tax Freedom Act last week, which bans the
taxation of internet access forever.

Committee Advances Bills Related to Regulation of the Nations
Waters
On Wednesday, the Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee, of which I am a member,
advanced three bills
to the full House
that provide businesses and workers certainty when dealing with
regulations of our nations waters.
Given the actions of the
Administrations overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), legislation
is necessary to ensure the agency is acting within its jurisdiction in
all federal-state partnerships.
One bill in particular, the
Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act,
preserves jobs, reduces the need for costly litigation, and allows landowners
to continue making decisions about their property by stopping the
EPAs attempt to expand their federal regulatory power under the Clean
Water Act.
Immigration Update
In
response to the outpour of calls and emails I have received regarding the
immigration crisis at our southern border,
I joined the Border
Security Caucus last week.
This caucus will make border
security and interior enforcement a top priority.
Furthermore,
I cosponsored legislation that calls upon the Governors of Texas, New
Mexico, Arizona, and California to deploy National Guard forces under
their command to immediately assist in securing our southern
border.
The ongoing immigration crisis is an issue we cannot take
lightly.
I will continue to work with my colleagues to advance
solutions that make our country safer and more secure.
