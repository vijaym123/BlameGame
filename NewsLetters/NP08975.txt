Dear David,
As I'm sure you've seen, allegations surrounding inadequate care at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are flooding in almost every
day.
Just this week, reports of extended wait times
over 90 days
surfaced at several facilities in Missouri. To
make this very serious problem worse, I received
confirmation
of an " unauthorized " wait list at
the Kansas City VA Medical Center.
It is inexcusable
that our veterans are facing delayed or inadequate care. If you or
someone you know has been affected by insufficient treatment at your VA,
please share your story with me
here .
I am committed to fighting for you, and
ensuring that our veterans and their families receive the care they need
and deserve.
As always, I invite you to join the
conversation online by sharing your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington
