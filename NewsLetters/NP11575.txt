Friend-
Last month, I wrote to you about premium hikes and changes in flood zone mapping affecting homeowners and communities in Virginias Fourth Congressional District, as well as across the nation.
I wanted to let you know that last week, the House passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act,
H.R.3370 , with my support, and it now awaits action in the Senate.
This bill reinstates grandfathered rates by decoupling rate increases from FEMA remapping. Removal of this provision ensures that policyholders who built to code and standards of existing Flood Insurance Rate Maps are not penalized.
The bill also repeals the home sale and new policy rate increase triggers, ensuring that both property owners and prospective buyers are treated equally.
I will continue working to protect homeowners in Virginias 4 th
Congressional District, and I hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this legislation.
Yours in service,
Randy
