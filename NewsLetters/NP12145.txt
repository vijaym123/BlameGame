Friend,
We were thrilled when the Sierra Club and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund both made public their support of our campaign.
I&#39;m very proud of these endorsements - but I always keep in mind that the issues these organizations fight for are only important because they affect people on an individual level.
I stand with Planned Parenthood so that women will have access to quality, affordable care. I stand with the Sierra Club because issues like climate change affect all of us. These larger organizations may have a far-reaching platform to speak from, but ultimately - this is about you.
So, while these endorsements mean a lot to me - nothing means more to me than
your
endorsement.
Can you sign here to commit your support for our campaign in 2014?
Endorsements like these let me know that we&#39;re on the right track. These issues are important, and there&#39;s still more work to be done.
Thank you for working alongside me.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District

If you&#39;ve already signed, thank you.
