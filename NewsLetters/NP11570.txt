Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to share some of the things I've been working
on over the last couple of weeks.
The 2014 Congressional Artistic Discovery Contest
2014 Congressional Art Competition
It is my pleasure to invite all interested high school students in the
33rd Congressional District to participate in this year's Congressional
Art Competition.
Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts
competition is sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
The Artistic Discovery Contest is an opportunity to
recognize and encourage the artistic talent in the nation, as well as
in our congressional district.
The winner of our district's competition will be displayed for one year
in the U.S. Capitol beside the other winning artwork.
In addition, two
complimentary round-trip airline tickets will be provided to the winner
in order to attend the awards ceremony in Washington, D.C.
Each year I am impressed and inspired by the incredible level of talent
on display and I am looking forward to seeing this years submissions.
All submitted artwork will be on display at the Manhattan Beach
Cultural Arts Center from April 14th - April 21st and a reception will
be held on Wednesday, April 16th
to announce the winners.
The deadline for submissions is Monday, April 7th.

Form please visit my website here: http://1.usa.gov/1cCJ4Uo
New Nutrition Facts Label
On February 27, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed changes
to the Nutrition Facts label found on many U.S. food packages. The
proposed new nutrition label more prominently displays the calorie
content of the food, updates serving sizes to reflect today's eating
patterns, excludes processed less-healthful fibers from the fiber
listing, and perhaps most important of all, requires that added sugars
be listed separately.
As the author of the law that created the original nutrition label back
in 1990, I applaud the FDA's proposal to bring the nutrition label in
line with how food is marketed and consumed today, and with current
dietary recommendations. The proposed changes should give Americans
better information to protect their health, and help combat our
national obesity epidemic.
You can read my full statement on the FDA's proposed new label here

Addressing the California Drought Crisis
2013 closed as the driest year on record for many Californian
communities, and this winter threatens to become the third consecutive
year of drought conditions.
The droughts not only threaten California's
drinking water supplies, agricultural production, and endangered
aquatic species, but also increase the risk of catastrophic wild fires
and economic instability.
It's the responsibility of Congress to understand the connection
between climate change and drought in California and the Western United
States.
In February I joined with 36 members of the Californian
Congressional Delegation to urge House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman Fred Upton to hold hearings on the connection between climate
change and the severe droughts in the West.
Current conditions in
California and across the Western United States are in line with
scientific predictions that climate change would increase the intensity
and duration of droughts.

Combating Economic Inequality
At the end of last month, I joined with over 190 House Democrats to
sign a petition that would force a vote on the Fair Minimum Wage Act of
2013 (H.R. 1010), a bill that would raise the minimum wage from $7.25
to $10.10 per hour over three years.
As an original cosponsor of this
legislation, I believe raising the minimum wage is a critical part of
our effort to build an economy that works for everyone.
Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would increase the pay of at least
25 million men and women across the country, generating some $22
billion in increased economic activity and lifting more than one
million Americans out of poverty.
A higher minimum wage would benefit
our economy, our workers, and our long-term growth.

video my Democratic colleagues put together calling on the Republican
leadership to act on minimum wage legislation.
