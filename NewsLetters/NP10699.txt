Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
It was another busy week in Washington last week, and I was happy to welcome several groups of constituents and local advocacy groups who traveled to DC in support of issues that are important to our community. Beacon Colleges Chair Eileen Marinakis and new president, Dr. George Hagerty came to my office to discuss the work they are doing to offer education opportunities to students with learning disabilities. I have had the privilege of being a part of several events with Beacon College in Leesburg, and was honored to accept their Public Navigator &amp; Service Award for Leadership.
Some of the other meetings last week included:
- Girls Inc., from Winter Haven
- The Florida Cattlemans Association
- Florida Developmental Disabilities Council
- The Florida Bar Foundation
- Mortgage Bankers Association
- The Everglades Foundation and several other meetings related to the Water Resources Reform &amp; Development Act (WRRDA) and other transportation and infrastructure issues.

Last Friday, I attended the ribbon cutting for the 21st Annual Hispanic Business and Consumer Expo with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando. Held at the Orange County Convention Center, the expo is a huge production that unites the business and Hispanic community in order to strengthen Central Florida economic development. It was great to join local Hispanic business and government leaders in wishing them a successful weekend as they promote jobs and economic growth in the community.

On Saturday morning, I joined friends old and new from Windermere for their annual Run around the Lake. The race was dedicated to our first responders and during the opening ceremonies we paid tribute to Windermere Police Officer Robert German, who gave his life in the line of duty late last month. We also recognized Roger Tome, a long-time resident of Windermere who worked with the Orlando Fire Department and NASA fire and rescue for over 50 years. Both of these men contributed greatly to the West Orange community, and we are grateful for their legacy.

Sixteen years ago, when I was in the Florida Legislature, I secured funding for construction of a community health center in Winter Garden to provide members of the community with an alternative to the Emergency Room. Last weekend, I participated in the open house and ribbon cutting for the Winter Garden Community Health Center, which will have nearly double the space, see more patients and provide far more services than I ever imagined.

Habitat for Humanity hosted a groundbreaking for the construction of their 6th Home At Last housing project. I was privileged to join the community in honoring Marine Sgt. Stephen and Krystina Tovet, and thank them for their service and sacrifice for our country. In 2011, Sgt. Tovet was severely injured during an IED blast in Afghanistan, and it was a great privilege to welcome him and his family into our community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Polk City contacted my office regarding an application for disability benefits he had submitted to the Social Security Administration (SSA). Forced to quit his job due to macular degeneration and complete vision loss, he requested that my office follow up with the SSA, since he had not received an answer from them. We submitted a Congressional Inquiry to SSA and were glad to later find out that the constituent was granted an expedited hearing date, and he was subsequently approved for disability benefits.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Earlier this year, the President released a budget that included increases in taxes and more government spending. A far cry from a vision of how to pay down our crippling national debt, the Presidents budget never balances. Ever. So unworkable and shortsighted, it only received two favorable votes when brought to the full House.
The House Democrats budget doesnt balance either, and the Senate Democrats are once again refusing to even offer a budget. In stark contrast, I supported, and the House passed, a budget that will cut spending, jumpstart our economy, and balance the budget in ten years without raising taxes.
Our budget also strengthens and secures Medicare and Social Security services for seniors. To be clear, the budget we passed does not change Medicare or Social Security at all for seniors in or near retirement. Rather, it strengthens these programs to ensure they are still around for future generations.
In addition to cutting spending and balancing the budget, the House budget repeals Obamacare to pave the way for patient-centered health care reform, initiates overdue pro-growth tax reform, and provides our troops with the equipment and compensation they need and deserve.
America deserves
and our economy requires
a balanced budget that will generate jobs and growth. It is time we set our nation, and every American, on a path to prosperity.
