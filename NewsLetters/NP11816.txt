Over a month ago, Governor Brown officially declared a drought
emergency in our State amidst declining reservoir levels and
historically low amounts of rainfall. Despite our recent rainfall, the
state still faces a serious situation. The Governor has asked that
everyone reduce their water usage by 20 percent.
A simple way to achieve this reduction is to cut back on overwatering
and be extra mindful of your daily water usage. I am glad to see the
City of Cypress
is
promoting this practice throughout Orange County. I encourage you and
your community to take responsible steps in promoting and practicing
water security during this time of drought.
On Thursday, the Long Beach Board of Water Commissioners took proactive
steps in reducing our water use, restricting lawn watering to Mondays,
Thursdays, or Saturdays. In addition, Long Beach has ongoing
prohibitions on watering between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and hosing down
sidewalks and driveways without specialized hoses. Increasing awareness
and encouraging conservation will be critical as we deal with the
status of our State's water supply.
We may also be experiencing flash floods this weekend. While this may
bring some drought relief, it can pose serious threats to our
community. Please be extra safe this weekend!
$10.10 per hour
This week I signed Congressman Timothy Bishop's "discharge petition" to
vote on The Fair Minimum Wage Act, which would raise the federal
minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. If the petition reaches 218
signatures, the proposal will be brought to the House Floor for an
immediate vote.
Clean Energy Jobs
This year, I will be increasing my efforts with the Congressional Safe
Climate Caucus to spotlight the fact that there is a 97% consensus
among peer-reviewed scientific reports that humans are contributing to
climate change.
One of the best ways to mitigate the effects of climate change is to
invest in clean renewable energy to help create jobs, improve our air
quality, and fuel our country. Yesterday, I spoke on the House Floor in
favor of wind power, a critical clean energy source that employs 80,000
Americans, including 7,000 Californians.

Affordable Care Act Update
Four million Americans are now enrolled in health insurance
marketplaces, including over 700,000 Californians who have enrolled in
California's marketplace, Covered California.
Whether it is through Medi-Cal or Covered California, the Affordable
Care Act is providing Californians who have long been denied health
care a plan that works for them. Californians are picking plans, and
getting covered. Our State has even met all of its enrollment goals six
weeks early.
Remember: March 31 is the deadline to pick a plan and get covered.

Immigration Services in the District
This week, my District Staff attended an event at the U.S. Citizenship
and Immigration Service (USCIS) California Service Center, where they
assisted in the processing of visas and other immigration petitions.
The Center, located in Laguna Niguel, provides a myriad of immigration
services to many constituents in the 47th District. In fact, whenever
my office receives a request from a constituent to work on an
immigration case, be it obtaining an agricultural work visa or a
specialty occupation worker petition, they work with the talented
individuals at the Center to resolve them as quickly as possible.

Helping Veterans Become Entrepreneurs
On Wednesday, March 12, from 9:00am to 11:00am, the City of Cypress and
the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) will hold a FREE seminar
for veterans at the Cypress Community Center. The seminar, entitled
"Veterans and Entrepreneurship," will focus on training opportunities,
SBA loan initiatives for veterans, and leveraging your
status as a
veteran to secure federal and state government contracts.
To register for this event, e-mail Mr. Steve Clarke, City of Cypress
Redevelopment Project Manager, at sclarke@ci.cypress.ca.us or call

"Speaker of the House, and Majority and Minority Leader"
The Speaker of the House, a member of the Majority party, is the
presiding officer in the House of Representatives, and is responsible
for the day-to-day functions of the House, as well as advancing the
legislative agenda of his political party. Should an emergency occur,
the U.S. Constitution names the Speaker of the House as second in the
line of succession to the Presidency, after the Vice President. The
Speaker of the House in the 113th Congress is Speaker John Boehner, a
Republican from Ohio.
In addition to the Speaker, the majority Republicans and minority
Democrats in the House each have their own party leadership positions
known as Leaders, who each serve as their party's principal
spokesperson and legislative strategist.
The Majority Leader in the 113th Congress is Republican Eric Cantor
from Virginia. The Minority Leader in the 113th Congress is Democrat
Nancy Pelosi from California, who, herself, served as speaker from 2007
to 2011.
Do you think raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour will be good
for our economy?
53.1%
Yes -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would raise wages
for nearly 25 million Americans, thus giving hard-working people more
take-home pay to then spend on goods and services
11.1%
Maybe -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would be good
for families, but it could result in businesses offering fewer jobs
than expected
34.6%
No -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 is bad for
businesses, families, and the economy
1.2%

&#8220;Speaker

The
Speaker

is
the
presiding

in

of
Representatives,

responsible
for
the
day-to-day
functions
of
the
House,
as
well
as
advancing
the
legislative
agenda
of
his
political
party.
Should
an
emergency
occur,
the
U.S.
Constitution
names
the
Speaker
of
the
House
as
second
in
the
line
of
succession
to
the
Presidency,
after
the
Vice
President.
The
Speaker

Speaker
John
Boehner,
a
Republican
from
Ohio.
In
addition
to
the
Speaker,
the
majority
Republicans
and
minority
Democrats
in
the
House
each
have
their
own
party
leadership
positions
known
as
Leaders,
who
each
serve

The

The

Maybe
--
Increasing

it

result
in

offering
fewer
