Dear Friends,
Each year, we proudly celebrate the contributions of small businesses
and entrepreneurs during National Small Business Week, recognizing the
foundational role they play in our national and local economy. Today,
small businesses represent 55 percent of all American jobs and 65
percent of new job creation. Unfortunately, their impact too often goes
unnoticed or underappreciated, and their voices go unheard.
A big part of why I came to Congress was to amplify that voice and
fight for these small businesses. That's why I chose to serve on the
House Small Business Committee, and why I started the Brad at Your
Business initiative to tour local companies and hear directly from
owners, managers and employees.
During this National Small Business week, I highlighted the diverse and
significant impacts small businesses have on our communities.
I joined Mayor Wayne Motley and representatives of Waukegan Main
Street, an organization working to revitalize Waukegan's downtown, to
stress the role small businesses will play in the city's economic
future. I also hosted a roundtable discussion with mayors from
throughout our area to foster cooperation across federal, state and
local lines and to work on how we can create better conditions for
local businesses to succeed.
I'm proud that our community is a hub for so many small,
highly-advanced manufacturers, and I am so pleased that our schools and
organizations, like the Technology and Manufacturing Association (TMA),
are committed to harnessing that expertise and teaching our next
generation. This week, I attended TMA's first-ever certificate ceremony
where 12 exceptional local high school students were awarded an
industry-recognized certificate to show their completion of key
manufacturing and technology courses. This ceremony grew out of an idea
developed at a roundtable I hosted on ways to bridge our economy's
skills gap, and I am so proud to see it come full circle.
This training is exactly what we need to ensure our success in the 21st
Century, and it's teaching the skills our businesses need now. I hear
about our skills gap on most of my Brad at Your Business tours, and I
hosted three of those tours this week-visiting JD Honigberg, Ramcel
Engineering and MinXray.
Finally, I partnered with the Chicago Community Trust to host an
On the Table discussion with local entrepreneurs and representatives
from growth accelerators. We discussed ways to expand public-private
efforts to help startups and how we can help more entrepreneurs take
their ideas from startup to step out to success.
Small businesses are the engine of our economic success. They always
have been, and in this 21st Century global marketplace, they will lead
the way.
This was just one special week to celebrate and highlight the broad
economic impact of small businesses. I will continue working every day
to help small- and medium-sized companies plan for the future and grow.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Friends,
Each
year,
we
proudly celebrate
the
contributions
of
small
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
during
National
Small
Business
Week,
recognizing
the
foundational
role
they
play
in
our
national
and
local
economy.
Today,
small
businesses
represent
55
percent
of
all
American
jobs
and
65
percent
of
new
job
creation.
Unfortunately,
their
impact
too
often
goes
unnoticed
or
underappreciated,
and
their
voices
go
unheard.
A
big
part
of
why
I
came
to
Congress
was
to
amplify
that
voice
and
fight
for
these
small
businesses.
That&#8217;s
why
I
chose
to
serve
on
the
House
Small
Business
Committee,
and
why
I
started
the
Brad
at
Your
Business
initiative
to
tour
local
companies
and
hear
directly
from
owners,
managers
and
employees.
During
this
National
Small
Business
week,
I
highlighted
the
diverse
and
significant
impacts
small
businesses
have
on
our
communities.
I
joined
Mayor
Wayne
Motley
and
representatives
of
Waukegan
Main
Street,
an
organization
working
to
revitalize
Waukegan&#8217;s
downtown,
to
stress
the
role
small
businesses
will
play
in
the
city&#8217;s
economic
future.
I
also
hosted
a
roundtable
discussion
with
mayors
from
throughout
our
area
to
foster
cooperation
across
federal,
state
and
local
lines
and
to
work
on
how
we
can
create
better
conditions
for
local
businesses
to
succeed.
I&#8217;m
proud
that
our
community
is
a
hub
for
so
many
small,
highly-advanced
manufacturers,
and
I
am
so
pleased
that
our
schools
and
organizations,
like
the
Technology
and
Manufacturing
Association
(TMA),
are
committed
to
harnessing
that
expertise
and
teaching
our
next
generation.
This
week,
I
attended
TMA&#8217;s
first-ever
certificate
ceremony
where
12
exceptional local
high
school
students
were
awarded
an
industry-recognized
certificate
to
show
their
completion
of
key
manufacturing
and
technology
courses.
This
ceremony
grew
out
of
an
idea
developed
at
a
roundtable
I
hosted
on
ways
to
bridge
our
economy's
skills
gap,
and
I
am
so
proud
to
see
it
come
full
circle.
This
training
is
exactly
what
we
need
to
ensure
our
success
in
the
21st
Century,
and
it&#8217;s
teaching
the
skills
our
businesses
need
now.
I
hear
about
our
skills
gap
on
most
of
my
Brad
at
Your
Business
tours,
and
I
hosted
three
of
those
tours
this
week&#8212;visiting
JD
Honigberg,
Ramcel
Engineering
and
MinXray.
Finally,
I
partnered
with
the
Chicago
Community
Trust
to
host
an
On
the
Table
discussion
with
local
entrepreneurs
and
representatives
from growth
accelerators.
We
discussed
ways
to
expand
public-private
efforts
to
help
startups
and
how
we
can
help
more
entrepreneurs
take
their
ideas
from
startup
to
step
out
to
success.
Small
businesses
are
the
engine
of
our
economic
success.
They
always
have
been,
and
in
this
21st
Century
global
marketplace,
they
will
lead
the
way.
This
was
just
one
special
week
to
celebrate
and
highlight
the
broad
economic
impact
of
small
businesses.
I
will
continue
working
every
day
to
help
small-
and
medium-sized
companies
plan
for
the
future
and
grow.

you,
