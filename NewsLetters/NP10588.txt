Dear Friend:
I was pleased to learn today that the Obama Administration is extending the government comment period for the Keystone XL pipeline.
Given the unprecedented number of comments from the public on the Keystone XL pipeline proposal and the legal uncertainties due to lawsuits in Nebraska, the State Department was entirely correct to delay a decision on the pipeline.
I am also pleased that Secretary of State Kerry has agreed to take into account the public health impacts of the tar sands oil when he considers whether the pipeline is in the national interest, but we need a comprehensive study.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
