Dear Friend,
Like many living in Ohios 16
th
District, I have growing
concerns over the increase in heroin and
prescription opioid abuse and related
deaths. In Cleveland, heroin-related deaths
have increased 400 percent. What is even
more disturbing is that prescription
painkillers are involved in more overdose
deaths than cocaine and heroin combined -
killing more than 16,000 people a year.
That is why earlier this month, Sen. Rob
Portman and I hosted a
drug
abuse roundtable
to discuss the nature
of the prescription and heroin abuse
problems impacting Northeast Ohioans and
the federal governments role in
combating this issue. More than a dozen
stakeholders participated, including
representatives from the Governors
Opiate Action Team, Department of Mental
Health and Addiction Services, Ohio
Association of County Behavioral Health
Authorities, Ohio Bureau of Criminal
Investigation, Ohio State Board of
Pharmacy, and local hospitals. Our
discussion was productive and I am hopeful
that it will lead to a coordinated response
at the federal, state, and local level to
tackle the growing problem.
Additionally, I am a cosponsor of the
Preventing
Abuse of Cough Treatments (PACT) Act .
Introduced by my colleague Rep. Bill
Johnson, the PATH Act bans over the counter
cough medicines containing the active
ingredient DXM to minors under the age of
16. Though when taken as recommended DXM is
a safe and effective cough suppressant, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse found that
roughly 1 in 20 teens in grades 8 through
12 have abused cough medicine. The PACT Act
was introduced in the Senate, and is
supported by dozens of organizations,
including the American Association of
Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs of America, Community Anti-Drug
Coalitions of America (CADCA), Consumer
Healthcare Products Association (CHPA),
Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.),
and Safe Kids Worldwide and Treatment
Communities of America (TCA).
I also sent a
letter
to Department of Justice (DOJ) about a
pilot program in Ohio conducted by the
Department of Mental Health and Addiction
Services that evaluates the success of
addiction treatments, inquiring about
mirroring the program at the federal level.
Lastly, I contacted the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB)
asking
that it quickly approve the review of the
proposed Disposal of Controlled Substances
rule. This rulemaking is necessary to
ensure that all Americans have a safe and
convenient method for disposing of
unwanted, unused, or expired prescription
drugs.
It is important that we work together
across all levels to reduce the number of
heroin and prescription opioid abuse
related deaths. Our drug abuse roundtable
was an important first step to discussing
the growing problem with important
stakeholders and learning what we can do at
the federal level to assist local leaders
in their efforts to combat drug abuse.
