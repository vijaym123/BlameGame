Improving Congressional Transparency
Last week I joined with my colleague Representative Tammy Duckworth
(D-IL) to introduce a bipartisan bill that will reform the
Congressional mail system
so that members of Congress no
longer receive any special perks from the U.S. Postal Service.
*	WSB-TV. Woodall proposes ending free mail for Congress.
*	Roll Call. Woodall, Duckworth want Congress to speak frankly
about franking mail.
You can hear me explain this issue below.
House Approves Department of Defense Funding Bill
With a strong, bipartisan vote of 340-73 the House approved the FY15
Department of Defense Appropriations Act
. We
made some tough choices in this bill regarding the future of certain
weapons systems and the need to increase base pay for our military
members, but I'm proud that we were able to make those decisions
together, across partisan lines.

IRS Emails "Lost"
Despite repeated promises by the Internal Revenue Service that all of
the emails from Lois Lerner relating to the IRS targeting scandal had
been saved and would be produced to Congress, the IRS last week now
says that the emails have been lost.
The IRS says that Ms. Lerner's
computer crashed and the emails are gone forever.
The House Ways and Means Committee and the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee, on which I sit, are holding hearings now
to find out what happened and why the IRS kept this information from
Congress for so long.

*	US News and World Report. How Convenient for the IRS.
*	Speaker John Boehner. Administration must come clean on IRS
scandal.
Calling on President Obama to Lower Energy Prices for American Families
The Keystone XL Pipeline should be an easy win for American energy
security.
A clear majority of the American people support it,
Democrats in the Senate support it, editorial boards of liberal
newspapers support it, union bosses support it, and even the President's
own advisors support it.
Sadly the only folks standing in the way of
North American energy independence are the radical environmentalists
bankrolling the President and his allies.
I went to the floor to
discuss this issue:
Moving Forward - Supporting Our Veterans
Last week the House and Senate voted to constitute a Conference
Committee in which members of both chambers will work together to
develop a new reform bill that will address the systemic mismanagement
and lack of accountability across the Veterans Health Administration.
The House and Senate have each passed different, though somewhat
complementary pieces of legislation, and it is my hope that this
Conference Committee will be able to merge those bills into a measure
that provides more efficient health services to our veterans.

*	Dallas Morning News. More veterans are waiting 30 days or more
for medical appointments.
New Leaders in the House of Representatives
You may have heard that my Republican colleagues in the House elected a
new Majority Leader and a new Majority Whip last week to serve with
Speaker John Boehner in the House Leadership. Our new Majority Leader
is Representative Kevin McCarthy from California and our new Majority
Whip is Representative Steve Scalise from Louisiana. I was proud to
work as a member of the Scalise support team, and I look forward to
working with them as we bring the House together to fight for American
jobs, to boost our economy, and to make tomorrow better than today.

The Week Ahead
This week the House is expected to consider two important energy bills:
H.R. 6 and H.R. 3301.
H.R. 6, the "Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act
," streamlines our nation's natural gas
export process and provides support to America's allies in Europe who
are currently reliant on natural gas from a Russian government that
uses the profits of its natural gas sales to fund its aggression toward
its neighbors.
H.R. 3301, the "North American Energy Infrastructure Act
,"
creates a new framework for the U.S. to approve oil and natural gas
pipelines and electric transmission lines that cross U.S. borders with
Canada and Mexico. By working with our North American allies on
creating a more effective and efficient energy infrastructure, we will
become less reliant on unstable parts of the world for our energy
supply and we will be supporting two of our nation's closest allies and
most important economic partners.
These measures will improve our economy, grow jobs, advance the needs
of American workers and businesses, and support our allies.
Finally, I want to highlight for you that I am hosting a Veterans
Assistance Open House
in Cumming on June 27th.
If you
are a veteran or if you know a veteran who needs help accessing
benefits or who has questions about whether they qualify for a Veterans
Affairs program, this Veterans Assistance Open House is the place to go
for answers. I hope to see you there!

This

the

and
H.R.
3301.
H.R.
6,
the
&#8220; Domestic

Freedom
Act ,&#8221;
streamlines
our
nation&#8217;s
natural

export
process

from

government
that

profits
of
its

H.R.
3301,
the
&#8220; North
American
Energy
Infrastructure
Act ,&#8221;
creates
a
new
framework
for
the
U.S.
to
approve
oil
and
natural
gas
pipelines
and

transmission
lines
that
cross

working
with
our
North

allies
on
creating
a
more
effective
and
efficient
energy
infrastructure,
we
will
become
less
reliant
on
unstable
parts
of
the
world

our
energy
supply
and
we
will
be
supporting
two
of
our

partners.
These
measures
will
