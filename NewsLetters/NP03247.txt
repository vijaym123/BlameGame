Friend
Wanted to be sure you had seen that, in December, Congress was able pass
a prohibition on funding to implement the UN Arms Trade Treaty
a treaty that raises deep concerns about the U.N.s encroachment on our nations sovereignty to act within the parameters of the Second Amendment (with specific regard to the domestic manufacture, possession, and sale of firearms and ammunition).
You can count on me to continue to work to protect the Constitutional right to keep and bear arms throughout this new Congress. Its a right for a reason.
Yours in service,
Randy
