Florida And New Hampshire Senators To
Introduce Bipartisan Resolution Honoring
Lives Of Slain American Journalists,
Condemning ISIS
Marco, along with Senators Bill Nelson
(D-FL), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Kelly
Ayotte (R-NH) will introduce a bipartisan
resolution in the Senate to honor the lives
of American journalists James Foley and
Steven Sotloff, and condemn the Islamic
State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) terrorist
organization that brutally killed them. The
resolution recognizes the significant
contributions Foley and Sotloff made
through their courageous reporting
of events in Libya, Syria and
elsewhere, and calls for the
immediate and unconditional release of all
hostages held by ISIS, also known as the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL).
Its important that
Americans never forget James Foley and
Steven Sotloff, the lives they led as
successful journalists, and how loved
they were by their families and
friends,
Marco
said . The U.S. Senate
should honor these brave men by approving
this resolution as soon as Congress
reconvenes next week. The American people
should also never lose sight of the fact
that these awful executions are only the
beginning of ISILs plans to sow
evil across the Middle East and the
world, unless we stop them.

reported killing of Steven Sotloff, an

Rubio Calls On Reid To Allow A Senate
Vote On Venezuela Sanctions Bill
On Thursday, Marco called on Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to allow
the Senate to vote on the
Venezuela Defense
of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of
2014
, a bill authorizing sanctions on
individuals involved in serious human
rights violations against peaceful
demonstrators in Venezuela, immediately
following the Senates return to
session next week.
In
a letter to
Reid
, Marco highlights the Maduro
regimes influence over blocking the
bill in the Senate last month, and urges
Reid to ensure that the grotesque human
rights violations in Venezuela receive due
attention from the U.S. Senate.
This sweeping arc of human
rights abuse demands the attention of the
United States Congress,
wrote Rubio . You were
quoted in July saying that you support
bipartisan legislation to sanction the
Venezuelan officials responsible, yet in
the two months since, the heart wrenching
stories of savage violence from the
Maduro government have worsened while
Congressional action has only
stalled.
Just last month, as the Senate
was about to pass the sanctions bill that
unanimously passed the House,
Maduros regime found a way to
influence our legislative process,
added Rubio . Even though
the legislation would have targeted
individuals only and posed no threat to
American jobs or Venezuelan firms, a
Venezuelan government-controlled oil
company with operations in the U.S.
succeeded in convincing a member of the
Senates Democratic majority to
block the bills passage.
As Majority Leader, I hope you
will use your authority toensure
that the bipartisan legislation
sanctioning Venezuelan
officials-legislation which
you have spoken in favor of
will
be allowed an up or down vote immediately
upon our return onSeptember 8
th ,
continued Rubio .
During a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing in May, Rubio
listed at least 23
Maduro regime officials
that should be targeted for sanctions
due to their involvement in human rights
abuses against the Venezuelan people.
