THE 12TH DISTRICT
|
LEGISLATION
Dear
David,
I
believe one of my most important functions as your elected
representative is to connect you with community resources that will help enrich
your lives, which is why I host multiple resource fairs a
year.
Within the few weeks alone, I have hosted a Senior Fair and a
Veterans Resource Fair which provided dozens of vendors offering a
variety of services for hundreds of my constituents.
I want to
make sure seniors are able to access the services and information that
will help keep them healthy. The Senior Fair served as a one-stop shop
for seniors to receive a variety of check-ups and assistance,
including health and wellness suggestions, nutritional guidance, home health
care services, and identity protection tips.
The
Veterans Resource Fair was my 8th annual fair to honor the service of those
who have worn the uniform of the U.S. Armed Forces. The event
provided veterans in the Tampa Bay area with access to a variety of available
services and resources, including medical care, disability claims
assistance, education benefits counseling, and employment
information.
Going forward, I want to hear from you! It is my job to be as
accessible to my constituents as possible. Are there other resource
fairs you would like to see me hold in the District? Please answer the
question below and tell me what you think!
What resource fair would you most like me to
host next?
Select One Hurricane Preparedness Fair College and
Education Fair Jobs Fair Personal Finance Fair Flood

Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
