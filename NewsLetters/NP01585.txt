Kansas Common Sense
April 13, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." I am already back in Washington,
D.C., and ready to work. It was good to spend the days around Easter in
Kansas.
Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
Wrapping Up Second Tour of Kansas' 105 Counties
This week, I completed my second series of town hall meetings in each
of Kansas' 105 counties with stops in Goodland, Tribune, Leoti,
Satanta, Greensburg, Pratt and South Hutchinson. Thanks to each of the
communities for the welcome and conversations about issues affecting
Kansas and the country. Click here
to see a story about why I
find town hall meetings so valuable in The Hutchinson News. For
upcoming town hall meetings, visit my website.
Sherman County
I held my Sherman County Kansas Listening Tour stop in Goodland at the
Shiraz Restaurant. Thanks to the folks who came out to share concerns
about a number of issues including VA health care, the Iran nuclear
deal, the Keystone XL Pipeline and Farm Bill implementation. Thank you
also to State Rep. Rick Billinger for attending and Penny Livengood for
hosting.
Greeley County
Thanks to the 20 Greeley County area residents for attending my Kansas
Listening Tour stop in Tribune. We visited about numerous issues facing
our state and nation including the new veteran's health care law, the
budget, protecting privacy and the Iran nuclear deal. Thanks also to
Kansas Rep. Russell Jennings for attending and to Kristen Crittenden
for hosting the conversation.
Wichita County
Next, I stopped in Wichita County where area residents shared feedback
with me on the lesser prairie chicken listing, Waters of the United
States, border security and federal government overreach. Thanks to the
20 folks who attended including Kansas Rep. Don Hineman. I appreciated
Simone Elder for hosting at the Wichita County Business C.A.R.E. Center.
Haskell County
My last Kansas Listening Tour stop on Thursday was in conjunction with
the Satanta Lions Club Meeting. It was great to have so many Haskell
County residents attend and visit with me about issues facing our state
and nation. Lions Clubs International is the world's largest service
club organization, including more than 270 clubs in Kansas. In addition
to its efforts to conquer blindness, the organization has made a strong
commitment to community service, disaster relief, and helping youth in
Kansas and throughout the world. Thanks to Kansas Rep. Steve Alford for
attending, and to the Satanta Lions Club for hosting.
Kiowa County
Thanks to the more than 20 Kiowa County residents who came out to my
Kansas Listening Tour stop in Greensburg. We discussed a number of
issues important to this resilient community, our state and the nation
including veterans' affairs, the Greensburg Post Office and overall
community recovery, health care and the confusing tax code. Thanks to
Kiowa County Memorial Hospital Administrator Mary Sweet for hosting the
event.
Pratt County
It was great to have nearly 50 folks come out for my town hall meeting
at Pratt Community College. We discussed veterans' issues, importance
of the SGR Doc Fix, concerns regarding the USDA's Dietary Guideline
Recommendations, Iran nuclear deal and the need for manufacturing jobs.
Thanks to Pratt Community College President Dr. Mike Calvert and Debbie
Hearn for hosting the conversation.
Reno County
In South Hutchinson, special thanks to Kansas Rep. Jan Pauls, County
Commissioner Dan Deming and Dr. Ed Berger for attending. Thank you also
to South Hutchinson City Administrator Matt Stiles for arranging the
visit, and to South Hutchinson Housing Authority Executive Director
Annette Boyer for hosting. Here, I'm pictured visiting after the
meeting with Mo Yoder.
Iran's Leaders Dispute Framework, Demonstrate Additional Need for
Congressional Oversight
Since the announcement of agreed framework for an international accord
regarding Iran's nuclear program, there has been a surprising amount of
disagreement. Iranian leaders object to the terms of the framework as
outlined in the summarizing "fact sheet" published by the Obama
Administration.
These disagreements are not insignificant and threaten key provisions
of the proposed deal. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has
claimed his support, necessary for a nuclear deal, requires all
sanctions to be lifted immediately upon Iran's signature.
This demand is unacceptable and problematic as diplomats attempt to
negotiate a final deal by June 30. Given the gravity and lack of
clarity of the negotiations to date, Congress must have an opportunity
to review and evaluate any such deal. This week, the Senate is
considering bipartisan legislation, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review
Act of 2015 (S. 615) that would require as much. I support this
legislation and the broader position that Congress and the American
people should have a say in the final decision on policy of such
importance as preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
University of Kansas Medical Center Visit
Before heading west, I toured the research laboratories at the
University of Kansas Medical Center's Department of Anatomy and Cell
Biology and received a briefing on current research projects. The
success of KUMC is directly associated with the quality its research
and education. This tradition of excellence resulted in the KU Kansas
Cancer Center earning prestigious National Cancer Institute designation
in 2012. And KUMC's reputation attracts the best and brightest,
enabling our state to continue developing into a research powerhouse.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, I
strongly support investing in medical research. By doing so, we are
investing in our future and driving economic growth. Pictured with me
is the impressive lab team I met on Monday - left to right: Isabella
Fuentes, Julie Christianson (Assistant Professor), Angela Pierce, and
Frank Wang. Thanks again to Karen L Miller, Ph.D., Dean of the School
of Nursing and Health Professions; Peter G. Smith, Ph.D., Senior
Associate Dean of Research; and Jamie Caldwell, M.B.A., Executive
Director of the KU Medical Center Research Institute for the impressive
and informative visit.
Visiting Kansas Community Hospitals
This week, I met with hospital administrators and health care providers
at three Kansas community hospitals to learn more about their efforts
to provide quality care to patients. During my time representing
Kansans in Washington, D.C., I have had the opportunity to visit each
of the 128 community hospitals in Kansas. Meeting with Kansas hospital
administrators, physicians, nurses and other staff gives me important
insight on the challenges they face caring for patients.
Rawlins County Health Center
On Thursday, I traveled to Atwood to visit Rawlins County Health Center
(RCHC). RCHC is a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) with more than 70
employees, making it one of the largest employers in Rawlins County.
Access to hospitals like RCHC and other health care providers
determines whether Kansans can remain in the communities they call
home, and whether their children can return to raise families of their
own. During my visit, our conversation focused on the importance of
access to quality health care services, as well as how local providers
utilize resources to care for patients spread across a wide geographic
area. Thanks to RCHC CEO/Administrator Sharon Cox for the tour.
Cheyenne County Hospital
Later Thursday morning, I stopped in Saint Francis to visit Cheyenne
County Hospital (CCH) - also a CAH. CCH CEO Scott Jenkins led me on a
tour of the facility. During the visit, we discussed ways to encourage
young people pursuing careers in health care to return to Kansas and
their hometown to practice their profession. The federal government
should create an environment that helps - not hinders - the ability of
our Kansas communities to recruit and retain highly qualified medical
professionals. Since Scott is a Saint Francis native, his insight on
this subject is particularly useful. Thanks to Scott, and all the CCH
administrators and medical staff for the informative visit.
Western Plains Medical Complex
On Friday, I was in Dodge City to visit the Western Plains Medical
Complex (WPMC). WPMC is a 99-bed hospital that serves as a regional
patient referral center for Southwest Kansas. Since my last visit, WPMC
has made several significant investments in its facility including a
new therapy pool, special procedures room and state-of-the-art
communications technologies. Late last year, WPMC also broke ground on
a new Women's Center, and expects the it to begin serving patients in
June. The new, 13,000 square foot facility will be connected to the
main hospital and feature 10 rooms for labor, delivery, recover and
postpartum care. Thanks to WPMC CEO Mike Burroughs for the tour and
work to enhance the quality of care delivered to folks in Dodge City
and the surrounding area.
Kansas National Guard Joint Force Headquarters
On Tuesday, I visited the Kansas National Guard (KSNG) Joint Force
Headquarters in Topeka to learn more about their innovative analytical
and intelligence capabilities with the Fusion Center, and how they are
used against existing and emerging threats to the homeland. The Fusion
Center in Kansas offers a one-of-a-kind model that is capable of
collaborating with various federal agencies and private sector partners
to analyze and prevent potential biological, terrorist and cyber
threats in Kansas and across the country. Thanks to The Adjutant
General of Kansas, Maj. Gen. Lee Tafanelli for his leadership on this
critical effort and for taking the time to explain the instrumental
work the Fusion Center conducts to protect Kansans and all Americans.
Stopping by Tony's Pizza Plant in Salina
On Wednesday, I stopped by Tony's Pizza Plant in Salina where I was
honored to be presented with the National Association of Manufacturers
(NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence by Schwan Food
Company Senior Director of Manufacturing/Tony's Pizza Plant Director
John St. Aubin.
Representing a state that is home to nearly 3,200 aviation and
manufacturing businesses, I understand the importance of investing in
jobs and manufacturing right here in the United States. Exports are
vital to the Kansas economy and Kansas jobs, and our state must
continue to build quality products to stay competitive in the global
marketplace. I will continue my efforts in Congress to support this
important industry, as Kansans continue to build quality products that
allow our businesses to stay competitive in the global marketplace.
Thanks to President Jay Timmons and Chip Tangen at NAM, as well as
Tony's Pizza Plant director John St. Aubin, for their kind words and
hospitality.
Opening of new Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport
It was a pleasure to tour the new Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National
Airport over the weekend. With the Air Capital of the World's deep
roots in aviation, the Wichita community now has an airport that fits
its rich tradition while honoring Kansas' own President Eisenhower. The
new terminal will officially open in May. Here, I'm pictured with
Basehor resident Merrill Eisenhower Atwater-the President's great
grandson.
Honoring Victims on One-Year Anniversary of Overland Park Shooting
Today marks one year since the shocking attacks in Johnson County that
took lives, broke hearts, and pained entire communities. Today, as on
many days in the past year, much is being done to honor the lives of
Reat Underwood, William Corporon and Terri LaManno. While the victims'
families and friends have suffered an irreparable loss, it is
comforting to see our communities reject the hatred that caused the
horror and come together to honor their memory.
Honoring Robert Carmichael's Life
In every Kansas community one person can make a tremendous difference.
At the United Methodist Church in Plainville over the weekend we
honored the life of Robert Carmichael, longtime business owner and
civic leader who did just that. Bob and Erma and their family were our
neighbors for awhile and my employer in Junior High and High School.
Robba and I offer our condolences on Bob's death, and gratitude for a
longtime friendship between our families. Thanks Bob for making
Plainville a better place with a brighter future. Robba and I extend
our sympathies and prayers to Robert's entire family, including his
wife Erma, and children Wes, Kelly and Robyn.

Iran's
Leaders
Dispute
Framework,
Demonstrate
Additional
Need
for
Congressional
Oversight
Since
the
announcement
of
agreed
framework
for
an
international
accord
regarding
Iran's
nuclear
program,
there
has
been
a
surprising
amount
of
disagreement.
Iranian
leaders
object
to
the
terms
of
the
framework
as
outlined
in
the
summarizing
"fact
sheet"
published
by
the
Obama
Administration.
These
disagreements
are
not
insignificant
and
threaten
key
provisions
of
the
proposed
deal.
Iran's
Supreme
Leader
Ayatollah
Khamenei
has
claimed
his
support,
necessary
for
a
nuclear
deal,
requires
all
sanctions
to
be
lifted
immediately
upon
Iran's
signature.
This
demand
is
unacceptable
and
problematic
as
diplomats
attempt
to
negotiate
a
final
deal
by
June
30.
Given
the
gravity
and
lack
of
clarity
of
the
negotiations
to
date,
Congress
must
have
an
opportunity
to
review
and
evaluate
any
such
deal.
This
week,
the
Senate
is
considering
bipartisan
legislation,
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
of
2015
(S.
615)
that
would
require
as
much.
I
support
this
legislation
and
the
broader
position
that
Congress
and
the
American
people
should
have
a
say
in
the
final
decision
on
policy
of
such
importance
as
preventing
Iran
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapons.
University
of
Kansas
Medical
Center
Visit
Before
heading
west,
I
toured
the
research
laboratories
at
the
University
of
Kansas
Medical
Center's
Department
of
Anatomy
and
Cell
Biology
and
received
a
briefing
on
current
research
projects.
The
success
of
KUMC
is
directly
associated
with
the
quality
its
research
and
education.
This
tradition
of
excellence
resulted
in
the
KU
Kansas
Cancer
Center
earning
prestigious
National
Cancer
Institute
designation
in
2012.
And
KUMC's
reputation
attracts
the
best
and
brightest,
enabling
our
state
to
continue
developing
into
a
research
powerhouse.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
I
strongly
support
investing
in
medical
research.
By
doing
so,
we
are
investing
in
our
future
and
driving
economic
growth.

Visiting
Kansas
Community
Hospitals
This
week,
I
met
with
hospital
administrators
and
health
care
providers
at
three
Kansas
community
hospitals
to
learn
more
about
their
efforts
to
provide
quality
care
to
patients.
During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals
in
Kansas.
Meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses
and
other
staff
gives
me
important
insight
on
the
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients.
Rawlins
County
Health
Center
On
Thursday,
I
traveled
to
Atwood
to
visit
Rawlins
County
Health
Center
(RCHC).
RCHC
is
a
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH)
with
more
than
70
employees,
making
it
one
of
the
largest
employers
in
Rawlins
County.
Access
to
hospitals
like
RCHC
and
other
health
care
providers
determines
whether
Kansans
can
remain
in
the
communities
they
call
home,
and
whether
their
children
can
return
to
raise
families
of
their
own.
During
my
visit,
our
conversation
focused
on
the
importance
of
access
to
quality
health
care
services,
as
well
as
how
local
providers
utilize
resources
to
care
for
patients
spread
across
a
wide
geographic
area.
Thanks
to
RCHC
CEO/Administrator
Sharon
Cox
for
the
tour.
Cheyenne
County
Hospital
Later
Thursday
morning,
I
stopped
in
Saint
Francis
to
visit
Cheyenne
County
Hospital
(CCH)
&ndash;
also
a
CAH.
CCH
CEO
Scott
Jenkins
led
me
on
a
tour
of
the
facility.
During
the
visit,
we
discussed
ways
to
encourage
young
people
pursuing
careers
in
health
care
to
return
to
Kansas
and
their
hometown
to
practice
their
profession.
The
federal
government
should
create
an
environment
that
helps
&ndash;
not
hinders
&ndash;
the
ability
of
our
Kansas
communities
to
recruit
and
retain
highly
qualified
medical
professionals.
Since
Scott
is
a
Saint
Francis
native,
his
insight
on
this
subject
is
particularly
useful.
Thanks
to
Scott,
and
all
the
CCH
administrators
and
medical
staff
for
the
informative
visit.
Western
Plains
Medical
Complex
On
Friday,
I
was
in
Dodge
City
to
visit
the
Western
Plains
Medical
Complex
(WPMC).
WPMC
is
a
99-bed
hospital
that
serves
as
a
regional
patient
referral
center
for
Southwest
Kansas.
Since
my
last
visit,
WPMC
has
made
several
significant
investments
in
its
facility
including
a
new
therapy
pool,
special
procedures
room
and
state-of-the-art
communications
technologies.
Late
last
year,
WPMC
also
broke
ground
on
a
new
Women's
Center,
and
expects
the
it
to
begin
serving
patients
in
June.
The
new,
13,000
square
foot
facility
will
be
connected
to
the
main
hospital
and
feature
10
rooms
for
labor,
delivery,
recover
and
postpartum
care.
Thanks
to
WPMC
CEO
Mike
Burroughs
for
the
tour
and
work
to
enhance
the
quality
of
care
delivered
to
folks
in
Dodge
City
and
the
surrounding
area.
Kansas
National
Guard
Joint
Force
Headquarters
On
Tuesday,
I
visited
the
Kansas
National
Guard
(KSNG)
Joint
Force
Headquarters
in
Topeka
to
learn
more
about
their
innovative
analytical
and
intelligence
capabilities
with
the
Fusion
Center,
and
how
they
are
used
against
existing
and
emerging
threats
to
the
homeland.
The
Fusion
Center
in
Kansas
offers
a
one-of-a-kind
model
that
is
capable
of
collaborating
with
various
federal
agencies
and
private
sector
partners
to
analyze
and
prevent
potential
biological,
terrorist
and
cyber
threats
in
Kansas
and
across
the
country.
Thanks
to
The
Adjutant
General
of
Kansas,
Maj.
Gen.
Lee
Tafanelli
for
his
leadership
on
this
critical
effort
and
for
taking
the
time
to
explain
the
instrumental
work
the
Fusion
Center
conducts
to
protect
Kansans
and
all
Americans.
Stopping
by
Tony's
Pizza
Plant
in
Salina
On
Wednesday,
I
stopped
by
Tony's
Pizza
Plant
in
Salina
where
I
was
honored
to
be
presented
with
the
National
Association
of
Manufacturers
(NAM)
Award
for
Manufacturing
Legislative
Excellence
by
Schwan
Food
Company
Senior
Director
of
Manufacturing/Tony's
Pizza
Plant
Director
John
St.
Aubin.
Representing
a
state
that
is
home
to
nearly
3,200
aviation
and
manufacturing
businesses,
I
understand
the
importance
of
investing
in
jobs
and
manufacturing
right
here
in
the
United
States.
Exports
are
vital
to
the
Kansas
economy
and
Kansas
jobs,
and
our
state
must
continue
to
build
quality
products
to
stay
competitive
in
the
global
marketplace.
I
will
continue
my
efforts
in
Congress
to
support
this
important
industry,
as
Kansans
continue
to
build
quality
products
that
allow
our
businesses
to
stay
competitive
in
the
global
marketplace.
Thanks
to
President
Jay
Timmons
and
Chip
Tangen
at
NAM,
as
well
as
Tony's
Pizza
Plant
director
John
St.
Aubin,
for
their
kind
words
and
hospitality.
Opening
of
new
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
National
Airport
It
was
a
pleasure
to
tour
the
new
Wichita
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
National
Airport
over
the
weekend.
With
the
Air
Capital
of
the
World's
deep
roots
in
aviation,
the
Wichita
community
now
has
an
airport
that
fits
its
rich
tradition
while
honoring
Kansas'
own
President
Eisenhower.
The
new
terminal
will
officially
open
in
May.
Here,
I'm
pictured
with
Basehor
resident
Merrill
Eisenhower
Atwater&mdash;the
President's
great
grandson.
Honoring
Victims
on
One-Year
Anniversary
of
Overland
Park
Shooting
Today
marks
one
year
since
the
shocking
attacks
in
Johnson
County
that
took
lives,
broke
hearts,
and
pained
entire
communities.
Today,
as
on
many
days
in
the
past
year,
much
is
being
done
to
honor
the
lives
of
Reat
Underwood,
William
Corporon
and
Terri
LaManno.
While
the
victims'
families
and
friends
have
suffered
an
irreparable
loss,
it
is
comforting
to
see
our
communities
reject
the
hatred
that
caused
the
horror
and
come
together
to
honor
their
memory.
Honoring
Robert
Carmichael's
Life
In
every
Kansas
community
one
person
can
make
a
tremendous
difference.
At
the
United
Methodist
Church
in
Plainville
over
the
weekend
we
honored
the
life
of
Robert
Carmichael,
longtime
business
owner
and
civic
leader
who
did
just
that.
Bob
and
Erma
and
their
family
were
our
neighbors
for
awhile
and
my
employer
in
Junior
High
and
High
School.
Robba
and
I
offer
our
condolences
on
Bob's
death,
and
gratitude
for
a
longtime
friendship
between
our
families.
Thanks
Bob
for
making
Plainville
a
better
place
with
a
brighter
future.
Robba
and
I
extend
our
sympathies
and
prayers
to
Robert's
entire
family,
including
his
wife
Erma,
and
children
Wes,
Kelly
and
Robyn.
