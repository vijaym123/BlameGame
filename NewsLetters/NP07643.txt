Dear Friends,
While it is fun to soak up the sun
during South Florida's seemingly endless summer days, I encourage you
to enjoy the outdoors responsibly. Sun safety will help keep you and
your loved ones healthy and ready to enjoy our beautiful South Florida
weather for many years to come.
As is the case with most
things, moderation is key. And while that fact may seem obvious to many
of us, it is important to start early in teaching our children and
grandchildren this lifesaving fact. Early safety education also includes
regular reminders when going outdoors to always apply sunscreen! Your
loved ones deserve to know that it is ok to enjoy the sunshine, but
that it does not have to take a toll on their health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched SunWise, a nationwide
program available to schools and educational organizations to promote
sun-safe behaviors. Since its start in 1999, more than 18,000 schools
and one million students from K-8 have benefitted from the program.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that by giving practical
tips on how to enjoy the sun responsibly, SunWise will prevent more
than 11,000 cases of skin cancer by 2015.
Thankfully, Miami has
dozens of family friendly opportunities for you and your family to
enjoy this summer. From parks such as Biscayne National Park with its
fantastic snorkeling and fishing to the Deering Estate, a late
19th century manor and park offering historical tours, canoeing, and hikes.
There are also hidden gems including the Coral Castle, built by a
Latvian immigrant to South Florida in 1920. Of course, kids will always
enjoy a trip to Zoo Miami to see their favorite animals first-hand and
up close!
You can find a full listing of parks, activities, and
programs near you at

However you choose to take advantage of our
beautiful South Florida weather, always remember sun safety. Your children,
grandchildren, and loved ones will be thankful that you
did!
Sincerely,
Ileana
