Earlier today, Ami told you that he is the TOP target for Republican outside spending in the entire country.
We were pretty worried here at campaign headquarters...but then YOU STEPPED UP!
In fact, as of 8pm, we&rsquo;re just 43 donations short of 6OO strong for October.
If we can get there by midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a HUGE victory for our campaign at the best possible moment!
But if we fall short, it could put us in a really tough spot heading into the final three weeks.
