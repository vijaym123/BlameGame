Working Hard for Florida's 18th District
Rep. Murphy greeted local WWII veterans during their Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. on the 70th anniversary of D-Day to visit the nation's monuments and memorials honoring their service to our nation.
Better Serving Our Veterans
I was pleased that the Florida Cabinet unanimously approved the recommendation of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs to build their new VA nursing facility in St. Lucie County.
The goal of the new facility is to provide service to aging veterans within a 75-mile radius; that radius on the Treasure Coast is home to over 200,000 veterans, half of which are seniors over the age of 65.
Additionally, the new facility is estimated to create nearly 200 new area jobs.
It is great to see that St. Lucie County has been officially awarded Floridas newest VA nursing home. This facility will provide veterans of the Treasure Coast and surrounding areas the health care, follow-up assistance, and long-term care services that they deserve and will truly be an asset to our community.
I thank the FDVA, Governor Scott, and the Florida Cabinet for making this a priority as well as our legislative delegation and local officials for their tireless efforts to make this a reality.
Making Sure Our Voices are Heard in Opposition to AAF
In April, Rep. Murphy joined Tequesta officials to view the concerns with the Loxahatchee River train trestle bridge firsthand.
The draft Environmental Impact Statement for All Aboard Florida released last week has raised more questions than it answers. While the 75 day public comment period is a marked improvement from the 45 day minimum required by law, it is still inadequate to understand and consider the concerns that countless Floridians have about the proposal.
To have enough time to listen to, understand, and process the concerns of so many concerned Treasure Coast and Palm Beach citizens, I am urging the Federal Railroad Administration to extend the public comment period to at least 90 days.
As a reminder, you can participate in the comment period by sending your comments to FRA at the address below or electronically via:
AAF_comments@vhb.com .
FRA Address for Public Comments:
Mr. John Winkle, Federal Railroad Administration
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Room W38-311, Washington, DC 20590
Additionally, the FRA will be hosting several local information meetings, taking place in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Stuart, Port St. Lucie, Vero Beach, Cocoa, and Orlando over the last week of October and first two weeks of November.
