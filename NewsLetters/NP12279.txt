Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Another Obamacare Delay
Last week the Treasury Department announced another delay in
implementing the President's health care law. Businesses with 50 or
more employees were originally to provide qualified health insurance to
their employees by January 1, 2014.
The Administration arbitrarily delayed that by one year to 2015. Now
they are once again delaying implementing this part of the law for
businesses with 50-99 employees to January 1, 2016.
While I am happy that businesses are getting this break, Americans who
buy their own insurance policies have not gotten any breaks. They are
stuck going on the exchange and probably having to pay higher premiums
for less coverage.
The President has selectively chosen which parts of the law he delays
or implements. That's not how our system of government should work.
Unfortunately It's Tax Time Again
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) actually offers free tax filing
services on its website (www.irs.gov/freefile
). Electronic filing is available for taxpayers with a 2013
adjusted gross income of $58,000 or less. You then select from one of
the national online tax services to actually file your return.
Those with higher incomes may use the fill-in-the blank form online.
Additionally, many of the basic tax forms are available on the IRS
website (www.irs.gov
) on the upper left hand side of the homepage. Once you've filed your
tax return, you can also check on your refund status on the IRS website.
Assistance Available
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the
Elderly (TCE) are available at locations throughout the 15th District.
VITA volunteers help those with incomes of less than $52,000 prepare
their returns. TCE volunteers help those 60 and older who may have
specific issues related to retirement income.
Find the location nearest you by searching for either a VITA or TCE
site at http://goo.gl/p7QOOo

Paris Schools Visited
On Thursday I visited Crestwood Junior High School and Mayo Middle
School (shown above) in Paris, Illinois. Students at both schools had
great questions and were very attentive.
Call my Maryville office to
schedule a visit to your school.
Announcements
Open Office Hours: I will be available to meet with local constituents
at my Danville office on Thursday, February 20, from 2:30 till 4:00
p.m. Call 217-446-0664 for an appointment.
My office is located in the U.S. Courthouse, 201 North Vermilion
Street, Suite 218, Danville. These are one-on-one meetings, so that
both constituents and I get an opportunity to discuss the issue -
whether a personal problem with a federal agency or an opinion on an
issue.
Staff Traveling Help Desk: A member of my staff will be at the Villa
Grove Municipal Building, 612 East Front Street, on Thursday, February
27, from 10:30 till 12 noon and on Tuesday, March 4, from 2:30 till
4:00 p.m. at the Germantown Village Hall, 306 Prairie Avenue.
These are opportunities for you to meet directly with my staff in your
hometown instead of having to travel to one of my offices. No
appointment is necessary.
Just stop in.
Valentines for Heroes: Thank you to everyone who participated in our
seventh annual effort to bring some holiday cheer to our nation's
active and retired military. Around 10,000 valentines were distributed
to various locations. I was able to deliver some myself at the Mattoon
and Effingham VA clinics.
President's Day: Monday, February 17, is the federal holiday honoring
our nation's presidents, and all of my offices will be closed.
