BREAKING: HOUSE TO VOTE ON MEDICARE-DESTRUCTION BILL TOMORROW
We have fewer than 36 hours to stop the unthinkable, so we&rsquo;ll move quickly:
The House is voting on the disastrous GOP-proposed budget tomorrow. It&rsquo;s basically a copy of the Ryan Budget from last year -- cuts to Medicare and defunding Obamacare all included.
All the while, millionaires and billionaires get an even larger payday.
Don&rsquo;t forget:
This year Republicans have a hold on both Houses of Congress.
This horrible budget could actually pass!
NAME: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00
We need to raise $100,000 before the vote tomorrow to STOP this atrocious budget.
David -- will you step up?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
