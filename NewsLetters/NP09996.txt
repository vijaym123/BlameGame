Fighting for Answers After Benghazi
Dear Friends,
On September 11, 2012 our nation's consulate in Benghazi, Libya came
under attack by radical, Islamic terrorists, resulting in the deaths of
four brave Americans including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. In the
weeks and months that followed, House Republicans began aggressive
oversight efforts to learn the truth of what happened and how this
heinous attack could have been prevented. Unfortunately, nearly 20
months later, many questions remain unanswered while the Obama
Administration continues to stonewall and mislead about how this event
unfolded.
Most recently, White House emails
obtained by the watchdog
group Judicial Watch show that in the immediate aftermath of the
Benghazi attack, the Administration was focused on protecting President
Obama's image and furthering the narrative that this terrorist attack
was instead a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video-a claim that has
been repeatedly proven to be false.
Even more troubling, these emails were withheld by the Administration
from Congress even after our committees had issued subpoenas for all
information regarding the Benghazi attack. It was not until a judge
ordered the emails to be turned over under the Freedom of Information
Act that the White House finally disclosed the documents-showing a
troubling effort from the White House to keep these communications
hidden from the American people. And when the media finally pressed
former Administration officials on this cover up, former National
Security Council Spokesman Tommy Vietor flippantly responded
"dude, that was like two years ago."
While the Obama Administration may be content to move on from the
terrorist attack in Benghazi without a full understanding of what went
wrong and who should be held accountable, my constituents are not. I
have received hundreds and hundreds of emails and phone calls from you
about this attack in recent months, asking that Congress continue our
pursuit of the facts. To that end, I have been a cosponsor of
legislation calling for a select committee to investigate the Benghazi
attack for more than a year, and I am pleased that yesterday the House
took action by passing
a
bipartisan measure to accomplish this goal.
The House's select committee on Benghazi will be led by Congressman
Trey Gowdy, a tenacious former prosecutor who I am confident will carry
out his duties fairly and impartially; following the facts wherever
they may lead. I look forward to following the committee's work and am
hopeful that the Members entrusted with this task can deliver the
answers and accountability the American people deserve. Stay up to date
with the latest developments at www.gop.gov/Benghazi

Diane Black

Fighting
for
Answers
After
Benghazi
Dear
Friends,
On
September
11,
2012
our
nation&#8217;s
consulate
in
Benghazi,
Libya
came
under
attack
by
radical,
Islamic
terrorists,
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
four
brave
Americans
including
U.S.
Ambassador
Chris
Stevens.
In
the
weeks
and
months
that
followed,
House
Republicans
began
aggressive
oversight
efforts
to
learn
the
truth
of
what
happened
and
how
this
heinous
attack
could
have
been
prevented.
Unfortunately,
nearly
20
months
later,
many
questions
remain
unanswered
while
the
Obama
Administration
continues
to
stonewall
and
mislead
about
how
this
event
unfolded.
Most
recently,
White
House
emails
obtained
by
the
watchdog
group
Judicial
Watch
show
that
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
Benghazi
attack,
the
Administration
was
focused
on
protecting
President
Obama&#8217;s
image
and
furthering
the
narrative
that
this
terrorist
attack
was
instead
a
spontaneous
reaction
to
a
YouTube
video&#8212;a
claim
that
has
been
repeatedly
proven
to
be
false.
Even
more
troubling,
these
emails
were
withheld
by
the
Administration
from
Congress
even
after
our
committees
had
issued
subpoenas
for
all
information
regarding
the
Benghazi
attack.
It
was
not
until
a
judge
ordered
the
emails
to
be
turned
over
under
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
that
the
White
House
finally
disclosed
the
documents&#8212;showing
a
troubling
effort
from
the
White
House
to
keep
these
communications
hidden
from
the
American
people.
And
when
the
media
finally
pressed
former
Administration
officials
on
this
cover
up,
former
National
Security
Council
Spokesman
Tommy
Vietor
flippantly
responded
&#8220;dude,
that
was
like
two
years
ago.&#8221;
While
the
Obama
Administration
may
be
content
to
move
on
from
the
terrorist
attack
in
Benghazi
without
a
full
understanding
of
what
went
wrong
and
who
should
be
held
accountable,
my
constituents
are
not.
I
have
received
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
emails
and
phone
calls
from
you
about
this
attack
in
recent
months,
asking
that
Congress
continue
our
pursuit
of
the
facts.
To
that
end,
I
have
been
a
cosponsor
of
legislation
calling
for
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
Benghazi
attack
for
more
than
a

and
I
am
pleased
that
yesterday
the
House
took
action
by
passing
a
bipartisan
measure
to
accomplish
this
goal.
The
House&#8217;s
select
committee
on
Benghazi
will
be
led
by
Congressman
Trey
Gowdy,
a
tenacious
former
prosecutor
who
I
am
confident
will
carry
out
his
duties
fairly
and
impartially;
following
the
facts
wherever
they
may
lead.
I
look
forward
to
following
the
committee&#8217;s
work
and
am
hopeful
that
the
Members
entrusted
with
this
task
can
deliver
the
answers
and
accountability
the
American
people
deserve.
