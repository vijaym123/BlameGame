Palazzo Votes to Stop Executive Amnesty Action
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Congressman Steven Palazzo (MS-4 ) released the following statement today after voting in support of H.R. 5759, The Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act of 2014:
Todays vote was a strong rebuke of the presidents unconstitutional executive actions on illegal immigration.
Granting amnesty to nearly 5 million illegal immigrants is not within his authority, and it is not what the American people want.
The President of the United States of America
cannot simply bypass Congress or the law-abiding citizens who elected this Congress.
As one of the original five co-sponsors of todays bill, I was glad to see the House of Representatives fight back against this presidents blatant overreach.
It is the first step of what will be many in holding the president accountable for his unconstitutional actions on immigration.
H.R. 5759 reaffirms that only Congress has the power to write immigration laws, and prevents the president, now and in the future, f ro m using executive actions to defer the removal of individuals residing in our country illegally.

Palazzo is a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and currently serves as a noncommissioned officer in the Mississippi National Guard. The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States recently awarded Palazzo with the G.V. Sonny Montgomery Eagle Award for his work on the House Armed Services Committee.
