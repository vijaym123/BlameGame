Good evening--
Yesterday, I voted to establish a select House committee to investigate the actions related to the September 11, 2012, attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including our ambassador.
The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and many other House and Senate panels have carried out commendable investigations. They sought the truth and they produced stunning findings.
But last week, the American people learned that the White House withheld information from Congress.
You deserve transparency.
Congress deserves answers. This select committee
responding as one institution on behalf of the House
has been created with Americas common interest in mind:
To once and for all seek and find the truth to this horrific attack.
Our focus must be on transparency and accountability, not politics or pageantry. In launching this select committee, the speaker said, This doesnt need to be, shouldnt be, and will not be a partisan process. I couldnt agree more.
I look forward to this full and complete investigation.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
