About In Georgia's 6th
On Monday, I had
the great opportunity to stop by the Buckhead Rotary Club and share my
thoughts on what needs to be done and what efforts are under way to
help improve our economy. On Tuesday, we talked manufacturing at
Oldcastle in Atlanta and then took part in an event at St. Vincent de Paul on
free tax filing for low-income families.
It's
always good to be home and to hear from folks who are working hard to
make our communities a wonderful place to live and work. With Congress
back in session this coming week, I will, as always, be bringing back
to my colleagues in the House of Representatives the thoughts, ideas
and concerns of the hard-working folks who call Georgias 6 th
District home.
Supporting Our
Manufacturers
It was a real honor to receive the
National Association of Manufactures (NAM) Legislative Excellence Award in
Atlanta this past week. NAM represents nearly 12 million men and
women across the United States who work in the manufacturing
industry. Manufacturing contributes more than $1.8 trillion to the
U.S. economy annually and accounts for two-thirds of private-sector
research and development.
Economic growth does not
come from central planners in Washington. It comes from hard-working
Americans being able to expand and grow without government interference.
That is what I fight for in Congress, and I will continue to
advance policies that provide the greatest amount of opportunity for the
greatest number of Americans.
