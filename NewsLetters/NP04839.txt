Rep. Bob Goodlatte
What We Learned from a
State Dept. Memo...
Click
here to watch my interview on &quot;The Kelly File.&quot;
It&rsquo;s
alarming that senior Obama Administration officials
so fiercely denied
the existence of any plans to transport non-U.S. citizens infected with
Ebola to the United States for treatment when a leaked
State Department
document
shows that such a proposal indeed exists
and was approved by
officials. The internal memo shows that this proposal was approved by
several people at the State Department. Unfortunately,
this lack of
transparency is just another example of the current Administration
trying to hide its actions from the American people.
Secretaries Kerry and Johnson still have not responded to
my letter
inquiring about this proposal. The Administration must
be up front with
both Congress and the American people about its proposed plans to bring
non-U.S. citizens infected with this deadly disease to the
United
States for medical care.
Weekly Column: A
Real Economic Recovery
Over
the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve traveled throughout the Sixth Congressional
District visiting numerous businesses, getting a firsthand look at the
hard work their employees do, and listening to their concerns about the
direction of the economy. Whether large employers or small, family-owned
businesses, or if they are located in Roanoke, Front Royal, Amherst, or
Waynesboro, their comments have followed a common theme: the federal
government&rsquo;s policies of more regulation and higher taxes are standing
in the way of job creation.
Despite promises of hope and change, the
current Administration continues to push failed policies in the faces
of
the American people and the economy has yet to grow strong enough for
many families and businesses to feel much-needed relief. In an effort
to
provide this relief, the House Judiciary Committee, where I serve as
Chairman, has passed bill after bill to help spark economic growth,
create jobs
for Americans, and protect job creators. One ingredient
critical to a healthy, growing economy is regulatory reform that holds
federal bureaucrats
accountable for imposing burdens on America&rsquo;s
economy. This includes the
REINS Act , which requires federal
agencies to submit major
regulations to Congress for approval and
guarantees that no major regulations become effective until Congress
approves them. Another is the
Regulatory Accountability Act , which strives to lower the cost of new regulations.
Another ingredient to a more competitive America is an efficient and just legal system. The
Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act
reduces unnecessary and abusive litigation while preserving the rights of citizens to file legitimate lawsuits. The
FACT Act
brings
transparency to asbestos litigation practices. The
Innovation Act,
which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, defends
America&rsquo;s job creators and innovators against abusive patent trolls that
extort their money and steal their inventions.
These bills, which were passed by the
Judiciary Committee and then by the full House of
Representatives, are
an important step toward challenging the current strategy of the Obama
Administration and laying the foundation for a robust
economy. The House
has done its part to advance solutions, now it&rsquo;s time for the Senate to
join in providing relief. Job creators in the Sixth
District and
throughout the nation have the drive and innovative ideas to grow the
economy. But they should not foot the growing bill that the
Administration piles on them. They deserve a real economic recovery.
