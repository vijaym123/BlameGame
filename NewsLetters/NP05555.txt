New York Times: Secret Money Fueling a Flood of Political Ads
If you missed the
New York Times
latest report, here&rsquo;s what you need to know: We&rsquo;re in serious trouble.
Karl Rove just launched a massive campaign targeting Cheri. And yesterday, the
New York Times
announced Rove&rsquo;s spending millions in &ldquo;secret money&rdquo; to buy our elections. There&rsquo;s still time to set the record straight -- but we must do so
immediately.
David, the fate of Cheri&rsquo;s first re-election campaign is at stake. Will you chip in today?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Karl Rove and his secretive wealthy donors and corporations are desperate to defeat us.
They know our opponent will fight for
their
interests, not to give Illinois&rsquo; families a fair shot.
Please, David -- this election is too important to sit on the sidelines. Chip in right now:
