Ending the Privacy Violations in the PATRIOT Act
In 2001, I voted against the original authorization of the PATRIOT Act because I believed that it compromised our constitutionally-protected civil liberties.
Todays appeals court decision
confirms what Ive known all along:
the PATRIOT Act undermines our fundamental right to privacy.
In the coming weeks, as Congress considers renewing the PATRIOT Act, I will continue to fight to end these undemocratic invasions into the private lives of Americans.
