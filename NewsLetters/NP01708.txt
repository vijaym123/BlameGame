David -- We&rsquo;re sorry to email so early, but we&rsquo;ve asked and asked again &hellip; and as of 6 a.m. we&rsquo;re still dangerously behind on our goal.
This is the
FINAL NOTICE
of your member status before tonight&rsquo;s fundraising deadline.
David Johnson 2015-2016 Membership: FINAL NOTICE
Boehner and the Republicans just raked in $17.5 million in ONE NIGHT.
We need an ENORMOUS fundraising day to catch up.
Otherwise, the Republicans will DESTROY our progress.
You've supported us in the past, but you haven&rsquo;t re-upped your membership for 2015 . We need you NOW -- tonight&rsquo;s deadline could decide everything.
We need at least 1 donor from 60659 by tonight&rsquo;s midnight fundraising deadline to close the gap. Can you help?
