Restraining the
EPA
On Friday,
I joined
Senator David Vitter and Congressman Charles Boustany in
Lake Charles to discuss how the Obama Administration's policies will
destroy jobs.
By threatening to raise ozone standards to an
unreasonable level, the Obama Administration and the EPA could harm
our economy while doing little to help the environment.
My
Energy Consumers Relief Act
would help restrain the
EPA.
Strengthening our
Military
Last Tuesday,
I
urged Army Secretary
John McHugh to protect Fort Polk from defense
budget cuts.
Fort Polk is a critical asset for our national
security and Louisianas economy.
I recently visited Fort Polk
and will continue to support our troops who keep America
strong.
Supporting Stanford
Victims
Finally,
last week I
urged Securities Exchange Commission
Chair Mary Jo White to appeal the
D.C. Circuit Court decision that denied Stanford victims compensation
from the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation.
Investors in the Stanford Financial Group were victims of a cruel Ponzi
scheme, and we must do all we can to help these families achieve
justice.
I was successful
in pushing the SEC to
appeal a similar District Court decision, and I am hopeful that they
will carry their appeal to the Supreme Court.
