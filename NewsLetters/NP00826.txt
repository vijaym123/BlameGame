Stopping Government Encroachment on Water
Rights
5/12/15
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn voted in favor of H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection
Act. The bill requires the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to
withdraw a proposed rule increasing their jurisdiction under the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act.
"The proposed changes from the EPA and the Corps are a major
infringement on state and local control of water rights. H.R. 1732 is so
important because it will stop this out-of-control bureaucratic
overreach from the Obama Administration and will allow state and local
officials an increased role in any changes made to water policy. Expanding
the size and scope of the federal government's control over our lives
is not a path to prosperity or economic success, that's why I'm pleased
to support this much-needed dose of common
sense."

(CO-05)
