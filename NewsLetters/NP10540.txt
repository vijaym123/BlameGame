Congressman
Steve Stockman
Representing the 36th District
April 17, 2014
Stockman co-sponsors National Day of Prayer
Resolution
WASHINGTON -- Congressman Steve Stockman (R-TX 36) is co-sponsoring
H. Res. 547, the Bipartisan National Day of Prayer Resolution. This
resolution establishes May 1, 2014 as the 63rd annual National Day of
Prayer and reaffirms the importance of prayer in our nations
history.
Prayer is important to many Americans and will continue
to play a significant role in our society. I hope this resolution
encourages more Americans to come together to pray on May 1, said
Congressman Stockman. Judeo-Christian values are a cornerstone of the belief
in individual liberty and limited government.
Americans of all
faiths and beliefs should take time on May 1 to reflect on how faith in
God led our ancestors to limit the powers of earthly leaders and give
us the constitutionally-limited government that serves us
today.
