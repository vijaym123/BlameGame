David -- Here&rsquo;s the simple math:
Republican outside groups are outspending us 3-to-1 in key races. If we allow that to continue, they could have their strongest majority yet for the last two years of my presidency.
And you know what that means -- they&rsquo;ll make it harder than ever to do the things we need to do to move this country forward.
So I have a quick favor to ask:
We&rsquo;re up against the most urgent fundraising deadline we&rsquo;ve faced together. Can you chip in $5 or more today? Your gift will be tripled-matched. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
David, we can get this done. I just need you to step up before we lose our chance. http://dccc.org/Forward
Thanks,
Barack Obama
