Report from Maine
Earlier this month, I had the chance to spend a week in Maine touring
businesses, celebrating innovation and economic development, and
hearing the comments, concerns, and ideas of people across our state.
These visits took me across 7 counties, including stops in Augusta,
Greenwood, Westbrook, Bangor, Old Town, Rockland, and Rockport.
I visited the Island Institute in Rockland
and I had a
very productive discussion with the Institute leadership and staff
about the future of Maine's island and remote coastal communities. Some
of the issues that we covered included climate change and the dangerous
effects of ocean acidification
, broadband
and economic development, and
energy efficiency and sustainability (photo courtesy of Jason
Mann/Island Institute).
When was the last time you were at Mt. Abram Ski Resort
? The mountain's recent renewable energy projects
prove that investment in clean energy sources -- like their 803
solar-electric panels and two wood pellet-fired boilers -- can be good
for both business and the environment. That's me with owners Matt
Hancock and Rob Lally in front of Mt. Abram's array of solar panels,
the second-largest solar project at a ski resort in North America.
It was an honor to receive the "Friend of the Farm Bureau" award
from my good friend John Olson, Executive Secretary of
the Maine Farm Bureau in Augusta. Following the award ceremony, we
didn't waste any time getting right to work to discuss issues facing
Maine farmers, including losses caused by recent winter storms. Any
farmer who has experienced losses due to the weather, such as collapsed
buildings, green houses, or loss of livestock, should contact their
local Farm Service Agency (FSA) county office
.
I stopped by Governor's Restaurant for lunch when I was in Old Town
last week.
Report from Washington
Maine Community Health Options
(MCHO) co-founders Kevin Lewis and Robert
Hillman were in the
gallery when I spoke on the Senate floor
about their organization's role in
helping more than 60,000 Mainers sign up for health insurance. As one
of 23 cooperatives established through the Affordable Care Act, and the
only one in Maine, this Lewiston-based organization has adopted an
innovative approach to healthcare.
Meeting in my office with General John Campbell, the commander of the
International Security Force (ISAF) and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
General Campbell was in Washington earlier this month to testify before
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Policy Update
*
With my support, the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Dr. Ashton
Carter to be the new Secretary of Defense
. I look forward to working with him as a member
of both the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, and sharing
with him the vital role that Maine plays in our nation's security.
*
Together with a group of my colleagues, I pushed for a special
Affordable Care Act enrollment period in a letter to the
administration. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
recently announced that there will be a special enrollment period.
*
As I said in a short video recorded in my office
, the Federal Communication Commission's vote to
protect net neutrality is an historic action that will preserve the
open internet.
*
I have long called on Congress to fulfill its fundamental duty
to debate an Authorization of Military Force (AUMF)
for the
fight against ISIS. This month, the President submitted his proposed
AUMF to Congress.
