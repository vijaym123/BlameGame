Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Roe v. Wade Anniversary
This week marked the 41st anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court
decision, Roe v. Wade, and many marched for life in Washington, D.C. on
Wednesday despite the cold weather.
Due to this Supreme Court opinion from 1973, more than 55 million
children's lives have been lost to abortion and they never had a chance
to live, to dream or to grow up and do an untold number of great things
in this world. That we are marking yet another anniversary of this
tragic legal decision is a sad time for our nation.
As the father of five children, including adopted twin girls, I will
always be a voice for the sanctity of life because I know that life is
a sacred gift from God and should be protected by law.
District Work Week
It is always good to be back in Oklahoma, and I have had a great week
visiting people throughout the Second District.
A great visit in Claremore this week at BakerHughes.
Another stop in Claremore was with Mick Webber, the President and CEO
of Rotek.
Head Librarian Nancy Hamlin and Children's Librarian Carole Gill gave
me a tour of the new Patrick Lynch Public Library in Poteau.
I am proud to have Carl Albert State College in my district. It was
great to talk with President Ivey and Regents Huggins, Williams,
Lawson, and Reed this week in Poteau.

Visiting with residents at Go Ye Village in Tahlequah.
Tour at International Paper in Valliant-another great employer of
residents in District 2.
Great conversation with administrators at the John Paul Scroggins
Conference Center in Valliant.
Keystone XL Pipeline
On Wednesday, the southern leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline became
operational and is making commercial deliveries through the pipeline
from Oklahoma to refineries in Texas. Unfortunately, the fact remains
that the Obama Administration has delayed and stalled, for five years,
approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline's northern leg crossing our border
with Canada.
The Keystone XL project is a private sector investment into America's
economy with much-needed jobs and other revenues that benefit local
communities through which the pipeline passes. It will also reduce our
dependence on oil from countries that do not have America's best
interests at heart.
Touring construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline in Southeast Oklahoma
last year.
The southern leg of the pipeline is expected to carry 520,000 barrels
per day in its first year. When I toured the pipeline's construction
last year in Southeast Oklahoma, I met some of the highly skilled men
and women working on this project, including residents of the Second
District. Approving the northern leg of this project would mean jobs
for Americans. I renew my call to the Obama Administration to stop
delaying and permit the pipeline's northern leg construction
immediately.
Week Ahead
Next week, the fight for the sanctity of life continues. H.R. 7, the
"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," will be considered on the House
floor. This legislation prohibits taxpayer funded abortions under
Obamacare.
