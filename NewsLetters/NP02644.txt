Week in Review
The past couple of weeks have
brought both successes in
legislation and sadness back home
in Nevada for the loss of legendary
UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian.
Coach Tarkanian passed away
recently, leaving our state with a
sense of loss and pride. He was a
role model nationwide and left a
lasting impact on college
basketball. Senator Harry Reid and
I commemorated Coach Tarkanian by
passing a
Senate
Resolution
honoring his life's
work in basketball and his
community.
But aside from this great loss,
the past couple of weeks have been
successful.
Nevada was recognized as leading
the nation in solar jobs per
capita, with a 146 percent solar
job growth in 2014. Read more

Keystone XL legislation and
theClay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans
(SAV) Act made their final passage
through Congress and to the
President's desk. The Clay Hunt SAV
Act was signed into law by the
President, bringing great
opportunity for veterans struggling
with mental health.
I also introduced two bills that
are important in helping my fellow
Nevadans and people across the
country:
Douglas
County Lands Bill : The
legislation expands recreational
opportunities, promotes
conservation, and jump-starts
economic development in Douglas
County, Nevada.
Women
Veterans Access to Quality Care
Act : This legislation ensures
the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) adapts to meet the needs of
the expanding female veteran
population.
This last week, I spent time
back in the state for the
Presidents' Day recess.
I attended a round table hosted
by the International Franchise
Association in Las Vegas with small
business owners from Nevada to talk
about finances and legislation that
could benefit small businesses in
the state. I also caught up with
Sam Shad and Ray Hagar on Nevada
NewsMakers and Dan Mason on News
Talk 780 KOH in Reno.
I enjoyed being back in the
state to spend time with fellow
Nevadans and listen to their ideas
on key issues. I look forward to
getting back to Washington, D.C.,
to bring these views to Capitol
Hill.

Everyone who had the privilege of
