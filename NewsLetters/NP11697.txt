The
Presidents Irresponsible Budget
A budget is a
fiscal blueprint of the future.
It is an outline of ones
priorities that tells you what an individual or group considers important,
and also what they view as unimportant.
President
Obamas budget proposal for next year
which was delivered late once
again, for the fifth time in six years
demonstrates that his
priorities remain both higher taxes
to the tune of $1.8 trillion
and bigger
government in the form of new spending.
On the
other hand, it appears the president finds debt reduction to be
unimportant.
His budget does nothing to control the costs of our nations
entitlement programs, and makes no attempt to stop the reckless
spending and get our debt under control.
His proposal totals $3.9
trillion at a time when our federal government collects roughly $3
trillion in revenues
meaning more borrowing from countries like China will
be required to finance his government
spending.
With the federal debt totaling roughly $17.5 trillion, I had hoped that
the president would do more to address our nations fiscal
irresponsibility.
Instead, this budget once again does not balance, it adds
$8.3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years, and it does more to
grow the government rather than growing the economy.
At
the end of the day, unfortunately, the presidents budget is more of
the same - more taxes, more spending, more borrowing, more debt, and
more government.
It is not a serious plan for our nations
future.
