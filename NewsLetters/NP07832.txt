 for half an hour on Friday to try to fight off anti-home-rule riders that Republicans have been introducing.
I devoted the time to the bans on D.C. using its local funds to provide abortions to low-income women and to implement its local marijuana laws. Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), sponsored a marijuana rider, which has provoked D.C. Vote to call for a boycott of his district, Marylands Eastern Shore.
This is our city, not his.

Two Republicans Try to Drag D.C. into Their Anti-Union Bill
Last week, I called on Senate and House Republicans to end their attacks on the District of Columbias labor laws
after Senator David Vitter (R-LA) and Representative Paul Broun (R-GA) introduced the second bill this Congress uniquely attacking the labor laws of the District of Columbia.
Their bill, which undermines collective bargaining and portrays unions as violent, would not only undermine the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain, but it is particularly offensive because it reaches inside the District to undermine the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain here.
Defending the Districts Gun Safety Laws from Senator Rand Paul
Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) is at it again.
He filed an amendment on Wednesday that would eliminate the District of Columbias gun safety laws .
Fortunately, the underlying Sportsmens Act failed to get cloture to advance in the Senate and we therefore did not have to take this one out.
However, when the bill was still alive, I called out Senator Paul, the tea party standard-bearer, known for wanting to devolve power from the federal government to states and local governments.
Remember last year when Senator Paul visited Howard University to discuss the war on drugs?
We had hoped he might become an ally in keeping Congress out of D.C.s local affairs.
In any case, trying to wipe out the gun laws in the nations capital is no way to run for president.
D.C. Meeting Produces Recommendations for the Refugee Crisis at the Border from Latino Leaders
I had a very constructive meeting this week with my District of Columbia Congressional Latino Council (CLC) and other D.C. Latino leaders in response to the refugee crisis at the U.S. border .
[cid:image002.jpg@01CF9F8F.73F8AB10]
(Norton meeting with CLC)
The District and the region are home to one of the largest Central American immigrant populations from the countries from which children are fleeing
El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
Among the recommendations were avoiding change in current law that would send the children, many under age 10, back to the collapsed states where their safety would be jeopardized; providing the children and their relatives with legal counsel; and, a regional response from D.C. and the surrounding counties, including a statement by chief executives and Members of Congress that they will work collaboratively on this issue.
Decongesting the Traffic Outside of Union Station
On Thursday, I sent a letter
to officials at the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation (USRC) urging them develop a new plan to address traffic congestion in front of Union Station.
I have received complaints from residents, and even from Members of Congress, about missing train connections or having to get out of taxis and other vehicles in order to make trains and buses.
More Progress on Inmate Calling Service
On Wednesday, I spoke before a follow-up Federal Communications Commission (FCC) panel
led by Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the moving force behind the new Inmate Calling Services (ICS) reform, which has reduced telephone rates for families and inmates.
To her credit, Commissioner Clyburn invited experts to not only look at the impact of the FCCs ICS reform, but also at additional reforms on inmate calling services.
Kudos and thanks to Commissioner Clyburn not only from me, but from inmates and their families in D.C. and around the country!

Last week, I commemorated
the passing of Henry Minton Francis, Sr., a fifth-generation Washingtonian who was a graduate of Dunbar High School, the eighth African-American graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, and a deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense. Mr. Minton died on July 7, 2014, at the age of 93.
