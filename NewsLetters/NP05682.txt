BREAKING: Since we emailed you this morning, Karl Rove has piled in ANOTHER $1.7 million to defeat us.
There&rsquo;s no more &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; anymore.
If we don&rsquo;t raise $2OO,OOO today, this election is over.
We promised ourselves we wouldn&rsquo;t let Karl Rove buy another election. We promised ourselves we&rsquo;d have the grassroots strength to fight back. We don&rsquo;t want to see the election end this way. Please -- can you chip in to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action today?
