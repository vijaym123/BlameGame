Protecting Our Kids
Since Jan. 1 this year, 275 teachers have been arrested for sexual misconduct with a child.

Two-hundred seventy-five. That's the number of teachers across America who have been arrested for sexual misconduct with a student since January 1. It's more than one teacher for each day of the year so far.
When I last spoke on this subject on the Senate floor, in April, it was 130. Enough is enough.
It is time for the Senate to pass my bipartisan
Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act
and crack down on those who prey on children.
As the father of three young children, I cannot imagine the pain of a parent whose child has been sexually abused. As your U.S. senator, I am dedicated to strengthening laws to better protect kids - in Pennsylvania and across our country.
The House of Representatives passed this legislation
unanimously
last year. It's time for the Senate to finally do the same.
Standing With Israel
I co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution expressing support for the State of Israel as it defends itself against unprovoked attacks from the Hamas terrorist organization. I am pleased to report that the Senate has passed this resolution unanimously.
This resolution reaffirms the United States' support for Israel's right to defend its citizens and ensure its survival. It condemns unprovoked rocket fire at Israel and calls on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks. Lastly, it calls on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to dissolve the unity governing arrangement with Hamas and condemn the attacks on Israel.
Encouraging Entrepreneurship

Keystone Cup 2014!
Every year, my office squares off against Senator Bob Casey's staff in a
friendly, bipartisan game of softball on the National Mall . The series is all tied up at 2-2, so we'll have to wait until next summer to see who will take the lead! Thanks to everyone who came out for the game!
Put me in coach!
