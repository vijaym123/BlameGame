Friend,
The 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month of 1918 marked the signing of the armistice between Germany and the Allied nations ending World War I. The day was first commemorated the following year by President Wilson, who said this day should be "filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the countrys service and with gratitude for the victory."
On May 13, 1938, Congress declared Armistice Day a national holiday honoring veterans of WWI, and in 1954, Congress changed the holiday to Veterans Day to honor all American veterans.
The country owes a great debt to all the military men and women who served and stood ready at a moments notice to fight for our freedom and democracy. As a nation, it is our responsibility to care for our servicemembers abroad and when they come home.
As your congressman, I am committed to strengthening the quality of health care for veterans, and I will continue to work to increase the benefits available for veterans and ensure that members of the Armed Forces who bravely served this country receive all the benefits to which they are entitled.
Sincerely,
