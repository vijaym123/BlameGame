Friend,
Wanted to be sure you saw that the Health Care Conscience Rights Act ( H.R. 940 )
which I cosponsored
was introduced last week. This critical piece of legislation amends the Presidents healthcare law to make sure that religious organizations, private businesses, institutions of higher education, healthcare providers, and insurance companies are not required to sponsor insurance coverage or participate in medical procedures that violate their moral or religious beliefs.
I will keep you posted on the progress of this bill.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I also cosponsored the Life at Conception Act ( H.R. 816 ), which clarifies that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution begins at the moment of conception or fertilization.
