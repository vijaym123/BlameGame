Dear Friends,
In March, I introduced the
Social Security 2100 Act
to cut taxes for seniors, strengthen benefits, and ensure Social Security remains strong through this century. On Friday, May 8th, please join me at the Cromwell Town Hall for a Community Forum on Social Security to discuss my proposal and ask questions about this vital program
Community Forum on Social Security
Friday, May 8th, 1:30 PM &ndash; 2:30 PM
Cromwell Town Hall
Selectman&rsquo;s Meeting Room
41 West Street, Cromwell, CT 06416
Map it!
While Social Security remains the nation&rsquo;s bedrock retirement program, many do not believe it will be there for them when they retire. I am proud to have proposed
a common sense path forward to strengthen benefits now while ensuring Social Security will be here through the next century , and look forward to sharing this plan with you Friday.
Please
RSVP online
above or by calling my office at 860-278-8888. I look forward to seeing you there.
Sincerely,
