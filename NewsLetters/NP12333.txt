ALLEGAN, Mich. (WZZM) -- Michigan congressman Fred Upton says
a new law he authored
will help west Michigan pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Perrigo, while protecting consumers nationwide.
In November 2013, President Barack Obama signed the
Drug Quality and Security Act , aimed at regulating compounding pharmacies and establishing a track-and-trace pedigree system for drugs.
It was in response to the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak linked to a Massachusetts pharmacy that killed dozens of people, including many from Michigan.
Upton, a Republican from St. Joseph, toured the Perrigo plant Tuesday and spoke with reporters afterward. "Not only does it help employers with jobs created here - it also helps consumers at the end because they know the drugs they take are much safer," Upton said.
Upton said the national standards the Act creates are much more desirable, and less costly, than a patchwork of state regulations.
Perrigo employs 3,500 people in West Michigan and is one of the world's largest makers of generic drugs.
