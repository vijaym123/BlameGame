David -- Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s campaign arm just announced a stunning
$30 MILLION
ad buy to try and defeat top Democrats at the polls.
Boehner&rsquo;s hell-bent on picking up seats in the House -- and you can bet your bottom dollar he&rsquo;s got his sights set on Brad Schneider.
David, June 30th marks Brad&rsquo;s first major fundraising deadline since Boehner&rsquo;s groups revealed their massive ad buy. If we&rsquo;re going to fight back against the barrage of attacks, it&rsquo;s absolutely critical Brad has the resources to be competitive. David, will you chip in $5 or more right now to help Brad fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s cash? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Every day, I see Brad tirelessly working for Illinois&rsquo;s middle class families. But if Speaker Boehner has his way, the 10th district will fall into destructive Tea Party hands. Illinois Democrats can&rsquo;t afford to sit this one out. Please, chip in what you can right now: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-For-Brad
I&rsquo;m counting on you,
