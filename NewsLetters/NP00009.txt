A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
June 19, 2015
Dear Friends,
On Wednesday, I spoke on the Senate floor about the rising costs of
health care under Obamacare and the importance of moving to a system
that meets the needs of the 21st century while allowing true
competition.
There's a limit to what
government can do to try to fit a square peg in a round hole, and
that's what President Obama has attempted to do with his seriously
flawed health care law. The Affordable Care Act is a square peg that
for six years this administration has forced on the American people and
tried to fit in a round hole that doesn't exist. Obamacare has actually
raised the cost of health insurance, despite the president's promise
that it would lower costs and that Americans would be able to keep
their preferred insurance plans. Americans should have a reliable
choice of insurance policies and a system that doesn't mandate
increases but instead encourages competition and quality.
It is time to build a health care system for the 21st century for
America by encouraging innovation and competition, and not by making
arbitrary decisions on cost and taxation which drive people out of the
marketplace and out of business.
Watch my full remarks on the Senate floor here
.
Providing for the Common Defense
I am thrilled that my Senate colleagues passed the fiscal year 2016
defense authorization bill yesterday. This bill will provide a
blueprint for defense spending priorities to support our troops, and is
critical to our national security. I'm especially proud that the
National Defense Reauthorization Act included critical measures to
support and continue the successful missions at Georgia's military
installations. We need to be certain that we are giving our men and
women in uniform the very best support possible to accomplish their
missions and return home safely.
Listening to our Service Members
I enjoyed spending time with Sergeant Major
of the U.S. Army Dan Dailey to discuss the ways Congress and the
Department of Defense can better serve our veterans through the Soldier
for Life initiative and transition assistance programs.
Praying for Charleston
On Thursday, I joined my fellow congressmen and visitors to our
nation's Capitol at a prayer vigil for the victims of the tragedy at
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
Senseless violence has no place in the world and especially not at
church. Dianne and I will continue to lift Mayor Joe Riley and the
residents of that beautiful city up in prayer as we continue to seek
answers.
What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will return to trade legislation in the wake of
House passage of one of the key trade bills this week. In Georgia, 1.2
million jobs are directly related to international trade. Last year
alone, Georgia's farmers, manufacturers and companies exported $39.4
billion worth of goods around the globe. The trade legislation passed
by the House this week provides for unprecedented congressional
oversight of the negotiating process and it bars agreements from making
any changes to U.S. law without further congressional action. Congress
retains the authority to either approve the agreement, or to determine
that the agreement will not benefit the United States and to vote it
down.

Dear
Friends,
On
Wednesday,
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
about
the
rising
costs
of
health
care
under
Obamacare
and
the
importance
of
moving
to
a
system
that
meets
the
needs
of
the
21st
century
while
allowing
true
competition.
There's
a
limit
to
what
government
can
do
to
try
to
fit
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole,
and
that's
what
President
Obama
has
attempted
to
do
with
his
seriously
flawed
health
care
law.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
a
square
peg
that
for
six
years
this
administration
has
forced
on
the
American
people
and
tried
to
fit
in
a
round
hole
that
doesn't
exist.
Obamacare
has
actually
raised
the
cost
of
health
insurance,
despite
the
president's
promise
that
it
would
lower
costs
and
that
Americans
would
be
able
to
keep
their
preferred
insurance
plans.
Americans
should
have
a
reliable
choice
of
insurance
policies
and
a
system
that
doesn't
mandate
increases
but
instead
encourages
competition
and
quality.
It
is
time
to
build
a
health
care
system
for
the
21st
century
for
America
by
encouraging
innovation
and
competition,
and
not
by
making
arbitrary
decisions
on
cost
and
taxation
which
drive
people
out
of
the
marketplace
and
out
of
business.
