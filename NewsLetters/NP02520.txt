Dear David,
My
thoughts and prayers go out to the passengers and crew on the
Metrolink train (VC Line 102) that was involved in a collision this morning
in Oxnard. I have been in touch with federal, state, and local agencies
responsible for coordinating the accident investigation, and I will
continue to monitor the investigation closely. Clearly, there are many
unanswered questions that must be addressed.
The National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is sending a go-team to investigate
this accident. The Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, and other
federal, state, and local partner agencies are coordinating with the
NTSB lead investigators.
Family members and friends can
contact the Metrolink Call Center at 1-800-371-5465 for passenger
information. Additional resources for affected community members can also be
found on the Ventura County Emergency Information page at
http://vcemergency.com .
If I can
help connect you with additional resources, please do not hesitate to
contact my office at 805-379-1779.
