Dear Friends,
My thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved
ones, those who were injured, and those who lost their homes and
businesses to the devastating storms earlier this
week.
Today, Senators Thad Cochran (R-Miss) and Roger
Wicker (R-Miss), Congressman Gregg Harper (MS-03) and I were home in
Mississippi to meet with state and local officials, and see firsthand the
damage caused by the tornadoes.
The photographs I have seen over
the past two days are powerful, but nothing compared to seeing the
devastation to the homes and businesses of neighbors and friends.
I
am committed to making sure that the proper federal disaster
assistance is provided, and I stand ready to do all that I can as the recovery
process begins.
Governor Phil
Bryant, state and local officials, the media, and first responders did a
great job providing up-to-date information during the storms and
providing assistance information after.
I also cannot thank General
Collins and the Mississippi National Guard enough for their ability to
quickly mobilize and be on the ground in Tupelo and
Louisville.
Unfortunately, we have become all too
familiar with natural disasters. I am proud of Mississippi and the
determination I have seen to rise above this disaster.
Once again
in the face of difficulty, Mississippians have shown an outpouring of
generosity and support for one
another.
As we reflect and begin to rebuild, we will always
remember the precious lives lost during this
disaster.
Sincerely and God bless,
Tell a Friend
