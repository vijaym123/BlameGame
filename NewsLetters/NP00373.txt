Wisdom of the District: Fixing the TSA
A recent internal investigation of the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) security procedures by the Department of Homeland Security, first made public by ABC News, revealed that TSA failed to stop undercover agents from carrying fake weapons through security at major U.S. airports in 67 of 70 recent tests
a 95% rate of failure.
As a result, the acting TSA Administrator was reassigned.
What do you think is the best way to improve airline transportation safety?
( )
Increase Funding: We have not given TSA enough money to operate in an increasingly dangerous world
we should provide more funds to TSA so they have the technology and resources to more accurately detect threats.
( )
Overhaul the Leadership: Since 2005, funding for TSA has increased by $2.09 billion, or almost 40%. Clearly leadership
not funding
is the problem. We should encourage a clean sweep of its decision making body.
( )
Move Towards Privatization: Under the Department of Homeland Security, TSA has not been successful or cost effective
we should push for large scale reforms with the goal of eventual privatization.
