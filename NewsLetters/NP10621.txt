Dear Friend,
This week, I asked the U.S. Attorney General to protect Shelby County
voters in our upcoming elections, reflected on Dr. King's Dream on the
House floor, hosted a telephone town hall, met with two groups of
outstanding Memphis high school students, and introduced legislation to
protect taxpayers from fraudsters like Mo' Money. Keep reading to learn

TOMORROW: Building a Healthier Memphis by Preventing Diabetes
More than 7.5 million Americans enrolled in high-quality, affordable
coverage before the Affordable Care Act's 2014 open enrollment period
ended on March 31st. With so many Americans now enrolled in coverage
through marketplaces like HealthCare.gov, President Obama is right when
he says "the Affordable Care Act is here to stay."
The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans get
covered and get the care they need, but we can do more. In February, I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District with a panel discussion and education session focused on
the racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes in Memphis. During the
panel-which drew an overflow crowd-experts discussed the reasons for
the current outcome gap and helped identify how Memphians can take
advantage of provisions of the President's Affordable Care Act that
include no co-pay and no deductible mammograms to address the disparity
and improve outcomes for themselves, their families, and their
communities.
I was encouraged that so many Memphians attended the panel and
education session to learn how they can improve their own health and
the health of their families and communities. Now, I am glad to invite
you to the next "Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness tomorrow
morning at Church Health Center Wellness (located at 1115 Union Avenue)
at 10:00AM.
This next event will focus on how our community can work together to
stem the rising tide of diabetes diagnoses in Memphis and will include
a number of local experts on diabetes prevention as well as Dr. Ann
Albright from the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC). I
hope you can join us tomorrow.
Remembering Martin Luther King and Promoting Civil Rights
Last weekend, to commemorate the 46th anniversary of the assassination
of Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr., I attended the April 4th Foundation's
2014 Gala and I also spoke at the grand reopening of the National Civil
Rights Museum. When I got back to Washington, I went to the floor of
the House of Representatives and reflected on Dr. King's dream and the
museum's reopening. You can watch my speech here, and I hope you will
visit the museum to see its powerful exhibits for yourself.
Protecting Shelby County Voters
On Tuesday, I questioned U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder at a
Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. I was glad to have the
opportunity to follow-up with him on a letter that I sent to him with
Pastor Kenneth T. Whalum of the New Olivet Baptist Church regarding our
concerns about the competency of the Shelby County Election Commission.
Despite an election riddled with errors that was set aside by court
order and other documented serious mistakes, no changes have been made
at the Shelby County Election Commission. As I have highlighted on
several occasions, the Commission has demonstrated a troubling pattern
of incompetence over the years-and something must change. At Tuesday's
hearing, I urged the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to
do everything in their power, including sending monitors to ensure the
fairness of our elections, to protect the vote of every citizen in
Shelby County.
Fighting for Sane Criminal Drug Policies
At Tuesday's hearing with Attorney General Holder, I also had the
opportunity to question him about the federal government's priorities
when it comes to enforcing outdated and misguided marijuana laws.
Currently, the drug is on "Schedule I" of the Controlled Substances
Act. If a drug is listed under Schedule I, it means that the federal
government recognizes no medical use, but the listing can be changed by
the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and
Human Services. Including marijuana in Schedule I disregards both
medical evidence and the laws of nearly half of the states that have
legalized it for medical purposes.
When marijuana was placed on Schedule I, it was supposed to be
temporary until the science was in. That was 1970. The science has been
in for a long time, and keeping marijuana on Schedule I-with heroin and
LSD-is ludicrous. Not simply because African Americans are 4 times more
likely than Caucasians to be arrested for possession, although that is
a travesty, but also because the science tells us it's wrong. Time and
again, this Administration has acted within its authority to address
injustice and fix problems, whether immigration, protecting our
environment, or raising the minimum wage for federal contractors. The
Attorney General can and should act to better reflect the science, the
medical research, and the opinions of the American people when it comes
to the federal classification of marijuana. You can watch my
questioning of the Attorney General here.
Outstanding Memphis Students Visit Our Nation's Capital
This week I was pleased to welcome two groups of outstanding Memphis
high school students to Washington, DC.
Victoria Meeks (left) and Jamila Miller (right), seniors at The
Soulsville Charter School and finalists at the Shelby Debate Society
City Championship, came to my office to discuss their upcoming
challenge at the 2014 Urban Debate National Championship. Jamila and
Victoria are part of a Soulsville class that has seen 100% of its
graduating students accepted into college. I am proud that Memphis is
represented in the national tournament by these two bright young women,
and am confident that they will perform admirably. Good luck, Victoria
and Jamila!
I was also pleased to welcome an impressive group of high school
seniors from BRIDGES, a Memphis organization that works to unite and
inspire diverse young people to become leaders and thinkers, committed
to their communities. This particular group, which included (from left
to right) Corrine McClure (White Station High School), Paris Byrd
(Central High School), Logan Ruthling (Christian Brothers High School),
and Bryan Redmond (City University Charter School), are part of the
Bridge Builders CHANGE program, who have been doing local education
policy work for the past two years in Shelby County. In November, 2013,
their combined efforts resulted in the establishment of a Student
Congress for Shelby County Schools. A recent Huffington Post article
details their accomplishments.
The six students I met with this week represent five different Memphis
high schools. I was very pleased to see such bright, poised young
people representing our city of Memphis in our nation's Capital. I am
thankful for the opportunity to have met with these students, and am
proud to represent our City of Memphis.
Listening to Memphis
On Monday night, I hosted another telephone town hall with more than
5,600 Ninth District citizens to answer questions about the issues
facing our district and our nation, including how to ensure that
taxpayers take advantage of all the credits and deductions they are
entitled to. We also discussed tomorrow's "Building a Healthier Memphis"
diabetes reduction event.
Town hall meetings like Monday's give citizens of the Ninth District
like you another way to speak directly with me and share what's really
on your mind. I appreciated having this opportunity to hear the Ninth
District's perspective on the issues facing our city and enjoyed
discussing how hardworking Memphians can ensure they receive every
penny they are owed in tax refunds this year, and what our community
can do to help stem the rising tide of diabetes diagnoses in Memphis.
Regardless of the issue, the opinions and ideas of Ninth District
constituents help us move forward with legislation in Congress.
If you would like to sign up to participate in my future telephone town
halls, please email me through my website with your home phone number.
Please enter a landline phone number, as I cannot call cell phones
during telephone town halls.
Protecting Consumers from Fraudsters Like Mo' Money
In Memphis and across the country, Mo' Money was caught defrauding
honest taxpayers with outrageous fees and cheating them out of the
refunds they deserved. As the New York Times reported, the U.S.
Department of Justice shut them down, but there remain many other
fly-by-night tax preparers just like them that deceive hardworking
Americans of their earned refunds with little risk of repercussions.
Yesterday, I introduced the Tax Return Preparer Accountability Act to
help ensure that these shady and dishonest business practices cannot
continue, and protect the pocketbooks of middle-class families and the
federal treasury alike.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Refunds They Deserve
April 15th - the deadline to file your 2013 federal tax return - is
less than a week away. As you prepare your return, I hope you won't
overlook the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if you are eligible for
it. It is an important credit that can give families a financial boost.
But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby County have
not taken full advantage of the program. Last year alone, as much as
$70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by area
taxpayers.
If you have not yet filed your 2010 federal tax return and are owed a
refund, the April 15th deadline is also your last chance to claim that
refund. If the federal government owes you a refund from 2010, there is
no penalty for filing a late return for that year. According to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), nearly $13 million in unpaid refunds is
owed to more than 16,000 taxpayers across Tennessee, but you must file
by next Tuesday, April 15th in order to collect those funds or they
will be forfeited.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. This year, I helped open one of 15
new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites that are now operating
throughout Shelby County.
The VITA sites are available to provide tax
return guidance and advice free of charge to ensure that Memphians take
full advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. More information including a list of all VITA
locations and their hours is available at my website, and I encourage
you to find one near you to help ensure you get every penny you are
owed.
Helping Shelby County Recover from March's Severe Winter Storms
Earlier this week, Governor Bill Haslam asked the President to declare
a "major disaster" for the State and to make federal Public Assistance
funding and other aid available to Shelby and other counties affected
by the severe winter storms of early March to help the region recover.
I fully supported his efforts, and on Wednesday I joined Senators
Alexander and Corker and other members of the Tennessee Congressional
delegation in calling on the President to quickly approve the Governor's
request and make federal aid available. You can read more here
.
I was pleased to learn that this afternoon, President Obama issued a
major disaster declaration for the State of Tennessee, which will
trigger the release of Federal funds to help our local communities
recover from the Severe Winter Storms of March. All counties in the
State of Tennessee are eligible to apply for assistance under the
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and I encourage all who need
assistance to apply.
Working for the Unemployed
On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bipartisan emergency unemployment
insurance extension for the millions of Americans whose benefits
expired at the end of the year due to Republican obstruction. I'm glad
that some in Congress have finally recognized the urgent need to pass
this legislation, but I remain very disappointed that Speaker John
Boehner has indicated that he won't even let the House vote on it when
the Senate sends it to us.
Speaker Boehner shouldn't make millions of out-of-work Americans-
including more than 31,000 Tennesseans-wait another day for the
unemployment benefits they need to keep a roof over their heads and put
food on their tables. He should stop obstructing the Senate's
bipartisan bill and immediately let the House vote to extend this
critical lifeline to people who have lost their jobs through no fault
of their own.
Urging De-escalation in Ukraine
This week, I attended a Commission on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (the U.S. Helsinki Commission) hearing with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to
discuss the tumultuous situation in Ukraine. The United States has a
responsibility to work towards a peaceful de-escalation of current
tension, support Ukrainian sovereignty, ensure that Russia recognizes
there are costs for their actions, and maintain our commitment to the
security of all of our NATO Allies. I joined the Helsinki Commission to
continue my work of promoting human rights and democracy around the
globe as well as to help strengthen ties and cooperation among nations.
Grant for the University of Memphis
On Wednesday, I announced nearly $50,000 in federal funds from the
National Science Foundation for a University of Memphis research
project that could help emergency personnel respond to chemical spills.
The grant underscores the important role that University of Memphis
scholars play in keeping Americans healthy and safe from toxic
chemicals.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding any property
or assets for you. And you may pass this information along to your
friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners. In
guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan Guarantee program
helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a new home than at
any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this great news for
veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing market is
rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan Guarantee
program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and, along with
offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a down payment
from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to purchase a
home, you can learn more about the program here.
Again, thank you for your interest.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

before
the
Affordable

Act&#8217;s

ended
on
March

With
so
many

HealthCare.gov,
President
Obama
is
right
when
he
says
&#8220;the

The

Act
is
already
helping
millions
of
Americans
get
covered
and
get
the
care
they
need,
but
we
can

In

I
launched
my
&#8220;Building

on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
with
a
panel
discussion
and
education
session
focused
on
the
racial
disparities
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
in
Memphis.
During
the
panel&#8212;which
drew
an

crowd&#8212;experts
discussed
the
reasons
for
the

and
no

to
address
the
disparity
and
improve

for
themselves,
their
families,
and
their

I
was
encouraged
that
so
many
Memphians
attended
the
panel

education
session
to
learn
how
they
can
improve
their
own

Last
weekend,
to
commemorate
the
46th
anniversary
of
the
assassination
of
Dr.
Marin
Luther
King,
Jr.,
I
attended
the
April
4th
Foundation&#8217;s
2014
Gala
and
I
also
spoke
at
the
grand
reopening
of
the
National
Civil
Rights
Museum.
When
I
got
back
to
Washington,
I
went
to
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Representatives
and
reflected
on
Dr.
King&#8217;s
dream
and
the
museum&#8217;s
reopening.
You
can
watch
my
speech
here,
and
I
hope
you
will
visit
the
museum
to
see
its
powerful
exhibits
for
yourself.
Protecting
Shelby
County
Voters
On
Tuesday,
I
questioned
U.S.
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
at
a
Judiciary
Committee
hearing
on
Capitol
Hill.
I
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
follow-up
with
him
on
a
letter
that
I
sent
to
him
with
Pastor
Kenneth
T.
Whalum
of
the
New
Olivet
Baptist
Church
regarding
our
concerns
about
the
competency
of
the
Shelby
County
Election
Commission.
Despite
an
election
riddled
with
errors
that
was
set
aside
by
court
order
and
other
documented
serious
mistakes,
no
changes
have
been
made
at
the
Shelby
County
Election
Commission.
As
I
have
highlighted
on
several
occasions,
the
Commission
has
demonstrated
a
troubling
pattern
of
incompetence
over
the
years&#8212;and
something
must
change.
At
Tuesday&#8217;s
hearing,
I
urged
the
Attorney
General
and
the
Department
of
Justice
to
do
everything
in
their
power,
including
sending
monitors
to
ensure
the
fairness
of
our
elections,
to
protect
the
vote
of
every
citizen
in
Shelby
County.
Fighting
for
Sane
Criminal
Drug
Policies
At
Tuesday&#8217;s
hearing
with
Attorney
General
Holder,
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
question
him
about
the
federal
government&#8217;s
priorities
when
it
comes
to
enforcing
outdated
and
misguided
marijuana
laws.
Currently,
the
drug
is
on
&#8220;Schedule
I&#8221;
of
the
Controlled
Substances
Act.
If
a
drug
is
listed
under
Schedule
I,
it
means
that
the
federal
government
recognizes
no
medical
use,
but
the
listing
can
be
changed
by
the
Attorney
General
in
consultation
with
the
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services.
Including
marijuana
in
Schedule
I
disregards
both
medical
evidence
and
the
laws
of
nearly
half
of
the
states
that
have
legalized
it
for
medical
purposes.
When
marijuana
was
placed
on
Schedule
I,
it
was
supposed
to
be
temporary
until
the
science
was
in.
That
was
1970.
The
science
has
been
in
for
a
long
time,
and
keeping
marijuana
on
Schedule
I&#8212;with
heroin
and
LSD&#8212;is
ludicrous.
Not
simply
because
African
Americans
are
4
times
more
likely
than
Caucasians
to
be
arrested
for
possession,
although
that
is
a
travesty,
but
also
because
the
science
tells
us
it&#8217;s
wrong.
Time
and
again,
this
Administration
has
acted
within
its
authority
to
address
injustice
and
fix
problems,
whether
immigration,
protecting
our
environment,
or
raising
the
minimum
wage
for
federal
contractors.
The
Attorney
General
can
and
should
act
to
better
reflect
the
science,
the
medical
research,
and
the
opinions
of
the
American
people
when
it
comes
to
the
federal
classification
of
marijuana.
You
can
watch
my
questioning
of
the
Attorney
General
here.

what&#8217;s
really
on
your
mind.
I
appreciated
having
this
opportunity
to
hear
the
Ninth
District&#8217;s
perspective
on
the
issues
facing
our
city
and
enjoyed
discussing
how
hardworking
Memphians
can
ensure
they
receive
every
penny
they
are
owed
in
tax
refunds
this
year,
and
what
our
community
can
do
to
help
stem
the
rising
tide
of
diabetes
diagnoses
in
Memphis.
Regardless
of
the
issue,
the
opinions
and
ideas
of
Ninth
District
constituents
help
us
move
forward
with
legislation
in
Congress.

Protecting
Consumers
from
Fraudsters
Like
Mo&#8217;
Money
In
Memphis
and
across
the
country,
Mo&#8217;
Money
was
caught
defrauding
honest
taxpayers
with
outrageous
fees
and
cheating
them
out
of
the
refunds
they
deserved.
As
the
New
York
Times
reported,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
shut
them
down,
but
there
remain
many
other
fly-by-night
tax
preparers
just
like
them
that
deceive
hardworking
Americans
of
their
earned
refunds
with
little
risk
of
repercussions.
Yesterday,
I
introduced
the
Tax
Return
Preparer
Accountability
Act
to
help
ensure
that
these
shady
and
dishonest
business
practices
cannot
continue,
and
protect
the
pocketbooks
of
middle-class
families
and
the
federal
treasury
alike.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Refunds
They
Deserve
April
15th
&#8211;
the
deadline
to
file
your
2013
federal
tax
return
&#8211;
is
less
than
a
week
away.
As
you
prepare
your
return,
I
hope
you
won&#8217;t
overlook
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
if
you
are
eligible
for
it.
It
is
an
important
credit
that
can
give
families
a
financial
boost.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program.
Last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
If
you
have
not
yet
filed
your
2010
federal
tax
return
and
are
owed
a
refund,
the
April
15th
deadline
is
also
your
last
chance
to
claim
that
refund.
If
the
federal
government
owes
you
a
refund
from
2010,
there
is
no
penalty
for
filing
a
late
return
for
that
year.
According
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
nearly
$13
million
in
unpaid
refunds
is
owed
to
more
than
16,000
taxpayers
across
Tennessee,
but
you
must
file
by
next
Tuesday,
April
15th
in
order
to
collect
those
funds
or
they
will
be
forfeited.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
This
year,
I
helped
open
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
are
now
operating
throughout
Shelby
County.
The
VITA
sites
are
available
to
provide
tax
return
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
Memphians
take
full
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
More
information
including
a
list
of
all
VITA
locations
and
their
hours
is
available
at
my
website,
and
I
encourage
you
to
find
one
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Helping
Shelby
County
Recover
from
March&#8217;s
Severe
Winter
Storms
Earlier
this
week,
Governor
Bill
Haslam
asked
the
President
to
declare
a
&#8220;major
disaster&#8221;
for
the
State
and
to
make
federal
Public
Assistance
funding
and
other
aid
available
to
Shelby
and
other
counties
affected
by
the
severe
winter
storms
of
early
March
to
help
the
region
recover.
I
fully
supported
his
efforts,
and
on
Wednesday
I
joined
Senators
Alexander
and
Corker
and
other
members
of
the
Tennessee
Congressional
delegation
in
calling
on
the
President
to
quickly
approve
the
Governor&#8217;s
request
and
make
federal
aid
available.
You
can
read
more
here .
I
was
pleased
to
learn
that
this
afternoon,
President
Obama
issued
a
major
disaster
declaration
for
the
State
of
Tennessee,
which
will
trigger
the
release
of
Federal funds
to
help
our
local
communities
recover
from
the
Severe
Winter
Storms
of
March.
All
counties
in
the
State
of
Tennessee
are
eligible
to
apply
for
assistance
under
the
Hazard
Mitigation
Grant
Program,
and
I
encourage
all
who
need
assistance
to
apply.
Working
for
the
Unemployed
On
Tuesday,
the
Senate
passed
a
bipartisan
emergency
unemployment
insurance
extension
for
the
millions
of
Americans
whose
benefits
expired
at
the
end
of
the
year
due
to
Republican
obstruction.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
some
in
Congress
have
finally
recognized
the
urgent
need
to
pass
this
legislation,
but
I
remain
very
disappointed
that
Speaker
John
Boehner
has
indicated
that
he
won&#8217;t
even
let
the
House
vote
on
it
when
the
Senate
sends
it
to
us.
Speaker
Boehner
shouldn&#8217;t
make
millions
of
out-of-work
Americans&#8212;including
more
than
31,000
Tennesseans&#8212;wait
another
day
for
the
unemployment
benefits
they
need
to
keep
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
put
food
on
their
tables.
He
should
stop
obstructing
the
Senate&#8217;s
bipartisan
bill
and
immediately
let
the
House
vote
to
extend
this
critical
lifeline
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
Urging
De-escalation
in
Ukraine
This
week,
I
attended
a
Commission
on
Security
and
Cooperation
in
Europe
(the
U.S.
Helsinki
Commission)
hearing
with
U.S.
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
for
European
and
Eurasian
Affairs
Victoria
Nuland
to
discuss
the
tumultuous
situation
in
Ukraine.
The
United
States
has
a
responsibility
to
work
towards
a
peaceful
de-escalation
of
current
tension,
support
Ukrainian
sovereignty,
ensure
that
Russia
recognizes
there
are
costs
for
their
actions,
and
maintain
our
commitment
to
the
security
of
all
of
our
NATO
Allies.
I
joined
the
Helsinki
Commission
to
continue
my
work
of
promoting
human
rights
and
democracy
around
the
globe
as
well
as
to
help
strengthen
ties
and
cooperation
among
nations.
Grant
for
the
University
of
Memphis
On
Wednesday,
I
announced
nearly
$50,000
in
federal
funds
from
the
National
Science
Foundation
for
a
University
of
Memphis
research
project
that
could
help
emergency
personnel
respond
to
chemical
spills.
The
grant
underscores
the
important
role
that
University
of
Memphis
scholars
play
in
keeping
Americans
healthy
and
safe
from
toxic
chemicals.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners.
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here.
Again,
thank
you
for
your interest.
As
always,
I
remain.
Most
sincerely,
