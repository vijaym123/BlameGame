Rep. Garrett delivers a solemn address to attendees at a Memorial Day event in Blairstown.
This week, he led the entire New Jersey Congressional Delegation in sending
a
letter
to the directors of the VA Health Care Systems that treat NJ veterans.
Dear Friend,
Today marks the 70 th
anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
As we reflect on the sacrifices of The Greatest Generation, I think its vitally important for us to band together to immediately address the mistreatment of veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The recent news about systemic problems of neglect at VA facilities is inexcusable.
According to recent reportsand as admitted by former VA Secretary Eric Shinshekiat least 40 veterans died while waiting to receive necessary medical treatment and 1,700 others sought care, but were never added to the appropriate waiting lists.
As your Congressman, I am committed to holding accountable those responsible for these acts of mistreatment and ensuring our countrys heroes receive the care and medical treatment they deserve.
This week, with the support of the entire New Jersey Congressional Delegation, I sent a letter to the directors of the VA Health Care Systems in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware to ensure the all VA facilities in our area are providing the best possible care to our veterans.
Specifically, we are seeking clarification on four questions:
1) How many veterans are currently on the wait list for appointments at the facilities under your direction?
2) How long is the average wait time for New Jersey veterans to receive an appointment at facilities under your direction?
3) What safe guards are in place to ensure that all veterans are placed on the appropriate electronic waitlist?
4) Have there been any reported incidents of wait time and data manipulation at facilities under your direction?

Finally, if you need help or know a veteran who needs assistance with their benefits, please contact my Glen Rock office at 201-444-5454 or my Newton office at 973-300-2000.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
