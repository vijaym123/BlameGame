Dear Friend &ndash;
I am proud to let you know that parts of my "She is Ready" Act (SIR) will be included in the House of Representatives's annual defense bill.
Female service members have proven they don't compromise combat readiness - they actually enhance it.
Our women in service have made it clear that th ey don't want standards to be lowered because they are women, but they
do
want a chance to meet fair standards.
My SIR Act will help break down artificial barriers by providing third party oversight of gender-neutral standards and other methods of research the military conducts.
Watch me bring up my bill here: http://bit.ly/1qIUz8v

Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
