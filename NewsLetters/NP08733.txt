VISITING DC
June 13, 2014
This week, I joined Minority Senate Veterans Affairs Committee
members in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, pressing the
Department of Justice (DOJ) to join efforts with the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) Inspector Generals investigation into misconduct at VA
facilities. On Wednesday,
the FBI also opened a criminal
probe
into the VA scandal. To read the text of the letter,

The Senate passed the bipartisan
Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and
Transparency
Act to address the crisis at VA, introduced by Senators
McCain and Sanders. This legislation will empower our nations veterans
and bring accountability and transparency to the VA. However, this
legislation alone will not solve the deep culture problems at the
Department -- we still have much more work and oversight that will need to be
done. I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to
ensure our veterans can get the health care they have
earned.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
