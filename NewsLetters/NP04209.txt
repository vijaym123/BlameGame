Stimach from Jonesboro, Kimberly Seibert from Texarkana, Angela
Lassiter from Conway, Gayle Taylor from Jonesboro, Joyce Soulaire from
Jacksonville, the Arkansas Society of Human Resource Management, and State

After considering and passing fifteen bills under
suspension of the rules on Monday, the House passed the EPA Science
Advisory Board Reform Act of 2013 ( H.R. 1422 ), by a vote of 229-191 on
Tuesday. H.R. 1422 amends federal law relating to the Scientific Advisory
Board to: establish qualifications for members, reinforce
independence of the board, facilitate public participation in the boards
advisory activities, and limit the advice given by the board to scientific
determinations, rather than policy direction.
On Wednesday, in addition to considering six
more bills under suspension, the House passed the Secret Science Reform
Act of 2014 ( H.R.
4012 ) , by a vote of 237-190. H.R. 4012 prohibits the EPA
from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating any risk, exposure, or
hazard assessment, criteria document, standard, limitation, regulation,
regulatory impact analysis, or guidance unless all scientific and
technical information relied on to support the regulation or guidance is
specifically identified and publicly available in a manner sufficient
for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of research
results.
On Thursday, the
House passed the Promoting New Manufacturing Act ( H.R. 4795 ) by a vote of
238-172. H.R. 4795 provides for greater transparency and timeliness in
obtaining the permits necessary for new manufacturing.
Specifically, the bill requires the EPA to publish information on the timeline
for issuing preconstruction permits; directs the EPA to issue
implementing guidance when publishing a final rule to establish a national
ambient air quality standard; and requires the EPA to submit an annual
report to Congress that assesses the permitting
process.
On Thursday evening, President
Obama announced he would be issuing an executive order on immigration
to shield approximately five million undocumented immigrants from
deportation, and frankly, Im astounded hes proposed to make our
immigration laws even more lax through executive fiat and skirt Congress yet
again. The Constitution is clear when it grants Congress the
authority to make our nations laws, not the President. But throughout
his presidency, President Obama has refused to do the job actually
afforded to him by the Constitution, the job of enforcing
not creating
Americas laws. This has been especially true when it comes to
immigration. There is no doubt our immigration system is in desperate need
of reform, and Congress must develop a long-term immigration policy
that encourages lawful behavior. As we work towards these
thoughtful solutions, Obama cannot change the laws himself.
Thats not
how democracy works.
Next week, the House will not be in session, and I am looking
forward to being in the Third District to celebrate
Thanksgiving.

Front...
