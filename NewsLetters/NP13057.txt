Dear Friend,
Over the weekend it was announced that the United States, along with
six other world powers, and Iran reached an agreement on a plan forward
toward loosening economic sanctions placed on Iran in return for a
temporary freeze in their nuclear program.
This is an international issue that I believe warrants your attention.
It's also an issue I continue to have very serious reservations
about both with the underlying negotiated plan with Iran and the
failure so far during these discussions to come to an agreement to
completely dismantle Iran's nuclear program.
A nuclear Iran will lead to further destabilizing a region already
consumed in turmoil and it would be a direct threat to our allies in
the area, including Israel. I am concerned that while negotiations have
been ongoing it has allowed Iran to further develop key components of
its nuclear program that make it more difficult to reverse as these
discussions continue.
The tough sanctions placed on Iran to date have been working and until
the international community can fully verify Iran is dismantling its
nuclear program, I firmly believe current sanction must stay in effect
and the threat of further sanctions should remain on the table.
The Iran nuclear deal to temporarily freeze much of Iran's nuclear
program is set to go into effect this Monday, January 20th. So this
means the real test of Iran's willingness to cooperate with the
international community begins next week. I have my reservations and I
will be monitoring this issue closely as it develops.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Over
the
weekend
it
was
announced
that
the
United
States,
along
with
six
other
world
powers,
and
Iran
reached
an
agreement
on
a
plan
forward
toward
loosening
economic
sanctions
placed
on
Iran
in
return
for
a
temporary
freeze
in
their
nuclear
program.
This
is
an
international
issue
that
I
believe
warrants
your
attention.
It&#8217;s
also
an
issue
I
continue
to
have
very
serious
reservations
about
both
with
the
underlying
negotiated
plan
with
Iran
and
the
failure
so
far
during
these
discussions
to
come
to
an
agreement
to
completely
dismantle
Iran&#8217;s
nuclear
program.
A
nuclear
Iran
will
lead
to
further
destabilizing
a
region
already
consumed
in
turmoil
and
it
would
be
a
direct
threat
to
our
allies
in
the
area,
including
Israel.
I
am
concerned
that
while
negotiations
have
been
ongoing
it
has
allowed
Iran
to
further
develop
key
components
of
its
nuclear
program
that
make
it
more
difficult
to
reverse
as
these
discussions
continue.
The
tough
sanctions
placed
on
Iran
to
date
have
been
working
and
until
the
international
community
can
fully
verify
Iran
is
dismantling
its
nuclear
program,
I
firmly
believe
current
sanction
must
stay
in
effect
and
the
threat
of
further
sanctions
should
remain
on
the
table.
The
Iran
nuclear
deal
to
temporarily
freeze
much
of
Iran&#8217;s
nuclear
program
is
set
to
go
into
effect
this
Monday,
January
20th.
So
this
means
the
real
test of
Iran&#8217;s
willingness
to
cooperate
with
the
international
community
begins
next
week.
I
have
my
reservations
and
I
will
be
monitoring
this
issue
closely
as
it
develops.
Sincerely,
Kay
Granger
