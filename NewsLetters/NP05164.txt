Dear David,
Today marks the end of National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week
(NLPPW).
This year's NLPPW theme, "Lead-Free Kids for a Healthy
Future," underscores the importance of testing your home, testing your
child, and learning how to prevent lead poisonings serious health
effects.
Hundreds of thousands of
children living in the United States have elevated blood lead levels that
may cause significant damage to their health. They can develop
behavior and learning problems (such as hyperactivity), slowed growth,
hearing problems, and aggressive patterns of behavior. The damage can be
permanent. Stopping a childs exposure to lead from leaded paint, house
dust, or any other source is the best way to prevent the harmful
effects of lead.
Since 2000, the number of children under six years
old in Monroe County testing positive for lead poisoning has declined by
over 85 percent.
New York
State Law requires all children to be tested for exposure to lead at 12
months and 24 months of age.See your health care provider and ask that
your child be tested for exposure to lead. In the City of
Rochester, you can call
(585) 428-LEAD
to request a free
inspection of your home. In Monroe County, call the Monroe County
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at
(585)
753-5087 .
Rochester has made
remarkable progress on preventing child lead poisoning in recent years, but
more must be done. I have been proud to fight for federal funding for
lead poisoning prevention programs, most recently restoring $60 million
that was cut from the Department of Housing and Urban Developments
Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. You can count on me to
continue fighting to protect Rochesters children.
Best,
Louise
