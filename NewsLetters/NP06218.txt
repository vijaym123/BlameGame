Dear Fellow Nevadan,
In August and September, I
traveled throughout Nevada attending summits, meetings and seeing old
friends. I have included some photos below of some of my
visits.
Nevada received excellent news when Tesla announced that our
state would be home to their new gigafactory
which is expected to pump
$100 billion in Nevadas economy and create 22,000 jobs. I
appreciated working together with Governor Brian Sandoval to bring this project
to the Silver State. For more on how Tesla will spur economic
development, you can read my remarks
here .
In
the Senate, I continue to fight for middle class families so they can
have a fair shot at economic success. We must pass the Paycheck
Fairness Act, which would ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. We
must raise the minimum wage to a living wage because everyone who
works 40 hours a week should earn a living wage. And we must reduce the
burden on college students by lowering interest rates on federal student
loans.
Thank you for taking the time to read this email.

HARRY REID
U.S. Senator
for Nevada
In The Silver
State
On September 4th, I
co-hosted the 7th annual National Clean Energy Summit at the Mandalay Bay
in Las Vegas. I was honored to have former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton attend as the keynote speaker. This event brings together
leaders to discuss clean energy innovation and investment in Nevada and
our country.
On August
19th I spoke at the 18th annual Lake Tahoe Summit. I hosted the first
summit in 1997 and am so pleased we are still holding them to protect
Nevada and Californias treasure
Lake
Tahoe.
I met my friend
Chef Jose Andres at the SLS Las Vegas grand opening last month. Chef
Andres and his sucess is a reminder of why America must continue to
welcome immigrants to our country.
Senator Dean Heller and I appeared together on the program
Nevada Newsmakers" for our second joint television
interview.
My Las Vegas office hosted a Faith
Forum at the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas to unite Nevada's faith
coalitions in serving our communities .
I was fortunate to visit with truly gifted students at the
Davidson Academy on the University of Nevada, Reno
campus.
We cut the ribbon to open the Las Vegas Women's Health Center
at the Southern Nevada VA Medical Center. I secured $600 million to
make this medical center a reality
On August 27th I attended the grand opening of Las Vegas
Fire Station 108. I announced a $6.2 million grant to help hire personnel
at this new station for the next two
years.
