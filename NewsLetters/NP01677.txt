David -- We were NOT expecting this:
A Republican outside group just launched an ad blitz in 76 key races. You read that right: 76 races.
David -- Control of Congress and the White House are at stake.
We can&rsquo;t let these Republican deceptions go unanswered.
Suggested Action for David Johnson
Donate $5 to the Emergency Media Fund
We&rsquo;ll be blunt:
If we can&rsquo;t pull together the 10,000 donations we need to respond, we&rsquo;ll be absolutely BURIED by Republicans&rsquo; ads in all 76 of these races.
David -- We need you on this. Can you chip in to fight this Republican ad blitz?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
These new Republican ads are a brutal double whammy: they target Obamacare AND try to trick voters into supporting Republicans&rsquo; disastrous Medicare-destroying budget.
These are exactly the kind of deceptions that Republicans are relying on to win a Republican Congress and Republican White House in 2016. We can&rsquo;t let these ads break through with voters simply because we didn&rsquo;t have the resources to respond.
So David, we&rsquo;re counting on you. Can you chip in $5 or more today to fight the Republican ad blitz?
