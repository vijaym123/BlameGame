Dear
Friends,
I'm
honored to represent Utah's 2nd Congressional District. My top priority is
to stay in touch with you about what I'm doing in Congress to help
Utah and the nation. As we're nearing the election season, official U.S.
House of Representatives rules limit the type of communication my
office can have with you. These rules require that you subscribe to
my newsletter
in order to receive updates from me
during the 90 days prior to a primary election.
Utah's primary takes place on June 24th, which
means that until that date, I can only send you critical updates if
you
sign up
to receive my e-newsletter. In
addition to signing up for my
newsletter ,
you
can also stay up to date on what I'm doing by following me on
Twitter
or
Instagram , liking my
Facebook
page or subscribing to my
YouTube channel .
Please let me know what issues are important to you
by filling out the survey below.
As always, feel free
to
email me
or
call my office at 202-225-9730 if you have any concerns or
comments.
Your
Congressman,
Chris Stewart
Utah's 2nd Congressional
