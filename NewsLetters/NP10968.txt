The House of Representatives this week
voted to change the definition of a full-time employee as someone who
works for 40 hours a week for purposes of the employer mandate under the
Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.
As it
stands, the law defines a full-time employee
as someone who works at least
30 hours per week.
The employer mandate requires employers who have
50 or more full-time employees to provide government approved health
insurance plans.
How
do you define a full-time employee?
Someone who works 20 hours or more.
Someone who works 30 hours or more.
Someone who works 40
hours or more. I'd
rather not say.
