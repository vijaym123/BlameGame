I wanted to be sure you saw the breaking news that Secretary Shinseki has resigned as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, out of respect to the many veterans who have made such enormous sacrifices for this country. While this is a step forward, it is just the first step. It does not rectify the situation. It must be followed with swift and concrete action to ensure that our veterans
our nations heroes
are never treated this way again.
Our nations service men and women have my deepest admiration and my commitment to them is unwavering. Both veterans, and their families, sacrifice much to protect the freedoms we hold so dear. I intend to continue my steadfast support for active duty and retired service members. Our nations heroes who have offered themselves in service to our country deserve no less.

The abuses and deceptions that have occurred across the Department of Veterans Affairs medical system are an unforgivable breach of faith with those who have worn our countrys uniform. Our veterans dedicated their lives and sacrificed their health for our country, only to have those entrusted with their care at home systemically fail them in the most horrific ways. While I have great respect for General Shinsekis service to our country, I believe that Secretary Shinseki should resign and that the VA should begin to fix this broken system without delay.
Also, this week I will vote on legislation, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act,
H.R. 4031 , to give the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove employees of the Senior Executive Service, based on their performance, from government service completely or transfer them to another position within the current civil service system.
It is in the interest of our veterans, and out of respect for their enormous sacrifices, that we must require that the problems within the VA are fully investigated, that we take whatever action necessary to correct the problems, and that we ensure the services our veterans need and depend on are being provided to them.
Yours in service,
Randy
