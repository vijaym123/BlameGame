Swearing In
It was truly an honor to be elected to the United States Senate by the
people of South Carolina, and being sworn in was an amazing experience.
There are actually two swearing in ceremonies-an official one on the
Senate floor that is extremely quick (you can watch it here
),
and a second ceremonial one for family members, photos, and the media
in the Old Senate Chamber, which was last used by the Senate in 1859.
My family was able to be in Washington to be with me for the swearing
in, and my mother held the Bible for my oath of office.
Vice President Biden administered the oath of office both times, and we
were joined by much of the South Carolina Congressional delegation.
It was extremely meaningful for me also to be able to have constituents
in town to celebrate, as well.
I always enjoy meeting with South Carolinians from around the state!
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your voice in the United
States Senate.
On Your World with Neal Cavuto
I went on Fox News with Neal Cavuto to discuss my swearing in, and how
as a society, I believe we're better together. You can watch below!

Defense Secretary Nominee
The President's nominee for Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, has a
wealth of experience that I hope will lead to solid decision making and
long-term strategic thinking. I look forward to learning more about his
ideas and abilities through the confirmation process.
However, it does not matter how qualified a nominee is for Secretary of
Defense if the White House will not engage them in decision making. The
new Secretary must be empowered to develop a cohesive long-term plan to
combat threats such as ISIS. America cannot continue to lead from
behind on issues of national security at home and abroad, and this
administration needs to let our military and defense experts, not
politics, drive our policies.
I appreciate the opportunity to serve as your United States Senator.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
