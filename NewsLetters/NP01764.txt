Dear Friends,
Our veterans selflessly
answered the call to protect our freedom and liberty by serving in the
armed forces.
However, after their service to our nation, some
find the transition back to civilian life difficult to manage and fall
victim to homelessness.
A recent study by the National Coalition
for Homeless Veterans found that there are over 5,000 homeless
veterans in Florida alone.
Americans owe an immeasurable debt of
gratitude to those who have fought to maintain our nations position
as a champion of freedom and democracy and to protect that shining
city on a hill. I believe that it is our duty to help those veterans and
I am actively working to make sure veterans lead successful lives
following their service.
Recently, I was proud to work with Rep.
Murphy (FL-18) to introduce the
Reducing Barriers for Veterans
Education Act .
This bill would help veterans in our South
Florida community by covering a portion of the costs of applying to
institutions of higher education such as college or graduate school.
If
approved, this legislation would help make it easier for veterans to
become active members of our South Florida community by giving them the
tools and training they need to compete in the current economic
landscape.
However, the fight to protect our veterans
cannot be waged in the halls of Congress alone; it requires the
involvement of the entire community.
I am proud to say that the our South
Florida community has admirably responded to this important issue and
is working to end veterans homelessness in our city by joining the
Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness.
As part of this yearlong
mission, Miami-Dade County has partnered with the Miami VA, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and
Human Services to provide veterans who are homeless, or at-risk of
falling into homelessness, with safe and stable long term housing options,
as well as the medical and benefits assistance they need to get their
lives back on track.
In its first 100 days, nearly half of the
homeless veterans in our community have received the help they
desperately need.
I am thankful every day for the liberty
that our great nation affords us all. This freedom would not exist
without the brave men and women who have capably and proudly served our
country both at home and abroad. As a grateful community, it is our solemn
duty to help every veteran live a productive and fulfilling life in
order to honor their service to our nation.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
