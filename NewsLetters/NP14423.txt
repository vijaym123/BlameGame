Veterans Day
Today we remember, honor, and thank
America's veterans and their families. To serve in our armed forces is
to serve a cause greater than one-self and to dedicate one's life to
the preservation of our security and our
freedoms.
Each generation of Americans is faced with the same simple,
fundamental question: will they have the strength of mind, body, and
heart to stand against the forces of persecution, tyranny,
and uninmaginable evil in this world, to maintain our way of life so that
liberty may thrive both within our shores and as a beacon of hope for
millions around the world? So many of our fellow citizens
throughout our history have answered yes to that question, and we best
honor their sacrifice and that of their families and their loved ones
by never abandoning and never taking for granted the freedoms for
which they fought.
We honor our veterans not
simply for their acts of heroism. We honor them because they embody the
spirit of this nation. They embody that spirit of a free people always
striving to build a more perfect union.
May
God bless them, and may He continue to bless the United States of
America.
Visiting with Georgia Students
I enjoyed speaking with students from Cambridge High Schools AP Government
class on Wednesday. We had the opportunity to discuss a myriad of
important challenges and opportunities facing our nation. It is always
exciting and gratifying to meet so many young folks taking a
substantive interest in their nation's past, present, and future. To view
