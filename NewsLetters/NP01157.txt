Friend
Recently, I cosponsored a bill I thought youd be interested in
the National Blue Alert Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1269 ). This bill would create a national Blue Alert communications network within the Justice Department, tasked with integrating existing and future Blue Alert systems throughout the United States. The legislation would assign an existing DOJ officer to act as the national coordinator of the Blue Alert communications network.
Through the national Blue Alert program, law enforcement agencies, state, and local governments would voluntarily adopt new guidelines and develop protocols and procedures to speed up the apprehension of criminals who 1) have seriously injured or killed law enforcement officers; 2) are wanted in relation to the disappearance of law enforcement officers; 3) have made an imminent and credible threat with the intent to cause serious injury to or death of a law enforcement officer.
Our law enforcement officers and first responders put duty before self, working on the front lines to protect our homes, our communities, our children, and our lives. For that, I am grateful. They protect us; the least we can do is make it a priority to protect them.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I will continue working to increase public safety and ensure proper protection for our law enforcement officers and first responders.
