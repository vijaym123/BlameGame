New federal water bill good news
for both SC
ports
BY BRUCE SMITH | Associated Press | May 20,
2014
CHARLESTON,
S.C.
The multimillion-dollar deepening of Charleston Harbor as well
projects at smaller ports like Georgetown will be helped by a federal
water resources bill that is next up for a vote in the Senate, U.S. Rep.
Tom Rice said Tuesday.
The
freshman lawmaker from South Carolina's 7th District served on the
conference committee on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act and
spoke with The Associated Press from his Washington office minutes
after the U.S. House, by a 412-4 vote, approved the legislation. The
bill is expected to be approved by the Senate later this week and then
head to the president.
For the
next seven fiscal years, it allocates 10 percent of Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund expenditures for improvements at smaller ports handling
less than 1 million tons of cargo annually. The original House version
allocated such money for only two
years.
The trust fund brings in about $1.8 billion a year from
port users.
"The
Georgetown port is going to have to make its case and I will help with that
with the Corps of Engineers on the merits of dredging the
port,"
Rice said.
"I think that's going to be an easy argument
because the State of South Carolina has set aside funds to match federal
funds."
It's
expected to cost about $32 million to dredge the Georgetown port that is in
his district.
The water bill
authorizes spending on 26 waterway and harbor projects, including the
$650 million deepening of the Savannah River shipping channel to the
Georgia ports. It also allows the deepening of shipping channels in
Charleston and other ports to be paid for with local money while seeking
federal reimbursement
later.
The Charleston project is expected to cost upward to $350 million and
is being studied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A final Corps
decision is expected next
year.
Both Savannah and Charleston want to deepen their channels to handle a
new generation of larger container ships that will routinely call
when the Panama Canal widening is completed next
year.
Rice said that the water bill garnered
bipartisan support in an era of partisan
politics.
"Everybody knows jobs are important and
everybody wants to see our economy flourish. While we may not agree on exactly
how to get that done, pretty much everybody agrees infrastructure is
an important part of that,"
he
said.
Jim Newsome, the president and CEO of the South
Carolina Ports Authority applauded House passage of the bill saying it
meets key port priorities "specifically a seamless transition into
construction for the Charleston Harbor deepening project and the possibility
to secure channel maintenance funding for the Port of
Georgetown."
