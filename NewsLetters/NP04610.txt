Dear Friend,
Last week, I
brought together the leading local civilian and military healthcare
experts to host a public information session on the threat of Ebola. As you
will see when you read the materials in this Ledger, trained and
dedicated professionals are working hard and planning intelligently to
protect our community. I would like to extend a thank you to each of the
leaders that participated and a special thanks to Major General Paul
LaCamera, the Commanding General at Fort Carson. I know that he has
been extremely busy on multiple fronts, so the importance he placed on
keeping the community informed was very much
appreciated.
On the policy side,
I
will discuss the deeply troubling immigration developments
coming out of the White House. Also, I
will be sharing with
you the details of my response to the latest diplomatic mistake between
Israel and the Obama Administration.
I was also pleased to attend an important luncheon with the
new Air Force Academy Commandant, tour a great local manufacturer and
participate in a roundtable discussion of local banker's and housing and
building associations.
It is an honor to be your Representative in Washington DC.
Please let me know if you require any
assistance with a federal government agency by contacting my local office at
(719) 520-0055.
Sincerely,
Recap of

Readiness
Additionally, I met privately in recent weeks with Army
Major General Paul LaCamera, Commander, 4th Infantry Division and Army
General Charles Jacoby, Commander, NORTHCOM to discuss Ebola responses
from Fort Carson and Peterson
AFB.
General LaCamera and I discussed the forthcoming
deployment of approximatley 170 soldiers from Fort Carson's 615th Engineer
Company to West Africa. These soldiers will be on a humanitarian mission
helping to construct Ebola treatment centers, to prevent further spread
of the disease.
General
Jacoby and I discussed the role that NORTHCOM is playing at Peterson AFB in
preparing a 30 member task force of military Ebola experts. This team
would be deployed, under orders from the Pentagon, to help assist
local civilian medical professionals if any outbreak were to occur in the
United States. The task force will consist of nurses, disease control
experts, and doctors, who will be ready to deploy following their
training at Fort Sam Houston,
Texas.
Policy
Recap
Last week, I released a statement strongly speaking out against
the Obama Administration's potential actions regarding illegal
immigration:
I am very concerned about recent actions by the Obama
administration that suggest they are preparing to bypass Congress on
immigration policy after the November elections. Congress is the branch of
government that has Constitutional author ity to create law, not the President. An executive action
seeking to subvert this separation of powers would be an abuse of
executive power. If President Obama acts alone on immigration by deferring
deportation and offering work permits and green cards to millions of
illegal immigrants, Congress can and should go to court, and take any
other necessary steps, to stop the administration from granting amnesty
that the law does not provide. I remain absolutely opposed to amnesty
of any kind, and I urge President Obama to respect the separation of
powers and to work with Congress to pass responsible immigration reform
that strengthens border security, improves interior enforcement, and
streamlines legal
immigration.
I also released the following statement
in response to reports of a senior Obama Administration official
referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a, "chickens***":
" The
recent outrageous and vulgar statements by an unnamed senior
administration official regarding Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have crossed
every possible line of decency and diplomacy. Prime Minister
Netanyahu and the whole of Israel have been steadfast and dedicated allies in
a region where American friends can be hard to come by. President
Obama should personally and publicly apologize for this incident and hold
the senior unnamed official
accountable."
Additionally, I joined my fellow Members of Congress in a
Congressional Inquiry
to the FDIC's Inspector General calling for an
investigation of the Operation Choke Point program.
"Operation Choke Point is a DOJ initiative that aims
to force businesses, many
of which are licensed and legally-operating, out of the financial
services space and therefore, out of business. DOJ officials are working in
collusion with federal banking regulators, including but perhaps not
limited to the FDIC, to apply regulatory pressure to financial
institutions that offer banking services to specific industries as opposed to
targeting bad actors within a given industry. These include the
non-deposit lending industry, pawnbrokers, firearms and ammunition
manufacturers and retailers, and tobacco retailers, to name only a
few."
"There is no doubt in our minds that the FDIC and DOJ
officials have abused their authority to advance a political and/or moral
agenda."
"This situation merits your full and immediate
attention, and we request that you launch a comprehensive investigation
on Operation Choke Point and the individuals within FDIC charged with
creating and carrying out this unprecedented
initiative."

I was honored to share a meal with and hear
an important speech from Air Force Academy Commandant Brigadier
General Stephen Williams. General Williams spoke about the great things
happening at the Academy and the steps being taken to discipline and
correct inappropriate actions and behaviors by cadets. I appreciated the
General taking the time to introduce himself to the community and I wish
him the best in his new role.

I enjoyed taking part
in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Banker's and Homebuilder's
Associations of Colorado Springs. I was able to give an update on the

policies that I support in Washington.

SUPPORTING EDUCATION
I attended
the FMA Live! Forces in Motion show at Fountain Middle School. Put
together by Honeywell and NASA, FMA Live! is a unique one-of-a-kind
action packed show using live actors, hip-hop music and dance,
larger-than-life demonstrations and audience participation, FMA Live engages
students to learn the basic principles of physics and connects the dots
between Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) education and the
great hob opportunities of the
future.

"Thank you to Honeywell, NASA, and Fountain Middle School for
hosting today's fascinating and innovative event. So many careers come
from STEM education and it is important that we take all the steps we
can to encourage young Americans to learn and grow in these fields.
Thank you to all of the STEM teachers at Fountain Middle School, and
across the nation, for the incredible work they do to make these subjects
practical and
relatable."

PHOTOS
Recently, as part of a trip
to New Mexico to see critical Missile Defense technology, I was able
to visit the Trinity Site. This location is where the first ever
nuclear weapon was detonated. This development helped us win the Second
World War and we have been a faithful steward of this technology ever
since. The visit to the site was a humbling reminder of the responsibility
our country has to act prudently and responsibly with our nuclear
arsenal.

Secure the borders! Secure

them do it again!
