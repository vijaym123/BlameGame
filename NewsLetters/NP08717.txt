Dear Friend,
I want to share a few updates with you about my work in Washington and
take a moment to wish all fathers a very Happy Father's Day. Being a
parent is the most important job there is and I am especially grateful
to my Dad for all he has done for me in my life and for being such a
great Dad! On this Father's Day, I want to thank all the fathers who
lead by example, work hard and sacrifice for their families. I hope you
all have a very Happy Father's Day.
Free Senior Resources Fair
On Monday, June 16th from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. I will be hosting a
free Senior Resources Fair at the East Providence Senior Center located
at 610 Waterman Avenue in East Providence to offer valuable assistance
and information to seniors, caregivers, and those approaching
retirement age. There will be experts from more than 40 agencies and
organizations on hand including representatives from the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, the
Rhode Island Division of Elderly Affairs, and Rhode Island AARP. I
invite you to attend this free event to learn more about the resources
available to assist seniors and to discuss any issues you may have with
my constituent services staff. Please visit my website here
for further details on this
free event or contact my office at 729-5600.
Honoring the Greatest Generation
On Monday, I was honored to meet with Leo Heroux
, a 90 year old World War II veteran from Central Falls who fought
in the Battle of Normandy. Leo served in the U.S. Army as part of the
384th Amphibious Engineers where he helped unload ammunition supplies
to troops during the Allied invasion of Normandy. We discussed his
experiences during the War and my recent visit to Normandy where I
attended ceremonies observing the 70th Anniversary of D-Day with
President Barack Obama, French President Francois Holland and other
foreign heads of state. Leo and many other Rhode Islanders who put
their lives on the line to protect our liberty during the longest day
of the most destructive conflict of modern times deserve our gratitude
and respect. Their valor and courage is also a reminder that all our
brave men and women who wear the uniform and protect the freedoms we
enjoy today deserve the best when they return home. This week I wrote
about the need to fulfill our obligations to our veterans in the
Providence Journal
and I will continue working in
Congress to ensure we uphold our sacred promise to them.
Investing in America's Highways, Roads, Bridges, Rail and Housing
This week the Republican controlled House of Representatives approved
their version of the Fiscal Year 2015 Transportation-Housing and Urban
Development Appropriations bill, which makes devastating cuts to
transportation and housing investments across the nation. I voted
against this legislation
because instead of investing in
America's future, it slashes funding for Amtrak, the Public Housing
Capital Fund, and the Home investment partnership program. It also
practically eliminates the TIGER grant program that funds innovative
highway, port, and rail projects.
At a time when our competitors are investing in infrastructure to
protect their competitive positioning, we need to invest resources in
infrastructure projects that will support jobs in the construction
sector, grow our economy and rebuild America.
Fighting to Renew Unemployment Insurance
It's been 167 days since unemployment insurance expired for struggling
out-of-work Americans. This week I rallied with House Democrats and
faith, labor, civil rights and non-profit leaders to help kickoff the
"Witness Wednesdays" series to continue the fight to renew this vital
lifeline. During this rally I shared the story of Anthony from
Providence who is searching for a job and struggling to stay afloat.
In April I launched the Faces of the Unemployed
project to collect the names, pictures, and
stories of unemployed Rhode Islanders to share with my Republican
colleagues to help put a human face on the unemployment crisis and
press them to extend unemployment benefits. I will continue to fight to
help over 3 million Americans who have been cut off this safety net.
Preventing Gun Violence
This week, I engaged in a discussion with Federal Bureau of
Investigation Director James Comey
during a House Judiciary Committee
hearing on the need to invest in proven, effective programs such as
Project Safe Neighborhoods that help keep our communities safe and
prevent gang and gun violence. Congress needs to support programs like
Project Safe Neighborhoods that have a positive impact on communities.
That's why, last month, I offered an amendment to the Commerce,
Justice, Science Appropriations bill
to invest in these programs that
increase public safety and I will continue fighting in Congress to keep
our communities safe and prevent senseless gun violence.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at

and
many

to
protect
our
liberty
during
the
longest
day
of
the
most

of

deserve
our

is
also
a

that
all

Home

also
practically

the

port,

At
a
time
when
our
competitors
are
investing
in

to
protect
their

we
need
to
invest
resources
in
infrastructure
projects
that
will
support
jobs
in
the
construction
sector,
grow
our
economy
and
rebuild
America.
