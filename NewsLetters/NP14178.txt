Obamacare
It's no small
secret that the first six weeks of the Obamacare exchanges have not
gone well.
In fact, recent reports show that less than
27,000 people have signed up for
insurance
through one of the 36 federally-run exchanges, and
only
877 in Wisconsin .
Other reports highlight the " limitless security risks " with individuals' personal
information on the exchanges.
And, perhaps most upsetting to millions of
American individuals and families, is the reality that they will not be
able to keep their insurance plan even though they liked it.
Insurance companies have sent letters to plan-holders notifying them
their current plan is being cancelled or modified because of requirements
in the health care law.
Recently, President Obama announced he
would make changes to the implementation of the law to ensure some of
those who had their plans cancelled could keep them, though
insurance groups have expressed concern
that
premium rates could change significantly.
House and Senate
committees continue to hold oversight hearings to fully understand
the extent of the situation, where fault lies, and whether changes need
to be made to the law.
The House of Representatives
passed
bipartisan legislation
last week to ensure Americans who like
their insurance can keep it.
Recently, former
President
Bill Clinton supported the idea
that the President keep his
promise to the American people.
Shutdown Ends,
Congress Moves On
The 16-day
government shutdown ended on October 16 when the House passed, and President
Obama signed, a deal crafted in the Senate to keep the government
funded through January 15 and extend borrowing authority through February
7.
The shutdown started as a showdown over Obamacare, but
developed into a broader discussion about how to reduce our deficits and pay
off our debt.
While I never supported a government shutdown as
a way to resolve these issues, I was even more disappointed in the
final result.
After 16 days of uncertainty,
furloughs, closures, and delays, the deal that ended the shutdown
provided no significant progress in addressing our spending problems and
budget issues.
The American people deserve better.
That is why
I voted against the final deal.
I am glad we avoided defaulting
on our debt and the government is now reopened, but I would like to
see a renewed focus towards fiscal responsibility to lessen the debt
burden for future generations.
Coming
up in Congress
Farm Bill
conference
- Conferees have been
appointed by both the House and Senate to meet and iron out details for a
long-term Farm Bill--something desperately needed by America's farmers.
Farm Bill provisions include many low-income benefits, such as
SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), in addition to farm-related
programs.
At issue are differences in funding levels for these programs
and for several farm programs, such as crop insurance, but
conferees appear to be optimistic an agreement can be
reached .
There are many ways to reduce waste and abuse in farm and
low-income benefits programs while still leaving in place a safety net
for farmers and low-income families who truly need assistance.
For instance, Congressman Kind and I introduced
legislation to reform the crop insurance program and save taxpayer
dollars .
This recent article from the
Fond du
Lac Reporter
shows how billionaires still receive millions in
taxpayer-funded crop insurance, while many small, family farmers are
the ones who need the subsidies
more.
Budget Conference
- As part of the
deal to end the government shutdown, House and Senate conferees were
appointed to come up with a long-term,
bipartisan
budget
plan for reducing the nation's debt.
The conference--led by
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Budget
Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA)-- is set to release its report on
December 13.
At the outset, Senate Democrats urged higher taxes
and more revenue to be a part of the final product.
While I am
certainly open to finding new revenue sources, I question the need for
more revenue at a time when government already spends too much.
The top tax rate was already raised at the beginning of the year,
resulting in higher revenues.
Now, I hope to see a solid, realistic
plan for reducing spending and reforming the most costly government
programs.

WRRDA
conference
- On October 23, the House passed
H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform &amp; Development Act
(WRRDA) , with wide
bipartisan
support to update and
reform the process for maintaining our nation's water infrastructure.
There are hundreds of projects nationwide that need attention and
this bill will streamline the process for project approval and save
taxpayer dollars by deauthorizing funds for outdated projects.
The Senate passed its own version of the bill earlier this year.
Negotiators are currently discussing the two versions so Congress can
pass a final bill.
Fight
Continues for Medal of Honor for Fond du Lac Native, Jim
Megellas
At the Battle of the Bulge in World War II,
Jim Megellas (known as Maggie to his friends) single-handedly
destroyed a Nazi Mark V Panther tank that threatened his unit's mission and
the lives of his fellow soldiers.
He went on to lead his troops
into Herresbach, Belgium, liberating the town without sustaining one
casualty.
His actions earned him a recommendation for the Medal of
Honor by his executive officer, but this was downgraded by the Army to
a Silver Star.
Why?
Because the evidence relating to his
attack on the tank was left out.
New evidence could--and
should--change this decision.
I
sent a letter
with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and other Senators
and Representatives to Secretary of the Army John McHugh to ask him to
personally ensure Megellas' case receives a fair
reconsideration.

"Remarkable
Consensus" Among Education Groups for Petri Student Loan
Reforms
At a
House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing on November 13, four
expert witnesses testified on the benefits of an automatic
income-based repayment plan as a way to improve and simplify the way students
repay their federal student loans.
Many also noted the merits of
the bill I introduced with Congressman Polis
(D-CO).

Petri Introduces Bill to Ensure Disabled Students Receive Equal
Benefits from Educational Technologies
On November 15, I introduced legislation to
ensure students with disabilities have equal access to the benefits of
electronic instructional materials used in todays colleges and
universities.
Colleges
and universities across the country are using a wide array of new
technologies and instructional materials in the classroom.
This is a
positive development.
But at the same time, these new and
innovative tools can also pose a challenge for
accessibility.
