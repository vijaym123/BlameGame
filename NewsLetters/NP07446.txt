David -- Joe Kennedy III is right:
Boehner&rsquo;s DEAD SET on picking off strong Democrats like Cheri. If we don&rsquo;t gear up for his $30 million ad buy today, Cheri&rsquo;s first reelection campaign could be dead in the water.
David, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t answered Joe Kennedy III&rsquo;s call to action yet. If you can, will you chip in $5 or $10 immediately to help Cheri fight back against Boehner?

David --
If your inbox looks anything like mine, I bet you&rsquo;re tempted to delete this email. But I&rsquo;m asking for a quick favor -- because this is important:
One week from today marks Cheri Bustos&rsquo; end of month fundraising deadline -- Cheri&rsquo;s biggest test yet since Speaker Boehner doled out a whopping $30 million to defeat Democrats this election.
Every dime will go towards misleading personal attacks -- attacks designed to boost Republicans like Cheri&rsquo;s opponent. David, if we don&rsquo;t fight back now, Cheri risks falling dangerously behind. Can Cheri count on you to fight back? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I see it every day: Cheri is a tireless champion of Illinois&rsquo; hardworking families. But if Boehner has his way, Illinois' 17th district will fall into Tea Party hands.
We can&rsquo;t let him get away with it.
Illinois Democrats are counting on your urgent support.

Thanks,
Joe
