Dear
David,
Thanksgiving is a time when families and friends come together to give thanks
for the many things that fill our lives with
happiness.
I want to take a moment to thank all our nations troops who have
served and are currently serving.
They protect the freedoms that we
all enjoy in this nation and allow us to celebrate the holidays safely
at home.
I also want to take a moment and thank you for
participating in our democracy.
For this Thanksgiving,
may you all enjoy it with your family and friends as I will with
mine.
And for those who will be celebrating the festival of lights:
Happy Hanukkah!
Thank you,
Gloria Negrete
McLeod
Member of Congress
Congresswoman Gloria Negrete
McLeod helped distribute 150 turkeys, generously donated by the Fontana
Water Company, to needy families in the Inland Empire at her annual
Operation Gobble Turkey Giveaway event.
