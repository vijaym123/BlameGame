Keep The EPA
Out of Our Backyards
By now, many Missourians are aware of the proposed water rule by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and United States Army Corps of
Engineers to vastly expand their power authority.
When you get
down to it, the EPAs rule means a bigger government will create more
headaches while costing Missourians time and money for such things as
building a home, a pond, or raising cattle.
In effect, our government will impose significant
additional costs and burdens on property owners, farmers, and livestock
producers to comply with requirements for thousands of small streams,
ditches, ponds, and other isolated waters, some of which may contain little
or no water.
I recently wrote
to the EPA and the Corps asking leadership to withdraw its new water
rule.
And to find out how the EPA is going to impact small
businesses in Missouri, last week the Small Business Committee I chair called
on Blue Springs resident and former mayor Tom Woods, Owner of Woods
Custom Homes, to testify on the proposed rule.
Mr. Woods message
was clear: the EPA rule will have a significant impact on small
businesses in Missouri and around the country.
The National
Cattlemens Beef Association was also represented at the hearing to warn of
harm to livestock producers.
The
EPAs proposed rule is a classic example of regulatory
overreach.
Because the Obama Administration will bend its interpretation of the
law and ignore the limits placed on it by Congress, the Supreme
Court, and the Constitution, I plan to introduce legislation in the coming
weeks that will allow Congress to serve as a roadblock on how the
Administration has been doing business.
We already know that the Obama Administration will stop at
nothing to achieve its ideological, big government objectives.
If
property owners are forced to give up their rights now, we cannot
realistically hope to get them back in the future.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
