Dear Friend,
Mary Landrieu&rsquo;s race in Louisiana is heading to a runoff. In 30 days, Mary and her team will need to turn out Democratic voters -- on a Saturday -- to win.
Mary works incredibly hard for her state, and this race is our last chance to affect the outcome of the 2014 elections. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m joining with my colleagues to support Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;Off and Running Moneybomb,&rdquo; and I hope you will too. Join our moneybomb and help support Mary Landrieu.
During the campaign, Mary was the target of both Karl Rove&rsquo;s groups and the Koch brothers&rsquo; network. They&rsquo;ve slung millions of dollars of attacks at her, and they want to finish her off.
We don&rsquo;t know if the special interests will continue to attack Mary Landrieu over the next month -- but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against it. Mary&rsquo;s best chance is an aggressive ground game, and she needs our help to make that happen. Give $5 -- or more -- and give Mary&rsquo;s team the resources they need to keep fighting.
Thank you for helping Mary, and for all you&rsquo;ve done for me this year.
