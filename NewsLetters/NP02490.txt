I Stand with Israel
Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu clearly detailed the threat our two nations face from terrorism.
Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East and their entire existence is being threatened by its enemies, while Iran continues its march toward a nuclear bomb.
Its vitally important
now more than ever that we stand by Israel and all of our allies in this fight against Islamic extremism.
This is not a partisan issue and its not about politicsits
about the survival of Israel as well as the security of our own nation.
We must stand firm as a nation and work together with Israel to combat the threat of terrorism that endangers us all.
Yesterday, I spoke on the House floor formally welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and reiterating my unwavering support for Israel.
