Dear Friend:
Today, Congresswoman Susan Davis and I introduced the Survivor Outreach and Support Campus Act (S.O.S. Campus Act), legislation that would require colleges and universities to establish an independent, on-campus advocate to support survivors of sexual assault.
At a time when one in five female students has been assaulted at college, survivors of sexual assault deserve an advocate who will fight for them every step of the way. Our bill, which has been endorsed by the University of California, will help encourage more victims to come forward and report these heinous crimes. I will work with my colleagues to pass this important bill and other broader legislation to end the epidemic of violence on our nation's campuses.
