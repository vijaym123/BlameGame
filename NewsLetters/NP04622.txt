Friend, quick update:
Our race is still too close to call.
We&rsquo;re working as hard as we can to make sure every vote is counted.
But here&rsquo;s the deal:
We&rsquo;ve put
everything
we had into this race for Ami
-- and now we need your help to get us over the finish line.
As we did in 2012, we need to prepare for the possibility of a recount.
We need the resources to ensure every vote is counted and your voices are heard.
So please, rush whatever you can while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference.
