1 million: The number of people that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of. While the Department knows that these people arrived in the U.S., they cannot prove whether they left the country, according to a Government Accountability Office
report.
A workable system to track who has returned or illegally overstayed is grossly overdue. A biometric exit system remains an unfilled recommendation included in the
report
published by the 9/11 Commission nearly 10 years ago. The 9/11 Commission called it, an essential investment in our national security. Studies show that
roughly 40%
of unauthorized immigrants have come in on legal visas and simply overstayed.
It is not only critical that we address this issue, its common sense.
