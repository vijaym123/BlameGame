Thank you, David!
President Obama wasn&rsquo;t kidding when he said that last night was the most urgent fundraising deadline we&rsquo;ve faced together. And when he called on you to step up, you did in a big, big way.
In the final hours, we surged past our goal of 1 MILLION grassroots donations to elect House Democrats for the midyear. That has NEVER been done in the history of our party.
David, it&rsquo;s getting down to crunch time. Your donations are already at work helping Democratic candidates and fighting Republican attacks. We&rsquo;re not done asking for your help. There are more critical deadlines before the election and Republicans are going to pull more stupid stunts. But today, we just want to say: THANK YOU!
Onward to November!

P.S. Yesterday wasn&rsquo;t all good news. Five Republican-appointed men on the Supreme Court ruled that for-profit corporations can deny birth control coverage to women. Will you add your and help us reach 100,000 strong denouncing this terrible decision? SIGN YOUR NAME:
