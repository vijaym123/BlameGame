Republicans are running Congress like a circus. They&rsquo;ve attacked Social Security and tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- AGAIN.
David -- I haven&rsquo;t reached out in awhile. But this is such a critical moment that I had to email you.
Republicans are running Congress like a circus. They&rsquo;ve attacked Social Security and tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- AGAIN. And now,
the GOP is threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security because their extreme right wing wants to send President Obama a message.
But that&rsquo;s not the worst part. The worst part is that these same irresponsible Republicans could take over the White House
and
Congress if we let them. In fact, the Koch money machine has committed to making it happen.
It&rsquo;s never been more crucial to stand with Democrats.
But my friends at the DSCC tell me you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015 yet:
DSCC Membership Status:
pending
2015 Membership Rate:
$5
(renew now)
David, so much is at stake. We can&rsquo;t let the GOP get away with their disgraceful actions. The big FEC deadline hits in 24 hours, and we need 5,000 more Democrats to renew before then so we can hold Republicans accountable. I really need you in this moment.
Will you renew your membership by the FEC deadline in 24 hours? Your gift will be matched -- it&rsquo;ll have double the impact.
