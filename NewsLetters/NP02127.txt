LEGISLATION
March 15, 2015
Dear David,
Last year, a majority
of California residents approved a
$7.5 billion water
bond to fund water infrastructure to being
relief from Californias long standing drought. This bond authorizes the
California Water Commission to begin awarding bonds to deserving water
storage projects as soon as December of 2016.
Last week, I
introduced
H.R. 1060 , the
Sacramento Valley Water Storage and Restoration Act of 2015. This measure
would accelerate the completion of a feasibility study of Sites Reservoir,
and authorize construction of the project should it be found
feasible. Sites Reservoir is a proposed off-stream reservoir in Glenn and
Colusa counties that would store up to
1.8 million acre feet of water, generating an
additional 900,000 acre feet of water
during droughts for cities,
agriculture, and the environment.
How should California use the state bond funds
to address the current drought and prepare for future
droughts? Build new surface
water storage facilities, like Sites Reservoir.
Provide grants for habitat
conservation in headwaters. Improve groundwater storage in Southern California. Need More
