Supporting Montana's small businesses
Dear David,
In just a few days, one of the busiest economic periods of the year will begin.
And this Saturday, you have a chance to support Montana's hard-working small business owners.
Small Business Saturday is an opportunity to help our local business owners grow their companies and create jobs.
It's no secret that Montanans have a strong entrepreneurial spirit.
In fact, our state has the highest rate of new business start-ups in the country.
Supporting local businesses that produce and enhance Montana products will keep our economy growing and create jobs across our state.
As you and your family enjoy this holiday season, I encourage you to join me in supporting our small business owners and the Montana-made products they provide.
Please join me in supporting a small business this Saturday and throughout the holiday season.
Sincerely,
WWW.TESTER.SENATE.GOV
