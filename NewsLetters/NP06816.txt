Dear Friend, Tea Party Republicans in Congress are doing everything they possibly can to block progress for the middle class.
Their latest obstruction is an attempt to defund some of the basic functions of government unless they get to block action on climate change. That&rsquo;s how the Tea Party works -- they stamp their feet and hold their breath until they get what they want, and they don&rsquo;t care who gets hurt in the process. This is business-as-usual in the Tea Party House. And if the Tea Party picks up six seats in the Senate, they&rsquo;ll control all of Congress. We can&rsquo;t let our seat be one of those six -- help us keep fighting with a $5 contribution.

Imagine what a Tea Party Senate looks like. Imagine if candidates backed by the big oil Koch brothers swept into power. All action on climate change would be dead in the water -- and the Koch brothers know it.
That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve promised to raise nearly $300 million to influence our democracy this year. And the only thing stopping them is grassroots networks like ours. Our team is going to fight every minute of every day from now until November 4th, and we depend on people like you to keep us going. Help us reach our $55,000 goal for August -- give $5 today.
Thanks for your help. If we keep working hard and pull together, we&rsquo;ll send the big oil Koch brothers and the Tea Party a message they can&rsquo;t ignore.
Sincerely,
Ed
