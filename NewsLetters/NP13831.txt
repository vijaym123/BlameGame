Friend,
Our opponents may be glad to have the Washington Republican establishment on their side, but I&#39;m glad to count you on my team.
With your help, we were able to take full advantage of the dollar for dollar match to our Rapid Response Fund.
That means we&#39;ll have the resources necessary to respond to this latest news.
The National Republicans made it official-- they are investing in our race no matter which opponent we face next year.
It will be tough and it will take our full dedication to be successful.
Thank you for stepping up this week.
I am continually humbled by your support.
As 2013 comes to a close, I hope you&#39;ll stay updated on our campaign and the work we&#39;re doing at home and in Washington.
Please consider liking us on Facebook here , or

Thank you again for your commitment to our campaign.
They may have the Young Guns program, but that pales in comparison to the momentum of our team.
Be well,
