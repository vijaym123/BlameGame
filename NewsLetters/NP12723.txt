Summary
To-date, BLM and Fish &amp;
Wildlife have played a major role in
Nevadas Sagebrush Ecosystem Council.
If you are confirmed as Assistant
Secretary, you will play an integral role
in any potential action the Department of
Interior takes regarding the
sage-grouse. Can you assure me the
agencies under your purview will devote the
time and resources necessary to work
collaboratively with me and my State to
avoid an ESA listing?
asked
Heller .
To which
Ms. Suh responded , I
absolutely will commit, if confirmed, to
making this a top priority to working
across our jurisdictional lines, both with
the Fish and Wildlife Services and with the
Bureau of Land Managementto approach
this enormous problem and to make sure that
we have the resources to address it
appropriately.
