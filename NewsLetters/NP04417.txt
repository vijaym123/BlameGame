Dear Friends,
Just a few hours ago, I voted to
approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project long
delayed by the Obama administration. The House voted 252-161 to pass H.R.
5682, a bill to approve the pipeline introduced by Rep. Bill Cassidy
(R-La.).
Now is the time to approve and build the Keystone XL
pipeline. The House has voted repeatedly to approve this crucial
energy project, but the Democrat-led Senate and the Obama administration
have drug their feet. Todays vote overwhelmingly shows the strong
support in Congress for the Keystone pipeline and for purchasing energy
from allies like Canada instead of hostile nations in the Middle
East.
An energy economy is a jobs economy
West Virginians know
and appreciate the relationship between a sound domestic energy agenda
and strong economic growth. By building the Keystone pipeline, we can
create thousands of jobs, attract new investment, and improve our
access to oil from our allies. I urge the president to listen to the
American people and stop blocking this important energy
project.
PRESIDENT'S CLIMATE DEAL BAD FOR ECONOMY
Earlier this week,
President Obama announced a sweeping climate change agreement with
China while on a tour of East Asia. The president's climate deal with
China would force the United States to compete in the global economy
with one arm tied behind our backs. While our coal plants close, our
utility bills skyrocket, and our manufacturing jobs are shipped
overseas, our Chinese competitors would not have to reduce their greenhouse
gas emissions until 2030. This agreement would give China another 16
years of unlimited greenhouse gas emission growth while imposing
strict limits on the United States.
If America is to act on
climate regulations, then we should do so on the same terms as our
foreign competitors. I have introduced legislation that would block
U.S. greenhouse gas rules until major foreign emitter nations subject
themselves to the same standards. A similar principal is reflected
in the Byrd-Hagel resolution that passed the Senate unanimously in
1997. Forcing the United States to abide by more stringent
regulations than our competitors will hinder our ability to keep and create
good jobs for all Americans.
HONORING OUR
VETERANS
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to join West
Virginians in Charleston to honor and thank our veterans on Veterans Day.
We as a nation cannot let any veteran
young or
old; male or female; Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard,
Reserves or National Guard
slip through the cracks. We must provide for
our veterans, and we must care for the wounds that can be seen as well
as the wounds that are less visible. Freedom isnt free
lets show
our gratitude to our veterans and honor their
sacrifices.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as
always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
