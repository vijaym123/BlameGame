Dear Friends,
As your representative in Congress, I rely on your input to address the challenges that the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our nation face. To allow me to best represent you, I am conducting a 2014 Congressional Survey to seek your input on some of the issues facing Congress this session.
Your responses will help me address the issues important to you and the Commonwealth.
Rest assured that your individual results will not be disclosed, however I will email those who complete the survey a short summary featuring some of the results.

To continue to receive updates from my office and remain apprised of what is happening in Washington, I also encourage you to like my

Thank you in advance for taking the time to be a part of my 2014 Congressional Survey and helping me better represent you in Washington.
Sincerely,
BRETT GUTHRIE
Member of Congress
