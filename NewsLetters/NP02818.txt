ISSUES
LEGISLATION
February 08, 2015
Dear
David,
Last week, the House approved
H.R. 596 , a measure to
repeal Obamacare and move forward with replacing it with patient-centered
reforms that allow individuals and their families, not the federal
government, to make their own healthcare decisions. Contrary to what the
President promised, the Affordable Care Act is estimated to
reduce the number of full-time equivalent
workers by 2.5 million
and to
reduce small business wages by more than $22 billion annually .
Obamacare harms small businesses, hurts American workers, and forces too many
Americans to pay more for subpar healthcare. H.R. 596 is the third
measure passed by the House since January to curtail and eliminate
Obamacares disastrous effects on employers and employees.
