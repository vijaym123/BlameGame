Celebrating
Agriculture in Missouris 7th District
This year marks our
fourth annual agriculture tour of Missouri's 7th Congressional
District.
From my days growing up raising Polled Herefords I have witnessed
firsthand the vital role that agriculture played and continues to
play in our economy. My staff and I put together a great tour once again
this year.
Our office continues to hear from many
farmers regarding how federal regulations have continuously played a
heavy role in directing the path of their businesses.
Livestock and
livestock products are responsible for a little over half of
Missouri's agriculture production, which makes it important to ensure that
these businesses can progress and thrive without government
regulation.
Oftentimes, farmers are operating on farms that have been in
their families for several generations. I understand that farmers and
their families are proud and protective of their heritage and
land.
President Obama proposed a budget that would raise the estate tax
to 45 percent and will cost taxpayers $143 billion in one year.
The estate tax, also known as the death tax, punishes investment by
gutting family-owned small businesses of their capital in order to pay
the tax.
I ran a small business for 30 years and understand how
most taxes can harm our businesses.
I will continue to fight to
eliminate this tax entirely. Abolishing the estate tax is the only way
to ensure that small businesses and family farms can be passed from
generation to generation as they traditionally always have been. That is
why I cosponsored the Death Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 2429) which would
permanently repeal the estate and transfer taxes.
It would also
permanently set the gift tax rate at 35 percent with a $5 million
lifetime gift tax exemption, tied to inflation.
Earlier this
year, Congress passed H.R. 2642, the Agriculture Act of 2014, and was
signed into law by the president.
This bill reforms agriculture
programs by repealing direct payments, strengthening risk management and
crop insurance, providing permanent livestock disaster assistance, and
reforming dairy policy by offering producers a new, voluntary margin
protection program.
I always enjoy the annual agriculture
tour and look forward to seeing the progress that Missouri farmers and
ranchers have made over the year.
I am proud that Missouri
continues to stand as a leading state in the production of beef cattle,
hogs, and turkey while providing such a strong economic role for the 7th
District.
