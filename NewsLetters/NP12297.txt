My Vote Against the Debt Ceiling Extension
Last week, the House and Senate voted to suspend our debt ceiling
through March 15, 2015.
I voted
against the extension, because I think it's irresponsible to keep
extending our credit without reforming the spending problems that keep
pushing us up against our debt limit.
Imagine that you hit your credit card limit, and instead of paying down
some of your debt, you decided to call your credit card company and ask
them to simply ignore your credit limit for a year.
"Don't worry,"
you'd explain. "After I make a year's worth of purchases, you can see
where I stand then and give me a new, higher limit."
What do you think
the answer would be?
No, obviously.
And where do you think your
finances would be after that year of borrowing with no limit?
Not very
healthy.
Washington wants to keep spending, keep borrowing, and keep pretending
there are no long-term consequences. But as any family could tell you,
that kind of reckless spending isn't sustainable.
I'll continue voting
to hold Washington accountable to American taxpayers.
Another Battle in our Campaign to Prevent Listing the Lesser Prairie
Chicken
As you know, I've been leading the charge to prevent the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) from listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken as
threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
A listing would be
costly and difficult for landowners, because it would restrict activity
on lands within the birds' habitat.
Moreover, only 2% of the species
put on ESA lists have ever recovered sufficiently to be delisted.
The
good news is, five states have come together to develop a Range-Wide
Conservation Plan that should preserve habitat and make a listing
unnecessary.
Since FWS approved the Range-Wide plan, there are now 4.8
million acres of existing or pending enrollment in conservation plans
across the Lesser Prairie Chicken Range.
That's roughly the size of
Delaware and Connecticut combined.
Last week, I sent a letter
to FWS Director Dan Ashe urging a quick
approval of the accompanying oil and gas Candidate Conservation
Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) for this agreement. Instead of
stalling with never-ending reviews, FWS should finalize this agreement
and incentivize additional conservation efforts.
I'm confident that
given the opportunity to fully implement the range-wide plan, states
will prove that listing the lesser prairie chicken is not necessary.
Action Item: Events in Texas This Week
I'm looking forward to spending the week visiting with people in West
Texas and the Big Country.
In Abilene, I'll be meeting with the
Abilene Board of Realtors the Abilene Southwest Rotary Club before I
tour the Farm, Ranch, and Wildlife Expo.
I'm looking forward to
discussing the Farm Bill with Expo visitors.
We'll also raise
awareness about women's heart health with the Abilene Go Red for Women
luncheon. I'll be in Breckenridge to tour the Colt Competition Rifle
factory and discuss jobs in Texas. Later, I'll join the Levelland Lions
Club for their meeting, and then travel to Brownfield for a Texas
Tech-themed banquet at the Chamber of Commerce. In Lubbock, I'll meet
with high school students to talk about Black History Month.
In Big
Spring, I'll talk with members of the Rotary Club.
Finally, I'll close
out the week by volunteering at the Lubbock Lions Club Pancake
Festival.
I hope to see you when I'm in your neighborhood.

My
Vote
Against
the
Debt
Ceiling
Extension
Last
week,
the
House
and
Senate
voted
to
suspend
our
debt
ceiling
through
March
15,
2015.
I
voted
against
the
extension,
because
I
think
it&#8217;s
irresponsible
to
keep
extending
our
credit
without
reforming
the
spending
problems
that
keep
pushing
us
up
against
our
debt
limit.
Imagine
that
you
hit
your
credit
card
limit,
and
instead
of
paying
down
some
of
your
debt,
you
decided
to
call
your
credit
card
company
and
ask
them
to
simply
ignore
your
credit
limit
for
a
year.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry,&#8221;
you'd
explain.
&#8220;After
I
make
a
year&#8217;s
worth
of
purchases,
you
can
see
where
I
stand
then
and
give
me
a
new,
higher
limit.&#8221;
What
do
you

the

be?
No,
obviously.
And
where
do
you
think
your
finances
would
be
after

Not

Washington

But
as
any

I&#8217;ll

Another
Battle
in
our
Campaign
to
Prevent
Listing
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
As
you
know,
I&#8217;ve
been
leading
the
charge
to
prevent
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
(FWS)
from

the
Endangered

(ESA).
A
listing
would
be
costly
and
difficult
for
landowners,
because
it
would
restrict
activity
on
lands
within
the
birds&#8217;
habitat.
Moreover,
only
2%
of
the
species
put
on
ESA
lists
have
ever
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
delisted.
The
good
news
is,
five
states
have
come
together
to
develop
a
Range-Wide
Conservation
Plan
that
should
preserve
habitat
and
make
a
listing
unnecessary.
Since
FWS
approved
the
Range-Wide
plan,
there
are
now
4.8
million
acres
of
existing
or
pending
enrollment
in
conservation
plans
across
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken

That&#8217;s
roughly
the
size
of
Delaware

FWS
should

I&#8217;m
confident
that
given
the

fully

states
will
prove
that
listing
