Dear David,
It's been a busy month both in Oregon and in Washington, D.C. I
continued my Congresswoman in the Classroom tour with a full day
dedicated to visiting six schools in Columbia and Washington counties
and a public forum on education policy. In D.C. I spoke in support of
extending emergency unemployment insurance and called for Equal Pay for
Equal Work in honor of Women's History Month. Here's a rundown of March.
Touring Our Schools
During a six school tour from Clatskanie to Forest Grove, I discussed
the challenges students, teachers, and administrators face and learned
more about what I can do to help improve public education. I also
participated in a Washington County Education Forum where we discussed
curriculum, growth, and maintaining student privacy. Read more about my
visit here
and here
.
Economic Roundtable with Arts Community
I met with Portland artists, arts and humanities advocates, and
entrepreneurs to discuss the economic impact of the arts on the region.
This was a great opportunity to learn valuable information from small
business owners, museum directors, and members of the technology
industry who agree that the arts play a critical role in the future of
the region's economy. As a co-founder of the bi-partisan STEAM
Caucus, I am excited about the innovation and
creativity that results from integrating arts into STEM.
Extending Emergency Unemployment
I spoke on the House floor in support of extending emergency
unemployment insurance. The number of people who have lost coverage has
now surpassed two million; that includes one of my constituents who
tells me he's been forced into default after losing his coverage. I
recently co-sponsored legislation to provide for a six-month
forbearance on mortgages of homeowners who have lost unemployment
insurance because of Congressional inaction. Watch my floor speech here
.
Meeting with Oregon's Small Businesses
I met with members of Oregon's Main Street Alliance to discuss the
significant role small businesses play in Oregon's economy. We talked
about corporate social responsibility and the need to close offshore
tax loopholes.
Science Advisory Group
Scientific research and development is vital to Oregon's economy; it
spurs discoveries and innovation, creates jobs, and encourages the next
generation of scientists. It helps us plan for more sustainable
communities, guides our decisions on how to protect the environment,
and informs us how to best use our natural resources. To help inform my
work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I recently formed
an advisory group of prominent Oregon scientists and decision-makers to
discuss legislation and Oregon's research priorities.
Honoring Women
During Women's History Month, I celebrated the nation's women by
calling for economic equality. Women constitute nearly half the
country's workforce, but nationally still make about $0.77 for every
dollar a man makes. More women are serving as heads of household for
their family. We need Equal Pay for Equal Work - because when women
succeed, America succeeds. Watch my Women's History Month video here

To

I
