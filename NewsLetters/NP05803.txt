The news of the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States is beyond troubling. My office has been and will continue to be in close contact with federal, state and local health officials to ensure we are doing everything we can to protect our citizens and prevent the further spread of this terrible disease.
The reported details surrounding the travel of this gentleman from Liberia to the U.S. have raised serious questions about current policy regarding travel and visas from West Africa, and this incident should serve as a wake-up call given the fact that the number of people who have contracted this disease is growing rapidly.
Ultimately, our top priority must be to keep our citizens safe and mitigate an outbreak.
Yours respectfully,
