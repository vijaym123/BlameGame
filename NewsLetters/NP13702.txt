Dear Friend,
Yesterday, I joined a majority of my colleagues in approving a
bipartisan agreement that, if passed by the Senate, will end months of
budget wrangling and avoid a government shutdown over the next two
years. This bill was the result of extensive discussions between
Democratic and Republican budget negotiators from the House and Senate
and it offers some welcome relief from the gridlock and dysfunction
that sadly have become a hallmark of Washington.
We've long known that the sequester's indiscriminate, across-the-board
spending cuts are an irresponsible and inefficient way to budget. In
fact, sequestration has been so damaging to our economy that even some
Republicans are now calling for its repeal. In a first step in this
direction, the proposed budget compromise rolls back $63 billion in
cuts that would have taken effect over the next two years and provides
more flexibility for federal agencies struggling with the $85 billion
of sequestration cuts that remain in place. This holds the promise that
important programs like Head Start can be preserved over the next
couple of years. The agreement also avoids harmful cuts to earned
benefit programs that serve children, seniors, and the disabled.
There are certainly components of the deal that gave me pause. I was
disappointed that federal employees took another hit in this package,
which finances some of the sequester relief by cutting $6 billion from
pension benefits for people who choose public service in the future.
For the last few years, our dedicated public servants have been used as
a deficit reduction piggy bank, contributing more than $114 billion in
savings through pay freezes and increased pension contributions. It is
unfair to repeatedly target federal employees and I believe there were
better ways to raise an equivalent amount of revenue.
I was also very disappointed about a number of priorities that were not
included in the bill. Republican opposition to extending long term
unemployment benefits will have an immediate and detrimental impact on
1.3 million job-seekers who will lose their benefits on December 28th.
Though the job market has been improving, the economy is still not
working as it should for average Americans. The damage will continue
over the first half of next year when benefits will be cut off for an
additional 1.9 million people looking for work. I plan to join many of
my colleagues in urging that we retroactively restore these
unemployment benefits in January.
The agreement is also silent on the critical investments that are
necessary to get our country back on track. Our roads, public transit
and water infrastructure are in desperate need of repair. Our
commitment to education, research and scientific innovation is
inadequate. These investments create jobs and there are responsible
ways to pay for them. For starters, we should eliminate corporate
subsidies for the oil and gas industry. In addition, our tax code is
littered with special interest loopholes for the Wall Street crowd and
those should be repealed.
Unfortunately, big money campaign donors and high powered lobbyists
relentlessly defend these loopholes. Until we reform the way our
political campaigns are financed
so that every-day Americans
have a real voice that can be heard in the policy-making process, these
abuses will continue.
There is so much more work to be done. But in a year of frustrating
political gridlock and partisan bickering, even modest progress is
welcome. My hope is that this agreement will set the stage for
additional cooperation on some of the tremendous challenges we face in
the coming year.
Happy holidays to you and yours!
Sincerely,
John P. Sarbanes

Dear
Friend,
Yesterday,
I
joined
a
majority
of
my
colleagues
in
approving
a
bipartisan
agreement
that,
if
passed
by
the
Senate,
will
end
months
of
budget
wrangling
and
avoid
a
government
shutdown
over
the
next
two
years.
This
bill
was
the
result
of
extensive
discussions
between
Democratic
and
Republican
budget
negotiators
from
the
House
and
Senate
and
it
offers
some
welcome
relief
from
the
gridlock
and
dysfunction
that
sadly
have
become
a
hallmark
of
Washington.
We&#8217;ve
long
known
that
the
sequester&#8217;s
indiscriminate,
across-the-board
spending
cuts
are
an
irresponsible
and
inefficient
way
to
budget.
In
fact,
sequestration
has
been
so
damaging
to
our
economy
that
even
some
Republicans
are
now
calling
for
its
repeal.
In
a
first
step
in
this
direction,
the
proposed
budget
compromise
rolls
back
$63
billion
in
cuts
that
would
have
taken
effect
over
the
next
two
years
and
provides
more
flexibility
for
federal
agencies
struggling
with
the
$85
billion
of
sequestration
cuts
that
remain
in
place.
This
holds
the
promise
that
important
programs
like
Head
Start
can
be
preserved
over
the
next
couple
of
years.
The
agreement
also
avoids
harmful
cuts
to
earned
benefit
programs
that
serve
children,
seniors,
and
the
disabled.
There
are
certainly
components
of
the
deal
that
gave
me
pause.
I
was
disappointed
that
federal
employees
took
another
hit
in
this
package,
which
finances
some
of
the
sequester
relief
by
cutting
$6
billion
from
pension
benefits
for
people
who
choose
public
service
in
the
future.
For
the
last
few
years,
our
dedicated
public
servants
have
been
used
as
a
deficit
reduction
piggy
bank,
contributing
more
than
$114
billion
in
savings
through
pay
freezes
and
increased
pension
contributions.
It
is
unfair
to
repeatedly
target
federal
employees
and
I
believe
there
were
better
ways
to
raise
an
equivalent
amount
of
revenue.
I
was
also
very
disappointed
about
a
number
of
priorities
that
were
not
included
in
the
bill.
Republican
opposition
to
extending
long
term
unemployment
benefits
will
have
an
immediate
and
detrimental
impact
on
1.3
million
job-seekers
who
will
lose
their
benefits
on
December
28th.
Though
the
job
market
has
been
improving,
the
economy
is
still
not
working
as
it
should
for
average
Americans.
The
damage
will
continue
over
the
first
half
of
next
year
when
benefits
will
be
cut
off
for
an
additional
1.9
million
people
looking
for
work.
I
plan
to
join
many
of
my
colleagues
in
urging
that
we
retroactively
restore
these
unemployment
benefits
in
January.
The
agreement
is
also
silent
on
the
critical
investments
that
are
necessary
to
get
our
country
back
on
track.
Our
roads,
public
transit
and
water
infrastructure
are
in
desperate
need
of
repair.
Our
commitment
to
education,
research
and
scientific
innovation
is
inadequate.
These
investments
create
jobs
and
there
are
responsible
ways
to
pay
for
them.
For
starters,
we
should
eliminate
corporate
subsidies
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry.
In
addition,
our
tax
code
is
littered
with
special
interest
loopholes
for
the
Wall
Street
crowd
and
those
should
be
repealed.
Unfortunately,
big
money
campaign
donors
and
high
powered
lobbyists
relentlessly
defend
these
loopholes.
Until
we
reform
the
way
our
political
campaigns
are
financed
so
that
every-day
Americans
have
a
real
voice
that
can
be
heard
in
the
policy-making
process,
these
abuses
will
continue.
There
is
so
much
more
work
to
be
done.
But
in
a
year
of
frustrating
political
gridlock
and
partisan
bickering,
even
modest
progress
is
welcome.
My
hope
is
that
this
agreement
will
set
the
stage
for
additional
cooperation
on
some
of
the
tremendous
challenges
we
face
in
the
coming
year.
Happy
holidays
to
you
and
yours!
