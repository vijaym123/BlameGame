Friend,
It's the last day of our fundraising quarter, and normally I would be sending you an email pushing for our deadline-- but after what happened this morning, I had to reconsider.
This morning, in a shocking decision, the Supreme Court decided that employers are allowed to dictate what kind of birth control their female employees have access to.
Isn't that absolutely unbelievable? As a doctor, husband, and father of a daughter, I'm infuriated. I trust the women in my life and in my practice to have the final say in their birth control options - their body, their lives, their choice. I'm so stunned by this morning's ruling, I don't even know where to begin.
This is why elections matter. In Congress, I fight every day for you and your family's right to private, personal healthcare choices, free of government or employer intrusions. I can't say the same for my opponent. That's why, if you haven't already, I ask that you pitch in $5 or more today to help us hit our goal. This is not about the money, but with your help, we can continue our fight in Washington.
I'm frustrated, but I'm not giving up. I'll continue to fight in Congress for personal freedom and the sacred right of complete and accurate medical care, free from outside influence. Click here so I can keep fighting.
Thanks - talk soon.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California's 7th District

Friend,
Wanted to make sure you saw Ami&#39;s email this morning.
I can&#39;t believe the Supreme Court believes that employers have the right to make decisions about my reproductive options. This is personal and outrageous.
It&#39;s the 21st century. We should be past this. The fact that we&#39;re re-litigating access to BIRTH CONTROL - it makes no sense. It really doesn&#39;t.
Ami is committed to fighting against this insanity and to protecting rights that the women who came before us so bravely fought for -
can you click here and give $5 to help him continue his work?
Thanks for standing with us in this - although the decision this morning temporarily set us back, this is NOT the end of this battle. I&#39;m fired up. Ami is too.
Click here to stand with us and fight.
Thanks. Don&#39;t give up.
Best,
Janine Bera, MD
PS - I&#39;m proud that my husband is a man who trusts women, and stands with them instead of speaking for them - click here to see a video of him standing with Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California at the Supreme Court.
