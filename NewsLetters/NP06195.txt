Here&rsquo;s the good (ok, amazing) news:
Earlier today, Hillary Clinton announced that she&rsquo;s going all-in to elect Democrats this November! And already, over 95OO of you have stepped up! But here&rsquo;s the bad (ok, terrible) news:
We just got word that Boehner is launching his BIGGEST ad blitz of the entire election. And it all starts TOMORROW.
So here&rsquo;s what we need to do:
-- Respond to these Obama-bashing attacks
-- Answer Hillary&rsquo;s call-to-action (see below)
-- Raise $1 million before the ad buy deadline
According to our records, it doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;ve had a chance to reply to Hillary&rsquo;s inspiring call-to-action yet:
David Johnson Answered Hillary Clinton's Call-to-Action? NO DONATION
Can you step up?
