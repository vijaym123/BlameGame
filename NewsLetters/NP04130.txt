Dear
Friend,
Thanksgiving is a time of joy and remembrance,
looking back over the past year and celebrating all of lifes blessings.
Thanksgiving gives us cause to pause and realize that despite all our
hardships we still have reasons to be grateful. Whether those reasons are
turkey and pumpkin pie or seeing your family for the first time in
months, the holiday provides a chance to delight in all things great and
small.
For many of us, gratitude and a spirit of
Thanksgiving are an integral teaching of our faith. Yet, the 4th Thursday in
November has been designated a federal holiday for so long for a reason.
As a country, we have so many reasons to be thankful. Taking the time
to acknowledge that is important evidence of the values we still
hold.
Over the next weeks and months, individuals, families,
businesses, and yes, a new Congress, will be looking toward the future.
Today, it's important to look at what we have and be grateful not only
for those things, but for the potential each of us has to do so much
more.
Wishing you and yours a blessed
Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
