Dear David,
As 2014 draws to a
close, I want to take a moment to say how grateful I am to serve you and
the Rochester area.
This year has been tumultuous, and it
seems that every day, we hear about more bad news: global epidemics,
unending wars, increasing inequality, and senseless terrorist attacks.
Simply turning on the nightly news is enough to remind one of the lines
from Henry Longfellows
Christmas Bells , There is no peace
on earth, for hate is strong, and mocks the song of peace on earth,
good-will to men!
And yet, as we gather together with family
and friends during this special season, we will all have the
opportunity to spread peace and good-will through the gifts we give, meals we
share, and rest we enjoy. Indeed, it seems that during the holiday
season, we are always able to give a little more of ourselves to others
than we can during the rest of the year.
It is my hope that
we can all carry this holiday spirit into the upcoming year. As Gandhi
reminds us, If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world
would also changeWe need not wait to see what others do. We should
never forget that we can all help bring about a more just and peaceful
world every single day. With this in mind, I look forward to
continuing to work with you in the New Year to hasten the arrival of peace on
earth and good-will toward all.
Happy
Holidays!
Louise
