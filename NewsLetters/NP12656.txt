I Wasn't Impressed
Dear Friend,
On Tuesday, I attended President Obama's State of the Union Address. I
wasn't impressed. It was yet another speech loaded with more of the
same rhetoric. The President likes to pass the blame for his stagnant
economy onto House Republicans but we've passed dozens of jobs bills,
all of which are stuck on Senator Reid's desk. If the President is
serious about his so-called 'Year of Action', he can start by telling
Senator Reid to pass those bills. On the heels of December's jobs
report, which had the worst Labor Force Participation Rate since April
1978, Americans are looking for real solutions, not more empty promises.
Furthermore, President Obama is once again promising to dictate his
policy goals through executive fiat, circumventing Congress and the
Constitution. Given the Administration's disregard for the rule of law
and the Constitution, I can't say this is surprising. But it is
certainly unacceptable. As a member of the House Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform, it's my responsibility to hold the federal
government accountable and ensure the rule of law is upheld. I take
that responsibility seriously and will continue to fulfill it. Click

official statement.
We Are the Party of KNOW
The President likes to say Republicans are the party of "no." But, in
actuality, Republicans are the party of KNOW. We know that ObamaCare is
a disaster and we know we need patient-centered, free-market healthcare
reform. Two of my colleagues in the GOP Doctors Caucus, Reps. Tom Price
(GA-06) and Phil Roe (TN-01), and I filmed a video describing some of
our alternatives to ObamaCare. Click HERE
or below to watch the video.
Mr. President, We're Watching You
On Thursday, I joined with Reps. Trent Franks and Matt Salmon in
sending a letter
to
President Obama in which we informed him that his threats to ignore the
Constitution's separation of powers are unacceptable, and that we will
continue to watch him and the Administration to ensure our laws and
Constitution are adhered to. Click HERE
to read more. You can also read our letter to the President by clicking

.
Then, on Friday, I announced my co-sponsorship of the Stop This
Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution (H.Res.442), which would
direct the House of Representatives to compel the President, through
legal action, to comply with the law.
The fact that we were forced to introduce legislation to judicially
compel the President to comply with the laws of the land is incredibly
sad. One expects imperial behavior in countries ruled by dictators but
not in the United States of America, which was once known worldwide as
a beacon of freedom and hope. From President Obama's capricious
one-year delay in the ObamaCare employer mandate to his arbitrary
decision to grant deferred removal action to illegal immigrants, his
transgressions against the Constitution are egregious and must stop.

Is Justice Still Blind?
Holding the Administration accountable starts with Attorney General
Eric Holder. From Fast & Furious to the AP scandal, his actions are
unacceptable. Click HERE

whether Mr. Holder has upheld his oath of office.
Demanding Better for Arizona and America
On Wednesday, I voted against the flawed Farm Bill (H.R.2642). This is
the second bill this month that was brought to the House floor for a
vote less than 48 hours after it was introduced. At 959 pages, this
bill is too long for anyone to read and digest in such a short time
frame. This is a negative pattern that can't become a habit. We must
reverse this trend.
In addition to the limited time we were given for review, I voted
against the Farm Bill because it's bad legislation. It continues the
flawed practice of combining agricultural legislation with safety net
programs like food stamps. These are two very different things that
should be aired out and debated by the American people as separate
issues.
Moreover, the bill didn't include a work requirement for food stamp
benefits and most of the savings from the original House-passed Farm
Bill evaporated in the final bill. The final bill was also stripped of
important House-passed language modifying certain livestock
regulations, which will have an overall negative impact on Arizona's
livestock industry - a sizable component of our economy. Click HERE

more.
Protecting the Unborn
On Tuesday, I voted in favor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Act (H.R.7), which passed the House of Representatives by a bipartisan
vote of 227-188. Legislation that permanently outlaws taxpayer-funded
abortion is long overdue. Americans across the country worry that, if
certain laws aren't reauthorized every year, their hard-earned money
could be used to pay for the execution of unborn babies through
abortion. This bill will finally make the temporary laws that prevent
taxpayer-funded abortion permanent. I was proud to vote for this
life-saving legislation. Click HERE

Dear

On

If
the

he
can
start
by
telling
