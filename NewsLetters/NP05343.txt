Responding to the Ebola Crisis
If you've
been following the news, you will know that Ebola has now spread from West Africa to the United States. While it is important to keep perspective on
the outbreak overseas, cases of Ebola now spreading in the continental United States is of extreme concern. As we continue to learn more about these
cases and how the disease was spread from an infected patient in Dallas to two nurses, it is critical that the federal government take the necessary
actions to protect the American people.

information on Ebola.
Yesterday, I
sent a
letter
to President Obama asking him to use the authority granted
to him by Congress in the
Immigration and Nationality Act
to temporarily ban foreign nationals who were recently in one of the Ebola-ravaged
countries in West Africa from traveling to the United States. I also
wrote
to the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Transportation (DOT) asking about the response to Ebola by the United States thus far. I will continue to
closely monitor this response and continue working to ensure that the federal government is doing everything it can to protect the American people
from Ebola.
Protecting Your Health Care Plan
If you like your health care
plan, you can keep it. Right? Well, despite President Obama&rsquo;s promises that under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, you could keep your
health care plan, millions of Americans have discovered that is simply not true.
Now, a year after the troubled rollout of Obamacare, millions more Americans will find out that they are also losing their health care plans,
including many thousands of Virginians. Many individuals who work for small businesses are now losing their employer sponsored plans because the plans
do not comply with all of the costly Obamacare mandates.
In order to
protect those set to lose their plans this year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the
Employee Health Care Protection Act
(H.R. 3522)
in September by a bipartisan vote. This legislation
gives Americans a choice and would allow employers in the group insurance market to continue to offer their existing health insurance plans, even if
they don&rsquo;t quite meet all of the Obamacare requirements, through 2018.
I have opposed Obamacare from the start and these cancelled plans and increasing premiums are just another symptom of a fundamentally flawed law.
The
Employee Health Care Protection Act
would allow more Americans to keep plans that they like and not discourage small businesses from
creating new jobs. I urge the Senate to take up this legislation and join the House in protecting the American people from the negative side effects
of Obamacare.

Good News for U.S. Livestock, Poultry
Industries
This
week, I joined United States Trade Representative Michael Froman to announce an important victory at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on behalf
of U.S. farmers. Recently, the WTO ruled that India's ban on various U.S. agricultural products, allegedly to protect against avian influenza, was not
valid and was imposed without sufficient scientific evidence. This ruling sends a strong message that the United States will demand a level
playing field for U.S. grown and made products in the international marketplace. American agriculture is dependent on access to global markets and a
vibrant trade policy. This ruling opens the door for increased market access of U.S. livestock products, including poultry, which plays a key role in
Virginia&rsquo;s economy. I look forward to seeing the positive economic impact of this ruling.
