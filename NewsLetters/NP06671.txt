LEGISLATIVE
September 05, 2014
D e ar Friends,
Summer is coming to a close soon, and
children have just started school.
This fall, four-year-olds
are also heading to the classroom as New York State implements a
universal pre-Kindergarten program.
Numerous studies have
shown that children who start learning early are more likely to
succeed academically throughout their schooling, and are more likely to
continue their education after earning a high school diploma than those
who have not been exposed to early learning initiatives.
Unfortunately, children from disadvantaged household often
face additional obstacles which limit their access to such programs.
Thats why I am pleased that New York has taken the lead in creating a
universal pre-Kindergarten program.
As a former
educator, I encourage parents to partner with teachers. Children whose
parents are active participants in their education tend to do better in
school. Make it a priority to speak with your children's teachers
regularly to discuss their academic progress or any problems your children
are having in the classroom.
There are different ways parents
can keep their children engaged throughout school. Parents can
motivate young children to get excited about learning by reading to them and
taking regular trips to the library. Middle school is a great time
for children to start exploring possible career interests, and parents
can help teens prepare for college or vocational
school.
One of my top priorities
this legislative session has been ensuring that post-secondary
education remains affordable. I have co-sponsored bills that would keep
student loan interest rates low for college students and that strengthen
our commitment to students from low-income households by increasing the
limit on federal Pell Grants.
But without a strong
academic foundation, starting with pre-K, an affordable higher education
may only be a dream for far too many
Americans.
Investing in education is a
fundamental investment in our future. I promise to continue my efforts to
ensure that all of our children have a chance to
succeed.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
