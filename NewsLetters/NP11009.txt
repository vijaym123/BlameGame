This week not only marked the
four-year anniversary of ObamaCare, but also the health care laws
30 th
delay.
This delay came as no surprise as Obama has
proven the law is not working by his own
submission.
As Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations
Subcommittee and a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and
Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, this was a very busy
week for me filled with many important hearings. Tuesday, I chaired a
DHS hearing and
questioned TSA Administrator John
Pistole on TSAs budget requests for FY15. Also as Chairman it is my
duty to ensure congressional oversight of FEMA, therefore
I questioned FEMA Administrator William Craig Fugate on
Wednesday about FEMAs budget requests and their ability to maintain disaster
preparedness and assist Americans in times of
crisis.
Additionally this week, I attended three Defense
hearings to discuss FY15 budget requests. Wednesday morning, I questioned
Secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James and Wednesday afternoon, I
attended a hearing for PACOM and the US Forces of North
Korea.
Lastly,
I questioned Secretary
of the Army, Honorable John McHugh, and Chief of Staff of the Army,
General Odierno , on Thursday about significant budget issues that
affect army readiness and national
security.
Fort Hood remains a top priority of mine. I questioned FBI Director
James Comey at a CJS hearing on Wednesday about the steps the FBI has
taken in the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting to ensure a similar
tragic event doesnt reoccur. In addition, I asked about the progress
the FBI has made in the 18 important recommendations the Webster
Commission made in the report of the Fort Hood shooting. I plan to meet with
Director Comey after his meeting with William Webster to discuss the
recommendations and the FBIs progress. I will continue to fight and
demand answers for the Fort Hood shooting
victims.
To finish up my week in Washington,
I
had the pleasure of meeting with Killeen Mayor, Dan Corbin , to
discuss Killeen priorities and
initiatives.
I am headed back to Texas for a few days before coming back to D.C. on
Tuesday, April 2 nd
for another busy
week.
