Good ideas dont originate in a vacuum
Good ideas dont
originate in a vacuum. Good ideas are the end product of open
discussion, and the nation is having an important discussion on protecting
privacy rights of Americans, religious freedom, the definition of
marriage, and whether or not Congress should reauthorize outdated institutions
like the Export-Import Bank. You are invited to share your ideas on
these topics and any others that are on your mind. Your are invited to
join my tele-townhall on Wednesday night at 6:00 p.m. MT.

Visit my Mobile Office in Salt Lake County
today
One of the best ways for Utahns to keep in touch with my
office is to
visit my mobile office
when it is in
your area.
During a mobile office visit, a member of my staff
comes to a nearby city to open a dialogue between local residents and my
office about important local issues.
On May 13 my mobile office
will be visiting Magna and Taylorsville:
