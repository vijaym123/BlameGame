Dear Neighbor,
We&rsquo;re proud to announce the
Protecting Our Schools and Communities Act , which directly
benefits our local schools . Our bill puts local school districts in a better position to access School Resource Officers and helps keeps our kids safe. By reauthorizing the COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) program on a long-term, five-year basis, we can ensure that our schools will have the resources they need to protect students. We all have a shared goal: keeping our kids safe. School Resource Officers play a significant role in this goal, and we&rsquo;re happy to help our schools have access to these officers.
With members of the board and local school officials.
COMBATING THE GROWING DRUG PROBLEM
We recently joined with Congresswoman Susan Brooks of Indiana for a
roundtable discussion
on the growing drug use problem. Local health professionals, law enforcement officials, and local officials all weighed in and gave their input on the different ways to reduce the number of drug-related crimes in New York&rsquo;s Southern Tier and Finger Lakes. Last month, Chautauqua County was designated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, allowing the country to receive Federal funds to reduce drug-related crime. Our roundtable discussion is yet another way we can care for those who are victims of illegal drug activity and potentially prevent some of our neighbors from becoming victims. Drugs continue to devastate too many communities across our nation&mdash;we will keep seeking out ways to combat this growing problem.
ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO TREATMENTS
With the staff at Schuyler Hospital and local officials.
Today, we had the chance to
stop by
Schuyler Hospital in Montour falls to talk about our
Ensuring equal Access to Treatments Act . This bipartisan effort would ensure seniors suffering from cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses have access to the most up-to-date, state of the art treatments. Caring for our patients means putting them first; by requiring Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use fair payment classifications, we can get seniors the care they need and deserve.
P.S &ndash;
&ldquo;What do you want to do after high school?&rdquo; we asked a group of students at a recent visit to Penn Yan Academy.
P.P.S &ndash;
Yesterday we conducted an employee town hall Q&amp;A at Kennedy Valve in Elmira.
P.P.P.S &ndash;
We attended the Fredonia Science Center Dedication and ribbon cutting ceremony&hellip; and cut through DNA!
Best,
Tom
