Will
Change Lead to Commonsense Solutions?
Below is a recent column from Congressman
Lipinski:
"Another election has come
and gone and many people have again voted for change.
It has
been apparent for some time that people believe the country is generally
moving in the wrong direction and they are frustrated with
government.
"The rebuilding of trust must begin with
both parties working together towards commonsense solutions.
People
are hearing that the unemployment rate is falling and the stock
market is breaking records, but they arent seeing more dollars in their
pockets.
Congress top priority must be to promote policies that
lead to the creation of more good-paying jobs.
"As Illinois' most senior member on the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, I know that one good move Washington can make is
to pass a long-term comprehensive road and transit funding bill.
For safety and economic reasons, as well as overall quality of life,
commonsense dictates that Republicans and Democrats must compromise on
this issue and get it done.
We should also work together to
reform our tax code, put our fiscal house in order, strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, and honor our
veterans."

Rep. Lipinskis Bill Renaming Mount Greenwood Post
Office for Fallen Firefighter Capt. Herbie Johnson Clears Congress, Sent
to President
The Senate has passed Congressman Dan
Lipinskis (IL-3) bill renaming Chicagos Mount Greenwood Post Office as
the Captain Herbert Johnson Memorial Post Office Building.
Captain Herbert Herbie Johnson died on November 2, 2012, at the age of
54, while battling flames in the attic of a two-story home on Chicagos
South Side.
The bill passed the House earlier this year and now
awaits the Presidents signature.
On Monday, Rep.
Lipinski was joined by members of Herbie Johnsons family, local
firefighters, and Ald. Matt OShea at the Mount Greenwood Post Office, located
at 3349 West 111th Street, to celebrate passage of the
bill.
"Captain Johnson
heroically served area residents for over 32 years, paying the ultimate
price while protecting his citys residents," Rep. Lipinski said.
"While his duties took him to almost every part of Chicago, his heart
belonged to the Southwest Side, especially to the close-knit
community of Mount Greenwood.
Herbies wife of 28 years, Susan, his two
sons, Thomas and Michael, and his daughter, Laurie, as well as all of
Herbies family, continue to be in my prayers and the prayers of so
many other people in the surrounding area who knew him well, not only as
a courageous and dedicated public servant, but also as an outgoing
and caring neighbor and
friend."

Rep. Lipinski Issues Statement
on the Passing of Illinois Comptroller Judy Baar
Topinka
Official statement from Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) on the
passing of Illinois Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka, the first woman in
Illinois to serve in two state constitutional
offices:
"I am deeply saddened by
the sudden loss of Judy Baar Topinka.
She was a great public
servant with unlimited fight in her, not only for issues, but for people
she believed in.
Judy knew how to get things done and was willing
to do what it takes to get them done.
She was one-of-a-kind and
will be dearly missed.
My thoughts and prayers go out to her
family and friends, of whom she had
many."
