Dear Friend:
On January 19th, the American people will honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., offering us an opportunity to reflect on Dr. King's tireless efforts to make America a land of freedom and opportunity for all people.

It is only fitting that we honor Dr. King's birthday by working to improve the lives of others.
Throughout our nation, people will serve their communities by feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, and offering a guiding hand to at-risk youth.
For information on how to volunteer, please visit the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service website at
http://mlkday.gov/ .
Dr. King once said, "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
Our country has come a long way since Dr. King spoke those words, but the tragic deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner remind us that our work is far from done.
Far too many Americans have lost trust in our criminal justice system, which undermines our communities and our society as a whole.
That is why I wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder thanking him for his leadership and urging him to ensure that we have a justice system that treats everyone equally under the law. We cannot, we must not stop fighting until every American can count on equal justice under the law.

That is how we will honor Dr. King's legacy and build a stronger America.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
