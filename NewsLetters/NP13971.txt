News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
November 25, 2013
Dear Friends,
I know this is a busy week for many of you-preparing your home for
guests, cooking for friends and family, or traveling to see loved ones.
So Randy's Roundup will be short and simple.
Last week we worked on a number of issues in Washington. In the Science
Committee, we held a hearing with experts on data security to examine
whether your personal information is secure on the Obamacare website. I
was surprised and dismayed to learn that the top searches on
healthcare.gov are for code vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. I
asked the experts about the fact that Obamacare navigators aren't
required to get federal background checks. They said navigators could
easily steal your identity with the information they're given. You can
watch that exchange here
.
I had a productive meeting
with representatives from the five
states working to implement the Western Association of Fish and
Wildlife Range-Wide Conservation Plan to prevent listing the Lesser
Prairie-Chicken as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act. A
listing could be costly for landowners, energy producers, and farmers
and ranchers in West Texas. So I'm hopeful the Fish and Wildlife
Service will acknowledge that with this plan in place, a listing won't
be necessary.
We also passed three
energy
bills
last week, as part of the House Republicans'
efforts to promote affordable American energy.
We'll be back in session on December 2, and I'll update you then on our
schedule for the rest of 2013.
Until then, I'd like to share what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving.
First, I'm grateful to all of you, who have given me the opportunity to
serve as your voice in Washington. It's humbling and inspiring to
represent such great Americans.
I give thanks every day to the men and women in uniform who serve our
country and defend our freedoms. I'm also thankful to all those who
serve here at home-from police to firefighters, from nurses to EMTs-our
emergency responders keep us safe and secure. And of course, as I sit
down to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with my family, I'm grateful to the
farmers and ranchers who work to produce the food that nourishes us
every day.
I hope that you and your family have a happy and blessed Thanksgiving.

Dear
