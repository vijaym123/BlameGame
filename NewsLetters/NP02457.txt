Forbes on Prime Minister Netanyahus Address to Congress
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) released the following statement in advance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus address to both Chambers of Congress:
At a time when our allies across the globe continue to have questions about this Administrations commitment and competency, the United States support for Israel should be unwavering. Instead, we see the White House prioritizing risky negotiations with a nuclear obsessed Iran over the concerns of a trusted ally, and Democratic Members of Congress playing into a partisan spectacle rather than respecting the longstanding relationship between our two countries. To allow the American commitment to the nation of Israel to be thus called into question is not only shortsighted, it is detrimental to security and U.S. interests in the region.
