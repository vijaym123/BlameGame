Dear friends,
It's been a busy few weeks, and I wanted to give you an update on some
of my recent work in Central New York.
I kicked off the District Work Period by announcing my participation in
the SNAP Challenge. SNAP is a critical anti-hunger program that feeds
millions of low income Americans, including children, veterans, and
seniors that would not otherwise have the resources to buy groceries.
As part of the SNAP challenge, I ate on a budget of $4.20 per day, the
average grocery budget that a SNAP recipients live on daily. I visited
a food pantry in Syracuse to talk about my experience on the SNAP
Challenge and to learn about the food pantry's work to serve some of
the most vulnerable in our communities.

Last week I also hosted a number of events across the 24th District
focusing on strengthening our local economy, including a rural
broadband symposium, a roundtable focused on improving infrastructure,
and a workshop with military and defense industry leaders in Central
New York to provide information on the Fiscal Year 2014 National
Defense Authorization Act process.
Upgrading our infrastructure is a key component of my jobs plan. I
firmly believe we must make smart investments in infrastructure - from
roads and bridges, to airports and water and sewer systems -- in order
for local businesses to grow, hire new workers, and create jobs. During
my first infrastructure roundtable in Onondaga County, I met with local
leaders to discuss ways we can improve the structural framework that
supports our communities to grow our economy. Over the next few months
I will be hosting additional infrastructure roundtables across the 24th
Congressional District.
As part of my rural broadband symposium at Red Creek High School in
Wayne County, I brought together state officials, rural broadband
experts, telecommunications executives, and other key leaders and
community members to discuss ways to expand internet services to our
rural areas.
Broadband internet is an important economic engine;
unfortunately, some of our rural communities in Central New York do not
have access to this important high-speed technology. Bringing broadband
to rural communities in Wayne and Cayuga Counties will help strengthen
the local economy, create jobs, improve educational opportunities for
students, and streamline the delivery of health care services. I was
thankful to have the opportunity during my broadband symposium to hear
from local stakeholders and explore ways to create public partnerships
that will help bring broadband to Wayne and Cayuga Counties.

It's important to me to continue hearing directly from economic leaders
across the region about the policies that affect their businesses.
That's why I recently announced the formation of both a Small Business
Advisory Council and an Agriculture Advisory Board for the 24th
Congressional District.
I look forward to meeting with the both of
these groups to discuss the issues that matter to them the most and
partnering with them on finding solutions to strengthen Central New
York's economy.
I encourage you to contact my office to share your thoughts and
concerns. As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House
of Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
friends,
It&#8217;s
been
a
busy
few
weeks,
and
I
wanted
to
give
you
an
update
on
some

my recent

in
Central
New

I
kicked
off
the
District

the

a
SNAP

live

It&#8217;s
important
to
me
to
continue
hearing
directly
from
economic
leaders
across
the
region
about
the
policies
that
affect
their
businesses.
That&#8217;s
why
I
recently
announced
the
formation
of
both
a

an

Advisory
Board

As

it
is
