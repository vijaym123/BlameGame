Dear Friend:
Following alarming
reports
that nearly 50,000 undocumented and unaccompanied children have been held in poor conditions at temporary detention facilities this year alone, I
wrote
to President Obama today urging him to sign an executive order ensuring humane treatment for all individuals held at these facilities.
This proposed executive order is modeled on
legislation
I introduced last year, the Humane Short Term Custody Act, which would direct the Department of Homeland Security to require short-term detention facilities to set standards guaranteeing access to food, water, bathrooms, beds, and medical care.
To read my letter to the President or learn more about the legislation, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
