Dear
Mothers,
Thank you. Thank you for your grace, your patience,
and your unfailing love. You are truly an inspiration to your
children. Even if your kids are grown and have a family of their own, you
will always be their source of comfort during their struggles and of
pride during their successes.
A single day of
appreciation will never repay the love and attention you give to your
family, but know that not a day goes by that we do not think of you. You
have given us life and to that we can credit all of humanity. Today
we acknowledge and honor you; but every day we give thanks for
you.
With sincere gratitude,
Jim Inhofe
