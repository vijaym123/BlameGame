Dear
Friend,
I would like to take a brief moment to update you on Flood
Insurance Reform, which has been an important issue to many Long
Islanders.
Last month, President Obama signed into law the Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.
This law repeals and
modifies certain provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act,
which was enacted in 2012, and makes additional program changes to
other aspects of the program not covered by that
Act.
For months, I have been working with my colleagues in Congress to
address the unforeseen consequences of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance
Reform Act of 2012, as well as to improve the accountability of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency when it comes to the implementation
of the flood insurance program.
As a Long Islander, I
understand the frustration my neighbors are experiencing regarding
flood insurance rate increases, especially in the wake of Superstorm
Sandy.
With the rising cost of other expenses, the financial burden
of mandatory flood insurance has created an additional strain on many
Long Island homeowners.
Reducing the financial burden and
ensuring that the cost of flood insurance will not force anyone from their
home, or reduce their ability to sell their home is a good start to
brining relief to those who have been burdened by FEMAs flood insurance
program.
I am pleased to see that my constituents will benefit
from this legislation in the near future.
The Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act contains a number of key provisions
including: the repeal of certain rate increase triggers such as the sale
of a home; the lowering of FEMAs ability to raise rates from 20%-15%;
the restoration of the grandfathering provision that would allow
homeowners of properties built to code in the past to not have to worry
about massive increases due to new mapping; and the requirement of FEMA
to complete the affordability study and
framework.
FEMA recently released an overview about the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act.
For more information please visit
FEMAs website .
As always, I thank you for
your time and attention.
It is pleasure and honor to serve as
your representative in Congress.
Please feel free to visit
my website
for updates, or contact me or my
staff with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Carolyn
McCarthy
Member of Congress
