Rubio: Shinseki Resignation Only First
Step Toward Real Reform
Marco issued the following statement
regarding Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary
Eric Shinsekis resignation, calling
on Senate Democrats to empower his
successor and bring greater accountability
to the VA by supporting S. 2013, the
VA Management
Accountability Act of 2014
. Marco is the Senates original
sponsor of the bill, which passed the U.S.
House of Representatives with the support
of 165 Democrats and is co-sponsored by
seven Democrats in the United States
Senate.
Secretary Shinsekis
resignation is just the first step in
addressing the institutional neglect of
veterans at the VA, but that alone
wont solve the problem. The
systemic mismanagement will continue
unless we bring reform to the VA and hold
all those who are responsible
accountable. Under current law, whoever
succeeds Secretary Shinseki will be
prohibited from firing VA employees such
as those detailed in the inspector
generals latest report, who have
failed at their jobs and therefore failed
our nations veterans.
This level of failure is simply
inexcusable and must be fixed
immediately. Our veterans deserve the
best medical treatment possible, which is
why I hope more Senate Democrats will
join in supporting the VA Management
Accountability Act of 2014, a bill that
would bring accountability to the VA and
empower the new VA Secretary to fire and
hold accountable those who had
responsibility in neglecting,
mistreating, or mismanaging care for our
veterans. This is a common sense,
bipartisan reform that deserves a vote in
the Senate as soon as possible so we can
better care for those who have
courageously served our
nation.
Rubio Urges Senate To Act On Venezuela
Sanctions Bill
Following the U.S. House of
Representatives action to impose
sanctions on human rights violators in
Venezuela, Marco issued a statement urging
the Senate to move on Venezuela sanctions
legislation. Marco is an original sponsor
of the
Venezuela Defense
of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of
2014
.
The House has taken an
important step to call attention to the
gross human rights violations being
committed in Venezuela by Maduro regime
officials and sanctioning those
responsible. The full Senate should also
move on Venezuela sanctions legislation
when it returns next week.
We are now approaching the four
month mark since Venezuelan students took
to the streets to demand a better future
and their fundamental rights, only to be
met with violent and even deadly force by
the Maduro regime. Sanctions on the
individuals responsible are long
overdue.
Preparing For Hurricane Season
Here are a few tips to help prepare for
the 2014 hurricane season, which officially
begins June 1 and ends November 30:
Know your area and the evacuation
routes. They are available on the
Florida Division
of Emergency Managements
Website
.
Have a
plan to prepare
your home and/or business
with storm shutters or plywood.
Bring items that could be picked up by
the wind and break windows - like lawn
furniture, toys, or trash cans -
inside.
Make sure you know where your
homes safe room is located.
FEMAs
website
details what a safe room should look
like.
Keep your automobile fully fueled; if
electric power is cut off, gas stations
may not be able to operate pumps for
several days.
Be prepared to survive on your own
for a few days. Assemble a disaster kit
with a battery-powered radio,
flashlights, extra batteries, a first-aid
kit, blankets, clothing, food, water, and
prescription medications and needed
medical supplies. The
Florida
Division of Emergency
Management
points you to a good list of items
to have ready.
Know how to shut off utilities. Know
where gas pilots are located and how the
heating and air-conditioning system
works. If you have any questions, contact
your local utility company.
Gather your personal documents -
insurance policy information, emergency
contact information, and any other vital
documents - somewhere they can be easily
located and ready to take with you should
you have to evacuate your home.
Remember, if you need help or have
questions, please
contact
any of our offices and we will do our
best to help.
