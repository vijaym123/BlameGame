Dear Friend,
50 years ago today, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in
Dallas. This week, I visited President Kennedy's grave at Arlington
National Cemetery to pay my respects. Keep reading to learn more about
this week in Washington.

Remembering President John F. Kennedy
President John F. Kennedy inspired me to pursue a legislative career and
dedicate my life to public service. When I was 11, JFK campaigned in
Memphis and I was on the street with my camera hoping to see him and get
a photo. As the motorcade passed me near the Methodist Church on Union,
John Kennedy, sitting up on the backseat of the convertible in which he
rode, turned backed toward me and waved and I snapped the photo which
I've cherished as one of my most prized possessions, as well as one of
my most prized memories. The photo hangs on the wall in Washington D.C.,
near my desk, and I look at it often.
I was 14 years old when President Kennedy was assassinated, but his
death left an indelible mark on me as it did on millions of other
Americans. President Kennedy was a statesman who believed that politics
could be an honorable profession and famously inspired countless
Americans to serve their nation with the immortal words: "ask not what
your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."
President Kennedy gave his life to this country; his assassination was a
great loss for our nation. As we remember the life he lived, as well as
the sad occasion of his death 50 years ago today, I hope my fellow
Americans will take a moment to think back on the good that he did while
he was with us: working for a more just society and fighting for both
our civil rights as well as our human rights.
Before the House of Representatives adjourned for the week, I spoke on
the House floor to commemorate his life. You can watch my speech here
. This week, I was also reminded of one of the favorite records
listened to in the Kennedy White House: the original cast recording of
Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's Camelot. The recording of the
musical included a line that Jacqueline Kennedy wanted her husband and
his Presidency to be known for: "Don't let it be forgot that once there
was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot."
Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Gettysburg Address
This week also marked the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address. Most of us likely remember Lincoln's famous "four
score and seven years ago" line, but perhaps less well remembered are
the words that came later in his address. However they are just as
powerful:
"The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it
can never forget what [the soldiers] did here. It is for us the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be
here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
One hundred and fifty years later, I am proud to serve in the same
legislative body where Abraham Lincoln once served and I remain
dedicated to working hard on the great tasks before us today: ensuring
equality, freedom, and fairness for all.
Helping Families Travel with Their Pets
On Wednesday morning, I joined dog trainer and television personality
Laura Nativo and Congressman Jeff Denham from California at Washington's
Union Station for a press conference in support of the Pets on Trains
Act of 2013. Earlier this year, Congressman Denham and I introduced the
bill to allow families and passengers to travel with domesticated cats
and dogs on certain Amtrak trains-something Amtrak's current policies do
not allow.
Those of us lucky enough to have pets are greatly blessed with their
companionship. When travelling on Amtrak, families should be able to
bring their pets along. Our bill would establish a pet policy on Amtrak
trains so pets - which are a part of the family - won't be left at home
to fend for themselves this holiday season.
Promoting American Innovation and Ingenuity
On Wednesday, I supported bipartisan patent reform legislation in the
House Judiciary Committee that would unleash creativity and create jobs.
Although it is not a perfect bill, it would help protect inventors from
abusive litigation by so-called "patent trolls" and make other needed
reforms to the patent system. As it moves through the legislative
process, I hope it can be improved even further. Our patent system helps
keep the United States on the forefront of innovation and creativity. We
must do everything we can to ensure that inventors can continue to forge
breakthroughs that will lead to economic growth and jobs. I'm glad that
Republicans and Democrats could work together on this important
legislation that promotes innovation, just like we did with the America
Invents Act in 2011, which was introduced in the House by then-Chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith from Texas and passed in a
bipartisan manner.
Protecting Human Rights Abroad
On Monday, I joined with my colleagues in the Congressional Caucus on
Turkey to welcome a delegation of Turkish officials to Capitol Hill.
While Turkey is one of our most valued allies, I feel we must always
hold our friends and allies to the goals of justice and equality to
which the United States aspires. With that in mind, I asked the Turkish
Foreign Minister about reports of antisemitism coming out of their
country. These reports are disturbing, and we must do everything we can
to promote tolerance of all people, in our country and beyond our
borders.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health coverage and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not had
access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to afford
quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's
Health Insurance Marketplace
. If you do not have health insurance coverage, you may be eligible
to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year that you will enroll in, you're already
covered and won't need to enter the Marketplace for your health
coverage. If you aren't sure whether or not you will need to use the
Marketplace to get insurance, call the Marketplace Hotline at
1-800-318-2596 or visit www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option
for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health
insurance, you can sign up
for coverage today that will take effect January 1, 2014.
Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open until March 31, 2014, but
you can go online to www.healthcare.gov
today to check out your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare
paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription medications as
we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health insurance companies
can no longer discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions
and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance
plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit Seedco Mid-South for
in-person help. Seedco is located at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900),
and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341. If you have any other
questions, you should also feel free to call my office at 901-544-4131.
2014 U.S. Capital Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol Historical
Society calendars available. If you would like to receive next year's
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House, I am only able to mail calendars to residents of Tennessee's
9th District. Please feel free to share this email with other citizens
of the Ninth District who may be interested in receiving one but who do
not receive my eNewsletter.
White House Internships
The White House Internship Program is currently accepting applications
from young people who are interested in government and devoted to public
service. If you-or anyone you know- would like to spend some time
working at the White House, gaining valuable professional experience and
building leadership skills, I would like to take this opportunity to
urge you to apply. The application deadline is January 5th, 2014. Click
here
for more information.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

Remembering
President
John
F.
Kennedy
President
John
F.
Kennedy
inspired
me
to
pursue
a
legislative
career
and
dedicate
my
life
to
public
service.
When
I
was
11,
JFK
campaigned
in
Memphis
and
I
was
on
the
street
with
my
camera
hoping
to
see
him
and
get
a
photo. As
the
motorcade
passed
me
near
the
Methodist
Church
on
Union,
John
Kennedy,
sitting
up
on
the
backseat
of
the
convertible
in
which
he
rode,
turned
backed
toward
me
and
waved
and
I
snapped
the
photo
which
I&#8217;ve
cherished
as
one
of
my
most
prized
possessions,
as
well
as
one
of
my
most
prized
memories. The
photo
hangs
on
the
wall
in
Washington
D.C.,
near
my
desk,
and
I
look
at
it
often.
I
was
14
years
old
when
President
Kennedy
was
assassinated,
but
his
death
left
an
indelible
mark
on
me
as
it
did
on
millions
of
other
Americans.
President
Kennedy
was
a
statesman
who
believed
that
politics
could
be
an
honorable
profession
and
famously
inspired
countless
Americans
to
serve
their
nation
with
the
immortal
words:
&#8220;ask
not
what
your
country
can
do
for
you,
but
what
you
can
do
for
your
country.&#8221;
President
Kennedy
gave
his
life
to
this
country;
his
assassination
was
a
great
loss
for
our
nation.
As
we
remember
the
life
he
lived,
as
well
as
the
sad
occasion
of
his
death
50
years
ago
today,
I
hope
my
fellow
Americans
will
take
a
moment
to
think
back
on
the
good
that
he
did
while
he
was
with
us:
working
for
a
more
just
society
and
fighting
for
both
our
civil
rights
as
well
as
our
human
rights.
Before
the
House
of
Representatives
adjourned
for
the
week,
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
to
commemorate
his
life.
You
can
watch
my
speech
here .
This
week,
I
was
also
reminded
of
one
of
the
favorite
records
listened
to
in
the
Kennedy
White
House:
the
original
cast
recording
of
Alan
Jay
Lerner
and
Frederick
Loewe&#8217;s
Camelot .
The
recording
of
the
musical
included
a
line
that
Jacqueline
Kennedy
wanted
her
husband
and
his
Presidency
to
be
known
for:
&#8220;Don't
let
it
be
forgot
that
once
there
was
a
spot,
for
one
brief,
shining
moment
that
was
known
as
Camelot.&#8221;
Commemorating
the
150th
Anniversary
of
the
Gettysburg
Address
This
week
also
marked
the
150th
anniversary
of
President
Lincoln&#8217;s
Gettysburg
Address.
Most
of
us
likely
remember
Lincoln&#8217;s
famous
&#8220;four
score
and
seven
years
ago&#8221;
line,
but
perhaps
less
well
remembered
are
the
words
that
came
later
in
his
address. However they
are
just
as
powerful:
&#8220;The
world
will
little
note,
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here,
but
it
can
never
forget
what
[the
soldiers]
did
here.
It
is
for
us
the
living,
rather,
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced.
It
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us&#8212;that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion&#8212;that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain&#8212;that
this
nation,
under
God,
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom&#8212;and
that
government
of
the
people,
by
the
people,
for
the
people,
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth.&#8221;
One
hundred
and
fifty
years
later,
I
am
proud
to
serve
in
the
same
legislative
body
where
Abraham
Lincoln
once
served
and
I
remain
dedicated
to
working
hard
on
the
great
tasks
before
us
today:
ensuring
equality,
freedom,
and
fairness
for
all.
Helping
Families
Travel
with
Their
Pets
On
Wednesday
morning,
I
joined
dog
trainer
and
television
personality
Laura
Nativo
and
Congressman
Jeff
Denham
from
California
at
Washington&#8217;s
Union
Station
for
a
press
conference
in
support
of
the
Pets
on
Trains
Act
of
2013.
Earlier
this
year,
Congressman
Denham
and
I
introduced
the
bill
to
allow
families
and
passengers
to
travel
with
domesticated
cats
and
dogs
on
certain
Amtrak
trains&#8212;something
Amtrak&#8217;s
current
policies
do
not
allow.
Those
of
us
lucky
enough
to
have
pets
are
greatly
blessed
with
their
companionship.
When
travelling
on
Amtrak,
families
should
be
able
to
bring
their
pets
along. Our
bill
would
establish
a
pet
policy
on
Amtrak
trains
so
pets
&#8211;
which
are
a
part
of
the
family
&#8211;
won&#8217;t
be
left
at
home
to
fend
for
themselves
this
holiday
season.
Promoting
American
Innovation
and
Ingenuity
On
Wednesday,
I
supported
bipartisan
patent
reform
legislation
in
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
that
would
unleash
creativity
and
create
jobs.
Although
it is
not
a
perfect
bill,
it
would
help
protect
inventors
from
abusive
litigation
by
so-called
&#8220;patent
trolls&#8221;
and
make
other
needed
reforms
to
the
patent
system.
As
it
moves
through
the
legislative
process,
I
hope
it
can
be
improved
even
further.
Our
patent
system
helps
keep
the
United
States
on
the
forefront
of
innovation
and
creativity.
We
must
do
everything
we
can
to
ensure
that
inventors
can
continue
to
forge
breakthroughs
that
will
lead
to
economic
growth
and
jobs.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
could
work
together
on
this
important
legislation
that
promotes
innovation,
just
like
we
did
with
the
America
Invents
Act
in
2011,
which
was
introduced
in
the
House
by
then-Chairman
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
Lamar
Smith
from
Texas
and
passed
in
a
bipartisan
manner.
Protecting
Human
Rights
Abroad
On
Monday,
I
joined
with
my
colleagues
in
the
Congressional
Caucus
on
Turkey
to
welcome
a
delegation
of
Turkish
officials
to
Capitol
Hill.
While
Turkey
is
one
of
our
most
valued
allies,
I
feel
we
must
always
hold
our
friends
and
allies
to
the
goals
of
justice
and
equality
to
which
the
United
States
aspires. With
that
in
mind,
I
asked
the
Turkish
Foreign
Minister
about
reports
of
antisemitism
coming
out
of
their
country.
These
reports
are
disturbing,
and
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
promote
tolerance
of
all
people,
in
our
country
and
beyond
our
borders.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
coverage
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
If
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year
that
you
will
enroll
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
today
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014.
Enrollment
in
the
marketplace
will
remain
open
until
March
31,
2014,
but
you
can
go
online
to
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
check
out
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
recent
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
Many
of
the
Marketplace

issues
that
have
been
in
the
news
recently
have
been
resolved. However,
the
Marketplace
website
is
only
