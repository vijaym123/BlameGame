Dear David,
I recently
co-sponsored the Put a Woman on the Twenty Act of 2015 (H.R. 1910). This
legislation would require the Department of Treasury to convene a panel of
U.S. citizens to solicit recommendations from the public for a
portrait of a woman to be used in a redesign of the $20
bill.
Who would you recommend that the citizens panel select for the
new $20 bill? Make your selection below.
Thank you
for participating in this survey. It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of
Congress
Who should replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill? Harriet Tubman Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Susan B. Anthony Clara Barton Elizabeth Cady Stanton Other *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my
