House Passes
Long-Awaited Bill to Help Americans with Disabilities: The ABLE
Act
Click here to watch coverage
from Fox 4 News.
Last week, the House passed
HR 647, the ABLE Act, on a vote of 404 to 17. I was proud to cosponsor
and vote for the ABLE Act, which helps families with children with
special needs like Down syndrome or Autism have the chance to save for
the costs of independence and opportunity for their children like care,
education, and transportation without being taxed on those
savings.

This bill has been introduced every year for
the last eight years. Year after year families and advocates met with
their representatives to explain the importance of this legislation and
to advocate its passage. In 2011, as a new member of Congress, I met
with Rachel Mast and her family to discuss her encouragement of my
cosponsorship and support. Rachel, now a student at Olathe South High
School quickly became a good friend, and her continuous advocacy of the
ABLE Act, as well as other advocates across the country, is why it
passed.
Rachel with Congressman Yoder at the Step Up for Down
Syndrome walk in Kansas
City.
Sometimes we all can become cynical about the legislative process and
the ability for real people to be heard in the halls of Congress. On
this bipartisan vote, we ensured that Rachel's voice and millions of
other families voices were heard.
House Takes
Action to Reverse Administration's Unconstitutional Immigration
Order
Our immigration system is broken. It does not work for
those trying to come to America legally and it provides incentives for
breaking the law. Unfortunately, in a misguided attempt to fix the
system, this Administration has broken it further with its recent unilateral
action.
In circumventing
Congress, this Administration has circumvented the will of the American
people. This is especially disheartening because the American people could
not have sent a clearer message in November: unilateral action on the
part of the executive branch must stop, and the two branches must work
together to solve our nations most pressing
issues.
Instead, this Administration has pushed
forward and granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants without
Congressional consent. Not only is this bad process, but it is also bad
policy. That is why I voted for HR 5759, the Executive Amnesty
Prevention Act, which nullifies any executive action taken with the purpose of
circumventing the US Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality
Act, or other Federal law. This is one of several options, including
withholding funding, that I support to correct this unconstitutional
action. I urge the Senate to do the
same.
Last year I had the opportunity to visit the
U.S.-Mexican border.

visit.
I hope that this Administration will stop
attempting to circumvent Congress, restore regular order, and join me in
working on real solutions. A step by step approach, beginning with
enforcement of our current laws and ensuring the borders are secure, is the
right way forward.
House Passes Important
Tax Extension Legislation
Last week, I joined an
overwhelming majority of my colleagues in voting to pass the Tax Increase
Prevention Act by a 378 to 46 vote. This important legislation extends tax
relief provisions that expired either at the end of calendar year 2013
or during 2014. The bill effectively prevents a tax increase on
millions of families and small businesses across the country and provides
certainty and stability as Americans file their 2014 tax
returns.
Additional information on the bill
can be found
here.
While I did support this bill to
provide clarity to taxpayers in the short term, my preference is for
Congress to debate and pass comprehensive tax reform. We need a
shorter, simpler, and fairer tax code. We can achieve that by eliminating
numerous deductions and exemptions that favor certain groups or
individuals over others, and lower rates to offset the burden created by their
elimination. It is my hope that the new GOP-led Congress will take up
these measures in the new year, so that future Congresses will not
have to enact legislation short-term extension bills.
America Remembers Pearl Harbor
Yesterday, America remembered all those who lost their lives 73 years ago on
that fateful day and honored those who stepped up to fight the
ensuing battle to ensure freedom and democracy triumphed over tyranny and
oppression. Thank you to the Greatest Generation.

I enjoyed meeting
with my good friend, K-State President Kirk Schulz in my office on Captol
Hill. We discussed important priorities for the university, including
federal funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in
Manhattan.
