Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s hard to believe October is already here! You&rsquo;ve asked me to stay focused on
job creation ,
veterans&rsquo; resources
and
infrastructure
in District One, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m doing. Below are several updates for you from the last several weeks in Arizona and Washington, so please read on. My colleagues and I on the
House Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Committee
continue our efforts to hold the VA accountable. In our Sept. 17 hearing, I urged new
VA Secretary McDonald
to boost protections for whistleblowers and stop bonuses for bad employees. And Congress took some important votes recently, including a vote to support a stronger military effort against ISIL ( read more about my position ). We also voted to strengthen the benefits for veterans who have disabilities ( read my comments on the vote ). I recently hosted a series of
VA reform community meeting s to discuss how my VA reform bill &ndash; which was signed into law in August &ndash; will expand veterans&rsquo; access to care, especially in rural and tribal communities. These meetings reached many communities across our district:
Flagstaff, Sedona, Camp Verde, Tuba City, Show Low, Miami, Superior, Eloy and Marana. Below are some news stories and photo highlights I hope you&rsquo;ll take a moment to enjoy. And remember, if you need assistance with Social Security benefits, veterans&rsquo; resources or other federal issues, please
contact one of my five district offices . We are here to help!
Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One
