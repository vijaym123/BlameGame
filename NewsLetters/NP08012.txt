Happy 4 th
of July!
On this 238 th
commemoration of Independence Day, we take time as a nation to celebrate the birth of our country and the freedoms we enjoy as Americans.
My family keeps a tradition of reading through the Declaration of Independence on this day and reflecting on the wisdom contained in its words. Amidst the parades, barbecues, fireworks and time with friends and family, I would encourage you to take a moment and read through this inspiring document which continues to set the vision for our country:

Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Washington.
May God bless you and continue to bless the United States of America.
