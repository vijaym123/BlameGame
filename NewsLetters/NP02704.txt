David -- Yesterday, I was named the most vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
We always knew we had a tough campaign ahead of us. But if we&rsquo;re going to keep fighting to grow the middle class and protect Medicare and Social Security we can&rsquo;t back down now. Will you rush a donation today to help us prepare for 2016?

I ran for Congress to bring some Illinois common sense to Washington -- and ever since I got there, I&rsquo;ve been working tirelessly to give the middle class a fair shot.
But we need to get ready for the Republican attacks while there&rsquo;s still time.
David, I&rsquo;m asking -- please chip in before our midnight deadline: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
I&rsquo;m so grateful to have your support.
