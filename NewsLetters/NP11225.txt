Internet

Obamacare
Back to School Weekin

Saluting the Market Street Mission on 125 Years of
Service!
Welcome
Spring!
The Dangerous Situation in
Ukraine
Russias invasion and annexation of the Crimea, and its
ongoing threat to the rest of Ukraine, is a deeply troubling threat to
peace and freedom and to the inviolate right of national
sovereignty.
Russian president Vladimir Putin seems determined to
reestablish the sphere of influence in Europe and Asia once claimed by the
Soviet Union. The United States and its NATO allies must take a strong
stand against this Russian aggression, as I called for in this
Letter to the Editor
that appeared in the
Star-Ledger
yesterday.
The Obama Administration is apparently
beginning to understand the broad nature of the threat, as it
scrambles to assure our allies in Eastern Europe
especially those who once
were imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain
of our
support.
Earlier this week, George Will
wrote
a
searing column that exposes the brutal treatment of Ukraine under the
Soviet Union.
This bitter history helps explain the fierce
determination of the Ukrainian people to bravely resist Russian expansionism
into their nation.
Anne Applebaums compelling Pulitzer Prize
winning book,
Gulag: A History , published in 2004 and still in
print, is a must read for anyone interested in learning more about
the horrifying tyranny of Soviet Communism and its toll on millions of
enslaved people throughout the Soviet empire.
I highly recommend
it.
Obama Administration Giving Up American
Oversight of the Internet
No nation on earth has a more
enduring legacy of support for the free and open expression of ideas
than does the United States.
The global expansion of the Internet
has fostered economic growth, social equality, political freedom, and
cultural awareness in ways unimagined even 20 years
ago.
Thats why the Obamas Administrations decision to give up American
oversight of the Internet is so troubling.
By yielding to the
demands of some who have questioned U.S. oversight for their own
self-interest, we face the very real possibility that this international
marketplace for ideas and commerce could lose the freedom that has made it
such a powerful force around the world.
The
Wall Street
Journal s L. Gordon Crovitzs take on this is well worth a read
and can be found
here .
The Latest Unintended Consequence of Obamcare
For
the millions of seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage, the
Affordable Care Act will result in higher premiums and increased
out-of-pocket costs.
Under Obamacare, $200 billion is being cut from
this popular and successful program over the next ten
years.
These
cuts
are yet another example of how
this ill-advised law is and will continue to raise the cost of health
care for millions of Americans, while also separating patients from
their doctors and consumers from the insurance coverage they
preferred.
Back to School Weekin
March?
During this weeks Congressional District work period, I was glad to
be able to spend the entire week here in the 11 th
Congressional District, meeting with constituents, attending numerous events,
and visiting eight schools across the district.
I
really enjoy having the chance to meet with students to hear their
concerns about the future and to share with them why I believe they should be
engaged and involved in their communities, counties, states, and
nation.
Over the years, Ive made hundreds of visits to local
schools.
This week I met with students at schools in Cedar Grove,
Parsippany-Troy Hills, Little Falls, Pompton Lakes, Wanaque, and
Wayne.
You can read here about two of this weeks school
visits:

Saluting the Market Street Mission on its 125 th
Anniversary
This week marks the 125 th
anniversary of the founding of the Market Street Mission in Morristown,
which opened for the first time on March 18, 1889.
Founded as a
Gospel Rescue Mission, the Market Street Mission assists individuals
to overcome homelessness, addictions, and disabilities through a life
centered on Christ.
In the past year, the Market Street
Mission has served more than 90,000 meals to homeless and underprivileged
individuals, provided more than 30,000 shelter nights of care to men
at its Emergency Shelter and residents in its Life Change Program, and
distributed 1,200 backpacks filled with supplies to needy school
children and teens in the area.
Thanks to the good work of the
men and women at the
Market Street Mission , the
lives of countless numbers of our less fortunate neighbors in Morris
County have been immeasurably
improved.
Welcome Spring!
It is hard to remember a year when the
arrival of spring was more welcome than it is this year.
This
past winter was long and hard, with near record amounts of snow, the
visit of the Polar Vortex, and potholes almost as numerous as
snowflakes.
Spring is a great time to enjoy the 11 th
Districts many beautiful natural areas.
