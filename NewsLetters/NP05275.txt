Forbes: DHS Policy on Travel from Ebola-Affected
Countries Insufficient
Washington, D.C . - Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) issued the following statement in response to the Department of Homeland Securitys announcement today that all individuals traveling from Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone to the U.S. will be required to travel through one of five major U.S. airports where additional Ebola screening measures have been implemented.
The additional restrictions that the Administration announced today are a minimal improvement over what we had in place yesterday, and far from sufficient. The United States government needs to immediately place a moratorium on travel to and from West African countries experiencing Ebola outbreaks, and to craft a comprehensive, preventative, containment strategy to ensure Americans safety. I continue to believe Congress is obligated to reconvene immediately to develop such a strategy and prevent the spread of the Ebola virus in the United States.
Last week, Forbes issued statements calling for the U.S. government to implement temporary travel restrictions to and from Ebola-stricken West African countries, and for Congress to reconvene to address Ebola containment. Those statement are available
