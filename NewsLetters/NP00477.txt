Rep. Curbelo on the Passage of FY16 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill
Washington, DC
Today, the House passed H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. Rep. Curbelo issued the following statement in support of its passage:
The FY2016 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill is an investment in modernization and a step towards creating a more advanced and innovative future. This bill totals $51.4 billion, $1.3 billion above the FY2015 enacted level and $661 million below the Presidents request. It allocates funds towards agencies and programs like NASA and NOAA, and includes an increase of $111 million to the FBI. This multifaceted bill ensures our nations security by providing our law enforcement with the necessary tools to protect us, bolstering our cybersecurity funds, and fighting against drug abuse.
I am particularly proud of Section 540, which is critical in ensuring that exports to Cuba do not benefit the Castors regimes military and intelligence services. Cuba has one of the most robust spy networks in the United States and should not be rewarded with American business. An amendment was offered to remove Section 540, but was soundly defeated by a bipartisan vote of
153-273.
In addition, I was very pleased language was included in the Committee Report to H.R. 2578 that would directly benefit windstorm research and storm surge modeling. Mitigating the impacts of natural disasters is crucial to the safety of our South Florida communities, and the work being done by NOAAs Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model and NISTs Engineering division is something I strongly support.
H.R. 2578
passed the House on June 3, 2015 by a vote of
242-183.
