Dear Friends,
Small
businesses employ millions of Americans, fueling our recovering economy by
expanding and hiring workers. On Small Business Saturday this past
weekend, I was encouraged to visit our hard-working local businesses in the
14 th
District. But business owners from Gurnee to Geneva
tell me they are still burdened by federal regulations and
overreach.
This week, the House passed a bill I
co-sponsored aimed at freeing up capital for small businesses. Additionally, I
co-sponsored two more pieces of legislation to relieve the heavy
burdens placed on small businesses by the IRS so they have the ability to
hire more workers.
Voted
for passage (254 to 159) of H.R. 1105, Small Business Capital Access and
Job Preservation Act.
Illinois has greatly benefitted
from private capital. More than $200 billion has been invested into
local companies and small businesses which have grown jobs 3.5 times
faster than others. This bill reduces costs for private equity firms,
allowing for increased investment into Illinois small businesses. Freeing
up private equity firms to invest will get much-needed capital off
the sidelines and directly into the hands of our job
creators.
Co-sponsored H.R. 3169, IRS Rulemaking
Fairness Act of 2013.
Small businesses should be focused on
innovating and expanding, not dealing with confusing and harmful
regulations. Currently, the IRS is the only agency not required to report on
the impact a proposed rule would have on small businesses. H.R. 3169
would add the IRS to the list of agencies required to certify that a
proposed rule will not have significant negative impacts on small
businesses, ensuring that the IRS considers their interests during the
rulemaking process.
Co-sponsored H.R.
3479, Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2013.
Disputes over the IRS complex and confusing tax system can be costly to
small businesses attempting to comply. H.R. 3479 would protect
businesses from abusive IRS claims and hold the agency more accountable to
taxpayers.
Federal Disaster
Assistance for Tornado Victims
The dozens of
tornadoes that touched down across Illinois wreaked havoc on a large
scale, taking a toll on our neighbors and friends. To complement the
outpouring of private support already at work, I joined the entire
Illinois Congressional Delegation in asking President Obama to issue a major
disaster declaration for Illinois and to provide relief to the fifteen
Central and Southern counties affected by the storms. In response to
our letter, he issued a major disaster declaration, allowing affected
areas like Will County to apply for federal reimbursements to help pay
for storm damage repair.
Merry Christmas
to the Troops
Many of our soldiers
overseas will be away from their families during Christmas this year.
Along with other Members of Congress, I filmed a holiday video message
which will be shown to service members and their families in more than
170 countries via the American Forces Network (AFN). We appreciate the
sacrifices they make on a daily basis guarding and protecting our
liberty. We pray for their safe return and for peace to reign over the
earth.
