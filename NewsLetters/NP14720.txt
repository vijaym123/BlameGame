Stay tuned to Facebook, Twitter, and your inbox
for a special
announcement for the 9th District from Congressman Doug Collins this
week!
Dear Friend,
President Obama is either
completely negligent or he's asleep at the wheel.
That's what
we're left to conclude after all of the developments this week. From a
website costing hundreds of millions of dollars that doesn't work to
reports of spying on our own allies, the level of unaccountability in
this Administration continues to astound.
It would be nice if
Congress could devote all of its time to getting the economy back on
track and finding more ways to allow Americans to keep more of their
hard-earned money, but oversight is becoming more and more important.
It's important because it has an impact on your own civil liberties.
I'm working hard with my colleagues--even some Democrats who care about
your rights--to protect your privacy.
Just this week,
I co-sponsored H.R. 3035, the Surveillance Order Reporting
Act , to ensure transparency when government intelligence agencies
request information from tech companies about how individuals use
their services. As this legislation and other surveillance bills come
through Congress, I hope you'll stay informed about the work we're
doing.
Speaking of oversight and staying informed, I'm
going to have a big announcement for you this week. Stay tuned to our
Facebook
page,
Twitter
account,
and keep an eye on your inbox!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member
of Congress
