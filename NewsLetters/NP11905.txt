Friend,
We&#39;re sure you&#39;ve heard by now that a friend of the campaign has offered to match donations dollar for dollar in honor of Ami&#39;s 49th birthday.
BUT - our deadline to raise $4900 is tomorrow at midnight.
We can&#39;t waste this opportunity and we only have $1,849 to go.
Let&#39;s make sure we hit this goal in the next 48 hours - click here to give $4.90, $49 or even more right now.
Thanks,
Team Bera
P.S.
If you&#39;ve been waiting to show your support, this is the perfect time.
Can you give $4.90 today?
