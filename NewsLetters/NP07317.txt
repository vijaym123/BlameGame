Policy Update
*
As part of my ongoing effort to shine light on our campaign
finance system, I chaired a Senate Rules Committee
hearing on the
DISCLOSE Act of 2014.
*
Together with Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, I've introduced
The Strong Families Act
. This bill would incentivize
employers to voluntarily provide employees with paid parental or
medical leave.
*
Congress passed compromise legislation to reform the Department
of Veterans Affairs
, which I was proud to support. We also voted to replenish
the Highway Trust Fund
until next spring. Though I'm glad we averted the looming
highway funding crisis, we need a long-term solution.
*
The Senate also reauthorized the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act,
and unanimously approved the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act
, a bill I
originally introduced with Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas.
Scenes from Washington
Chairing the Rules Committee hearing on the DISCLOSE Act of 2014. We
need more transparency in our campaign finance system.
Thanks to Paul Reynolds from Dayton for letting these ducks migrate
down to my Washington office! One is an eider, and the other is a
long-tailed duck.
