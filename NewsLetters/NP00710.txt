Carper's Connection
May 15, 2015
Dear Friends,
The First State may be small, but it has had a tremendous role in the
history of our country.
For more than a decade, I worked tirelessly with federal officials,
state officials, community leaders and activists in the hopes that one
day we could tell Delaware's unique story through a national park. Last
December, legislation to create the First State National Historical
Park
was finally approved by Congress, joining Delaware to the
network of states attracting millions of visitors to their national
parks each year and generating billions of dollars in tourism revenue.
Old
Swedes
This week, Old Swedes Church was formally recognized as part of the
First State National Historical Park. Old Swedes Church, in Wilmington,
Delaware, is the oldest church in the United States that stands as it
was originally built and remains in use as a house of worship. It was
erected in 16981699 by descendants of the Swedish colonists who
crossed the Atlantic aboard the Kalmar Nyckel in 1638. The pulpit is
the oldest known pulpit in the United States.
Reflecting more than 300 years of American history, Old Swedes Church
has a unique story to share. It helps tell the story of our state's
early Dutch, Swedish, and English settlement and Delawares role in
helping to launch the most enduring experiment in democracy the world
has ever known
the United States of America.
Old Swedes
Ceremony
Visitors from near and far will now be able to
learn about life for the early settlers of our great nation through the
story of Old Swedes Church. After many years, our dream of telling
Delawares important story in the settlement and founding of our
country is coming true.
I hope you have the opportunity to explore our states rich history by
visiting Old Swedes Church at the First State National Historical Park
soon. I invite you to share your photos and videos from your visit on
Twitter at @SenatorCarper

Dear
Friends,
The
First
State
may
be
small,
but
it
has
had
a
tremendous
role
in
the
history
of
our
country.
For
more
than
a
decade,
I
worked
tirelessly
with
federal
officials,
state
officials,
community
leaders
and
activists
in
the
hopes
that
one
day
we
could
tell
Delaware's
unique
story
through
a
national
park.
Last
December,
legislation
to
create
the
First
State
National
Historical
Park
was
finally
approved
by
Congress,
joining
Delaware
to
the
network
of
states
attracting
millions
of
vis itors
to
their
national
parks
each
year
and
generating
billions
of
dollars
in
tourism
revenue.
This
week,
Old
Swedes
Chur ch
was
formally
recognized
as
part
of
the
First
State
National
Historical
Park.
Old
Swedes
Church,
in
Wilmington,
Delaware,
is
the
oldest
church
in
the
United
States
that
stands
as
it
was
originally
built
and
remains
in
use
as
a
house
of
worship.
It
was
erected
in
1698&#150;1699
by
descendants
of
the
Swedish
colonists
who
crossed
the
Atlantic
aboard
the
Kalmar
Nyckel
in
1638.
The
pulpit
is
the
oldest
known
pulpit
in
the
United
States.
Reflecting
more
than
300
years
of
American
history,
Old
Swedes
Church
has
a
unique
story
to
share.
It
helps
tell
the
story
of
our
state's
early
Dutch,
Swedish,
and
English
settlement
and
Delaware&#146;s
role
in
helping
to
launch
the
most
enduring
experiment
in
democracy
the
world
has
ever
known
&#150;
the
United
States
of
America.
Visitors
from
near
and
far
will
now
be
able
to
learn
about
life
for
the
early
settlers
of
our
great
nation
through
the
story
of
Old
Swedes
Church.
After
many
years,
our
dream
of
telling
Delaware&#146;s
important
story
in
the
settlement
and
founding
of
our
country
is
coming
true.
I
hope
you
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
our
state&#146;s
rich
history
by
visiting
Old
Swedes
Church
at
the
First
State
National
Historical
Park
soon.
