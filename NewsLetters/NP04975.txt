Dear David,
Each month, I send out an electronic newsletter
my Monthly
Record
to Nebraskans discussing my work in Nebraska and in the U.S.
Senate. Its a cost effective, efficient way to stay in touch. If you
wish to unsubscribe from these emails, you can do so at any time by
clicking the link at the bottom of this newsletter.
Creative
thinkers across Nebraska and the nation are always coming up with
innovations that improve our quality of life in everything from
telecommunications to health care.
These advances help us to stay connected,
conduct business and remain independent. They also create jobs and
expand businesses. Unfortunately, federal policies and regulations have
not kept pace with modern technology. As a result, practices in
Washington that predate the VCR are holding back new growth and
innovation.
In October, I outlined a
Fresh
Technology Agenda for Growth, Innovation, and Opportunity . I
believe Washington needs a new approach to tech policy that takes into
consideration the modern tech landscape and the new challenges and
opportunities it presents.
As a member of the Senate Commerce
Committee, I have worked to improve broadband services in rural areas,
reduce onerous federal approval processes for new technologies, and roll
back expensive tech product labeling requirements that have become
obsolete in the 21 st
century.
I will continue working to
give Washington the policy reboot it needs to promote tech advances and
economic growth.

Fighting Ebola
The Ebola
outbreak continues to generate a great deal of concern across the country.
Despite the excellent care provided to patients at medical facilities
like the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the federal government
failed to adequately anticipate and communicate an effective response.
Earlier this month, I sent a letter to Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expressing my
concern that the CDCs efforts so far have not been sufficiently
proactive in addressing instances of Ebola in the United States. Full text of
the letter can be read
here.
Hearing on the Internet of Things
The rapidly
developing market of health wearables, connected homes, and other
novel, Internet-based solutions represents an expanding industry of
consumer products. The spread of these products gives rise to a number of
policy questions, including security, privacy, manufacturing, regulatory
certainty, and public-sector application.
I recently joined a
bipartisan group of senators in requesting an oversight Commerce
Committee hearing on the future of the so-called Internet of Things and
consumer wearable technologies.

Letter to EPA on WOTUS
I
joined a group of 24 senators in expressing my concern to the
Administration regarding its attempt to significantly expand federal control
over water through its proposed definition of waters of the United
States (WOTUS).
The letter to the Environmental Protection Agency
and Army Corps of Engineers outlined how the proposed rule displaces
state and local officials in their primary role of environmental
protection, and imposes restrictions and uncertainty on private property
owners. You can read the letter

Adoptions in the DRC
Many families in the United
States are ready and willing to provide safe and loving homes for
children facing strife in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Unfortunately, the DRC has blocked the transfer of adopted children to
foreign nations, leaving hundreds of American families, including several
in Nebraska, separated from their legally adopted children. This week,
I joined 182 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate,
in calling on our counterparts in the DRC to reform their adoption
policies to allow children in need to be united with caring families
wherever they may be.
