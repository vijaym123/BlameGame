I wanted to draw your attention to a new
resource
that the House Veterans Affairs Committee launched, called the VA Honesty Project.
Last month,
reports
indicated that the Veterans Administration blocked the release of the names of hospitals where 19 veterans died because of delays in medical screenings.
So far, the VA Honesty Project has documented nearly 70 recent instances in which the Department of Veterans Affairs has failed to respond to reporters requests for information or refused to answer specific questions.
Not only must the administration be accountable to the American people, but it must honor the men and women who have served this country by providing essential information and ensuring the timely issuance of benefits and services.
Theyve earned it.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I recently cosponsored the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act,
H.R. 4031 , which will give the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove employees of the Senior Executive Service, based on their performance, from government service completely or transfer them to another position within the current civil service system.
