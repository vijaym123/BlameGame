Dear Friends:
With the meltdown of
Obamacare and millions of Americans having their health insurance canceled,
President Obama proposed an Administrative fix that may be like trying
to put toothpaste back in the tube.
Rep. John
Mica (FL-07) joined America's News HQ on Fox News to discuss the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee's hearing on the
Administration's rollout of HealthCare.gov and the continuing IT glitches and
security flaws.
I and many others cautioned and voted to avert this disaster
and were berated by the White House, Senate Democrats and the media,
even after offering modest changes to the law to avoid this
mess.
Last week we offered a legislative remedy to allow those who
like the coverage they now have to keep it and to open those plans to
public choice.
We can address pre-existing
conditions, youth coverage and broader access to affordable health care without
destroying health care choice for Americans.
How about starting
with actions to bring down costs beginning with tort reform, opening,
not closing, competition, allowing flexibility and assisting states
in expanding Medicaid, and going after waste and fraud in existing
programs?
Instead, we've spent $630 million for a $60 million sign
up fiasco, hired thousands of bureaucrats, cancelled millions of health
policies and disrupted our nations health care
structure.
We can and we must do better.
With my regards and best
wishes, I remain
Most respectfully,
John L.
Mica
