Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
District Work Week
Oklahoma's Second Congressional District is full of hardworking
individuals from all walks of life. I count it a blessing to represent
my fellow Oklahomans and this week marked another great week being out
in the district. Visiting with many of you face to face recharges my
batteries, and coming to your communities means we can be accessible
and accountable to you. It also keeps the lines of communication open
as we work together to get our country back on the right track.
A Week in Pictures
I made several stops throughout the Second District this week and met
so many great people. Thank you for the work you do in making Oklahoma
a model for the nation to follow.

Week Ahead
Next week begins a three week stretch of work in Washington, D.C. As we
work through various issues, I will continue to represent the values of
Oklahoma's Second District and put our country back in business.
