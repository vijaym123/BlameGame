Certainty and stability are crucial for the financial services industry. Im pleased that the House passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) Reauthorization (H.R. 26) yesterday, with my support, and its now heading over to the Senate for consideration.
I will keep you posted.
Yours in service,
Randy
