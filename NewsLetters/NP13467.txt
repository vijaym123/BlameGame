Legislation to Exempt Working-Age Military Retiree, Disability
Pensions from Cost of Living Adjustment Reductions Honors Those Who
Have Served
I did not want to have to make the choice between working-age military
retiree Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) and stopping the devastating
cuts of sequestration, but that is the choice the House was given on
December 12 when it took up the Bipartisan Budget Act.
The final agreement passed, but did not please everyone. However, the
framework delivered long-overdue certainty to the appropriations
process and helped to ensure military readiness. Moving forward, I am
co-sponsoring COLA and disability pension reforms that strengthen the
budget agreement and honor those who have served.
I commend Congressman Jeff Miller, Chairman of the House Veterans'
Affairs Committee, for introducing these measures on Thursday.
Both
deserve the support of Congress, and I will be encouraging all my
colleagues to endorse them.

site at www.crenshaw.house.gov

Support for Tax-Free Savings Accounts for Individuals with Disabilities
Stronger than Ever
Support for passage of the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE
Act - S. 313, H.R. 647) is stronger than ever with every member of the
Florida United States Congressional delegation backing the bill and
Senate co-sponsorship growing to 60 Members today. Only six pieces of
legislation in Congress have as much support!
Individuals with disabilities and their families deserve access to the
same financial planning tools that other Americans use to map out their
futures. A level playing field for them is something that we all can be
proud of, and I'll be continuing the fight to pass this bill.
The legislation would amend Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service
Code to 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts for individuals with
disabilities. The bill, first introduced in 2006, would ease financial
strains faced by individuals with disabilities by making tax-free
savings accounts available to cover qualified expenses such as
education, housing, medical, and transportation. The bill would
supplement, but not supplant, benefits provided through private
insurance, the Medicaid program, the beneficiary's employment, and
other sources.
