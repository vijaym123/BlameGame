Announcing Veterans' Solutions
Seminars
Making
sure that Western North Carolina veterans get the care and
assistance they deserve is a top priority of mine. This week, I
announced that I will be hosting three Veterans' Solutions Seminars across
the 11th District to provide practical assistance to Western North
Carolina's veterans. Veterans will be able to meet with staff from
federal, state, and local government offices on issues surrounding
benefits, healthcare, disability, and even receive basic medical treatment
on site at the mobile hospital. They will also be able to handle
DMV-related matters including license renewal at the mobile DMV. I'm
grateful to the North Carolina Department of Veteran Affairs (NC VA),
the Winston-Salem Regional Benefit Office, and the North Carolina
Department of Motor Vehicles
for partnering with my office to make
this possible.

Announcing 'Spotlight Western North Carolina'
With so many tragic
events happening across the world today, its easy to feel discouraged
and lose sight of the positive things happening in our lives. But many
wonderful things are happening around us in Western North Carolina.
This week I was pleased to announce Spotlight Western North Carolina, an
initiative I've launched to highlight the good news coming out of our
communities in Western NC.
In
an effort to bring attention to the successes in our communities,
I've set up an email account for you to share about the way you or
someone you know has positively impacted Western North Carolina. Schools
winning awards, students receiving service academy nominations, new
businesses bringing jobs to our community--all of these are stories we want
to compile and share.
Please share your
story.
You can do so by sending your tips to
GoodNewsNC@mail.house.gov .
Visiting
McDowell High School
One of my favorite parts of being back in the
district during the Congressional recess is having the opportunity to
visit local schools and meet with teachers, faculty, and students. On
Thursday, I toured McDowell High School (MHS). I enjoyed hearing about
the ways MHS is providing an innovative learning environment for their
students. If you're a teacher or faculty member whois interested in
having me visit your school, don't hesitate to contact my
office.
