Friend,
I hope you saw our email earlier this week: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced that they&#39;re making a big ad buy for one of our opponents -- more than $250,000 before the
June 3rd
primary.
It&#39;s not that surprising that our opponents are getting outside money spent on their behalf, but the amount -- that quarter of a million dollars -- is definitely a jolt.
But our grassroots team has jumped into action.
Today, we&#39;re excited to share with you our response: our first online ad, &quot;Example.&quot;
This sets the record straight and outlines the promises we&#39;ve kept during our first year in office.
Support this ad with a $3 contribution today!
Your contribution will mean that we can ensure voters see this message.
It&#39;s critical that Sacramento County voters know that we stand true to our word.
I&#39;m proud that we passed No Budget No Pay, which says that if Members of Congress don&#39;t pass a budget, they don&#39;t get paid.
When the government shut down due to the irresponsibility of some of my extreme colleagues, I gave my salary to charity to help those impacted.
And I continue to fight to protect Medicare and Social Security, because we must keep our promises to our seniors.
We might not have U.S. Chamber commercials propping up our campaign, but what we do have is the truth -- and now we have a way to get it out there.
With all of the outside money flooding our district, your help today will strengthen our voice.
Can you click here now to give $3 to support our efforts?
Thanks for all you do.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th district
P.S.
Every day, whether in Washington or in our district, we are working to hold government accountable.
Now, we also have to hold these outside groups accountable by sharing the truth -- pitch in $3 or more now to make that happen.
