Dear Friend,
This week, I was sworn
into my 23rd term in Congress during a separate ceremony on Wednesday
for those of us who attended the late Governor Mario Cuomo's funeral.

Healthcare-
The number of uninsured adults has dropped to its
lowest level at 12.9%, a critical sign the Affordable Health Care Act
is working. Despite these encouraging numbers, House Republicans have
made their 55th attempt to dismantle our healthcare through a bill
labeled as Save American Workers Act of 2015. I voted against this
measure that the President also opposed because it redefines the work week
from 30 to 40 hours so that employers would only be required to provide
health benefits for workers who work 40+ hours per week. As the
sponsor of the Affordable Care Act I will continue fighting to protect
your right to affordable and quality
healthcare.
Jobs Report-
2014 was a historic year for economic
progress, which is a sign that President Obama's policies are working. We
created more jobs than in any year since 1999 and reduced the
unemployment rate to 5.6 percent. But while unemployment fell for the nation as a
whole, economic gains have not translated into higher incomes for
working families. In 2015, I will keep pushing for initiatives that will
help you find gainful employment in the district and ensure that
everyone can make a living wage.

LEGISLATIVE
SPOTLIGHT
This week the President unveiled the Americas
College Promise proposal to make two years of community college free for
responsible students.
While Democrats and
Republicans have many areas of disagreement, we should all agree that
affordable and accessible higher education is good for America's
future.
To help students afford their continuing
college education I will again introduce the
Student Loan Interest
Deduction Act,
which doubles the maximum deduction for student
loan interest.
I believe we must help relieve
students of the crushing burden posed by the loans.
Stay tuned for updates!
