This week, I hosted a forum on Human Trafficking at Benedictine
University, bringing local leaders together to shine a light on the
real threat of trafficking in our community.
By speaking out and
educating others, we can work together to not only bring criminals to
justice but also protect vulnerable individuals from this truly
horrible crime.
We can all lend a hand in eliminating this scourge
from our area.
