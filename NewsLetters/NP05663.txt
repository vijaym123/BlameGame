Forbes Recognized with Manufacturing Award
for Pro-Jobs Record
Washington, DC
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) has been awarded The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence, in recognition of his pro-jobs, pro-manufacturing voting record.
Our manufacturing plants represent what American production should be about
creating new, innovative products, building useful resources, and taking waste and redirecting to areas where it too can be used in an efficient way, said Congressman Forbes. The industry is ripe for global competitiveness, as well as national innovation and job creation. I remain committed to working to ensure that, instead of acting as a barrier, the government is doing its very best to enable growth and competitiveness in this crucial component of our economy.
Congressman Forbes was honored with this award based on his voting record on important manufacturing issues, ranging from energy to federal regulations. His rating from NAM is an outstanding 100 percent on key manufacturing votes in the 113th Congress.
In August, Congressman Forbes conducted
a manufacturing tour
of various manufacturing plants in the Fourth District, to meet with leaders and employees in this crucial industry. To learn more about Congressman Forbes pro-jobs, pro-manufacturing work,
