Morning Joe
Friend -- MSNBC&rsquo;s
Morning Joe
reports Democrats are SURGING:
&ldquo;Big turnaround in Kentucky&rdquo; (McConnell&rsquo;s race!)
&ldquo;Big turnaround in North Carolina&rdquo;
&ldquo;Democrats are doing so much better now than they should be doing.&rdquo;
The latest Senate projection?? 51 Democrats - 49 Republicans.
If we win, McConnell&rsquo;s Senate takeover chances would be DOOMED -- AND we&rsquo;d transform the political landscape.
But as NPR reports, the Senate battle &ldquo;remains close and could tip either way.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching our massive, FINAL Get Out The Vote Campaign.
If we can fully fund it, we WILL get enough voters to the polls to WIN. But the election is in JUST 28 DAYS -- and we need to raise $65,000 before MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
Will you pitch in to help us mobilize voters and WIN the Senate and the South? All gifts will be MATCHED until midnight.
