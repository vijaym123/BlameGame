Dear Friend,
As we begin the holiday season, I want to wish you and your family a
Happy Thanksgiving. Please take a moment to view my Thanksgiving
message below, and feel free to share this with friends and family.
As many of us turn to our shopping lists for the upcoming holidays and
make decisions on what to buy and where to go, I encourage everyone to
support local businesses and communities by buying local. In fact, this
Saturday, November 30th, is Small Business Saturday, and you can check
out the Small Business Saturday website
for more information
about participating retailers and vendors in your area.
Once again, I wish everyone a happy holiday. With the winter weather
already making its way to south central Wisconsin, I hope everyone
travels safely over the next several days. I look forward to seeing you
in Wisconsin soon.
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mark Pocan
