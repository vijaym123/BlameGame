Last week, a Sunni extremist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), intensified its attempts to overthrow the Shiite-majority Iraqi government and military.
ISIL, which originally grew out of Al Qaeda, has overtaken major cities in Iraq and is currently moving toward the capital in Baghdad.
The Sunnis and Shiites represent two branches of Islam in Iraq where political and sectarian rifts between the two have resulted in years of political violence.
Yesterday, President Obama
said , The United States will continue to increase our support to Iraqi security forces. Were prepared to create joint operation centers in Baghdad and northern Iraq to share intelligence and coordinate planning to confront the terrorist threat of ISIL. And through our new Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, were prepared to work with Congress to provide additional equipment. We have had advisers in Iraq through our embassy, and were prepared to send a small number of additional American military advisers -- up to 300 -- to assess how we can best train, advise, and support Iraqi security forces going forward.
American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq, but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region, and American interests as well.
