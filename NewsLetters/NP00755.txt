VISITING DC
May 18, 2015
Last week, students
and parents received good news: federal student loan interest rates are
set to drop for the upcoming school year to 4.29 percent, down from
4.66 percent. I am thrilled students in North Carolina, and all across
our nation, will see the interest rates on their student loans drop
for the next year, in addition to over $8 billion in savings from the
past year. When I introduced the
Bipartisan Student
Loan Certainty Act
two years ago, I knew this law would benefit
100% of students in the US, and with todays news, our students and
parents continue to reap the benefits. The facts now show that more
controversial legislation would not have served students best interests.
My bill was the right solution at the right time.
ICYMI:
McClatchy did a story
on my investigation into the
U.S. Customs and Border Protection which has failed to collect millions
of dollars in duties from Chinese furniture manufactures, leaving
North Carolina businesses hurting. In the article, McClatchy notes: More
than half of the money, $156 million, is owed to five companies based
in North Carolina or that have operations in the Tarheel state,
according to estimates of CBP data by Schumers office. Read the article in
full

Last week the Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Veterans Administration
held a meeting in Greensboro. The meeting focused on the ongoing effort
to convince the VA to rely on the most recent and credible body of
science that confirms the drinking water at Camp Lejeune was highly
contaminated with known human carcinogens from the 1950s to 1987, and led to
service related disabilities, particularly cancers, among veterans
and their families.
It has been almost three years since the
legislation I sponsored, the Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act, was
signed into law. In that time, the CDC has released four studies
showing that these Camp Lejeune families have a higher risk of certain
cancers and a higher mortality rate.
Yet the VA continues to drag its
feet and disagree with the governments leading scientists. It's
unconscionable that less than 10 percent of these sick veterans have
gotten disability benefits. If the VA won't listen to the law or to
scientists, what's it going to take? Check out
this story
from the Jacksonville Daily News
for more information on the
meeting.
Tuesday, I had a chance to visit with the North Carolina
ALS Catfish Chapter and former ABC11 news anchor Larry Stogner. As you
may know, Larry was recently diagnosed with this disease and
announced his retirement early this year.
ABC11 WTVD put
together
a moving piece on their day of ALS advocacy in DC, check it
out below.

Last
week was National Police Week and DC was been full of police officers
visiting from across the nation. Back at home, communities in North
Carolina held events honoring our men and women in blue. I had the
privilege of meeting Lt. Alan Hedgepeth of Henderson, NC on Tuesday. Lt.
Hedgepeth was honored at the 22nd Annual TOP COPS award dinner here in DC
for his work on an investigation that resulted in the arrest and
conviction of almost 40 MGM members. You can read more about this brave
public servants work

Tuesday morning I joined The Hill for a talk on how to foster
medical innovation so that Americans can have better access to new
safe treatments and devices. People all over the world are counting on
the United States to innovate for cures to our most debilitating
illnesses. Read the write up on my talk
here .
Last Thursday, I joined Senator Tillis, along with Tim Kaine
(D-VA), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Congressman G.K. Butterfield (D-NC-01),
in introducing The Road to Opportunity and Development (ROAD) Act of
2015. The ROAD Act will open up new opportunities across North Carolina
and will benefit everyone who uses our states infrastructure. Also,
connecting some of the east coasts largest ports to North Carolinas
cities and towns will encourage economic expansion. Im excited to see
the possibilities the ROAD Act will open for all North Carolinians.

Richard Burr
