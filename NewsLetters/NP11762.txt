Aloha David,
I have some good news.
This week, I'm launching a brand new &ldquo; virtual office &rdquo; to provide resources and services to people across our islands. Check out my video welcome!
My job is to serve you. Your letters, emails, Facebook comments, and tweets are all valuable to me as I work to make our voices heard in our nation&rsquo;s capital. Please stop in my virtual office at
gabbard.house.gov
to stay in touch and let me know how I can best be of service to you and your &lsquo;ohana.
Mahalo nui loa,
Tulsi Gabbard
Member of Congress (HI-02)
