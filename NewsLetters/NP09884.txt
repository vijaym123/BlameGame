Pushing Back on Obamacare?
We need a Secretary of Health and Human Services that will serve the
American people, not act as an ambassador for Obamacare.
This past
week, I questioned President Obama's new nominee for Secretary of HHS,
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, in the Senate Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
You can watch the hearing and my discussion with
Neil Cavuto on Fox News below, or read my latest piece on our need to

Celebrating South Carolina Tourism?
In a state with as much to offer as South Carolina, it's no wonder that
tourism is such a booming industry.
It was great to see Myrtle Beach
Chamber of Commerce President Brad Dean in Washington this week as he
testified on the importance of tourism to our state and nation in a
Senate hearing on travel and tourism in the Subcommittee on
Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion.

Honoring Moms on Mother's Day
My mom is one of the most hardworking, generous, incredible people I
have ever known, and I am grateful every day for her.
She put our
needs above her own, working 16-hour days as a single mom to keep us
afloat, and still managing to be the loving and structured presence we
needed in our lives.
Today and every day, I want to honor her, and all the moms out there
who give of themselves so generously to raise our next generation.
Thank you for being such amazing role models, and know that you are
loved and valued.
It is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate, and I
value hearing from you.
Please don't hesitate to reach out to my
office with your ideas, your questions, or if we can ever be of service
to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
