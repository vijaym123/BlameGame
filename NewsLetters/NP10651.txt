Westmoreland
Hosts Veterans Workshop
On Tuesday, April 15,
2014, I will host a Veterans Workshop at the Asa M. Powell Expo
Center in Newnan from 9:00am
12:00pm. There will be representatives from
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Georgia Department of
Veterans Service to discuss the opportunities and services they
provide, as well as an opportunity to speak about your case with them and
with my staff.
I want to thank the
Veterans of Georgias Third District for their service to our nation.
Id also like to thank the speakers and representatives from the local
Veterans affairs offices for giving their time to help and inform
our soldiers, as well as my staff for organizing the event. This is a
chance for people to learn more about how we can help with their cases
and make sure they are getting the right information and benefits from
their service.
The Asa M. Powell
Expo center is located at 197 Temple Court in Newnan, Georgia. For
more information, contact my Newnan office at 770-683-2033 or

Capitol Corner: America Needs Fair
Tax
As the April 15th tax deadline
arrives, we are reminded once again of our broken system and the need for a
simplified tax code.
Our current
tax code is over 73,000 pages long and equally as complex. By
constantly segmenting taxpayers with brackets and exemptions, the tax code is
becoming more complicated. We all have an equal stake in the success of
our nation and for the services our tax dollars provide. However,
manipulation and abuse are more prevalent in a complicated tax system,
because of its difficulty for even experts to navigate. The recent abuse
from the IRS is another shining example of why the Fair Tax is
needed. With a simplified tax code, there isnt a need for the large
agency.
Fair tax was first introduced
into congress in 1999 and sets a flat, national sales retail tax rate at
23%. It only taxes goods and services for personal consumption
thats it. No income, property, or estate tax. You can keep your whole
paycheck and only get taxed on what you choose to spend it on. Its as
simple as that. It treats everyone the same and is
transparent.
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 25, the Fair Tax
Act of 2013, which currently has 75 cosponsors. In fact, each
congress since I have been elected, I have supported and cosponsored the Fair
Tax Act and will continue to do so as long as I have the privilege to
serve in public office.

my
website , or by visiting
