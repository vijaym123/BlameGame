Holding Big Oil Accountable
Thursday, May 28, 2015
Dear Friend,
Like many Central Coast residents, I vividly remember the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and its devastating impacts on our environment and economy. When I visited Refugio State Beach last week to see the devastation from the oil spill, I couldn&rsquo;t help but recall the similarities between the two events.
The 1969 oil spill is always fresh in my mind, which is why I have spent my entire Congressional career working to limit and reduce the amount of oil drilling that takes place on the Central Coast.
Last week&rsquo;s oil spill is yet another tragic reminder of the serious risks oil drilling poses to our economy and environment. We know drilling is dangerous, dirty, and messy. And no matter what, spills happen. The only way to truly prevent future spills is to move away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable sources of energy.
My staff and I have been working closely with local, state, and federal agencies as they respond to the spill and coordinate the cleanup. I can assure you that I will also continue working to not only ensure this incident is thoroughly investigated and those responsible are held accountable, but that regulations are as strong as possible moving forward. While we will not eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels overnight, we must learn from this tragedy and truly work towards preventing spills altogether by investing in clean, sustainable energy resources.
As always, please keep in touch with me by
