Friends,
The House is back in session and ready to get to work. I am
honored to continue serving as your OH-14 representative, and I deeply
thank you for the opportunity to be your voice in Washington. My doors
in DC, Painesville and Twinsburg are always open. Please stay in touch
with me and let me know your thoughts.
We are already
starting to tackle some important issues that I'd like to share with
you.
On Friday, I voted
with a bipartisan majority to approve building the
Keystone XL
pipeline . American energy independence shouldnt be delayed
any longer.
There are good reasons why the majority of
Americans support Keystone XL. This project is slated to create more
than 42,000 jobs nationwide and reduce our dependence on foreign oil by
40%. We must stop stalling on solutions like this one that will make
energy more affordable and accessible while boosting our economy here at
home.
By making it easier to produce and distribute
North American energy, we can further insulate ourselves from supply
disruptions overseas and protect against price spikes that hurt Ohio
families budgets.
This week, news broke that President Obama
plans to take executive action on
immigration . The
President cannot continue to act unilaterally to accomplish his own
agenda. Congress makes the laws, not the executive branch. I oppose any
attempt by President Obama to bypass Congress and ignore the will of the
American people.
Of course, I want to hear your opinion
as well. Please take a moment to answer the question below to let me
know what you think.
Poll: Executive
Action on Immigration Do you support President Obama's plan to pursue executive action on
immigration? Yes No Undecided I have another thought I'd like to share. If you selected "I
