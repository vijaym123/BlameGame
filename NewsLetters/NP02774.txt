Congressman Veasey Works at Local Dry Cleaners
Fort Worth, Texas On Monday, February 16, 2015, Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, will be rolling up his sleeves and handling the Presidents Day crowd at Lawsons Cleaners. As part of his Marc Means Business workday, Congressman Veasey will be assisting customers with their garments and dry cleaning needs.
Each district work period I travel back to my district and connect with the residents here in the Metroplex, said Congressman Veasey. I have learned that the best way to understand the district I represent is by working alongside its residents, who remind me of what Im fighting for back in our nations capital.
Since March 2014, Veasey has spent a day each month working at a different job in his district. He has delivered UPS packages, worked as an American Airlines baggage handler, and even as a Mary Kay consultant. The Marc Means Business series connects Veasey with constituents at their place of employment to better understand the challenges they face in their work and daily lives.
