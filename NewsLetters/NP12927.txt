Dear Friends,
I wanted to share with you the video statement I shared following
President Obama's State of the Union address.
Transcript of my response:
"Hi, I'm Congressman Chris Collins and I want to take a moment to
discuss the President's State of the Union address.
For weeks now, President Obama has been talking about using a pen and a
phone to get things done. But the American people don't need a pen and
a phone, they need jobs and a paycheck. We need to focus on
strengthening our economy. There are 91.8 million Americans out of work
and at the end of the day jobs are created by economic growth, not
mandates from Washington.
Unfortunately, President Obama did not talk about plans for economic
growth, like fundamental tax reform, energy independence, or
significant changes to ObamaCare. We could immediately bolster our
nation's economy by changing ObamaCare's definition of a full-time work
week from 30 hours back to the traditional 40.
And we could repeal the medical device tax, which is hurting American
manufactures. But we didn't hear any of these solutions from the
President. Instead, we heard more "big government knows best" solutions
that are paid for by borrowing more money from China.
The American people want the checks and balances that come with divided
government. But they also want Washington to roll up its sleeves and
actually get something done.
Thankfully, Congress has started to get the message. We recently passed
a responsible spending bill, which will help restore Congress to
regular order, and are poised to pass a bipartisan Farm Bill.
But we cannot do it alone. We need President Obama to work with
Congress to address our nation's addiction to deficits and debt, so we
can begin to move our country toward a balanced budget. We need
President Obama to work with Congress to reform Social Security and
Medicare, to ensure they are solvent and give Americans confidence in
their retirement future. And we need the President to work with
Congress to get rid of Common Core, and put an end to the federal
government telling local schools how and what to teach.
Sadly, nothing in President Obama's address indicates he has gotten the
message that government works better when we work together. We need a
President who will work with Congress, not around Congress.
Thank you for listening, and as always, please continue to reach out to
me to share your comments and concerns."
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS
Member of Congress
Vision: The United States of America will reclaim its past glory as the
Land of Opportunity, restoring the promise of the American Dream for
our children and grandchildren.

Dear
Friends,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
the
video
statement
I
shared following
President
Obama&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
address.
Transcript
of
my
response:
&#8220;Hi,
I&#8217;m
Congressman
Chris
Collins
and
I
want
to
take
a
moment
to
discuss
the
President&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
address.
For
weeks
now,
President
Obama
has
been
talking
about
using
a
pen
and
a
phone
to
get
things
done.
But
the
American
people
don&#8217;t
need
a
pen
and
a
phone,
they
need
jobs
and
a
paycheck.
We
need
to
focus
on
strengthening
our
economy.
There
are
91.8
million
Americans
out
of
work
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
jobs
are
created
by
economic
growth,
not
mandates
from
Washington.
Unfortunately,
President
Obama
did
not
talk
about
plans
for
economic
growth,
like
fundamental
tax
reform,
energy
independence,
or
significant
changes
to
ObamaCare.
We
could
immediately
bolster
our
nation&#8217;s
economy
by
changing
ObamaCare&#8217;s
definition
of
a
full-time
work
week
from
30
hours
back
to
the
traditional
40.
And
we
could
repeal
the
medical
device
tax,
which
is
hurting
American
manufactures.
But
we
didn&#8217;t
hear
any
of
these
solutions
from
the
President.
Instead,
we
heard
more
&#8220;big
government
knows
best&#8221;
solutions
that
are
paid
for
by
borrowing
more
money
from
China.
The
American
people
want
the
checks
and
balances
that
come
with
divided
government.
But
they
also
want
Washington
to
roll
up
its
sleeves
and
actually
get
something
done.
Thankfully,
Congress
has
started
to
get
the
message.
We
recently
passed
a
responsible
spending
bill,
which
will
help
restore
Congress
to
regular
order,
and
are
poised
to
pass
a
bipartisan
Farm
Bill.
But
we
cannot
do
it
alone.
We
need
President
Obama
to
work
with
Congress
to
address
our
nation&#8217;s
addiction
to
deficits
and
debt,
so
we
can
begin
to
move
our
country
toward
a
balanced
budget.
We
need
President
Obama
to
work
with
Congress
to
reform
Social
Security
and
Medicare,
to
ensure
they
are
solvent
and
give
Americans
confidence
in
their
retirement
future.
And
we
need
the
President
to
work
with
Congress
to
get
rid
of
Common
Core,
and
put
an
end
to
the
federal
government
telling
local
schools
how
and
what
to
teach.
Sadly,
nothing
in
President
Obama&#8217;s
address
indicates
he
has
gotten
the
message
that
government
works
better
when
we
work
together.
We
need
a
President
who
will
work
with
Congress,
not
around
Congress.
Thank
you
for
listening,
and
as
always,
please
continue
to
reach
out
to
me
to
share
your
comments
and
concerns.&#8221;
