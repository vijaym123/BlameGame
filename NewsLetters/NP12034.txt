Dear
Friend,
This past week, I had the pleasure of spending time in the
District for the February Work Week. I was able to deliver the State of the
Fifth Congressional District Address, hear local business owner
feedback from the Colorado Springs Regional Business Alliance, take
questions from constituents over the radio, visit wonderful child care
facilities supporting our soldiers at Fort Carson, see the flood recovery
and mitigation efforts along Ute Pass and Highway 24 up close, and visit
one of our area's most important defense industry employers.
Also, details have started to trickle out regarding the latest budget
proposals from the Pentagon.
The
DOD has been the only part of the federal government that has been
seriously cut over the last few years. Our national security should not
be a budgetary punching bag. Instead, the rest of the federal
government needs to take some cuts. This is not the time to make the men and
women in uniform pay the price to balance the budget. Thats why I have
serious questions about TRICARE fee increases and cuts to
commissaries. Additionally, even though the Pentagon will call for a round of
BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) in 2017, I will oppose this and will
do everything I can to protect the important military installations in
the Fifth Congressional
District.
It is an honor to
serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's Happening in the Fifth Congressional
District?
On
Thursday, February 20th, I delivered the State of the Fifth Congressional
District Address as a guest of the Colorado Springs Regional Business
Alliance in Downtown Colorado Springs. The theme of the remarks was
"Working Together to Make a Better Community". I focused on four
critical issues facing our nation and our community: the impacts of
sequestration on our military, veterans issues, energy, and healthcare. For

Hearing feedback from the citizens in
the Fifth Congressional District is very important to me. That's why it
was so nice to spend an hour on our area's top-rated local radio
program taking calls and questions from listeners. Please click

Richard Randall.
Child care needs are an important issue facing our local
military community. That's why it was a
pleasure to
visit some of the child care facilities on Fort Carson today. The
people in these organizations provide a great service to our nation by
assisting in the readiness of our soldiers. One of the most helpful
organizations in this area is Community Partnership for Child Development
(CPCD), here I am pictured below with CPCD President and CEO Noreen
Landis-Tyson
Last
week,
I joined Commissioner Sallie Clark and representatives
from the Forest Service and the National Resources Conservation Service
for a tour of flash flood recovery and mitigation efforts being
undertaken along Ute Pass. These shots are
of work being done at
Pyramid Mountain in Cascade. Along the whole route, we witnessed tremendous,
collaborative work being done to help mitigate and alleviate the
dangers that have come from our recent natural
disasters.
I also had the opportunity during this Work Week to
tour
our local Honeywell facility. These dedicated men
and women provide critical support to our military all over the world
and to several small businesses here in El Paso County. Additionally,
I took questions on a variety of defense, energy, and veterans issues
during a town hall meeting following the
tour.

What Say
You?
One of the most important things I
can do is listen to my constituents. My staff and I get thousands of
phone calls, emails, letters, and social media postings every week. Here
is a sampling of what you are saying.
On
my Facebook
this week constituents
discussed the recent DOD budget announcements and shared their
suggestions on what President Obama should cut instead of our troops
:
Rob
Corcilius
-
Cut the pork barrel spending and
fully fund defense
Julie Arbuckle
-
I'd like to see less money being
sent to other nations. Seems we bail out nations - even nations with
anti-American agendas, when our own people are hurting and
suffering
Sharon Nordic
- Foreign
aid!
Cheri Ofner
- Cut entitlements by 10% and increase defense
spending!
