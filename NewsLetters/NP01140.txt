Dear Friend,
Last year, Americas deteriorating
roads cost drivers more than $67 billion in
repairs and operating costs, or about $324
per driver. Subpar and sometimes dangerous
road conditions are commonplace for many
drivers in Ohio and across the country.
Currently, there are about 70,000
bridges in the United States deemed
structurally deficient. In fact, one in
nine bridges needs to be repaired or
replaced. Additionally, more than 30
percent of our roads require some kind of
maintenance. The American Society of Civil
Engineers most recent report card
for Americas infrastructure is
evidence that something needs to change. We
earned a D plus.
Many people probably have not given our
deteriorating roads and bridges much
thought. However, over 200 million
trips are taken daily across deficient
bridges in our countrys 100 most
populated regions. Former Secretary of
Transportation Ray LaHood put it best when
he said, Our infrastructure is on
life support right now. Thats what
were on.
Unless action is taken to reinvest in
our failing infrastructure, the long-term
cost to our economy and taxpayers will be
devastating. We cannot afford to continue
to kick the can down the road, and many of
my constituents agree. In an informal poll,
eight out of 10 people said that they
consider addressing our nations
infrastructure a priority for Congress.
However, Congress hasnt made our
infrastructure a priority over the last two
decades. Maintenance of our highway system
falls jointly on the states and the federal
government, with about 80 percent of
highway funding coming from the federally
administered Highway Trust Fund.
Currently, the trust fund allocates
about $50 billion annually to the states
for upkeep of the system. However,
were spending about $16 billion more
annually than the trust fund is bringing
in, and were not spending enough to
keep our infrastructure from crumbling.
Congress lurches from crisis to crisis,
and the Highway Trust Fund is no exception.
The funding situation for the Highway Trust
Fund became dire last year when Congress
was forced to act to temporarily infuse the
fund with money from sources that have
nothing to do with roads and bridges.
Congress has about 30 days until it must
act again to sustain the fund.
As a member of the Ways &amp; Means
Committee, which is responsible for funding
the Highway Trust fund, I came up with a
long-term plan to address the imminent
shortfall: the Bridge to Sustainable
Infrastructure Act. This legislation will
put all transportation funding proposals on
the table. It also ensures that the trust
fund has enough money for at least 10
years.
Specifically, this legislation indexes
the gas and diesel user fees to inflation
going forward, which achieves nearly two
years of funding. The total cost per driver
per year would be less than $3.00 -
less than your morning latte. It also
creates a bipartisan, bicameral
Transportation Commission, a group that
would be charged with determining a path
forward for sustainable funding and
advised to consider all options. If
Congress doesnt come up with a
solution that will get us three
years worth of funding by December
31, 2016, the user fees will increase to a
level that will sustain the fund for the
next three years. Then, Congress will again
have the opportunity to get serious about a
plan. If Congress fails again to implement
long-term funding solutions, then the user
fees would increase to meet the next
five-year Highway Trust Fund shortfall,
guaranteeing 10 years of funding.
In 1982, President Reagan supported an
increase in the highway user fee of five
cents a gallon and said, Our
countrys outstanding highway system
was built on the user fee
principlethat those who benefit from
a use should share in its cost. I
refuse to pass on the cost of the roads and
bridges that were using to our
children. Instead of letting politics get
in the way of good policy, lets do
away with short-term patches that plague
our legislative process and settle on a
long-term funding plan.
Our transportation system touches every
aspect of our lives
whether we know
it or not. We use our roads and bridges
every day: to get to work, drive to
school, go to church, pick up
groceries. We must act now to reinvest in
our failing infrastructure, because if we
do not
down the road, well
be sorry that we didnt.
