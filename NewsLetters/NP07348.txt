Moving Forward With VA Reform
Dear Friend,
Yesterday, I joined my Senate colleagues to pass
The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014,
bipartisan legislation to improve veterans' access to health care and address systemic issues that have plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for too long. I'm especially proud that it's based on a
bill I introduced
with Senators Bernie Sanders, John McCain, Jeff Merkley, and Richard Burr in June.
Here's a quick look at what the bill accomplishes:
Ensures
veterans receive timely care by helping the VA hire more nurses, doctors
and other staff
Gives
patients the option of accessing private care if they live far away from a
VA facility or are facing long wait times
Increases
accountability by requiring an independent assessment of the care at VA
medical facilities and giving the VA Secretary authority to fire or
downgrade senior executives for poor performance or misconduct.
