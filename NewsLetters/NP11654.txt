Hatch Dispatch:
The Ukraine, the President's Budget, and
ObamaCare Delays
Dear Friend:
America continues to face critical economic
challenges
and the Presidents
budget proposal released this week makes it
pretty clear that the Obama Administration
doesnt have any answers. The
Presidents budget is a rehash of past
budgets which contained higher taxes, more
spending, and more debt.
I delivered a speech on the Senate floor this
week that I thought you might want to read to get
an idea of what I believe is wrong with the
Presidents budget and the solutions I
believe need to happen to make a true difference
to the economic future of our country.
You can find the speech at the link below:
Hatch:
President's FY2015 Budget "Returns to
Already-Rejected Ideas"
Not only did the President release a budget
that simply represented a campaign blueprint
designed to drum up the Presidents
left-wing base during an election year, this week
the Administration also announced it would,
again, delay ObamaCares minimum coverage
requirements for health plans offered by
insurance companies.
Once again, the Obama Administration has shown
it will do whatever it takes to hide the true
impact of ObamaCare from the American people
at least until after the next
election.
The fact is Americans should be able to keep
the insurance
and the doctors and
hospitals
of their choosing, just as the
President promised. Pushing this off for two more
years isnt a solution at all. The bottom
line, and the message I hear every day from so
many Utahns, is that this law is a disaster, and
should be thrown out and replaced with
common-sense reforms that will increase Americans
access to quality health care.
Theres one other issue of vital
importance that I wanted to address, and
thats the conflict in the Ukraine. This
week, I called on the Administration to utilize
all available tools to ensure that Russia
complies with international Law. As the Ranking
Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I sent a
letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and U.S.
Trade Rep. Michael Froman to insist that the
Administration not only begin using the tools
already available, but confirming my commitment
to working with the Administration, including
through legislation, to give our nation further
means to bring pressure to bear on Russia if
necessary.
You can find the text of the letter
here:
I will continue to work hard every day to find
solutions to the challenges we face. I feel
privileged to represent you in our nations
capital and appreciate your feedback and
support.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
