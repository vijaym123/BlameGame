Brain cancer. Breast cancer. Type 1 Diabetes. Parkinsons disease. Osteoporosis. All of these diseases
and more
are already being treated through adult stem cell research.
I introduced the Patients First Act ( H.R. 1740 ) to intensify research and human clinical trials using stem cells that are ethically obtained and that show evidence of providing near-term clinical benefit for human patients. This bill recognizes that the twin goals of scientific advancement and the protection of human life are not mutually exclusive; rather, they should be one in the same. By setting aside divisive political battles and prioritizing research with proven clinical success, we can finally make long-awaited progress in beating dreaded diseases.
I also sent a
letter
to my colleagues encouraging continued support and funding for NIH. With the research community on the verge of numerous medical advancements, it is imperative that we direct taxpayer dollars to medical research that will provide the most benefit to patients in the shortest amount of time.
I strongly believe that the federal government should do all it can to encourage the forms of medical research that show the most promise for curing and treating patients so we can combat these diseases.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.- Currently, adult stem cells are being used to treat over 70 diseases.
I will continue to work to encourage conscientious medical research to ease the suffering of those afflicted by diseases that do not yet have a cure.
