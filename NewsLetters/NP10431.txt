I hope that everyone had a blessed Easter and Passover.
As I said in
last week's newsletter, I am so thankful for the freedom to worship
that our country provides for us.
Let's never forget how hard-earned
that freedom is.
Tax Day 2014
The only certainties in life are death and taxes - and the tax part of
that came last Tuesday for many of us. While no one looks forward to
paying taxes, this time of year should spur us to reflect on how our
government is serving us.

With Tax Day comes an opportunity to continue spreading the word about
the FairTax. The FairTax is an idea that's been met with skepticism and
fear in professional Washington and with widespread support and
incredible excitement everywhere else in America.
That's how I know
we're on to something.
This month I had an opportunity to talk
directly to FairTax supporters across the nation in FairTax.org's
"FairTax Friday" newsletter
. When most folks think
about changing our nation, they look to Washington, but the real work
of changing America begins at home.
That's why I am so proud of the
work that grassroots leaders have done, and it's the reason why the
FairTax has more support in Congress today than it has ever had before.
Serving America's Veterans
On Wednesday I visited the Gwinnett Technical College Office of
Veterans Affairs, and it's clear that Gwinnett Tech is doing great
things for our veterans, their spouses, and dependents.
If you need
guidance on a career path, filling out paperwork for educational
benefits, VA certification, or registering for classes, the folks at
the Office of Veterans Affairs have a heart for serving eligible
veterans and their family members.

Georgia Gwinnett College
Last week I had the pleasure of visiting with a fantastic group of
students and faculty at Georgia Gwinnett College.
I am always
encouraged when I get the chance to speak with young people about our
nation and listen to where they stand on what's happening in
Washington.
With the discussion ranging from the FairTax to balancing
civil liberties with national security, their level of involvement
inspires me.

Georgia Manufacturing Expo
Last year I had the privilege of speaking at the inaugural Georgia
Manufacturing Expo.
The event was big success, and I am happy to say
that they have decided to do it again.
I visited with Jason Moss,
founder for the Georgia Manufacturing Expo, last week.
I am told that
everything has come together, and they expect to have another wonderful
event in June.

Crisis in Ukraine
Even though we are far removed geographically from the tensions in
Ukraine, our nation is nonetheless a critical player in this issue.
With events changing every day, it's certainly hard to stay informed.
That said, we have fantastic resources right here in Georgia - the
world headquarters of CNN. I encourage you to take a look at CNN's
special coverage on Ukraine,
and
I am certain that Congress will once again have to address this issue
in coordination with the President.
The Week Ahead
This week is going to be another great week in Georgia. I am visiting
local businesses and speaking to our service and civic organizations,
and I hope to see you out and about in our community this week!
