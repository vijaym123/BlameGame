Dear Friend,
In October
2012, Super Storm Sandy devastated parts of New York, including the
5 th
Congressional District in Southeast Queens and
the Rockaways, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The storm resulted
in 73 people losing their lives, over $65 billion in damages, and
650,000 homes either destroyed or
damaged.
Last week in Congress, Brad Kieserman, the Deputy
Associate Administrator for Insurance at the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), appeared before the Financial Services Committee and
provided members with an update on Super Storm Sandy insurance
claims.
As many of you know, in the aftermath of the storm, thousands of
homeowners were denied flood insurance claims, or their claims were
seriously underpaid, due to doctored and/or fraudulent engineers reports.
In the clip below, I had the opportunity to ask Mr. Kieserman what
FEMA is doing to rectify this unfortunate situation and how these
homeowners will be made whole.
