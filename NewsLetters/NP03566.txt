Week of Jan. 5

New Congress / Need to Move Beyond Congressional
Dysfunction
The
114 th
Congress convened on January 6 with Republican majorities
now in control of both the House of Representatives and the United
States Senate.
The question on many peoples mind is whether it
will now be possible for Congress to set aside the partisan dysfunction
that has gripped the legislative branch for the last four years
where
lawmakers spun their wheels passing partisan messaging bills that had
no chance of ever being signed into
law.
Maybe with one party in control of both
houses of Congress, lawmakers could finally get to work on the large
backlog of problems confronting middle class families, like putting
Americans back to work building roads and bridges; raising the federal
minimum wage; requiring that women receive equal pay for equal work; and
helping families afford the soaring cost of college
education.
So how is the House of
Representatives spending its first
week?
The House is considering bills to 1)
deem approval of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline (which could
raise gas prices in Midwestern states); 2) dismantle essential Wall
Street reforms that help prevent big banks from once again crashing the
economy; and 3) undermine the Affordable Care Act while adding $46
billion in red ink to the federal budget.
(This is the
54 th
vote by House Republicans to repeal or weaken the health reform
law.
For more information, read this
article
by Rep. Levin that appeared in the January 7 edition of The
Hill newspaper.)
The
President would veto all three of these bad bills, and there is not enough
support in Congress to override these vetoes.
Rather than
continue to waste time on partisan, ideological bills that have no chance
of becoming law, Congress should get to work on bipartisan legislation
to strengthen the middle class, create jobs, grow the economy, and
rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
