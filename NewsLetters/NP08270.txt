David -- WOW!
Last week, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s campaign machine placed $800,000 on the Chicago airwaves to attack Brad. Then, something AMAZING happened.
Since news of the ad buy broke, more than 1,000 people in Illinois and all across the country have pitched in online for Brad. THAT&rsquo;S INCREDIBLE!!!
If we can raise just $1,312 before MIDNIGHT, we&rsquo;ll hit $100,000 in online contributions for the quarter and BREAK OUR RECORD for this election. $1,312 to go -- will you put Brad over the top? David Johnson
