Rubio Introduces Legislation
Promoting Alternative Higher Education
Credentials In Federal Hiring
On Wednesday, Marco introduced the
Alternative Qualifications for Federal
Employment Act, a bill that will
encourage federal agencies to hire
individuals who have obtained education
and training from alternative providers
rather than a traditional college or
university. This pilot program would
apply to certain pre-determined agency
positions and would take place over a
five-year period. The results of the
study would be tracked and reported back
to Congress to form the basis for future
policy.
Marco first outlined this idea during
a
February
10 speech
at Miami-Dade College, as
part of his agenda to restore the
American Dream.
In introducing this legislation, he
issued the following statement:
Today there are an infinite
number of ways for people to learn and
master trades, including many low-cost
online opportunities. Unfortunately,
our current higher education model is
based on a broken accreditation system
that favors established institutions
while blocking out the new providers
that are more affordable and accessible
to many Americans.
Combined with stringent
hiring requirements in many
professions, this has created a barrier
to entry into the workforce for those
who received their education from an
unaccredited, alternative provider. By
creating a federal pilot program to
test the employment of these
individuals, I believe we will find
that the source of an employees
education is far less important than
some previously thought.
Those who have the skills and
aptitude to be successful in a job
deserve the opportunity to be
considered for employment, even if they
learned the trade from a
non-traditional source. This pilot
program will likely make that possible
by creating private sector confidence
in the hiring of these
individuals.
ICYMI: Rubio: 8 Steps Obama Must
Take To Punish Russia
On Saturday, Marco wrote an op-ed for
POLITICO Magazine, outlining the 8 steps
President Obama should take to punish
Russia for its aggression against
Ukraine. An excerpt of the article is
below:
Russias illegal
military incursion in the Crimea region
in Ukraine is a grave violation of a
nations sovereignty and cannot
go unpunished.
First, President Obama should
speak unequivocally and call this what
it is: a military invasion. The Obama
administration must publicly
acknowledge that its
reset with Russia is
dead. The president must now accept
that the only way to deal with tyrants
like Vladimir Putin is with a clear
understanding that they cant be
trusted and that only decisive action
will deter their provocative moves.
Second, President Obama
should dispatch Secretary of State John
Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
to Kiev to show U.S. support for
Ukraines transitional
government, and urge our allies in the
European Union and NATO to send
representatives there as well. The
United States should convene an
emergency meeting of NATO to develop a
strong united response from the
trans-Atlantic alliance. And we should
send high-level delegations to our
allies in Central and Eastern Europe to
reinforce the fact that we are standing
by them. As part of this work with our
allies, we should develop a series of
economic and security assurance
measures to help the transitional
government in Kiev remain stable and
carry out a democratic
transition.

Marco, along with U.S. Representative
Tom Cotton (R-AR), also wrote an op-ed
for
CNN.com
urging Congress to act quickly in
punishing Russia and supporting
Ukraine.
Rubio: Obama Budget Shows Alarming
Disconnect With Americas
Challenges
Marco issued the following statement
regarding Tuesdays release of
President Obamas Fiscal Year 2015
budget:
President Obamas
budget shows an alarming disconnect
with threats to the American Dream at
home and threats to our national
security abroad.
As recent events in Ukraine
show, the world is as dangerous as
ever. Our enemies are emboldened every
time we fail to uphold our commitments
and every time we naively try to
address our serious debt problem by
weakening our military strength and
readiness, as
this
budget
does.
This budget walks away from
the reality that America and the world
are safer when America is as strong as
possible economically and
militarily.
Economically, this budget
calls for more government spending,
instead of free enterprise, to create
jobs
as if the lessons of five
years of this failed approach have been
ignored. This budget is a disappointing
admission that President Obama has no
intention of seeking any reforms to
save our safety net programs. We need
to save Medicare and Social Security to
not only ensure future seniors can
retire with dignity and a safety net,
but also to make sure that we
dont sacrifice our security in
order to deal with our debt.
While there are many other
areas of this budget that we will
continue discussing in the coming days
and weeks, I am concerned by the
Presidents call to expand the
status quo on the Earned Income Tax
Credit. We should be reforming this
flawed approach to helping low-income
workers, not expanding it. As I
suggested earlier this year, we should
convert
the EITC into a wage enhancement
that is distributed to workers
throughout the year, not in one big
lump sum as it does now.
Constituent Casework Corner
Mark is a doctor who owns and operates
a physicians office in Central
Florida. Medicare erroneously deactivated
his provider number due to a death record
obtained from the Social Security
Administration. As a result of the
error, he was unable to receive payment
for patient claims he billed to Medicare.
With impending financial hardship, he
contacted Senator Rubios office
for assistance. A member of the staff
contacted the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services and they worked
collectively with First Coast Service
Options to remove the error.
Consequently, his provider number was
reactivated.
