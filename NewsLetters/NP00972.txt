Working to Lift the Crude Oil Ba n
On April 30th, I spoke at a press conference in Washington, D.C. to voice my support of HR 702, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation that would lift the crude oil ban, and allow the U.S. to benefit from a global marketplace. The lift of the ban would mean hundreds of thousands of jobs--many of which would be in Texas.
Meeting with Rio Grande Valley Coalition
On May 4, my southern district outreach coordinator Nichole Hernandez met with the Rio Grande Valley Coalition to discuss a valley-wide initiative to help our Veterans in the best way possible by networking with various agencies which are willing to altruistically guide and serve them.
City of McAllen's International Airport Expansion
On May 5th, I
spoke at the McAllen International Airport's expansion event to announce the expansion of the airport due in part to funding from the federal government. Pictured above, is me giving a certificate of recognition to McAllen Aviation Director Elizabeth Suarez.

TX28 Tips
May is American Stroke Month, a time for us all to educate ourselves and increase awareness about the number one cause of cause of preventable disability, the second leading cause of dementia, and the fifth leading killer in the nation.
Strokes are largely preventable and treatable, we just have to know the signs.
Check out this website from the American Heart Association that explains the warning signs and symptoms of a stroke.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
The House of Representatives is in session next week
