Dear Friend,
This week, I launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on
wellness in the Ninth District with a panel discussion on the racial
disparity in breast cancer outcomes in our city, introduced legislation
that could help in the fight for a sane national marijuana policy, and
continued to speak out to protect the HOPE Scholarship that so many of
our state's young people rely on. Keep reading to learn more.

Building a Healthier Memphis
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A New
York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer."
The racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes is deplorable, but we
can take steps to reduce it. A primary reason for the high mortality
rate among African American women is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. That's why
yesterday, I launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on
wellness in the Ninth District by hosting an expert panel discussion
and education session about this disparity and what we can do to
address it and improve outcomes for victims of breast cancer in our
city. News Channel 3 ran a story about our event, which you can watch
here
.
The overflow crowd at yesterday's event heard about several causes
behind the difference in outcomes, including a disparity in economic
situations and education, poor health and wellness habits, difficulty
accessing transportation, and a lack of insurance and local clinics.
There were also several representatives, including Carolyn Whitney of
Sisters Network and Linda Reddick of Seeds 2 Life, from groups that
help breast cancer survivors by providing services and care that they
need. You can find more information from some of these groups and the
services they provide at these links: http://sistersnetworkinc.org/
and http://seeds2life.org/
.
I'm encouraged by all of the Memphians who attended the panel and
education session to learn how they can help improve their own health
and the health of their families and communities. Everyone in the Ninth
District should know that provisions of the President's Affordable Care
Act enable them to get mammograms with no co-pays or deductibles.
Taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act could help save lives in
our city and around the country. And don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
Over the last 10 years, the HOPE Scholarship program that I worked for
20 years as a State Senator to create has been an outstanding success
that has provided $2.9 billion to Tennessee's best and brightest. And
while this funding has been critical to helping students attend college
and complete 4-year degrees, the HOPE Scholarship has never fully
funded college scholarships, as intended, because state lawmakers have
not allowed it to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of higher
education.
Today's HOPE Scholarships pay a smaller portion of college costs than
it did 10 years ago and, if Governor Haslam's newly-announced plan to
slash the first two years of HOPE Scholarships by 25% is implemented,
it will provide even smaller scholarships for freshmen and sophomores.
The first two years of college are crucial for students finding their
way. With scholarships paying a smaller portion of tuition, families
will have to pay more and students may need to work more hours while
studying, making academic success and retention of the HOPE Scholarship
more difficult. Today's college students are graduating with more
student loan debt than ever before, crippling their chances of economic
success.
To ensure that HOPE Scholarships continue to help Tennessee's students
afford college and succeed, the program must keep pace with the rising
cost of higher education. But the Governor's newly-announced "Promise"
actually cuts funding from high-achieving students beginning 4-year
degree programs. I am extremely concerned and remain cautious about any
plan that would make it harder for our state's proven young people to
begin attending the best universities in Tennessee, or any plan that
places additional financial burden on schools like the University of
Memphis which are already struggling to keep costs down and provide
high-quality educations.
Rather than raiding the scholarship fund's excess to create a new
government program, those funds should be used to provide full HOPE
scholarships. Tennesseans voted to repeal our state's constitutional
prohibition on lotteries based on the idea of replicating the success
of Georgia's successful HOPE program which provides full college
scholarships. That promise to the people moves farther from being
realized with every new idea to siphon money from the scholarship
program. Once scholarships are fully funded, the excess funds would be
better used, as I personally expressed last year to Governor Haslam, by
raising the income cap on or raising the amount of Aspire Awards that
give middle- and low-income students who work hard extra help to give
them a fair shot at success.
Protecting Worker's Rights
This week, at the Chattanooga Volkswagen plant, workers are voting to
decide whether or not they want to take the first step towards creating
a "works council" like those present at most other VW plants around the
world. Doing so would be revolutionary for the manufacturing industry,
fostering more collaboration between management and workers on
everything from plant rules to working hours and leave policies. And it
would help bring jobs to our state. But sadly, outside interest groups
have been funneling money and advertisements into Chattanooga to try to
influence the vote. These groups have their own big-moneyed interests
at heart and are not looking out for Tennesseans. If you want to know
more, I encourage you to read an op-ed I wrote
in the Chattanooga Times Free Press earlier this week. I also
joined The Ed Show on MSNBC on Wednesday to discuss the issue, and you
can watch my interview here
.
Join My February 25th Telephone Town Hall
On Tuesday, February 25th, at 6:30PM CT I will host a telephone town
hall to answer your questions and discuss a variety of topics including
what Memphians can do to reduce the breast cancer outcome racial
disparity and how everyone can better take advantage of the Affordable
Care Act. I hope you can join our telephone town call later this month.
If you would like to participate in this telephone town hall on the
evening of Tuesday, February 25th, please fill out the form here

Fighting for a Sane Marijuana Policy
Nobody dies from marijuana, but people die from heroin overdoses every
day. Every second that we spend trying to enforce marijuana possession
laws is a moment that we're not enforcing laws meant to protect
Americans from the ravages of drugs like heroin and methamphetamine.
That's where our priority should be. When we put marijuana on the same
level as LSD, crack, heroin, meth, and cocaine-as the federal
government has-it makes young people distrust what they are being told
about hard drugs because they know that what they are being told about
marijuana is wrong. There is a cultural lag in this country, and
Congress and this Administration must fix it. I joined Milissa
Rehberger on MSNBC over the weekend to discuss this. You can watch my
interview here
.
But one of the reasons for our current policy is that the Office of
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), commonly referred to as our "Drug
Czar," is required by law to oppose changing the legal status of
marijuana, even if it is proven to have medical benefits. The ONDCP is
also prohibited by law from studying whether or not there could be any
benefits. That troubles me, because the ONDCP's job should be to
develop and recommend sane drug control policies, not be handcuffed or
muzzled from telling the American people the truth.
How can we trust what the Drug Czar says if the law already preordains
the ONDCP's position? That's why this week, I introduced the "Unmuzzle
the Drug Czar Act
" to remove those restrictions and give the ONDCP the freedom to
recommend more sane drug policies for our nation. My bill would give
the ONDCP the freedom to use science-not ideology-in its
recommendations and give the American people a reason to trust what
they are told. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the
House to pass this important legislation.
I also co-signed a letter
with several other Members of Congress to the President this
week encouraging the reclassification of marijuana from Schedule I on
our nation's controlled substances "schedule," as it is currently
listed, to a less strict classification. This is a higher listing than
cocaine and methamphetamine. If a drug is listed under Schedule I, it
means that the federal government recognizes no medical use. Including
marijuana in this classification disregards both scientific medical
evidence and the laws of nearly half of the states that have legalized
it for medical purposes.
Promoting International Relations
On Tuesday, I attended a lunch hosted at the State Department by Vice
President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden to honor French President
Francois Hollande, who was visiting our country to meet with President
Obama. At the lunch, I spoke with New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu,
General Colin Powell, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun
Donovan, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, as well as National
Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D. I also had a
long conversation with FedEx founder and CEO Fred Smith.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I attended the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that recently opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near you to help ensure you get every penny
you are owed.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901)
528-8341. You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the
Marketplace Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid
program) is a coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions
of Americans who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

The

at

heard
about
several
causes
behind
the
difference
in

including
a
disparity
in
economic

and
education,
poor
health

difficulty

and
a
lack

There
were
also
several
representatives,
including
Carolyn
Whitney
of
Sisters
Network
and
Linda
Reddick
of
Seeds
2
Life,
from
groups
that
help
breast
cancer
survivors
by
providing
services
and
care
that
they
need.
You
can
find
more
information
from
some
of
these
groups
and
the
services
they
provide
at
these
links:
http://sistersnetworkinc.org/
and
http://seeds2life.org/ .
I&#8217;m
encouraged
by
all
of
the
Memphians
who
attended
the
panel
and
education
session
to
learn
how
they
can
help
improve
their
own
health
and
the
health
of
their
families
and
communities.
Everyone
in
the
Ninth
District
should
know
that
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
enable
them
to
get
mammograms
with
no
co-pays
or
deductibles.
Taking
advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
could
help
save
lives
in
our
city
and
around
the
country.
And
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
Over
the
last
10
years,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
that
I
worked
for
20
years
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
has
been
an
outstanding
success
that
has
provided
$2.9
billion
to
Tennessee&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
And
while
this
funding
has
been
critical
to
helping
students
attend
college
and
complete
4-year
degrees,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
has
never
fully
funded
college
scholarships,
as
intended,
because
state
lawmakers
have
not
allowed
it
to
keep
up
with
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
higher
education.
Today&#8217;s
HOPE
Scholarships
pay
a
smaller
portion
of
college
costs
than
it
did
10
years
ago
and,
if
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
newly-announced
plan
to
slash
the
first
two
years
of
HOPE
Scholarships
by
25%
is
implemented,
it
will
provide
even
smaller
scholarships
for
freshmen
and
sophomores.
The
first
two
years
of
college
are
crucial
for
students
finding
their
way.
With
scholarships
paying
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition,
families
will
have
to
pay
more
and
students
may
need
to
work
more
hours
while
studying,
making
academic
success
and
retention
of
the
HOPE
Scholarship
more
difficult. Today&#8217;s
college
students
are
graduating
with
more
student
loan
debt
than
ever
before,
crippling
their
chances
of
economic
success.
To
ensure
that
HOPE
Scholarships
continue
to
help
Tennessee&#8217;s
students
afford
college
and
succeed,
the
program
must
keep
pace
with
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education.
But
the
Governor&#8217;s
newly-announced
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
actually
cuts
funding
from
high-achieving
students
beginning
4-year
degree
programs.
I
am
extremely
concerned
and
remain
cautious
about
any
plan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
our
state&#8217;s
proven
young
people
to
begin
attending
the
best
universities
in
Tennessee,
or
any
plan
that
places
additional
financial
burden
on
schools
like
the
University
of
Memphis
which
are
already
struggling
to
keep
costs
down
and
provide
high-quality
educations.
Rather
than
raiding
the
scholarship
fund&#8217;s
excess
to
create
a
new
government
program,
those
funds
should
be
used
to
provide
full
HOPE
scholarships.
Tennesseans
voted
to
repeal
our
state&#8217;s
constitutional
prohibition
on
lotteries
based
on
the
idea
of
replicating
the
success
of
Georgia&#8217;s
successful
HOPE
program
which
provides
full
college
scholarships.
That
promise
to
the
people
moves
farther
from
being
realized
with
every
new
idea
to
siphon
money
from
the
scholarship
program.
Once
scholarships
are
fully
funded,
the
excess
funds
would
be
better
used,
as
I
personally
expressed
last
year
to
Governor
Haslam,
by
raising
the
income
cap
on
or
raising
the
amount
of
Aspire
Awards
that
give
middle-
and
low-income
students
who
work
hard
extra
help
to
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
success.
Protecting
Worker&#8217;s
Rights
This
week,
at
the
Chattanooga
Volkswagen
plant,
workers
are
voting
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
to
take
the
first
step
towards
creating
a
&#8220;works
council&#8221;
like
those
present
at
most
other
VW
plants
around
the
world.
Doing
so
would
be
revolutionary
for
the
manufacturing
industry,
fostering
more
collaboration
between
management
and
workers
on
everything
from
plant
rules
to
working
hours
and
leave
policies.
And
it
would
help
bring
jobs
to
our
state.
But
sadly,
outside
interest
groups
have
been
funneling
money
and
advertisements
into
Chattanooga
to
try
to
influence
the
vote.
These
groups
have
their
own
big-moneyed
interests
at
heart
and
are
not
looking
out
for
Tennesseans.
If
you
want
to
know
more,
I

you
to
read

op-ed
I
wrote
in
the
Chattanooga
Times
Free

earlier
this
week.

Fighting
for
a
Sane
Marijuana
Policy
Nobody
dies
from
marijuana,
but
people
die
from
heroin
overdoses
every
day.
Every
second
that
we
spend
trying
to
enforce
marijuana
possession
laws
is
a
moment
that
we&#8217;re
not
enforcing
laws
meant
to
protect
Americans
from
the
ravages
of
drugs
like
heroin
and
methamphetamine.
That&#8217;s
where
our
priority
should
be.
When
we
put
marijuana
on
the
same
level
as
LSD,
crack,
heroin,
meth,
and
cocaine&#8212;as
the
federal
government
has&#8212;it
makes
young
people
distrust
what
they
are
being
told
about
hard
drugs
because
they
know
that
what
they
are
being
told
about
marijuana
is
wrong.
There
is
a
cultural
lag
in
this
country,
and
Congress
and
this
Administration
must
fix
it.
I
joined
Milissa
Rehberger
on
MSNBC
over
the
weekend
to
discuss
this.
You
can
watch
my
interview
here .
But
one
of
the
reasons
for
our
current
policy
is
that
the
Office
of
National
Drug
Control
Policy
(ONDCP),
commonly
referred
to
as
our
&#8220;Drug
Czar,&#8221;
is
required
by
law
to
oppose
changing
the
legal
status
of
marijuana,
even
if
it
is
proven
to
have
medical
benefits.
The
ONDCP
is
also
prohibited
by
law
from
studying
whether
or
not
there
could
be
any
benefits.
That
troubles
me,
because
the
ONDCP&#8217;s
job
should
be
to
develop
and
recommend
sane
drug
control
policies,
not
be
handcuffed
or
muzzled
from
telling
the
American
people
the
truth.
How
can
we
trust
what
the
Drug
Czar
says
if
the
law
already
preordains
the
ONDCP&#8217;s
position?
That&#8217;s
why
this
week,
I
introduced
the
&#8220; Unmuzzle
the
Drug
Czar
Act &#8221;
to
remove
those
restrictions
and
give
the
ONDCP
the
freedom
to
recommend
more
sane
drug
policies
for
our
nation.
My
bill
would
give
the
ONDCP
the
freedom
to
use
science&#8212;not
ideology&#8212;in
its
recommendations
and
give
the
American
people
a
reason
to
trust
what
they
are
told.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
pass
this
important
legislation.
I
also
co-signed
a
letter
with
several
other
Members
of
Congress
to
the
President
this
week
encouraging
the
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
Schedule
I
on
our
nation&#8217;s
controlled
substances
&#8220;schedule,&#8221;
as
it
is
currently
listed,
to
a
less
strict
classification.
This
is
a
higher
listing
than
cocaine
and
methamphetamine.
If
a
drug
is
listed
under
Schedule
I,
it
means
that
the
federal
government
recognizes
no
medical
use.
Including
marijuana
in
this
classification
disregards
both
scientific
medical
evidence
and
the
laws
of
nearly
half
of
the
states
that
have
legalized
it
for
medical
purposes.
Promoting
International
Relations
On
Tuesday,
I
attended
a
lunch
hosted
at
the
State
Department
by
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
and
Dr.
Jill
Biden
to
honor
French
President
Francois
Hollande,
who
was
visiting
our
country
to
meet
with
President
Obama.
At
the
lunch,
I
spoke
with
New
Orleans
Mayor
Mitch
Landrieu,
General
Colin
Powell,
Secretary
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Shaun
Donovan,
NASA
Administrator
Charles
Bolden,
as
well
as
National
Institutes
of
Health
Director
Francis
Collins,
M.D.,
Ph.D.
I
also
had
a
long
conversation
with
FedEx
founder
and
CEO
Fred
Smith.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that recently
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.

find
a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline

or

Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

United
States
Naval
Academy
Summer
Programs
Each
year,
the
United
States
Naval
Academy
invites
more
than
3,000
students
to
Annapolis,
Maryland,
to
participate
in
its
summer
programs.
The
Academy&#8217;s
summer
STEM
program,
which
is
now
accepting
applications
here ,
gives
rising
8th,
9th,
10th,
and
11th
graders
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
some
of
the
best
college
professors
in
the
country
and
work
in
world-class
lab
facilities.
The
Academy&#8217;s
Summer
Seminars
gives
rising
12th
graders
the
opportunity
to
find
out
if
they
have
what
it
takes
to
be
midshipmen
by
allowing
them
to
experience
the
rigorous
academics,
physical
challenges,
and
student
life
at
the
Naval
Academy.

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .
