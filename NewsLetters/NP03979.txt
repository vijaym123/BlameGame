Congressman Lamborn Opposes "Cromnibus"
Funding
12/11/14
I cast my vote against
the so-called Cromnibus package because it funded lawless executive
amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, and that is something I
cannot support. I also introduced an amendment to the legislation that
would have prohibited federal funds from being used to carry out amnesty.
Unfortunately, the leadership rejected this common sense
approach.
As with any large, omnibus legislation, there are good aspects to
this bill. However, I must hold fast to my Constitutional oath and do
everything in my power to stop and defund President Obamas executive
amnesty. This is a consistent vote as I have been on record supporting
any practical legal steps to prevent this unlawful use of executive
power.

(CO-05)
