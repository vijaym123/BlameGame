Congressman Veasey Announces 2 nd
Annual Teen Summit
Washington, D.C Today,
Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, announced that registration is now open for the 2 nd
Annual Teen Summit scheduled to take place on Saturday, April 18 from 8:30 AM
4:00 PM at Sam Houston High School in Arlington, Texas.
This FREE event is open to high school juniors and seniors to learn about financial aid and scholarship opportunities, military academy appointments, job interview strategies and the opportunity to interview for summer internships and apprenticeships throughout the Metroplex.
I believe that investing in our youth is investing in our future, said Congressman Veasey. That is why I am proud to bring our annual Teen Summit to the Metroplex to bridge the opportunity gap that many students face and to provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
Registration for the Teen Summit will be capped at 200 registrants. For more information on the Teen Summit or to RSVP for this important event, please visit
