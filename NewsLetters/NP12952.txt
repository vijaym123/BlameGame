Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I look forward to spending this week in the Bluegrass and visiting with
people across the district. I will be traveling throughout central and
eastern Kentucky communities, attending events honoring Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., holding business roundtables, meeting with members of
my Sixth District signature industries coalitions and more! I truly
enjoy these types of events as they help me better serve you and they
allow me to hear directly from you about how Washington policies affect
your family.
I hope to see you around the district!
Empowering Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma
Last year, the crisis of sexual assault in the military was brought to
my attention in a much more personal and meaningful way when
Representative Susan Westrom and Susan Moseley, a constituent survivor,
visited my office. What Susan Moseley, a veteran of our armed services,
shared with me was not just that she had been a victim of unwanted
sexual conduct during her active duty service in the 1990's, but that
she had also struggled in the years since leaving the service - unable
to access the services that she need to treat and overcome the trauma
she had suffered.
Specifically she noted the healthcare services provided by the Veterans
Administration did not match her specific post MST needs. As I reflect
back on that conversation that day in my office, I remain struck by the
fact that here is a women who is not only courageous and a patriot for
serving her country in uniform, but also courageous and patriotic for
having the ability to come forward to share her experience so other
veterans suffering in similar circumstance might have better access to
MST related treatment and disability benefits that they so justly
deserve.
I was honored to be joined by a bipartisan group of Kentuckians to
announce that I have introduced H.R. 3775, the Military Sexual Assault
Victims Empowerment Act, or the Military SAVE Act, which would empower
survivors of military sexual trauma to select their own care providers
and provide the support these brave service members have earned. I look
forward to continuing our efforts to empower those who protect us and
to helping improve care for the members of our military who have
survived sexual trauma.

I hope you will consider becoming a Citizen Cosponsor of the Military
SAVE Act today

Listening to the Sixth District
I have received questions regarding the provision of the Budget
Agreement that, beginning in December 2015, will adjust the rate of
annual pension increases for military retirees who have over 20 years
of service and are under the age of 60. I have invited veterans and any
other interested members to join a task force to examine and evaluate
several legislative proposals to address military pensions and
compensation, and return a recommendation. The task force recently held
its first meeting and the next one has been scheduled.
If you are interested in participating, I would very much appreciate
your insight on this matter. Please contact Tyler White at my Lexington
office (859-219-1366) to receive more information.
Fighting for Kentucky Families
Recently, I learned the heartbreaking story of Eric and Katie Harshman's
adoption of their child from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The Harshmans have been working tirelessly to bring their daughter home
for three years, but when they were ready to complete the final step,
the DRC halted all adoption processes and denied the Harshmans the
chance to reunite their family in Kentucky.
While international adoptions are often vulnerable to unpredictable
bureaucratic red tape, the Harshmans and other families were promised
that they could bring their legally adopted daughter home. I am honored
to advocate for this family in Congress.

Department of State make the resolution of this issue a priority and do
all it can to help these American citizens and facilitate the travel of
their adopted children home to the United States
!
Promoting Central and Eastern Kentucky Priorities
The people of central and eastern Kentucky sent me to Washington to
rein in out-of-control federal spending, save our country from
bankruptcy, and promote the long-term growth of our economy and our
workforce.
At a time when Kentucky families are struggling to stretch every dime,
I am glad that on Wednesday, the House passed a government funding bill
that reduces federal spending and sets priorities that honor
hard-working taxpayers, while continuing to protect central and eastern
Kentucky interests. While there is still much more work to do to
achieve a balanced budget, this bill reflects my commitment to reducing
federal spending and sets a solid foundation on which to work for the
coming fiscal year. I appreciate the hard work of Chairman Hal Rogers
in reaching this agreement.
I am glad that the legislation continues the downward trend of overall
federal discretionary spending, which has now been reduced four years
in a row and is $500 million below Fiscal Year 2009 levels. And while
full repeal of the President's disastrous healthcare law remains the
only solution, I am pleased that this bill halts any new funding for
Obamacare and cuts over $1 billion from existing funding. This
legislation also cuts foreign aid by $4 billion and because the
families of those killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack deserve answers
and accountability, I am glad to support this bill's provisions to
withhold aid to government of Libya until they cooperate in Benghazi
investigation.

Pushing for Senate Action on House-Passed Jobs Bills
The red-tape cutting REINS Act, workforce training SKILLS Act, and
20,000-job-creating Keystone Pipeline Approval already passed the House
of Representatives and continue to sit idle on Senator Harry Reid's
desk.

the Senate to act

Empowering
Survivors
of
Military
Sexual
Trauma
Last
year,
the
crisis
of
sexual
assault
in
the
military
was
brought
to
my
attention
in
a
much
more
personal
and
meaningful
way
when
Representative
Susan
Westrom
and
Susan
Moseley,
a
constituent
survivor,
visited
my
office.
What
Susan
Moseley,
a
veteran
of
our
armed
services,
shared
with
me
was
not
just
that
she
had
been
a
victim
of
unwanted
sexual
conduct
during
her
active
duty
service
in
the
1990&#8217;s,
but
that
she
had
also
struggled
in
the
years
since
leaving
the
service
-
unable
to
access
the
services
that
she
need
to
treat
and
overcome
the
trauma
she
had
suffered.
Specifically
she
noted
the
healthcare
services
provided
by
the
Veterans

did
not
match
her
specific
post
MST
needs.
As
I
reflect
back
on
that
conversation
that
day
in
my
office,
I
remain
struck
by
the
fact
that
here
is
a
women
who
is
not
only
courageous
and
a
patriot
for
serving
her
country
in
uniform,
but
also
courageous
and
patriotic
for
having
the
ability
to
come
forward
to
share
her
experience
so
other
veterans
suffering
in
similar
circumstance
might
have
better
access
to
MST
related
treatment
and
disability
benefits
that
they
so
justly
deserve.
I

these
brave

members
have
earned.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
our
efforts
to
empower
those
who
protect
us
and
to
helping
improve
care
for
the
members
of
our
military
who
have
survived
sexual
trauma.

Fighting
for

Families
Recently,
I
learned
the
heartbreaking
story
of
Eric

adoption
of
their

from
the
Democratic

The

the
DRC
halted
all
adoption
processes
and
denied

the
chance

While
international
adoptions
are
often
vulnerable
to
unpredictable
bureaucratic
red
tape,
the
Harshmans
and
other
families
were
promised
that
they
could
bring
their
legally
adopted
daughter
home.
I
am
honored
to
advocate
for
this
family
in
Congress.

asking

State
make
the
resolution
of
this
issue
a
priority
and
do

and

Promoting
Central
and
Eastern
Kentucky
Priorities
The
people
of
central
and
eastern
Kentucky
sent
me
to
Washington
to
rein
in
out-of-control
federal
spending,
save
our
country
from
bankruptcy,
and
promote
the
long-term
growth
of
our
economy
and
our
workforce.
At
a
time
when
Kentucky
families
are
struggling
to
stretch
every
dime,
I
am
glad
that
on
Wednesday,
the
House
passed
a
government
funding
bill
that
reduces
federal
spending
and
sets
priorities
that
honor
hard-working
taxpayers,
while
continuing
to
protect
central
and
eastern
Kentucky
interests.
While
there
is
still
much
more
work
to
do
to
achieve
a
balanced
budget,
this
bill
reflects
my
commitment
to
reducing
federal
spending
and
sets
a
solid
foundation
on
which
to
work
for
the
coming
fiscal
year.
I
appreciate
the
hard
work
of
Chairman
Hal
Rogers
in
reaching
this
agreement.
I
am
glad
that
the
legislation
continues
the
downward
trend
of
overall
federal
discretionary
spending,
which
has
now
been
reduced
four
years
in
a
row
and
is
$500
million
below
Fiscal
Year
2009
levels.
And
while
full
repeal
of
the
President's
disastrous
healthcare
law
remains
the
only
solution,
I
am
pleased
that
this
bill
halts
any
new
funding
for
Obamacare
and
cuts
over
$1
billion
from
existing
funding.
This
legislation
also
cuts
foreign
aid
by
$4
billion
and
because
the
families
of
those
killed
in
the
2012
Benghazi
attack
deserve
answers
and
accountability,
I
am
glad
to
support
this
bill's
provisions
to
withhold
aid
to
government
of
Libya
until
they
cooperate
in
Benghazi
investigation.
