Rep. Bob Goodlatte
A Pro-Consumer, Pro-Competition Policy
Have you ever wanted to
switch wireless carriers, but keep the same phone? Or have you purchased a used phone recently and planned to activate it on a different wireless
network?
It seems like common sense to me. Consumers who have completed their phone contracts or have purchased a used phone should be able to
activate their device on their network of choice.
However, if you&rsquo;ve tried to do that in the last year, you know that this simple action is no
longer allowed under current law. But, that&rsquo;s about to change.
Just a few weeks ago, the United States House of Representatives and Senate both unanimously passed the
Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless
Competition Act , which I introduced last year. And President Obama recently
signed this legislation into law .
This pro-consumer, bipartisan legislation restores the ability of consumers to more easily transfer their
cell phones to other wireless carriers. Consumers are still subject to their contractual obligations. However, once these are met, this bill allows a
cell phone to be unlocked and switched to another carrier if that is what the consumer chooses. The legislation also directs the Librarian of Congress
to consider applying this option to tablets and other devices in the future.
Furthermore, restoring the ability to unlock
cell phones will help enhance competition between wireless carriers. Instead of stifling technological advances and consumer choice, our laws should
encourage innovation that will help drive the United States&rsquo; global competitiveness.
This flexibility and choice is something that Americans have been asking for. I have been working on this issue for many months
now, and I am pleased that Congress and the White House were able to work together to ensure the bill was passed and signed into law, allowing
consumers to unlock their cell phones. This is a simple, but important, fix to a real problem that consumers face today.
