E-Alert: Obamacare's Impact
What we're also discovering is that, you know, insurance is complicated to buy.
-President Obama, 11/14/2013
Rep. Wenstrup joined Larry Kudlow to discuss the troubled Obamacare rollout

Before being elected as your representative to Washington, I worked as a physician for over 25 years in Ohio and as an Army combat surgeon. Day in and day out, I cared for patients and dealt with insurance companies. I know full well the health care challenges that are before us, and I know that the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, fails to solve these challenges.
Losing Care, Losing Coverage
Years after Obamacare was passed through Congress on partisan lines, the nation
is seeing the harmful consequences of a poorly written law and an over intrusive government. Thats why I repeatedly voted to fully repeal the law and to delay the individual mandate.
36
times
President Obama promised
that "if you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance. period."
3,500,000
people have seen their
health insurance plans cancelled
because of provisions in Obamacare, and that number is still going up
Only
1,150
Ohioans
enrolled in Obamacare
through October. As a doctor, I would usually see more patients than that in just two months.
Up to
40%
percent of www.healthcare.gov
hasn't even been built yet !
And like millions of Americans, my staff and
I will be receiving our health care insurance through the Obamacare exchanges
starting January 1 st , just like the law prescribes.
Impact in Ohio
Every day, I am hearing from
Ohioans who are facing increasing uncertainty as their health care premiums go up. their plans are cancelled, or their doctors dropped, and www.healthcare.gov continues to only cause headaches and hassles. Across the country, millions are losing coverage. Here is just one example of the letters I have received from southern Ohioans:
My premiums are increasing from $316.21 a month to $866.65 a month, a 174% increase. My family doesn't qualify for any subsidies under the Affordable Care Act because our income is a little over the threshold. If the ACA is allowed to stand my family will have to come up with an extra $6,605.28 next year and we can't afford that.

If you or someone you know is having trouble with the Affordable Care Act, I want to know.

But we can't just dwell on the problems, Ohioans deserve solutions. That's why I am actively supporting a number of alternatives to Obamacare, including
H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act . Listen to the bill's author, Rep. Phil Roe, and me
talk about the legislation
with Brian Thomas on 55KRC this week.
Listen to Our Health Care Solution Here
H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, would:
Fully repeal President Obama's health care law
Spur competition to lower health care costs
Reform medical malpractice laws in a commonsense way
Provide tax reform that allows families and individuals to deduct health care costs
Expand access to Health Savings Accounts
Safeguard individuals with pre-existing conditions from being discriminated against
Protect the unborn by ensuring no federal funding of abortions.
Do you think Obamacare is fair for the average Ohioan?
