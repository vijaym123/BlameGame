Dear Friend,
Ever since
Citizens United
became the law of the land, two billionaire brothers have loomed large in American politics. Their names are Charles and David Koch, and thanks in part to the hundreds of millions of dollars they&rsquo;ve spent to influence our elections, we now run the risk of seeing our democracy become an auction. I&rsquo;m joining with some of my colleagues to support campaign finance reform and Koch-free elections. Click here to add your name to ours.
The Supreme Court made a grave error when its conservative majority ruled that corporations had the same rights to free speech as people. Corporations are not people -- period. And they shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as such.
But under
Citizens United , that&rsquo;s the law -- and thanks to that decision, the big oil billionaire Koch brothers saw a loophole they could exploit. They have spent untold millions trying to buy our elections, and they&rsquo;ve pledged to raise $290 million --
$290 million!
-- between now and election day. Our campaign finance system is broken, and it&rsquo;s allowing two billionaires to drown out the voices of the middle class. Stand with me and support campaign finance reform, because Americans deserve Koch-free elections.
Thank you.
