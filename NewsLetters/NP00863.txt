In case you missed it, I spoke on the House Floor this week in support of ending the NSAs bulk data collection practices and protecting Americans Fourth Amendment rights. You can watch
here , or by clicking the image below.
Americans across the country have called for the NSA to listen less, and elected officials to listen more . The USA Freedom Act will end the NSAs bulk collection program, which was established under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act , and will further protect Americans Fourth Amendment rights by strengthening oversight and accountability of the intelligence community. You can learn more about the bill,
here .
Striking this balance between safeguarding privacy and protecting Americans is a challenge in todays post-9/11 world, but it is one that should not tip towards allowing the government to trample on our constitutional rights.
Yours in service,
Randy
