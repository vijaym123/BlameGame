Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
This weekend, Sandy and I celebrated the marriage of our fourth son. We are happy to welcome Johns bride, Alyssa Bates, to our family. Her family has been featured on the TLC television series United Bates of America, and on the Duggar family show, 19 Kids and Counting. ABC Nightline News covered the wedding this weekend. John and Alyssa were married in Tennessee, but will be setting up their home in Lake County.

On Monday, I participated in the ribbon cutting for Harvest Power's Energy Garden that transforms organic waste into clean energy and natural fertilizers. Located in Lake Buena Vista, Harvest Power Orlando recycles organic waste by using it to generate power and to convert it into agricultural nutrients. I met the executives and employees and officially welcomed Harvest Power to Central Florida.
Free market innovation such as this is critical to our nation advancing a true all-of-the-above energy policy that utilizes all of our natural resources for the sake of our energy security and prosperity.

Our American heritage is inextricably linked to the sacrifice of the brave men and women who have given their lives to fight for and defend our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Today, on Memorial Day, we remember these heroes, express gratitude for their sacrifice, and celebrate the freedoms we enjoy because of their service to our country. It is with deep respect that we pause as a nation to honor the memory of those who have given the last full measure of devotion and made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Last year, my office assisted a constituent from Clermont with her VA claim from the Pension Management Center (PMC).
She recently contacted us again when her retro check failed to appear and her monthly benefits were suspended.
In following up, it was discovered that the check had been returned to PMC by the US Postal Service after being twice sent to the wrong address.
Shortly after providing the correct information and details to PMC, the constituent received the appropriate retro check and the monthly benefits were re-instated.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. It is unconscionable and completely unacceptable that the brave men and women who have put on the uniform and so faithfully served our country would be denied the timely, critical care and services we have promised to provide.
With growing evidence that the VA scandal, which has contributed directly to the death of dozens of veterans, has been ongoing for months if not years, do you believe the President of the United States is doing enough to hold VA personnel responsible for these deaths?
Yes
No

previous survey question,
"Recently, reports revealed that processing delays at a VA Hospital may have cost the lives of over 40 veterans. Do you believe that this is a serious problem that should be dealt with in the swiftest and harshest of terms?" Yes - 96%
No - 3%
I don't know - 1%
Legislative Update:
Human trafficking is one of the greatest tragedies of our time. Roughly 20 million children, women, and men are victimized around the world, including many within the United States. This week, the House of Representatives considered legislation to protect our most vulnerable and shine a harsh spotlight on those who engage in such evil.
In order to protect these victims, I co-sponsored several bills, including the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act to protect minors in the foster system from being ensnared by exploiters, the International Megans Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking, which establishes the Angel Watch Center to provide for the notification of international travel of sex offenders, and the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act that will eliminate advertising avenues that promote human trafficking.
Additional legislation encourages states to treat minors caught in sex trafficking as victims instead of criminals, implements grants programs that will deter human trafficking and support victims of trafficking, and promotes an international notification system of travel by convicted sex offenders.
As a modern-day form of slavery, human trafficking is a horrendous act that deserves the harshest of punishment. This week, I voted for legislation to support these victims, protect those who are most vulnerable among us, and end this heinous crime.
