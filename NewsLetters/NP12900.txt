Dear
friend,
Unfortunately, weve seen too many New Hampshire seniors
fall victim to fraud and scams. Thats why
last
week I hosted two forums
one in Manchester and another in Concord
along with officials from the Federal Trade Commission, the NH
Attorney Generals Office, the U.S. Postal Service Postal Inspection Service
and the U.S. Secret Service to discuss ways to protect seniors from
identity theft, credit card and loan fraud, and scam work-at-home and
business opportunities.
We have to do more to protect our
seniors from fraud and that starts with educating seniors on ways they
can avoid falling victim to these crimes. Just two weeks ago I
i ntroduced a bill that is designed to
safeguard seniors from some of the most common forms of health care
fraud
and this effort, along with others, represents exactly the
kind of common sense steps we ought to be taking to protect our
seniors.
This is also an issue, along with a host of others, that
Im looking forward to further discussing with Granite Staters next week
when Ill host my first telephone town hall of 2014. Telephone town
halls are a great way to connect with people across New Hampshire so I
hope youll join me at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, February 4th. If youd like
