Let The EPA Hear From You
Tuesday, March 25, 2014
Dear Friends
You are likely aware of the EPAs latest assault in its ongoing War on Coal, which essentially bans the construction of new coal-fired power plants in the United States.
These misguided EPA regulations, called New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), are so unrealistic that there is not a single coal-fired plant in the United States that would be allowed to be built today, even those that have the best available technology like the Virginia City Plant in St. Paul.
As President Obama admitted in 2008, the cost of these policies will be passed on to consumers.
Who are the consumers?
Theyre average, middle-class Americans working hard to try and make it in todays tough economy.
Sadly, government policies are making their lives harder.
The EPAs War on Coal is a war on our jobs, our energy, and our way of life.
At a time when many Americans are being forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, it is unacceptable for the EPA to hinder the use of coal and other domestic energy source, like natural gas.
Burdensome energy regulations have led to higher energy costs, which put a strain on working families and those on fixed incomes.
Higher electric prices also make it more expensive to manufacture goods in America.
When American goods are more expensive, they are less competitive in the global economy.
The bottom line is that American jobs are at stake as a result of federal regulations on coal, natural gas, and other domestic energy resources.
My four-point plan to turn around our current policies of hurting American energy production is called The Four Ds.
Drill .
Reducing our dependence on foreign oil means we must drill for our own domestic oil and natural gas.
Dig .
The United States has the largest coal reserves in the world.
I support proposals that encourage the United States to tap into its abundant and affordable domestic energy resources, including coal and natural gas.
Discover .
We can use our universities and think-tanks to find new energy sources and ways to use energy more efficiently.
Deregulate .
It is time for government to get out of the way and let private businesses use our domestic energy resources more freely.
The EPA needs to hear from hard working folks in Southwest Virginia.
