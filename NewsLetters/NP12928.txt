I just had the privilege
of watching President
Obamas State of the
Union address here at the
U.S. Capitol. And I wanted to
share with you a few of my
key takeaways from his
speech, while they are still
fresh in my mind.
First and foremost,
the state of our union is
strong and continues to grow
stronger.
Just a few
short years ago our nation
and the world were mired in
the worst recession since the
Great Depression. Today, our
economy is growing and
Americans are getting back to
work. But there is more we
need to do. During the course
of his speech, President
Obama touched on a number of
issues that will affect the
lives of Delawareans and all
Americans. Here are a few
topics that I was
particularly pleased to hear
him address:
Stemming the tide of
climate change-
The
effects of climate change,
specifically sea-level rise
and extreme weather events,
pose a unique and serious
threat to low lying,
coastal states like
Delaware. I am glad that
President Obama has renewed
his commitment to the
environment by urging a
multi-faceted and
common-sense approach to
our nations
environmental and energy
challenges to help us
reduce harmful pollutants,
lead healthier lives, lower
our energy costs, and help
put Americans to work.
Implementing the
Affordable Care
Act- Over the next
year, we must continue to
work to implement the law,
improving it where
necessary. In doing
so, we can help thousands
of Delawareans and millions
of Americans to get health
insurance while slowing the
growth of health care costs
and improving the quality
of care.
Adopting Comprehensive
Immigration Reform-
Last year, the Senate
passed a bipartisan
immigration reform deal. I
echo the Presidents
call that its time
for the House to follow the
Senates lead and
work toward passing an
immigration reform measure
that is effective, humane,
provides a path to
citizenship and improves
our nations economic
competitiveness while
safeguarding our
security.
The President and I share
an ambitious plan for 2014,
but
the only way for us to get
anything done here in
Congress is by doing what we
do every day in the First
State
by setting
aside our differences, coming
together and compromising for
the betterment of the
American people .
As always, I want to hear
your thoughts. Tell me about
your reaction to President
Obamas speech and what
you think our nation needs to
focus on over the next year.
