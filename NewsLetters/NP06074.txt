A Message from Congressman Paul Broun
It's Time to Audit the Fed
I am pleased to report that just last week, H.R. 24, my Audit the Fed bill, passed in the U.S. House with strong bipartisan support.This bill currently sits on Senator Harry Reid's desk among hundreds of other House-passed bills, awaiting consideration. In the past, the Senate Majority Leader has voiced his support for an audit of the Federal Reserve.
As recently as 2010
he stated,
"There should be a Federal Reserve audit. We haven't gotten it yet, but we've made some progress in that regard."
In 1995 , he enthusiastically called for an audit of the Federal Reserve on the U.S. Senate floor,
"I think we should audit the Federal Reserve. It's taxpayer's money that's being used there. But we don't do that."
Last Congress, Senator Reid stonewalled Dr. Ron Paul's "Audit the Fed" bill. Why his sudden change of heart, when the facts on the Fed remain the same? If anything, the Fed has proven to be a more powerful force today than it was 19 years ago. I urge citizens to flood Senator Reid's phone lines, call, and write their U.S. Senators, and tell them you want H.R. 24 to come to the Senate floor for a vote. It's up to the American people to hold Senator Reid accountable and remind him of his past support of the provisions found in H.R. 24. . ..read more
