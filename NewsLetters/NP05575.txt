Friends,
On Friday, more than 150 people
attended the Seventh District Economic Development Symposium to hear
key industry executives discuss why they located their businesses in
our community. Domtar, Ruiz Foods, PTR Industries, Harbor Freight
Tools, Beneteau, and AVM were represented at the meeting and gave an
overview of their current business operations. They shared with the group
how our districts low tax structure and high quality of life attracted
them to our area and encouraged them to expand in the Palmetto
State.
Beneteau USA, the worlds largest sailboat manufacturer for
boats 30 feet and larger and longtime Pee Dee Business Partner, said
that our communitys skilled workforce and economic partnerships make
doing business in our district enjoyable. PTR Industries, a gun
manufacturer that recently relocated its headquarters from the Northeast,
echoed Beneteaus remarks and noted that our districts business climate
and political climate make operating in South Carolina better for
their bottom line and their peace of mind.
The Symposium also
focused on how business and community leaders can work together to
encourage companies to relocate to the Palmetto State.
Here is a
picture from the event:
Constituent Spotlight
Last week, Sgt.
First Class David M. Smith, from Dillon, South Carolina, competed in the
2014 Department of the Army Best Warrior Competition at Fort Lee,
Virginia. This highly selective competition features 28 of our countrys
top soldiers and Sgt. First Class Smith has proven to be the toughest
of the tough.
Pictured below is Sgt. First Class Smith at the
competition. Congratulations to Sgt. First Class Smith and thank you for
your service!
Medicare Open Enrollment
Wednesday, October 15, is the first day of Medicare Open
Enrollment, which runs until December 7, 2014.
To review and
compare 2015 Medicare plans before the enrollment period begins, click
HERE.
Here are some
things to remember and consider during Fall Open
Enrollment:
If you decide to enroll in a plan or change your current
coverage, your new coverage starts January 1, 2015.
In
most cases, Fall Open Enrollment is the only time you can pick a new
Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan.
If you have
Medicare Advantage, you can also switch to Original Medicare. To get
Medicare drug coverage, you must join a stand-alone Part D plan at this
time.
A Medigap policy helps pay Original Medicare
costs.
To see if you are eligible to buy a Medigap policy during the
Fall Open Enrollment period or to view more information about
purchasing a Medigap policy, please click

American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Opens
Sadly, more than 4 million servicemen and women
return from war seriously injured and disabled for life.
While we
will never be able to thank them enough for the sacrifices they have made
for our country, we can ensure their service is remembered
forever.
After 15 years in the making, the National Park Service dedicated
the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in our nations
capital on Sunday, October 5.
The impressive memorial, pictured
below, features glass panels, bronze sculptures, stone inscriptions, a
reflecting pool, and a ceremonial flame.
I encourage you to watch
the highlight video below and to visit the memorial when visiting
Washington, D.C. For more information about this memorial, please click
