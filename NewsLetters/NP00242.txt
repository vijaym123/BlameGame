Building Support to Help Native Children Succeed
When I say we need to stand up with tribes to fight for Native American
children, it isn't just talk. Since serving as North Dakota's Attorney
General in the 1990s, I've been fighting and acting to give our Native
kids the opportunities they deserve. If I don't do anything to help
Native youth while I'm in the U.S. Senate, I'll consider my time here a
failure. Simply put, we all must come together to help change outcomes
for some of our country's most disadvantaged children.
Visiting with Native children at MHA Nation in April 2013.
Last week, the Senate unanimously passed
the first bill I introduced in the Senate -
with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska - to create a
Commission on Native Children. I'm beyond excited my bill is moving
forward. Named in part to honor my dear friend and former MHA Nation
Chairwoman Alyce Spotted Bear, the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter
Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act would aim to address the
stark challenges facing Native American children - such as high poverty
rates, unemployment, child abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse,
and few economic opportunities. The Commission would study the
programs, grants, and supports available to Native children, and
develop recommendations for creating a sustainable system that delivers
critical wrap-around services to make sure Native kids are getting the
best care.
All our kids deserve opportunities to succeed and thrive in life, but
far too often Native children get left behind:
*
More than a third of Native children live in poverty.
*
Only about half graduate from high school.
*
Suicide rates are 2.5 times the national average for Native
youth ages 15-24 years old.
But behind every statistic is a kid struggling to make something out of
his or her life, and wanting to believe they matter. That's why I'm
leading efforts to make sure our Native children understand they do
matter, and that they have the resources they need to grow into the
leaders of tomorrow.

improve the lives of Native children, and hear why each of us should
stand up to better support Native youth:
And this week we moved the ball even further, as my bill was introduced
in the House of Representatives by Democratic Congresswoman Betty
McCollum from Minnesota and Republican Congressman Tom Cole from
Oklahoma. Congressman Cole introduced the bill in the House last
Congress, and I can't thank him and Congresswoman McCollum enough for
their support in leading this effort. I look forward to the bill moving
quickly with strong, bipartisan support.
By working together, we can make a real difference in the lives of
Native children. Let's carry this momentum forward.

Building
Support
to
Help
Native
Children
Succeed
When
I
say
we
need
to
stand
up
with
tribes
to fight
for
Native
American
children,
it
isn't
just
talk.
Since
serving
as
North
Dakota's
Attorney
General
in
the
1990s,
I've
been
fighting
and
acting
to
give
our
Native
kids
the
opportunities
they
deserve.
If
I
don't
do
anything
to
help
Native
youth
while
I'm
in
the
U.S.
Senate,
I'll
consider
my
time
here
a
failure.
Simply
put,
we
all
must
come
together
to
help
change
outcomes
for
some
of
our
country's
most
disadvantaged
children.
Visiting
with
Native
children
at
MHA
Nation
in
April
2013.
Last
week,
the
Senate
unanimously
passed
the
first
bill
I
introduced
in
the
Senate
-
with
Republican
Senator
Lisa
Murkowski
from
Alaska
-
to
create
a
Commission
on
Native
Children.
I'm
beyond
excited
my
bill
is
moving
forward.
Named
in
part
to
honor
my
dear
friend
and
former
MHA
Nation
Chairwoman
Alyce
Spotted
Bear,
the
Alyce
Spotted
Bear
and
Walter
Soboleff
Commission
on
Native
Children
Act
would
aim
to
address
the
stark
challenges
facing
Native
American
children
-
such
as
high
poverty
rates,
unemployment,
child
abuse,
domestic
violence,
substance
abuse,
and
few
economic
opportunities.
The
Commission
would
study
the
programs,
grants,
and
supports
available
to
Native
children,
and
develop
recommendations
for
creating
a
sustainable
system
that
delivers
critical
wrap-around
services
to
make
sure
Native
kids
are
getting
the
best
care.
All
our
kids
deserve
opportunities
to
succeed
and
thrive
in
life,
but
far
too
often
Native
children
get
left
behind: More
than
a
third
of
Native
children
live
in
poverty. Only
about
half
graduate
from
high
school. Suicide
rates
are
2.5
times
the
national
average
for
Native
youth
ages
15-24
years
old.
But
behind
every
statistic
is
a
kid
struggling
to
make
something
out
of
his
or
her
life,
and
wanting
to
believe
they
matter.
That's
why
I'm
leading
efforts
to
make
sure
our
Native
children
understand
they
do
matter,
and
that
they
have
the
resources
they
need
to
grow
into
the
leaders
of
tomorrow.

Congressman
Cole
introduced
the

in
the
House
last
Congress,
and
I
can't
thank
him
and
Congresswoman
McCollum
enough
for
their
support
in
leading
this
effort.
I
look
forward
to
the
bill
moving
quickly
with
strong,
bipartisan
support.
By
working
together,
we
can
make
a
real
difference
in
the
lives
of
Native
children.
Let's
carry
this

forward.
