September 10, 2014
On September 30, 2014, the
funding authorizations to enable the federal government to continue
operating will end. Later this week, the House of Representatives is
expected to vote on legislation that would both reauthorize current funding
levels through December 11, 2014 and reauthorize the Export-Import
bank through June 2015.
As your Representative, I want your feedback
before this vote comes to the floor.
