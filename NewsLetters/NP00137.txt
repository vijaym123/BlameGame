Dear Neighbor,
All of us at some point may be in need of
help with a federal agency. I know it can sometimes be difficult to
navigate the maze of the federal government or to determine the correct
person or agency to contact to help you with your federal issue.
Please know, my office is always available to help you with many of these
issues.
We often assist constituents
with:
Veterans Affairs
Social Security
Benefits
IRS Matters
Medicare Issues
TRICARE
Benefits
Visas and Immigration
Passports for Emergency
Travel
Security Clearances
Service Academy
Nominations
Flag and Capitol Tour
Requests
Over the past six years we have recouped $8.5 million in one-time or
retroactive benefits due to residents of the 11 th
District
and more than $4 million per year in annual recurring benefits,
including nearly $3 million dollars in benefits owed to our veterans and
their families.
Here are just a few of the recent constituent
cases we were able to help resolve.
Solving a problem with
TRICARE
Ranelle Nadeu needed assitance with
TRICARE.
Ranelle Nadeaus doctor contacted TRICARE for
authorization for her hip surgery and was told that pre-authorization
wasnt needed. After her surgery, Mrs. Nadeaus TRICARE claim was
denied. She contacted us for assistance, and we worked with Mrs. Nadeau to
appeal the decision. Our office corresponded for months with TRICARE
until the claim was finally paid.
Providing
Assistance with Medicare
Jeffrey Schulman
requested assistance with a Medicare
issue.
Mr. Jeffrey Schulman received a bill for Medicare
Part B premiums that included 4 months of billings before he was even
eligible to enroll in the program. He contacted Medicare to fix the
problem, but instead of correcting the bill, Medicare cancelled his Part
B coverage. Mr. Schulman contacted our office for help and we were
able to get the billing error corrected and his coverage
restored.
Resolving a Problem with the
IRS
Mrs. Zeizel asked our office for assistance in contacting the
IRS.
Due to illness,
Mrs. Zeizels husband needed to retire from the federal government.
Before the government completed the retirement paperwork, Mr. and Mrs.
Zeizel needed to make withdrawals from his retirement accounts to pay
bills. This created a significant tax liability. In good faith, the
Zeizels tried to negotiate a payment plan with the IRS. The agency
intended to reject the plan because it had incorrect figures for the
couples income and assets. Our office helped correct the IRS figures, and
the payment plan was approved.
