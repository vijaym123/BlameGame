Dear
friends,
On Thanksgiving, we gather with friends and family and give thanks for
the many blessings we enjoy.
As a country, we have many things
to be thankful for, including the Constitutional freedoms our Creator
bestowed upon us, passed down from generation to generation, right
through the present day.
Every American has the right to freedom of
speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, the right to vote
and participate in our democracy, among many others.
These
freedoms are scarce in many parts of the world today and have been rare
throughout most of history.
We are also blessed to live in a country
that inspires brave men and women to voluntarily serve their country
in uniform and risk their lives to protect us.
We must never
forget their sacrifices.
The first Thanksgiving was celebrated
by the pilgrims in 1621 after their first harvest in the New
World.
The pilgrims had emigrated from England to escape religious
persecution.
But, upon coming here, they suffered incredible
hardship.
Nearly half of the original 102 passengers died during the
first winter.
By November 1621, only 53 pilgrims were still
alive.
But after their first harvest, they still took time to honor God
with a three-day observance of
Thanksgiving.
The pilgrims celebrated the harvest with 90 Native Americans who helped
them survive during their first winter.
One of the most
celebrated natives was a Wampanoag who the settlers called Squanto. He taught
the pilgrims where to fish and hunt and where to plant New World crops
like corn and squash.
He also helped negotiate a treaty between
the pilgrims and chief Massasoit.
The pilgrims survived
the next winter.
And, in time, they prospered.
Their
settlement inspired others to come to the New World and start a new
life.
John Winthrop, one of the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony,
said in 1630: We shall be a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people
are upon us, so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this
workwe shall be made a story and a byword throughout the
world.
Our Founder Fathers were inspired by these pioneers and their
incredible courage.
Even during the most harrowing days of the
Revolutionary War, they never forgot God, nor His blessings.
In
1777, George Washington proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving, and during his
first year as President, he proclaimed the first official Thanksgiving
Day.
Its purpose, said Washington, was to unite in rendering
unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection
of the people of this country.
The Founders recognized the
sacrifices made by the pilgrims, just as we remember the sacrifices
made by our Founders.
We follow their example by gathering at
this time of year to remember and give thanks for our
blessings.
President Reagan once said he thought of America as a place
in the divine scheme of things that was set aside as a promised
land.
I agree.
I have no doubt that America is close to Gods
heart because our heart is close to Him.
I am grateful to live in
this wonderful country with all of its blessings.
It is my
prayer that we will always be grateful and that we never forget to give
thanks.
I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving and pray
that God will continue to bless the United States of
America.
