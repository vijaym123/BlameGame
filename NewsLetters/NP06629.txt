Discussing the IRS Cover-Up on Fox
News
This past Wednesday, I joined Eric Shawn on Fox News'
America's Newsroom to discuss the latest revelations in the ongoing
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal. The more questions my
colleagues and I on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ask,
the more it becomes clear that a systematic cover up took place at the
IRS. This past week, it came to light that Lois Lerner's BlackBerry,
which likely contained communications pertinent to the investigation,
was deliberately destroyed after the congressional inquiry began. I will
continue to demand answers from the IRS until those involved are held
accountable for their abuse of power.

Standing Up for Student Workers and
Universities
Recently I penned an op-ed for the Asheville Citizen-Times about my
new bill, the Student Worker Exemption Act, H.R. 5262, which will
exempt student workers from the Employer Mandate in the President's
healthcare law. Under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), colleges
and universities will soon be required to provide health insurance for
student employees who work more than 30 hours a week for 3 months or
more, including summer breaks. Due to this new requirement, many schools
will be forced to cut student jobs. At a time when tuition costs are
on the rise and student loan debt nationally is at $1.08 trillion,
student workers cannot afford to lose hours and possibly jobs. Read more
about my bill

Visiting with Local
Industry
Touring Vulcan's Enka
Quary
Last week, I toured Vulcan's Enka Quarry. Vulcan Materials
Company is the nations largest producer of construction aggregates
primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel. While meeting with Vulcan's
team, they emphasized prioritizing safety and their commitment to
environmentally-friendly practices. It was a pleasure to meet with staff and
management, as well as business and community leaders who joined us
for the tour.
Meeting with Haywood County
Farmers
Congressman Meadows, Skipper Russell, and
Debbie Meadows
I
had the pleasure of
meeting with Haywood County farmers Skipper Russell, Carroll Burris and
Jeremy King earlier this week. Farming is truly part of the backbone
of Western North Carolina's economy. I'm grateful for the contribution
of these farmers to our community.
Spending Time in the
District
I was happy to do the coin toss for the
Pisgah High School v. North Buncombe High School football game last
Friday week. What better way to spend a summer evening than enjoying
football in your local community!
County fairs are always a highlight of the summertime in North Carolina.
Recently, my wife and I enjoyed spending some time at the Haywood
County Fair. While walking through the livestock area I had the chance to
meet Zachary and his reserve grand champion lamb. Congratulations,
Zachary!
