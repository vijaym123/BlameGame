ISSUES AND LEGISLATION
November 16, 2014
Its Time To Build The
Keystone XL Pipeline :
This week, the House voted on legislation
to approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Five years and
five environmental impact studies later, it is past time to approve this
shovel-ready project. The House knows that if you build it jobs,
energy independence, and lower energy costs will come. Hopefully the
President will finally understand there is no more stalling and its time
to build.
Honored to Serve As House Republican
Conference Vice Chair :
This week, I was reelected to
Vice Chair of the House Republican Conference by my colleagues in the
House of Representatives. I am honored to continue to serve as Vice Chair
for the next two years, as they are pivotal if we hope to turn this
country around. With our experienced House leadership team finally able
to work in partnership with a new Senate majority, I am confident
Congress will be able to pass critical legislation and place those
policies on the Presidents desk. Our solutions will seek to empower all
Americans and help everyone get ahead and achieve a better life.
Instead of operating alone, via executive fiat and vetoes, we are
hopeful President Obama will partner with us in our efforts to move our
nation forward.
From the very first time I ran for office I
have believed you learn more by listening than talking. My first priority
remains listening to Kansans each and every day to ensure their
voices are heard at the leadership table in
Congress.
Upcoming Medicare Enrollment Teletown
Hall :
Next Friday, November 21, 2014, I will host a Medicare Open Enrollment
Tele-Townhall for constituents in the 2nd District. Folks will be able
to discuss Medicare open enrollment questions and other Medicare
concerns with a health insurance specialist from the Center for Medicare
&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).
The Medicare open
enrollment season started on October 15th and runs through December 7th.
The goal of this phone call will be to address questions related to
changes in Medicare plans and seniors enrollment options. My office
will be placing outbound calls to seniors throughout Eastern Kansas, but
if you are a 2nd District Kansas senior and would like to participate
please call (877) 229-8493 and use this pin code: 13996 to join us

You Simply Cant Win With the
Presidents Healthcare Law :
This week, a number of
troubling articles came out concerning broken promises and failings of
the Presidents healthcare law.
A report from the
Washington Post
showed MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber, a
principal architect of the Presidents Health Care law, admitting the
law was crafted to deliberately deceive and manipulate the American
public.
In the video, Gruber says: Lack of transparency is a huge
political advantage...Basically, call it the stupidity of the
American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to
getting the thing to pass.
Meanwhile, the Wall Street
Journal came out with an eye-opening graphic in their article,
Surprises Lurk for People Re-Enrolling on
Healthcare.gov .
While open enrollment starts on Saturday, the Obama
Administration is now just advising folks to shop around again for a new plan.
However, with plans likely to increase by an average of 13% in Kansas,
the Wall Street Journal writes, In a twist, an influx of lower-priced
health plans on
HealthCare.gov
could lead many Americans to pay more for coverage next year
thanks to smaller insurance tax credits.
You simply cant
win with this law. Either your insurance is more expensive because of
a higher premium, or your insurance is more expensive because your
tax subsidy wont be as generous.
Honoring
Kansas Heroes :
This week, we recognized all those who have
served and sacrificed for our freedom. Thank you to all of our veterans
and to the active duty military personnel who are currently keeping
watch over our homeland. It was great to have the opportunity to speak
with veterans at the annual Veterans Day Parades in Leavenworth and
Holton, Kansas.
I want to also thank everyone who submitted
photos of Kansas veterans and for sharing their personal stories. I
encourage you all to look at my Honoring Kansas Veterans album on my
official Facebook page
to see some of the faces of
the brave men and women who served.
