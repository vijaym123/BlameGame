I recently joined U.S. Representative Glenn GT Thompson (PA-5), Co-Chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Career &amp; Technical Education (CTE) Caucus, at a field hearing in Harrisburg to discuss The Role of Career &amp; Technical Education in Creating a Skilled Workforce: Perspectives from Employers and Stakeholders.
We were joined by Pennsylvania State Senator John Blake (PA-22) and U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (PA-3). The Caucus received witness testimony from education and workforce advocates and representatives from a range of private industries and employment sectors.

As a graduate of the Cumberland Perry Area Vocational Technical School, I know firsthand the value of technical education. It's frustrating that at the same time millions of Americans remain unemployed, about 600,000 manufacturing jobs remain unfilled in the United States. Congress tackled this issue with a strong job training bill this year, but strengthening technical education will build on these efforts to grow our skilled workforce and improve economic opportunities for our citizens.
Earlier this year, the U.S. House passed legislation to help modernize and improve our nations workforce development system and help put Americans back to work. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803) reforms federal workforce training programs by: eliminating 15 duplicative programs, applying a single set of outcome metrics to federal workforce programs, aligning workforce development programs with local economic development and education initiatives, and enabling businesses to identify in-demand skills and connect workers with the opportunities to build those skills. H.R. 803 was first adopted by the U.S. House in March 2013 as the SKILLS Act. H.R. 803 was signed into law by President Obama.
These bills continue efforts in the U.S. House to lay the groundwork for a stronger economy and increased opportunities for all Americans. Legislation already passed by the House would: strengthen our water transportation networks; embrace American energy resources; lift barriers to clean renewable energy; give working families more flexibility and increase oversight of expensive federal regulations. Most of these bills remain stuck in the U.S. Senate.
Throughout the 113th Congress, House members have put their cards on the table and sent hundreds of bills to the Senate, waiting for them to pass their own versions so we eventually could come together to try and find some common ground. These proposals largely have been met with silence by the Senate and President Obama. Examples of jobs bills passed by the U.S. House may be reviewed here: http://www.speaker.gov/jobs.
Recently enjoyed a great tour of HealthSouth-Mechanicsburg.
Enjoyed my visit with the Student Wellness Team at South Eastern Middle School West in Fawn Grove to discuss healthy eating.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
