Pushing to Raise the Minimum Wage
Dear Friends,
Too many Pennsylvanians have been left out of our economic recovery,
despite the fact that they are working hard every day to build a more
stable and secure future for themselves and their families. That is why
I am fighting for a long-overdue increase in the federal minimum wage.
This week, I was proud to sign a petition
to force House Republican leaders to hold a vote on legislation I am
cosponsoring to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25.
This bill will give our recovery a much-needed boost, lift nearly 1
million Americans out of poverty and create more economic opportunity
for Pennsylvania families.
The bill, known as the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010), would
increase the minimum wage in three increments of 95 cents over two
years. The legislation would provide for annual increases in future
years to keep pace with the rising cost of living. It also would raise
the current hourly minimum wage of $2.13 for tipped employees gradually
until it is 70 percent of the federal minimum wage.
In Pennsylvania, a higher minimum wage would directly impact more than
700,000 workers, boost wages by over $1 billion and add thousands of
jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute
. It will also
help small businesses in our communities grow by putting money in the
pockets of Pennsylvania's consumers.
I commend President Obama for signing an executive order this month
that requires federal contractors to begin paying their employees a
minimum of $10.10 per hour. I will continue pushing Congress to do the
right thing by giving millions of other hard-working Americans a raise.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Pushing
to
Raise
the
Minimum
Wage
Dear
Friends,
Too
many
Pennsylvanians
have
been
left
out
of
our
economic
recovery,
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
working
hard
every
day
to
build
a
more
stable
and
secure
future
for
themselves
and
their
families.
That
is
why
I
am
fighting
for
a
long-overdue
increase
in
the
federal
minimum
wage.
This
week,
I
was
proud
to
sign
a
petition
to
force
House
Republican
leaders
to
hold
a
vote
on
legislation
I
am
cosponsoring
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
per
hour
from
$7.25.
This
bill
will
give
our
recovery
a
much-needed
boost,
lift
nearly
1
million
Americans
out
of
poverty
and
create
more
economic
opportunity
for
Pennsylvania
families.
The
bill,
known
as
the
Fair
Minimum
Wage
Act
(H.R.
1010),
would
increase
the
minimum
wage
in
three
increments
of
95
cents
over
two
years.
The
legislation
would
provide
for
annual
increases
in
future
years
to
keep

with
the
rising
cost
of

It
also
would
raise
the
current
hourly
minimum
wage
of
$2.13
for
tipped
employees
gradually
until
it
is
70
percent
of
the
federal
minimum
wage.
In
Pennsylvania,
a
higher
minimum
wage
would
directly
impact
more
than
700,000
workers,
boost
wages
by
over
$1
billion
and
add
thousands
of
jobs,
according
to
the
Economic
Policy
Institute .
It
will
also

small

by
