Giving
Thanks
Our modern, national celebration of Thanksgiving can be
attributed to the efforts of Sarah Josepha Hale, a woman who became a
widow in her 30s and wore black the rest of her life to outwardly
demonstrate the loss she continued to mourn.
I think that is a good
place to start with a review of what it really means to have a Happy
Thanksgiving.
Ms. Hale grew
up in New England, where an annual festival of thanksgiving was
regionally celebrated.
This tradition followed in the lead of the
Pilgrim Fathers and Founding Fathers.
We know about the feast of
1621.
Fewer may be aware that presidents Washington, Adams and
Madison all designated days of thanksgiving for the new nation, but it
lacked permanence and such declarations were at the whim of the
office-holder.
For the most part, the idea of setting aside a day every
year to thank God for the bounty and blessing He provided remained a
practice of the northern states.
Following the death of her husband, Ms. Hale became a very influential
voice in American 19 th
century life as the editor
of
Godeys Ladys Book .
It was with this platform that
she began her personal crusade to see Thanksgiving become a
nationally-recognized celebration.
It took many years and Ms. Hale
engaged a number of presidents before her entreaty to President Lincoln two
months after the Battle of Gettysburg achieved a result.
In the
midst of a bloody war and six days after Ms. Hale wrote to him,
President Lincoln encouraged all U.S. citizens to set aside the last
Thursday in November as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent
Father who dwelleth in the heavens.
Our day of thanksgiving was
born in our nations darkest hours and was championed by a woman who
suffered a tragic loss, and President Johnson followed Lincoln
and continued the annual practice.
Congress ultimately designated
Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1870, and in 1941 set the
official date of Thanksgiving as the fourth
Thursday
of
November.
Thanksgiving allows us to take time to stop
and appreciate the acts of divine providence in our lives.
There should certainly be joyful celebration
the Pilgrims feast
lasted t hree
days
but I encourage all Arkansans to make it
about more than just turkey, football and Black
Friday
shopping.
Remember
the genesis of this day and those who celebrated it before.
Happiness for them was demonstrated with an attitude of gratitude.
As my family thanks God for the blessings He has given us, I encourage
you and yours to do the same.
Happy Thanksgiving!
From the
Front...

Enter his gates with
thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his
name.

These statistics are nothing to yawn
about:

4 th
nationally in turkey
production
- Arkansas accounts for 8% of
total turkey cash receipts in the U.S.
- Turkeys rank among the Top 10 commodities produced in
Arkansas (the birds are #8
behind chicken eggs and before
wheat)
