Wyoming Can Make America an Energy All-Star
Dear Friends,
Wyoming has an abundant supply of natural gas and is poised to help America be a major player in the international gas market. And this week we in the House passed
H.R. 351:
the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act
with a bipartisan vote of 277-133. This bill would expedite the approval process for liquefied natural gas export terminals and cut unnecessary red tape that has held up construction.
With a more efficient exports approval process, we can help reverse declining gas production in Wyoming by opening up international markets for Wyoming gas produced by Wyoming workers.
This landmark economic and national security opportunity would create jobs, grow our economy, and give our allies a secure supply of energy.
Despite all these benefits, the only action I have seen on the part of the White House is pointless stonewalling.
With this bill we can overcome what I see as the Presidents inaction, grow jobs in Wyoming, and make America a sure bet in the international gas market.
Please let me know your
thoughts and concerns
on these or other issues as we work to expand Wyomings energy markets.
Sincerely,
