Friends,
Obamacare enrollment began one year ago today.
The result - from the broken website to the broken promises - was a disaster for millions of American families.
Every day, I hear from Georgians who want protection from Obamacare.
My Defund Obamacare Act passed the House last year and I have continued to fight.
Sadly, with President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid unwilling to face reality, the damage from Obamacare continues to spread.
This fall, many people - maybe even some reading this email right now - will be summoned to employee meetings where they'll be told
their
health plan is in violation of the law.
Many will face higher out of pocket costs or be forced to find new doctors.
To avert the next wave of plan cancellations, House Republicans
passed a bill
to allow American workers to keep their current health plans. We also acted last year to protect those on the individual insurance market.
With all the major issues happening in the world today, many Americans stuck in the chaos of Obamacare might feel forgotten. If that's you, please know
you are not alone.
I hear you, and
we will continue the fight
to repeal Obamacare and enact patient-centered reforms.
Freedom First,
Rep. Graves, House GOP Pass Major Plans For Jobs And Energy
In September, Rep. Graves supported two important bills that would give a major boost to jobs and the family budget.
The first, a jobs plan, would contain and reduce excessive taxes and regulations, give small businesses space to grow, and enhance opportunities for veterans, among many other provisions. ( Click here

The energy plan aims to increase production in America, create the next generation of energy jobs, and keep the cost of gas and utilities down. A big part of the plan is blocking EPA overreach. ( Click here
