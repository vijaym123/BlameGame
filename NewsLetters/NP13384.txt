Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
In keeping with the purpose of Rokita Readings, I wanted to share with
you a passage from the Gospel of Luke given that this is the Christmas
Day issue of the Rokita Report.
Whether you are a Christian, practice another faith, or practice no
faith at all, the events detailed in this passage are extremely
significant because whether you find it spiritual, historical,
anthropological or otherwise - this particular passage describes an
event that changed our world forever.
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
Luke 2:1-20 New King James Version
Christ Born of Mary
2:1 And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from
Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
2 This census
first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
3 So all went to
be registered, everyone to his own city.
4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was
of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his
betrothed wife, who was with child.
6 So it was, that while they were
there, the days were completed for her to be delivered.
7 And she
brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths,
and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Glory in the Highest
8 Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the
fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.
9 And behold, an
angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone
around them, and they were greatly afraid.
10 Then the angel said to
them, "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy which will be to all people.
11 For there is born to you this day
in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
12 And this
will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling
cloths, lying in a manger."
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God and saying:
14 "Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward
men!"
15 So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that
the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go to Bethlehem and see
this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."
16 And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe
lying in a manger.
17 Now when they had seen Him, they made widely
known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
18 And all
those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the
shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her
heart.
20 Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.

Seasons Greetings from the Rokita Family
Every year, we get such a thrill out of contact with our family,
friends, colleagues, and constituents during the holidays.
We are
thankful to have you all in our lives.
2014 has been a great year for
the Rokitas, particularly our two sons.
Teddy continues to make great
strides and continually surprises us with his hard work and progress
every day.
Ryan is a good little brother and has developed into a very
independent and strong willed little boy.
Their laughs and hugs remind
us just how blessed we are to have them.
Kathy, the boys and I wish
you a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
Amidst all the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, I hope you were
able to spend time with family and friends, and reflect on the true
meaning of the season.
God Bless,
Todd, Kathy, Teddy, and Ryan Rokita

Merry

Luke
2:1-20 New
King
James
Version
Christ
Born
of
Mary
2:1
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
a
decree
went
out
from
Caesar
Augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
registered.
2
This
census
first
took
place
while
Quirinius
was
governing
Syria.
3
So
all
went
to
be
registered,
everyone
to
his
own
city.
4
Joseph
also
went
up
from
Galilee,
out
of
the
city
of
Nazareth,
into
Judea,
to
the
city
of
David,
which
is
called
Bethlehem,
because
he
was
of
the
house
and
lineage
of
David,
5
to
be
registered
with
Mary,
his
betrothed
wife,
who
was
with
child.
6
So
it
was,
that
while
they
were
there,
the
days
were
completed
for
her
to
be
delivered.
7
And
she
brought
forth
her
firstborn
Son,
and
wrapped
Him
in
swaddling
cloths,
and
laid
Him
in
a
manger,
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
inn.
Glory
in
the
Highest
8
Now
there
were
in
the
same
country
shepherds
living
out
in
the
fields,
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night.
9
And
behold,
an
angel
of
the
Lord
stood
before
them,
and
the
glory
of
the
Lord
shone
around
them,
and
they
were
greatly
afraid.
1 0
Then
the
angel
said
to
them,
&#8220;Do
not
be
afraid,
for
behold,
I
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy
which
will
be
to
all
people.
11
For
there
is
born
to
you
this
day
in
the
city
of
David
a
Savior,
who
is
Christ
the
Lord.
12
And
this
will
be
the
sign
to
you:
You
will
find
a
Babe
wrapped
in
swaddling
cloths,
lying
in
a
manger.&#8221;
13
And
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
God
and
saying:
14
&#8220;Glory
to
God
in
the
highest, And
on
earth
peace,
goodwill
toward
men!&#8221;
15
So
it
was,
when
the
angels
had
gone
away
from
them
into
heaven,
that
the
shepherds
said
to
one
another,
&#8220;Let
us
now
go
to
Bethlehem
and
see
this
thing
that
has
come
to
pass,
which
the
Lord
has
made
known
to
us.&#8221;
16
And
they
came
with
haste
and
found
Mary
and
Joseph,
and
the
Babe
lying
in
a
manger.
1 7
Now
when
they
had
seen
Him,
they
made
widely
known
the
saying
which
was
told
them
concerning
this
Child.
18
And
all
those
who
heard
it
marveled
at
those
things
which
were
told
them
by
the
shepherds.
19
But
Mary
kept
all
these
things
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart.
20
Then
the
shepherds
returned,
glorifying
and
praising
God
for
all
the
things
that
they
had
heard
and
seen,
as
it
was
told
them.
