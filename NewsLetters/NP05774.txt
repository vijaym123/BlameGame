BREAKING: Supreme Court Clears Way for Gay Marriage in 5 States
News just broke that the Supreme Court denied review for all five pending same-sex marriage cases. That means the way is cleared for marriage equality in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
This is a HUGE victory for equality! And we can't think of a better reason to celebrate. So, we're giving away free
I &lt;3 EQUALITY
bumper stickers to our best supporters. After all, it&rsquo;s thanks to grassroots supporters like you that marriage equality can enjoy this much success!
According to the
New York Times , "The move will almost immediately increase the number of states allowing same-sex marriage from 19 to 24, along with the District of Columbia."
Now, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until everyone in American can marry who they love. Let&rsquo;s keep this going! https://action.dccc.org/equality-sticker-2014
