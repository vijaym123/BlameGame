Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
The nation's labor participation rate is the lowest it's been in 36
years-more than 91 million unemployed Americans have given up on
looking for work. This Administration's policies have killed jobs and
contributed to the nation's growing income disparity by driving down
the number of hours in the workweek, reducing net take home pay and
increasing health care costs for many families, and stunting small
business growth through unpredictable and punitive regulations.
This has perhaps been felt the most in rural America, where as I've
traveled through my district I've heard countless stories on how the
costs of basic services like health care are higher, incomes are lower,
and federal regulations have restricted many people from earning a
living off the land as their families have done for generations. The
President needs to understand that these individuals aren't looking for
more government-they want the opportunities they once had to put in a
day's work and earn a paycheck. They want the federal government to get
out of the way.
While I welcome the President's call in his State of the Union Address
for a year of action on the economy, it remains to be seen what form
that will take. Circumventing Congress through a series of executive
fiats to entrench already failed economic policies and further expand
government is not the answer to encouraging growth, creating jobs, and
shrinking the income disparity. It's disingenuous for the President to
say in one breath that he's willing to work with us, and then in the
next that he will avoid Congress if he can-as he has already by
unilaterally acting to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors.
The way forward must include a willingness to come to the table and
work together to advance legislation to improve the economy and foster
a federal government that is responsive, transparent, and accountable
to the people. We stand ready to work with the President to bring about
a reduction in the nation's income disparity by creating opportunities
and jobs in the private sector, providing accessible and affordable
health care, and restoring the 40 hour workweek so that families can
have a fighting chance to succeed and attain the American Dream.
I will continue to fight for the 3rd District and strive to represent
your voice in Washington. Please contact me or my office anytime with
your thoughts and ideas, or let us know if we can assist you in dealing
with a federal agency.
Thank you, and go Broncos!
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
The
nation&#8217;s
labor
participation
rate
is
the
lowest
it&#8217;s
been
in
36
years&#8212;more
than
91
million
unemployed
Americans
have
given
up
on
looking
for
work.
This
Administration&#8217;s
policies
have
killed
jobs
and
contributed
to
the
nation&#8217;s
growing
income
disparity
by
driving
down
the
number
of
hours
in
the
workweek,
reducing
net
take
home
pay
and
increasing
health
care
costs
for
many
families,
and
stunting
small
business
growth
through
unpredictable
and
punitive
regulations.
This
has
perhaps
been
felt
the
most
in
rural
America,
where
as
I&#8217;ve
traveled
through
my
district
I&#8217;ve
heard
countless
stories
on
how
the
costs
of
basic
services
like
health
care
are
higher,
incomes
are
lower,
and
federal
regulations
have
restricted
many
people
from
earning
a
living
off
the
land
as
their
families
have
done
for
generations.
The
President
needs
to
understand
that
these
individuals
aren&#8217;t
looking
for
more
government&#8212;they
want
the
opportunities
they
once
had
to
put
in
a
day&#8217;s
work
and
earn
a
paycheck.
They
want
the
federal
government
to
get
out
of
the
way.
While
I
welcome
the
President&#8217;s
call
in
his
State
of
the
Union
Address
for
a
year
of
action
on
the
economy,
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
form
that
will
take.
Circumventing
Congress
through
a
series
of
executive
fiats
to
entrench
already
failed
economic
policies
and
further
expand
government
is
not
the
answer
to
encouraging
growth,
creating
jobs,
and
shrinking
the
income
disparity.
It&#8217;s
disingenuous
for
the
President
to
say
in
one
breath
that
he&#8217;s
willing
to
work
with
us,
and
then
in
the
next
that
he
will
avoid
Congress
if
he
can&#8212;as
he
has
already
by
unilaterally
acting
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
for
federal
contractors.
The
way
forward
must
include
a
willingness
to
come
to
the
table
and
work
together
to
advance
legislation
to
improve
the
economy
and
foster
a
federal
government
that
is
responsive,
transparent,
and
accountable
to
the
people.
We
stand
ready
to
work
with
the
President
to
bring
about
a
reduction
in
the
nation&#8217;s
income
disparity
by
creating
opportunities
and
jobs
in
the
private
sector,
providing
accessible
and
affordable
health
care,
and
restoring
the
40
hour
workweek
so
that
families
can
have
a
fighting
chance
to
succeed
and
attain
the
American
Dream.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
the
3rd
District
and
strive
to
represent
your
voice
in
Washington.
Please
contact
me
or

anytime
with
your
thoughts
and
ideas,
or
let
us
know
if
we
can
assist
you

you,
and
