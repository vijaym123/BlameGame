I hate to keep emailing you, but this is so urgent that I really don&rsquo;t have a choice: President Obama is under attack and we are in desperate need of your grassroots support.
As of the House GOP hearing this week, Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit against President Obama is going full speed ahead. It&rsquo;s critical that we respond now with an outpouring of grassroots power. Otherwise we might as well throw in the towel for the remainder of his presidency.
David, we are only 2,105 away from hitting 200,000 donations since Boehner announced his lawsuit. If we don&rsquo;t have a massive flood of support today to get us there:
BOEHNER WINS.
We have to hit this goal to show Boehner what a horrible mistake he made when he decided to waste YOUR tax payer money on suing the President. Will you chip in $5 or more right now to get us over the top? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
