Keystone: Key to Growing the Economy
Dear Friends,
The Keystone XL pipeline has met all the requirements this administration has demanded and more.
Today we in the U.S. House passed a bill approving the pipeline and the Senate is expected to take up similar legislation next week.
This means the President could have the bill on his desk ready for signing even before Thanksgiving.
I call on the Senate to pass the bill and I call on the President to sign it.
There is no reason not to approve this pipeline.
It would strengthen our energy security, boost local economies, and create a lasting economic ripple effect throughout the country. The pipeline has even been approved by President Obamas own State Department.
Its time for current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the President to get out of the way and let construction start.
I will continue fighting and working to grow our economy and free up the jobs and opportunities tied down by regulation. Please feel free to
contact me
with your thoughts and concerns.
Sincerely,
This mailbox is unattended.
