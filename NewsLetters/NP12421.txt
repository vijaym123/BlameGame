Propane Shortage Update
[http://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pro3.jpg%3Fw%3D1500]
The propane shortage continues to cripple Minnesota households, and that is why I co-authored a letter signed by 70 Members of Congress to call for immediate action by the President of the United States.
In the letter, I joined my co-author Congressman Adrian Smith in expressing concerns about how further reduction in supply would threaten to leave many Americans without fuel to heat their homes, businesses, and livestock and poultry operations. We urged the President to take immediate action to help improve the situation and work toward responsible solutions.

National Turkey Federation President Joel Brandenberger said, "We commend Congressmen Peterson and Smith for leading this crucial effort.
It is clear the quick action of our representatives played a key role in emergency federal orders for priority propane shipments.
Pipeline regulators signaled their response to significant concerns from House and Senate pressure.
Congress stepped up and extended a lifeline of support to secure propane for barns to keep animals warm and family homes safe in isolated farmland areas - for that we are grateful."

Loans Available for Small Businesses Affected By Propane Crisis
Zero Fees Offered for Borrowers, Lenders on Loans $150,000 or less
U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans may help Minnesota small businesses squeezed by the high cost of propane this winter.
The standard SBA 7(a) loan and the SBA Express loan both offer a guaranty of at least 50% along with no collateral for loans of $25,000 or less and zero fees for borrowers and lenders on loans of $150,000 or less until September 30, 2014.
These existing SBA products, with zero fees and longer maturities can help borrowers absorb this winter's higher than expected fuel costs while minimizing impact on cash flow.
The high guaranty percentages also minimize the lender's risk. Both loans offer terms of up to 10 years on working capital.
There are more than 250 Minnesota lenders participating in these programs.

Manufactured and Modular Home Ass'n

Mark Brunner
This week I met with Mark Brunner, the president of the Manufactured and Modular Home Association of Minnesota. We discussed the home building sector in Minnesota and the rest of the country. We are thankful for all the jobs this industry creates, especially in the 7th District, where three home manufacturers are creating jobs on a daily basis: Dynamic Homes of Detroit Lakes, Friendship Homes of MN in Montevideo, and Schult Homes of Redwood Falls. I applaud these businesses hard work and for providing affordable housing for our nation.
Steelworkers
[cid:image007.jpg@01CF29A1.67DA0A90]
This week members of the United Steelworkers stopped by to discuss trade, unemployment insurance, and how the United States can continue to make investments that support our manufacturing sector. Manufacturing jobs traditionally have been high-skill jobs that afford workers the opportunity to secure a place in our middle class. Congress has a responsibility to do whatever it can to assist in bringing these types of jobs back to our communities.
That's why I will continue to support legislation that provides incentives to manufacturers who produce their goods here in America.

The ARA is a non-profit trade association for agricultural retailers and distributors around the United States.

The northwestern town of Warroad, population 1,781, has sent seven hockey players to the Olympics since 1956. Each of them has returned home with a medal. This year at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, two more Warroad-natives are hoping to continue the trend. Gigi Marvin, a twenty-six year old who won a silver medal for the U.S. women hockey team in 2010, and T.J. Oshie, a twenty-seven hockey player for the St. Louis Blues and the 8th Olympian from Warroad, will help the United States bring home the gold in the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

This Week in American History

Every state in the U.S. Capitol is allowed to commission two statues that are placed around the building. On February 8th, 1916, Minnesota's first statue, Senator Henry Mower Rice, was unveiled in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. Statuary Hall is also where the U.S. House of Representatives used to congregate and debate legislation from 1807 to 1857. The hall gets its name for the large number of statues that are placed throughout the room. Senator Rice was a pioneer and trader, and was an effective advocate for Minnesota statehood. The second Minnesota statue is Maria Sanford, a long-time educator and civil rights leader and her statue is located in the Capitol Visitors Center.

Dear Friends,
As the propane crisis continues, I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that resources are available for folks in the 7th District. The Small Business
Administration offers loans to help small businesses struggling during the shortage. I met with the president of a Minnesota housing association that creates jobs and provides affordable housing, Steelworkers who shared their concerns about the manufacturing
sector, and the Agricultural Retailers Association to discuss regulations impacting their industry.
Sincerely,
