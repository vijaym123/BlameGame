Friends,
I hope you all enjoyed the Fourth of July holiday with
your families. It's a busy month here in Washington, so I want to keep
you up to date on what's happening while getting your feedback on
important issues.
Here's the rundown from this
week:
1. Great Lakes Funding
The House
Appropriations Committee took a crucial step to protect our greatest
economic and environmental resource. Im pleased to have helped secure
$300 million in funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI)
during the subcommittee markup of the fiscal year 2015 Interior and
Environment Bill. With the Great Lakes directly connected to 1.5
million jobs that generate $62 billion in annual wages, securing this GLRI
funding is important not only to Northeast Ohio but to the nation. Next
stop for this bill: the House Floor.
2. SKILLS
Act
A couple weeks ago, I got to visit The Malish
Corporation, a family-owned company in Willoughby. There I was able
to visit with Jeff Malish and four other company owners. Besides
federal regulations and Obamacare, one of the top issues these small
business owners talked about was finding people with the necessary job skills
to fill the openings they have. That definitely got me
thinking.
With so many people looking for work and employers needing to
fill good jobs, we have to do better closing the unemployment gap.
This week, I voted for a revamped version of the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803,
The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act), which will improve
workforce training programs and connect skilled workers with jobs that need
to be filled. Now that the bill passed the House in a bipartisan
415-6 vote, it goes to the President for his
signature.
3. Cleveland Rocks
It was a huge week
for Northeast Ohio, as both the 2016 Republican National Convention and
LeBron James made decisions to call Cleveland home. City leaders from
both parties worked tirelessly on the convention bid, and I was
honored to support their efforts. In talking with the RNCs site selection
committee members, I could tell they saw the potential we all see in
our city. Now, LeBron does too.
As always, thank you for
the opportunity to serve
you.
Sincerely,
Dave
