Dear Friend,
As you gather with family and friends to enjoy a holiday feast, please allow me to wish you and your family a happy and blessed Thanksgiving.
Like many Americans, this year I will be giving thanks for my family, our freedoms, and the blessings of liberty that are secured by those who proudly wear the uniform of the United States of America.
Across our country, thousands of families have an empty spot at the table because a loved one is on the front lines answering the call of duty.
While these brave men and women may be many miles away, I hope that they will be on the forefront of all our minds and prayers today.
Today, and every day, join me in thanking those who fight for our freedom.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
