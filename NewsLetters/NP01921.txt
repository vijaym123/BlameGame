Kansas Common Sense
March 23, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
National Agriculture Week
This week was National Agriculture Week. Regardless of our job or where
we live, agriculture matters to us. Agriculture puts food on our
tables, clothes on our backs, and roofs above our heads. If we want
strong schools, growing businesses and vibrant communities, we must
make certain farmers and ranchers in our state have the opportunity to
prosper. When agriculture is successful, Kansas is successful. In
addition to being the economic backbone of so many of the towns you and
I come from, agriculture is also our link to the past - times when
family was the axis around which all things revolved. In today's
fast-paced world, there are few industries where sons and daughters can
work side-by-side with moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas. I will
continue to work to keep Kansas' tradition of agriculture alive through
strong agriculture policy so that farmers and ranchers can pass on
their heritage to the next generation of producers.
Dietary Guidelines Comment Period Extended
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, formulated every five years by
USDA and HHS, provide a blueprint for how Americans can have a healthy,
nutritious diet. The guidelines also form the basis for our federal
nutrition policy and food assistance programs. Recently, a report
issued by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, meant to provide
unbiased dietary recommendations based on nutritional science,
contained a number of concerning and inappropriate recommendations.
The report relegates the role of lean meat in a healthy diet to a
footnote in the 500-plus page report, instead recommending that
Americans eat a heavily plant-based diet. The report also factors
environmental sustainability into its dietary recommendations - a field
outside the committee members' background or expertise. Not only does
the potential harm to Kansas beef producers greatly concern me, but we
are left to wonder if the committee simply ignored the extensive,
peer-reviewed research that shows lean red meat as part of a healthy
diet.
I am pleased USDA heeded our call for an extension of the comment
period to make certain stakeholders have enough time to review and
comment on the report. However, it is only a small first step. As the
Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman and as a member
of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to
be diligent in my oversight as the agencies finalize the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans.
Reforming the Examination Process for Financial Institutions
This week I introduced much-needed, bipartisan legislation to reform
the bank examination process. The Financial Institutions Examination
Fairness and Reform Act (S. 774) will give financial institutions
reasonable and timely access to their examination results and provide
them with the right to have those examination determinations
independently reviewed. By creating a culture of openness and
transparency around the examination process, financial institutions can
have confidence that their concerns are fairly heard.
Community banks and credit unions continue to be disproportionately
burdened by Dodd-Frank's rules and recordkeeping requirements because
they are less able to absorb compliance costs. By improving the
examination process, our banks and credit unions can better serve their
communities and promote economic growth in the places they call home.

Examining the Evolving Cyber Insurance Marketplace
On Thursday, I convened my second hearing as Chairman of the Senate
Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety,
Insurance, and Data Security. The hearing examined the emerging
cybersecurity insurance market and strategies for companies to improve
their cyber posture. American consumers and businesses face serious
cyber threats. Just this week, we learned of yet another significant
data breach at a health insurer. These types of incidents are all too
frequent. One strategy for businesses to mitigate cyber or
privacy-related losses is the purchase of cybersecurity insurance.
While an insurer's primary function is to mitigate financial losses -
not defend against cyber threats - cyber insurance may be a
market-oriented approach to help businesses improve their cybersecurity
posture by tying policy eligibility or lower premiums to better
cybersecurity practices. An example of this relationship is an auto
insurer offering a "good driver discount" to a customer who avoids
accidents or driving violations. This policy creates an additional
incentive to a driver to be more cautious and attentive, and while the
premium receipt an insurer receives may be lower, in the end they have
fewer claims to pay out.
The cyber insurance market is one of the fastest growing commercial
lines of insurance. Approximately 50 carriers now offer stand-alone
cyber policies, and the total written premiums were $1.5-2 billion in
2014. Some estimates show the market could grow as high as $5 billion
by the decade's end. One topic that was uncovered during the hearing is
the difficulty of small businesses to afford and understand their
policies. To watch a video of the hearing or to read witness testimony,

Meeting with Secretary of the Army John McHugh
It was a pleasure to meet with Secretary of the Army John McHugh. As a
Member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I had the
opportunity to question Secretary McHugh last week during his testimony
regarding the Army's FY16 Budget Request. As a follow up to our
exchange during the hearing, Secretary McHugh stopped by to discuss
important Army issues in Kansas, particularly emphasizing the Army's
requirements and investments in Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley.
I appreciated the Secretary's candor and willingness to explain the
Army's decision-making process related to potential force reductions
that could impact Brigade Combat Teams Army-wide, to include those
stationed at Fort Riley. I wanted to make certain the Secretary clearly
understood the immense opportunity and advantages that Fort Riley
offers the Army and the 1st Infantry Division - from infrastructure, to
home base ground and air training, enhanced medical care with a brand
new Irwin Army Community Hospital, and the ability to quickly deploy
from regional airfields and rail heads. I also described how cost
conscious and fiscally responsible Fort Riley is among other
division-level bases. The excellent quality of life that soldiers and
their families experience in the Junction City and Manhattan
communities is a clear indication of how supportive Kansans are to our
U.S. Army. This was evident when 4,300 Kansans showed up to support the
Big Red One last month at the Army Listening Session. In fact, Big Red
One soldiers are more likely to reenlist or extend their active duty
service obligation when assigned to the 1st Infantry Division at Fort
Riley, Kansas, compared to other division-level bases. I will continue
my discussions with the Army, particularly senior leaders who oversee
these important issues facing Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley.
ITI Legislator of the Year
I was named a tech legislator of the year this week by the Information
Technology Industry Council (ITI) - the global voice of the tech
sector. Throughout my time in public service, I have been an advocate
for innovation, entrepreneurship and job creation. Our country was
built on innovation, and we must protect that legacy by putting
policies in place that foster a pro-growth environment where businesses
can succeed and consumers can benefit.
Community Visit in Marion
It was a beautiful day in Kansas on Saturday. On my drive to
Wellington, I had the opportunity to stop in Marion to visit with
residents and businesses. In addition to the Library, I stopped by
Casey's General Store and Marion Health Mart. Thanks again for being so
welcoming and for the good conversation.
TRIO Programs' 21st Annual Legislative Breakfast
This week, I attended Kansas TRIO Programs' 21st Annual Legislative
Breakfast. I had the opportunity to meet Kansas TRIO Alumni and
University of Kansas graduates Jyleesa Hampton, Nicole Humphrey and
Allora Richey (pictured with me below), and hear their inspiring
stories about pursuing higher education with the support of TRIO
programs.
TRIO programs operate in 19 Kansas postsecondary schools and provide
services to students from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds,
students with disabilities, adult learners and veterans. The programs
support students in achieving their goal of completing higher
education, and often becoming the first in their family to earn a
college degree. Thanks to Wichita State's Kaye Monk-Morgan for emceeing
the event and to the Kansas TRIO staffs for hosting the breakfast.
Speaking at Sumner-Cowley Electric Cooperative Annual Meeting
On Saturday, I traveled to Wellington to speak at the Sumner-Cowley
Electric Cooperative Annual Meeting. Despite the challenges posed by an
ever-growing number of burdensome federal regulations, the cooperative
successfully brings affordable, reliable electric service to families
and businesses in a 2,500 square mile service area. One of the most
burdensome regulations is the decision by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife
Service to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species
under the Endangered Species Act. In January, I introduced legislation
to reverse this ill-advised action which is yet another example of the
federal government unnecessarily intruding into private lives and
businesses. In fact, a number of industries - farming, ranching, oil
and gas development, transportation and wind energy - are already
feeling the effects of the listing. I also discussed the negative
effects of the EPA's greenhouse gas rules and the President's veto of
the Keystone XL Pipeline. Thanks to Co-Op CEO Cletas Rains for the kind
introduction and to board member John Whittington for inviting me to
speak. It was also good to see State Rep. Kyle Hoffman. Below, I'm
pictured with Wellington High School Senior Austin Pfalzgraf who is
receiving an Electric Co-Op Scholarship and 92-year-old World War II
veteran Bennie Jefferies.
Grand Opening of A Cup On The Hill Coffee Shop
This morning in Kansas City, I participated in A Cup On The Hill Coffee
Shop's grand opening. A Cup on the Hill was first formed in 2009 to
give Kansas City residents the opportunity to inspire change within
their community and empower disadvantaged youth to be productive
members of society. Last year, Community Housing of Wyandotte County
(CHWC) - a Community Development Corporation - partnered with A Cup on
the Hill to establish the cafe to bring high-quality coffee to the
community and educate its youth. Here, I'm pictured alongside CHWC CEO
& Executive Director Donny Smith, Assistant Cafe Manager Jamina Bone,
Cafe Manager Jessica Johnson and former KCK Mayor Joe Reardon.
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center
On Tuesday, I visited with Ed Berger, the Chair of Revitalization
Initiatives for the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson.
The Cosmosphere is one of the most comprehensive space museums in the
world, holding a sizeable collection of more than 15,000 U.S. and
Russian space artifacts. Dr. Berger was in Washington, D.C., to give me
an update on the progress of the Cosmosphere's revitalization plan.
Last summer the Cosmosphere's Governing Board approved a revitalization
plan with major emphasis on informal Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Math (STEM) education initiatives. The main goal of the
revitalization effort is to position the Cosmosphere as a STEM learning
hub in Kansas, and contribute to efforts to increase the STEM workforce
by fostering interest in STEM subjects among Kansas youth. This is an
important mission considering the number of jobs requiring STEM degrees
is increasing at three times the rate of the rest of the job market,
all while the number of students pursuing STEM education is declining.
If this trend continues, American businesses are projected to need an
estimated 800,000 workers with advanced STEM degrees by 2018, but will
only find 550,000 American graduates with those degrees they need. I
appreciate the Cosmosphere's efforts to be part of the solution in
addressing the need for a stronger STEM workforce in Kansas. Thanks to
Dr. Berger for traveling to Washington to share the latest on the
Cosmosphere's progress.
Holton Rotary Club
I made it back from this week Washington to give remarks at Holton
Rotary Club. It was good to visit with fellow Rotarians and get an
update on what's happening in the Holton Community. Thanks to Dr. Jeff
Warner for helping to coordinate my attendance.
Honored to Serve You
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

National
Agriculture
Week
This
week
was
National
Agriculture
Week.
Regardless
of
our
job
or
where
we
live,
agriculture
matters
to
us.
Agriculture
puts
food
on
our
tables,
clothes
on
our
backs,
and
roofs
above
our
heads.
If
we
want
strong
schools,
growing
businesses
and
vibrant
communities,
we
must
make
certain
farmers
and
ranchers
in
our
state
have
the
opportunity
to
prosper.
When
agriculture
is
successful,
Kansas
is
successful.
In
addition
to
being
the
economic
backbone
of
so
many
of
the
towns
you
and
I
come
from,
agriculture
is
also
our
link
to
the
past
&mdash;
times
when
family
was
the
axis
around
which
all
things
revolved.
In
today's
fast-paced
world,
there
are
few
industries
where
sons
and
daughters
can
work
side-by-side
with
moms
and
dads,
grandmas
and
grandpas.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
keep
Kansas'
tradition
of
agriculture
alive
through
strong
agriculture
policy
so
that
farmers
and
ranchers
can
pass
on
their
heritage
to
the
next
generation
of
producers.
Dietary
Guidelines
Comment
Period
Extended
The
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans,
formulated
every
five
years
by
USDA
and
HHS,
provide
a
blueprint
for
how
Americans
can
have
a
healthy,
nutritious
diet.
The
guidelines
also
form
the
basis
for
our
federal
nutrition
policy
and
food
assistance
programs.
Recently,
a
report
issued
by
the
Dietary
Guidelines
Advisory
Committee,
meant
to
provide
unbiased
dietary
recommendations
based
on
nutritional
science,
contained
a
number
of
concerning
and
inappropriate
recommendations.
The
report
relegates
the
role
of
lean
meat
in
a
healthy
diet
to
a
footnote
in
the
500-plus
page
report,
instead
recommending
that
Americans
eat
a
heavily
plant-based
diet.
The
report
also
factors
environmental
sustainability
into
its
dietary
recommendations
&ndash;
a
field
outside
the
committee
members'
background
or
expertise.
Not
only
does
the
potential
harm
to
Kansas
beef
producers
greatly
concern
me,
but
we
are
left
to
wonder
if
the
committee
simply
ignored
the
extensive,
peer-reviewed
research
that
shows
lean
red
meat
as
part
of
a
healthy
diet.
I
am
pleased
USDA
heeded
our
call
for
an
extension
of
the
comment
period
to
make
certain
stakeholders
have
enough
time
to
review
and
comment
on
the
report.
However,
it
is
only
a
small
first
step.
As
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
Chairman
and
as
a
member
of
the
Senate
Labor-HHS
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
will
continue
to
be
diligent
in
my
oversight
as
the
agencies
finalize
the
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans.
Reforming
the
Examination
Process
for
Financial
Institutions
This
week
I
introduced
much-needed,
bipartisan
legislation
to
reform
the
bank
examination
process.
The
Financial
Institutions
Examination
Fairness
and
Reform
Act
(S.
774)
will
give
financial
institutions
reasonable
and
timely
access
to
their
examination
results
and
provide
them
with
the
right
to
have
those
examination
determinations
independently
reviewed.
By
creating
a
culture
of
openness
and
transparency
around
the
examination
process,
financial
institutions
can
have
confidence
that
their
concerns
are
fairly
heard.
Community
banks
and
credit
unions
continue
to
be
disproportionately
burdened
by
Dodd-Frank's
rules
and
recordkeeping
requirements
because
they
are
less
able
to
absorb
compliance
costs.
By
improving
the
examination
process,
our
banks
and
credit
unions
can
better
serve
their
communities
and
promote
economic
growth
in
the
places
they
call
home.

Examining
the
Evolving
Cyber
Insurance
Marketplace
On
Thursday,
I
convened
my
second
hearing
as
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance,
and
Data
Security.
The
hearing
examined
the
emerging
cybersecurity
insurance
market
and
strategies
for
companies
to
improve
their
cyber
posture.
American
consumers
and
businesses
face
serious
cyber
threats.
Just
this
week,
we
learned
of
yet
another
significant
data
breach
at
a
health
insurer.
These
types
of
incidents
are
all
too
frequent.
One
strategy
for
businesses
to
mitigate
cyber
or
privacy-related
losses
is
the
purchase
of
cybersecurity
insurance.
While
an
insurer's
primary
function
is
to
mitigate
financial
losses
&ndash;
not
defend
against
cyber
threats
&ndash;
cyber
insurance
may
be
a
market-oriented
approach
to
help
businesses
improve
their
cybersecurity
posture
by
tying
policy
eligibility
or
lower
premiums
to
better
cybersecurity
practices.
An
example
of
this
relationship
is
an
auto
insurer
offering
a
"good
driver
discount"
to
a
customer
who
avoids
accidents
or
driving
violations.
This
policy
creates
an
additional
incentive
to
a
driver
to
be
more
cautious
and
attentive,
and
while
the
premium
receipt
an
insurer
receives
may
be
lower,
in
the
end
they
have
fewer
claims
to
pay
out.
The
cyber
insurance
market
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
commercial
lines
of
insurance.
Approximately
50
carriers
now
offer
stand-alone
cyber
policies,
and
the
total
written
premiums
were
$1.5-2
billion
in
2014.
Some
estimates
show
the
market
could
grow
as
high
as
$5
billion
by
the
decade's
end.
One
topic
that
was uncovered
during
the
hearing
is
the
difficulty
of
small
businesses
to
afford
and
understand
their
policies.

Meeting
with
Secretary
of
the
Army
John
McHugh
It
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
with
Secretary
of
the
Army
John
McHugh.
As
a
Member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
Secretary
McHugh
last
week
during
his
testimony
regarding
the
Army's
FY16
Budget
Request.
As
a
follow
up
to
our
exchange
during
the
hearing,
Secretary
McHugh
stopped
by
to
discuss
important
Army
issues
in
Kansas,
particularly
emphasizing
the
Army's
requirements
and
investments
in
Fort
Leavenworth
and
Fort
Riley.
I
appreciated
the
Secretary's
candor
and
willingness
to
explain
the
Army's
decision-making
process
related
to
potential
force
reductions
that
could
impact
Brigade
Combat
Teams
Army-wide,
to
include
those
stationed
at
Fort
Riley.
I
wanted
to
make
certain
the
Secretary
clearly
understood
the
immense
opportunity
and
advantages
that
Fort
Riley
offers
the
Army
and
the
1st
Infantry
Division
&ndash;
from
infrastructure,
to
home
base
ground
and
air
training,
enhanced
medical
care
with
a
brand
new
Irwin
Army
Community
Hospital,
and
the
ability
to
quickly
deploy
from
regional
airfields
and
rail
heads.
I
also
described
how
cost
conscious
and
fiscally
responsible
Fort
Riley
is
among
other
division-level
bases.
The
excellent
quality
of
life
that
soldiers
and
their
families
experience
in
the
Junction
City
and
Manhattan
communities
is
a
clear
indication
of
how
supportive
Kansans
are
to
our
U.S.
Army.
This
was
evident
when
4,300
Kansans
showed
up
to
support
the
Big
Red
One
last
month
at
the
Army
Listening
Session.
In
fact,
Big
Red
One
soldiers
are
more
likely
to
reenlist
or
extend
their
active
duty
service
obligation
when
assigned
to
the
1st
Infantry
Division
at
Fort
Riley,
Kansas,
compared
to
other
division-level
bases.
I
will
continue
my
discussions
with
the
Army,
particularly
senior
leaders
who
oversee
these
important
issues
facing
Fort
Leavenworth
and
Fort
Riley.
ITI
Legislator
of
the
Year
I
was
named
a
tech
legislator
of
the
year
this
week
by
the
Information
Technology
Industry
Council
(ITI)
&mdash;
the
global
voice
of
the
tech
sector.
Throughout
my
time
in
public
service,
I
have
been
an
advocate
for
innovation,
entrepreneurship
and
job
creation.
Our
country
was
built
on
innovation,
and
we
must
protect
that
legacy
by
putting
policies
in
place
that
foster
a
pro-growth
environment
where
businesses
can
succeed
and
consumers
can
benefit.
Community
Visit
in
Marion
It
was
a
beautiful
day
in
Kansas
on
Saturday.
On
my
drive
to
Wellington,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
stop
in
Marion
to
visit
with
residents
and
businesses.
In
addition
to
the
Library,
I
stopped
by
Casey's
General
Store
and
Marion
Health
Mart.
Thanks
again
for
being
so
welcoming
and
for
the
good
conversation.
TRIO
Programs'
21st
Annual
Legislative
Breakfast
This
week,
I
attended
Kansas
TRIO
Programs'
21st
Annual
Legislative
Breakfast.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
Kansas
TRIO
Alumni
and
University
of
Kansas
graduates
Jyleesa
Hampton,
Nicole
Humphrey
and
Allora
Richey
(pictured
with
me
below),
and
hear
their
inspiring
stories
about
pursuing
higher
education
with
the
support
of
TRIO
programs.
TRIO
programs
operate
in
19
Kansas
postsecondary
schools
and
provide
services
to
students
from
low-income
and
disadvantaged
backgrounds,
students
with
disabilities,
adult
learners
and
veterans.
The
programs
support
students
in
achieving
their
goal
of
completing
higher
education,
and
often
becoming
the
first
in
their
family
to
earn
a
college
degree.
Thanks
to
Wichita
State's
Kaye
Monk-Morgan
for
emceeing
the
event
and
to
the
Kansas
TRIO
staffs
for
hosting
the
breakfast.
Speaking
at
Sumner-Cowley
Electric
Cooperative
Annual
Meeting
On
Saturday,
I
traveled
to
Wellington
to
speak
at
the
Sumner-Cowley
Electric
Cooperative
Annual
Meeting.
Despite
the
challenges
posed
by
an
ever-growing
number
of
burdensome
federal
regulations,
the
cooperative
successfully
brings
affordable,
reliable
electric
service
to
families
and
businesses
in
a
2,500
square
mile
service
area.
One
of
the
most
burdensome
regulations
is
the
decision
by
the
U.S.
Fish
&amp;
Wildlife
Service
to
list
the
lesser
prairie
chicken
as
a
threatened
species
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act.
In
January,
I
introduced
legislation
to
reverse
this
ill-advised
action
which
is
yet
another
example
of
the
federal
government
unnecessarily
intruding
into
private
lives
and
businesses.
In
fact,
a
number
of
industries
&ndash;
farming,
ranching,
oil
and
gas
development,
transportation
and
wind
energy
&ndash;
are
already
feeling
the
effects
of
the
listing.
I
also
discussed
the
negative
effects
of
the
EPA's
greenhouse
gas
rules
and
the
President's
veto
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline.
Thanks
to
Co-Op
CEO
Cletas
Rains
for
the
kind
introduction
and
to
board
member
John
Whittington
for
inviting
me
to
speak.
It
was
also
good
to
see
State
Rep.
Kyle
Hoffman.

I'm

Grand
Opening
of
A
Cup
On
The
Hill
Coffee
Shop
This
morning
in
Kansas
City,
I
participated
in A
Cup
On
The
Hill Coffee
Shop's
grand
opening.
A
Cup
on
the
Hill
was
first
formed
in
2009
to
give
Kansas
City
residents
the
opportunity
to
inspire
change
within
their
community
and
empower
disadvantaged
youth
to
be
productive
members
of
society.
Last
year,
Community
Housing
of
Wyandotte
County
(CHWC)
&ndash;
a
Community
Development
Corporation
&ndash;
partnered
with
A
Cup
on
the
Hill
to
establish
the
cafe
to
bring
high-quality
coffee
to
the
community
and
educate
its
youth.
Here,
I'm
pictured
alongside
CHWC

Kansas
Cosmosphere
and
Space
Center
On
Tuesday,
I
visited
with
Ed
Berger,
the
Chair
of
Revitalization
Initiatives
for
the
Kansas
Cosmosphere
and
Space
Center
in
Hutchinson.
The
Cosmosphere
is
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
space
museums
in
the
world,
holding
a
sizeable
collection
of
more
than
15,000
U.S.
and
Russian
space
artifacts.
Dr.
Berger
was
in
Washington,
D.C.,
to
give
me
an
update
on
the
progress
of
the
Cosmosphere's
revitalization
plan.
Last
summer
the
Cosmosphere's
Governing
Board
approved
a
revitalization
plan
with
major
emphasis
on
informal
Science,
Technology,
Engineering,
and
Math
(STEM)
education
initiatives.
The
main
goal
of
the
revitalization
effort
is
to
position
the
Cosmosphere
as
a
STEM
learning
hub
in
Kansas,
and
contribute
to
efforts
to
increase
the
STEM
workforce
by
fostering
interest
in
STEM
subjects
among
Kansas
youth.
This
is
an
important
mission
considering
the
number
of
jobs
requiring
STEM
degrees
is
increasing
at
three
times
the
rate
of
the
rest
of
the
job
market,
all
while
the
number
of
students
pursuing
STEM
education
is
declining.
If
this
trend
continues,
American
businesses
are
projected
to
need
an
estimated
800,000
workers
with
advanced
STEM
degrees
by
2018,
but
will
only
find
550,000
American
graduates
with
those
degrees
they
need.
I
appreciate
the
Cosmosphere's
efforts
to
be
part
of
the
solution
in
addressing
the
need
for
a
stronger
STEM
workforce
in
Kansas.
Thanks
to
Dr.
Berger
for
traveling
to
Washington
to
share
the
latest
on
the
Cosmosphere's
progress.
Holton
Rotary
Club
I
made
it
back
from
this
week
Washington
to
give
remarks
at
Holton
Rotary
Club.
It
was
good
to
visit
with
fellow
Rotarians
and
get
an
update
on
what's
happening
in
the
Holton
Community.
Thanks
to
Dr.
Jeff
Warner
for
helping
to
coordinate
my
attendance.
