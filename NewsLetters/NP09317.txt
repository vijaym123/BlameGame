Dear Friends,
This week I worked extensively with my
senate colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to advance two important
pieces of legislation that are critical to Oklahomas future. The Water
Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) Conference Report passed
both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and on the same day
the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) successfully completed
marked-up of the fiscal year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) and passed it out of committee by a vote of
25-1.
Water Resources Reform and Development
Act
Congress finally put aside partisan differences and fulfilled their
constitutional responsibility to maintain and modernize a significant
portion of our nation's infrastructure. I was proud of the opportunity
I had as senior member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW)
Committee and a member of the WRRDA Conference Committee to improve the
bill and ensure it addressed our nations critical infrastructure needs.
The Water Resources Reform and Development Act authorizes the
construction of major navigation and flood risk management projects in a
deficit neutral manner with no new direct spending. With this bill, the
Senate and House have addressed the important safety requirements and
regulatory reforms that will benefit our nation's economy
and Oklahoma for decades into the future.
The bill
will help to maintain Oklahoma's inland waterways as a viable means of
transportation and ensure the water requirements for our state's
rural communities are met. I applaud my colleagues for working
together on the final bill to reduce red tape and streamline the
environmental review process that is plaguing our nation's
infrastructure development and inhibiting economic
output.
WRRDA overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives on May 20 by a
vote of 412-4, and then passed the U.S. Senate on May 22 by a vote of
91-7. The bill is now waiting to be signed by the president. Please take
a moment to read in detail how this bill will benefit Oklahoma by

National
Defense Authorization Act
The National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY15 authorizes programs for the Department
of Defense (DOD) and includes numerous provisions that I authored and
supported that will benefit U.S. national security; active-duty,
retired and civilian personnel; and Oklahomas military installations and
communities. The FY15 NDAA marks the culmination of a strong,
bipartisan effort to ensure our military men and women and their families have
the support they need to defend this country.
I am proud
that we stayed within budget caps and fully funded military readiness.
As we face an increasingly dangerous world, I am also pleased that we
were able to increase funding for our nation's missile defense and
ensure full funding for AWACS, an essential airplane for detecting enemy
aircraft whose mission is predominantly based at Tinker Air Force
Base
Oklahomans and all of our military came out ahead with a
provision that prevents a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) next
year, as conducting BRAC costs more in the near-term and it's a cost we
cannot afford in the midst of historically steep budget cuts to our
national security. I will fight to ensure these measures stay intact and
others important to Oklahoma's military community as the NDAA proceeds
through Congress. Please take a moment to read in more detail how this
bill will provide for national security and support Oklahomas
military by

Thank you for
taking an interest in what I am doing to best represent you in
Washington, and I appreciate your
support.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
