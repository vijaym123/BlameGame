Dear Friend,
In 2010, the Tea Party took control of the House. We all know what has happened since then -- thanks to the Tea Party&rsquo;s refusal to be reasonable and find any common ground, we&rsquo;ve seen two sessions of the least productive Congress in the history of the United States.
Think about that --
the least productive Congress in the entire history of the American government.
This fall, the exact same people who run the House and get next to nothing done will try to take over the Senate -- and they only need to pick up six seats to do it.
You can help us hold the Senate by contributing $5 toward our $15,000 April goal.
If the Tea Party takes over the Senate, our progressive priorities are in jeopardy. An energy policy that acknowledges the reality of climate change? Not going to happen.
Raising the minimum wage? Forget it.
Medicare? They&rsquo;d rather turn it into a voucher for private insurance. Our campaign is determined to fight back against the Tea Party&rsquo;s agenda, and we need your help to get the job done -- contribute $5 to get us closer to our goal before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.
Thank you.
