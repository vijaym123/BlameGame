High School
Art Contest Deadline is April 20
Dear
Neighbor,
I want to let you know that the deadline for my annual high
school art completion is less than two weeks away. This is an
extraordinary opportunity for one lucky student to have his or her art
displayed in the U.S. Capitol and for other students to win
prizes.
The contest is open to any high school student who lives in the 11th
District. Public, private and home-schooled students are invited to
participate.
Students who wish to submit an entry should refer to
the guidelines for instructions and program details. These can be found
on my website
connolly.house.gov/art-competition/
Winners will be announced at a reception
for all participants in the contest and their families scheduled for
Saturday, May 9, 2015 at the Workhouse Arts Centers Gallery in Lorton.
The top entry will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year and
the winning artist will be invited to a reception at the U.S. Capitol
to be honored with the other winners from across the country.
The
work of another high school artist judged to be a Rising Star, will
have his or her artwork displayed prominently for a year on the
Workhouse campus. Additional prizes will be presented by our sponsors to
the artists of the 1st through 5th place entries.
This annual
contest provides a unique opportunity for young artists in Fairfax and
Prince William to join with other students from across the nation to
showcase their artistic creativity and talent. It is my pleasure to
host this competition and highlight the importance of the fine
arts.

20, 2015.
