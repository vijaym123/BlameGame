Dear
Friends,
This week the House passed a bill that I co-sponsored, the Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act (H.R. 3370). This bi-partisan bill
will put an end to astronomical flood insurance increases being felt
by families on their National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
statements. These increases are not only painful for individual homeowners but
they put our local economy and housing market in jeopardy.
We
in Florida hold almost 40% of all National Flood Insurance Policies
nationwide, and have been responsible partners to the NFIP. Floridians
have paid four times the amount in premiums compared to what we have
received in claims, making Florida one of the biggest contributors to
the NFIP.
This bill will provide long-term consistency for
South Florida policyholders, and provide well deserved relief for families
from the ridiculous Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
imposed insurance premium increases. Importantly, it will rein in the
federal agency that implemented these rate increases without following
proper procedure dictated by law.
Grandfathered rates will be
reinstated, ensuring that policyholders who built to code and built to the
standards of existing Flood Insurance Rate Maps will not be unfairly
penalized.
Homeowners will be able to pass on their
grandfathered rate, if and when, they chose to put their home on the market,
meaning South Florida residents can once again sell their homes with
confidence.
The bill will also provide a refund for those people
who purchased their home without sufficient notice or warning of the
rate increases to come from FEMA.
And families will now be
able to make monthly payments towards their premium, instead of being
laden with an annual lump sum payment, making it easier for families to
manage their household budgets.
These improvements are common
sense. The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act is a positive
and responsible solution to a problem that impacts thousands of
homeowners nationwide and especially in our community.
This is a
good starting point, but there is still more work to be done. Every
homeowner in South Floridian deserves access to affordable protection from
natural disasters, and I look forward to continuing my work towards
further reform that benefits our community.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
