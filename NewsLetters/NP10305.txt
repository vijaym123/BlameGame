Dear Friend, Right now, we need to build Ed&rsquo;s firewall, and we need your help to do it.
That means hitting our $15,000 April goal before midnight tonight --
contribute $5 or more to get us closer.
Building a grassroots firewall right now frees us up to play offense later in the campaign. If we spend time building our infrastructure now, we can better take advantage of the critical months and weeks before election day. Giving $5, $10, or more to Ed&rsquo;s campaign is the single biggest thing you can do right now. Help us reach our April goal and build a rock-solid firewall for Ed.
Thanks.
David
