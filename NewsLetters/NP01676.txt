David -- We&rsquo;ll let the facts speak for themselves:
Because of the Affordable Care Act (&ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo;), 16.4 million people now have health insurance.
The law has saved an estimated 50,000 lives in just three years.
But the GOP just doesn&rsquo;t get it.
They&rsquo;ve released a budget plan that would repeal the law COMPLETELY.
That&rsquo;s on top of 56 votes to dismantle Obamacare and two Supreme Court cases trying to overturn it!
If they&rsquo;re successful,
11 million Americans could lose their health care.
Tell Republicans:
Don&rsquo;t take away our health care.
Obamacare is the law. Drop your attacks and move on.
We need to show the GOP that voters are SICK of the constant attempts to overturn a law that is
saving lives.
Can we get 100,000 Democrats to chime in by noon tomorrow?
Add your name to tell Republicans to drop their attacks on Obamacare
before
they send their budget to President Obama.
