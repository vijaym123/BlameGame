This week I was honored to present Jane Tucker, one of the founders of ACCESS-York, with the 2014 Eva Murillo Unsung Hero Award, a national recognition presented to a crime victim who has utilized their experience to promote public education, public policy development, and greater awareness about crime victims rights and needs. The award is presented annually by the U.S. Congressional Victims Rights Caucus. As a member of the Victims Rights Caucus, I was honored to nominate Mrs. Tucker, of Dallastown, along with ACCESS-York.
Mrs. Tucker is a domestic violence survivor who has devoted decades of her life to founding, then volunteering at ACCESS-York, York Countys county-wide shelter and service provider for victims fleeing domestic violence.
Mrs. Tucker endured four years of life-threatening physical and mental abuse at the hands of her first husband in the 1950s.
Years later, Mrs. Tucker met others who shared her interest in establishing a safe shelter for victims fleeing abuse, and together, through tenacity and perseverance, created ACCESS-York, a program for victims of domestic violence that continues to provide free and confidential emergency shelter, transitional housing, medical and legal advocacy, individual and group counseling, life skills training, and a 24-hour hotline for all victims seeking help.

Jane Tuckers life is a story of triumph over tragedy. From a battered mother to a founding mother of ACCESS-York, Jane was an ideal candidate for the Eva Murillo Unsung Hero Award and I was proud to join ACCESS-York at the ceremony in Washington, D.C.
