Dear Friend-
This week, the House Republican Conference voted to elect a new
Majority Leader for the House of Representatives to fill the position
currently held by Eric Cantor. The defeat of a sitting House Majority
Leader is unprecedented, and, by my lights, represented a firm rebuke
to the Washington, DC establishment.
The vote was by secret ballot, but I believe that members should be
transparent with their constituents and disclose who they supported. I
voted for Congressman Ral Labrador and delivered one of his nominating
speeches. Read the remarks I gave before the House GOP Conference by
clicking here.
Although Congressman Labrador is a skilled communicator who as Majority
Leader would have been able to break through the misguided assumptions
of the media elite and articulate limited government principles, the
GOP Conference elected current Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy to Majority
Leader. Congressman Steve Scalise, chairman of the Republican Study
Committee, was then chosen to succeed Congressman McCarthy as Whip.
Also this week, the House Judiciary Committee voted 30-4 to pass H.R.
3086, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which makes permanent the
moratorium on internet access taxes. I voted "yes." This bill needs to
be signed into law within the next several months or else consumers
will start getting hit with a deluge of taxes and fees at the city,
county and state levels. Americans should not have to pay a tribute to
the government in order to access the internet.
On Wednesday, I attended a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing
about the release of the Taliban Five and the Bowe Bergdahl saga. Watch
my questioning by clicking here
. Here are several points that I think are important:
1.
Those who claim that opponents of the release of the Taliban 5
somehow support "leaving a man behind" are wrong in two senses. For one
thing, as we heard during the testimony from one of Bergdahl's former
platoon members, Bergdahl left his unit behind. He was not captured on
the battlefield, as Susan Rice has claimed, but instead voluntarily
deserted his unit. Second, we have not "left" Afghanistan - we still
have thousands of troops in Afghanistan and will have troops there
through 2016 according to the President's timeline. Even if you
classify the deal as a legitimate "exchange" of prisoners, the fact is
that such exchanges usually happen when hostilities cease.
2. The release of the Taliban 5 clearly harms U.S. security interests,
as it replenishes the enemy in wartime. There is little reason to
believe that Qatar will keep tabs on these 5 terrorists, but even if
they do the Taliban 5 will be back in Afghanistan before the scheduled
redeployment of U.S. troops. As has been pointed out by former POWs,
such as my colleague Sam Johnson and others who obviously subscribe to
the POW/MIA ethos, it is not good policy to undermine the security
interests of your country in order to effectuate a transfer of
detainees. In fact, men like Johnson have stated that they would not
have wanted to be released from captivity if it meant endangering their
fellow Americans.
3. The Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to honor Bergdahl's
parents upset a lot of veterans, and rightfully so. It is now clear
that the White House tried to puff up Bergdahl's service so that
Americans would focus on Bergdahl rather than scrutinize the release of
the Taliban 5. Of course, the heroes who died looking for Bergdahl were
not afforded such a ceremony for their aggrieved parents.
4. Bergdahl needs to face court-martial for his desertion. If he doesn't
then he will likely receive an honorable discharge as well as hundreds
of thousands of dollars of back pay and allowances. I am concerned
about the Obama administration interfering with the military justice
process. If the Obama administration (falsely) characterized Major
Nidal Hasan's terrorist attack at Ft. Hood as "workplace violence," I
can see the administration trying to handle this case in a way that
seeks to protect the political interests of the President at the
expense of truth and justice.
On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the
oppressive nature of the Islamic terror state in Iran.
During my
questioning, I rejected the notion, advanced by some in the Obama
administration as well as by some Republicans, that the United States
should collaborate with Iran in order to counter the terrorist group
the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
ISIS is a ruthless
terrorist group that is trying to impose a totalitarian Sunni Islamic
caliphate in the heart of the Middle East and represents a threat to
the United States.
At the same time, Iran is a mature Shiite terrorist
state that is committed to the destruction of the United States and is
seeking nuclear weapons.
We should not try to referee a conflict
between warring Islamic rivals, much less referee such an ancient
dispute in favor of the mullahs in Iran.
Check out my testimony to
hear some of the deplorable things that the Iranian regime does to
individuals under their system of sharia law
.
Lastly, next Saturday starting at 10 AM, the University of North
Florida will host a Northeast Florida Congressional Update with myself,
Congressman Ander Crenshaw, and Congressman Ted Yoho. Please join us
and share your thoughts, questions, and concerns on the important
issues facing Florida and our nation. More details can be found by

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week,
the
House
Republican
Conference
voted
to
elect
a
new
Majority
Leader
for
the
House
of
Representatives
to
fill
the
position
currently
held
by
Eric
Cantor.
The
defeat
of
a
sitting
House
Majority
Leader
is
unprecedented,
and,
by
my
lights,
represented
a
firm
rebuke
to
the
Washington,
DC
establishment.
The
vote
was
by
secret
ballot,
but
I
believe
that
members
should
be
transparent
with
their
constituents
and
disclose
who
they
supported.
I
voted
for
Congressman
Ra&#250;l
Labrador
and
delivered
one
of
his
nominating
speeches.
Read
the
remarks
I
gave
before
the
House
GOP
Conference
by
clicking
here.
Although
Congressman
Labrador
is
a
skilled
communicator
who
as
Majority
Leader
would
have
been
able
to
break
through
the
misguided
assumptions
of
the
media
elite
and
articulate
limited
government
principles,
the
GOP
Conference
elected
current
Majority
Whip
Kevin
McCarthy
to
Majority
Leader.
Congressman
Steve
Scalise,
chairman
of
the
Republican
Study
Committee,
was
then
chosen
to
succeed
Congressman
McCarthy
as
Whip.
Also
this
week,
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
voted
30-4
to
pass
H.R.
3086,
the
Permanent
Internet
Tax
Freedom
Act,
which
makes
permanent
the
moratorium
on
internet
access
taxes.
I
voted
"yes."
This
bill
needs
to
be
signed
into
law
within
the
next
several
months
or
else
consumers
will
start
getting
hit
with
a
deluge
of
taxes
and
fees
at
the
city,
county
and
state
levels.
Americans
should not
have
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
government
in
order
to
access
the
internet.
On
Wednesday, I
attended
a
House
Foreign
Affairs
subcommittee
hearing
about
the
release
of
the
Taliban
Five
and
the
Bowe
Bergdahl
saga.
Watch
my
questioning
by
clicking
here . Here
are
several
points
that
I
think
are
important:
1.
Those
who
claim
that
opponents
of
the
release
of
the
Taliban
5
somehow
support
&#8220;leaving
a
man
behind&#8221;
are
wrong
in
two
senses.
For
one
thing,
as
we
heard
during the
testimony
from
one
of
Bergdahl&#8217;s
former
platoon
members,
Bergdahl
left
his
unit
behind.
He
was
not
captured
on
the
battlefield,
as
Susan
Rice
has
claimed,
but
instead
voluntarily
deserted
his
unit.
Second,
we
have
not
&#8220;left&#8221;
Afghanistan
&#8211;
we
still
have
thousands
of
troops
in
Afghanistan
and
will
have
troops
there
through
2016
according
to
the
President&#8217;s
timeline.
Even
if
you
classify
the
deal
as
a
legitimate
&#8220;exchange&#8221;
of
prisoners,
the
fact
is
that
such
exchanges
usually
happen
when
hostilities
cease.
2. The
release
of
the
Taliban
5
clearly
harms
U.S.
security
interests,
as
it
replenishes
the
enemy
in
wartime.
There
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
Qatar
will
keep
tabs
on
these
5
terrorists,
but
even
if
they
do
the
Taliban
5
will
be
back
in
Afghanistan
before
the
scheduled
redeployment
of
U.S.
troops.
As
has
been
pointed
out
by
former
POWs,
such
as
my
colleague
Sam
Johnson
and
others
who
obviously
subscribe
to
the
POW/MIA
ethos,
it
is
not
good
policy
to
undermine
the
security
interests
of
your
country
in
order
to
effectuate
a
transfer
of
detainees.
In
fact,
men
like
Johnson
have
stated
that
they
would
not
have
wanted
to
be
released
from
captivity
if
it
meant
endangering
their
fellow
Americans.
3. The
Rose
Garden
ceremony
at
the
White
House
to
honor
Bergdahl&#8217;s
parents
upset
a
lot
of
veterans,
and
rightfully
so.
It
is
now
clear
that
the
White
House
tried
to
puff
up
Bergdahl&#8217;s
service
so
that
Americans
would
focus
on
Bergdahl
rather
than
scrutinize
the
release
of
the
Taliban
5.
Of
course,
the
heroes
who
died
looking
for
Bergdahl
were
not
afforded
such
a
ceremony
for
their
aggrieved
parents.
4. Bergdahl
needs
to
face
court-martial
for
his
desertion.
If
he
doesn&#8217;t
then
he
will
likely
receive
an
honorable
discharge
as
well
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
back
pay
and
allowances.
I
am
concerned
about
the
Obama
administration
interfering
with
the
military
justice
process.
If
the
Obama
administration
(falsely)
characterized
Major
Nidal
Hasan&#8217;s
terrorist
attack
at
Ft.
Hood
as
&#8220;workplace
violence,&#8221;
I
can
see
the
administration
trying
to
handle
this
case
in
a
way
that
seeks
to
protect
the
political
interests
of
the
President
at
the
expense
of
truth
and
justice.
On
Thursday,
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
held
a
hearing
on
the
oppressive
nature
of
the
Islamic
terror
state
in
Iran.
During
my
questioning,
I
rejected
the
notion,
advanced
by
some
in
the
Obama
administration
as
well
as
by
some
Republicans,
that
the
United
States
should
collaborate
with
Iran
in
order
to
counter
the
terrorist
group
the
Islamic
States
of
Iraq
and
Syria
(ISIS).
ISIS
is
a
ruthless
terrorist
group
that
is
trying
to
impose
a
totalitarian
Sunni
Islamic
caliphate
in
the
heart
of
the
Middle
East
and
represents
a
threat
to
the
United
States.
At
the
same
time,
Iran
is
a
mature
Shiite
terrorist
state
that
is
committed
to
the
destruction
of
the
United
States
and
is
seeking
nuclear
weapons.
We
should
not
try
to
referee
a
conflict
between
warring
Islamic
rivals,
much
less
referee
such
an
ancient
dispute
in
favor
of
the
mullahs
in
Iran.
Check
out
my
testimony
to
hear
some
of
the
deplorable
things
that
the
Iranian
regime
does
to
individuals
under
their
system
of
sharia
law .
Lastly,
next
Saturday
starting
at
10
AM,
the
University
of
North
Florida
will
host
a
Northeast
Florida

with
