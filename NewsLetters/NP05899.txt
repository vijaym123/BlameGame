David, we need your support. This morning, a leading election forecaster called Brad Schneider one of the TOP TEN most vulnerable members of Congress. Here&rsquo;s what that means:
With 33 days to go, Republicans will use every last tool in their arsenal to defeat Brad and bring Bob Dold back to Congress.
David -- this is a make or break moment for our campaign. We can&rsquo;t let Brad fall behind. Will you rush $5 or whatever you can to our Final Stretch Rapid Response Fund? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
33 days to go and no time to waste.
Thanks,
Schneider HQ
