Dear Friend:
On September 11, 2012, four Americans - including our Ambassador - were
murdered in a well-coordinated attack on the U.S. consulate in
Benghazi, Libya.
Almost two years later, justice has still not been
served and too many questions remain unanswered.
In light of newly released White House documents regarding the attack,
the House of Representatives has voted to establish a select committee
to get a full and complete understanding of what happened that night
and the government's response.
With these developments in mind, please take a brief moment to answer
the following question so I can hear your thoughts on the Benghazi
investigation and provide you updates on the issues that matter most to
our district.
I will be sharing the results in our next newsletter -
so stay tuned.
Do you support the creation of a House select committee to investigate
the deadly attacks on our U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya?
Yes
No
