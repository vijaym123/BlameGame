Farm Bill's Positive Local Impact
This month I also visited the People's Food Co-Op in Rochester to talk about the positive impact the Farm Bill has for local producers and businesses in Minnesota. The Farm Bill is working to help our local farmers sell their produce to the local community. This works not only to put fresh, homegrown food on your dinner table, but also to create local jobs and build upon the healthy economy we enjoy in southern Minnesota. I was proud of our hard-fought victory on the Farm Bill. I will continue fighting for producers and consumers in southern Minnesota.

Working to Make our Communities Safer
As more and more hazardous materials are shipped through our communities via rail we must do all we can to ensure our communities are kept safe. That is why I convened a meeting in Waseca with community leaders, first responders, and rail officials to talk rail and community safety.
Last month, a train derailed in Waseca. Luckily that train was carrying only grain, and not hazardous material. The meeting we held in Waseca is a part of my effort to bring folks together and increase rail shipping safety. In February I called for and participated in a Congressional hearing on the matter and have held similar meetings in Winona and St. Paul.

Supporting Equal Pay for Equal Work
According to a report from the American Association of University Women, women in southern Minnesota earn only 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. Nationally women receive 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. This isn't fair and it isn't right. It's shocking that in 2014, we're still fighting to ensure equal pay for equal work. And let me be clear, equal pay isn't just a women's issue-it's an economic and middle class family issue. Families increasingly rely on women's wages to make ends meet.
When women bring home less money each day, they have less for the everyday needs of their families - groceries, rent, child care, gasoline. That's why I'm a co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens and closes loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act and provides effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal pay for equal work.

Opposing the GOP's Reckless Ryan Budget
At the beginning of the month, Chairman of the Budget Committee, Representative Paul Ryan released his latest "budget," which reads as a Tea Party wish list. This reckless budget would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors, decimate our ability to repair our crumbling roads and bridges, gut funding for scientific research, provide tax incentives to ship American jobs overseas, all while giving tax breaks to millionaires and the ultra-rich. These aren't southern Minnesota values.
The only way we'll ever truly tackle the debt is by taking a balanced approach. That includes working together and making smart investments in programs that work, cutting programs that don't work, and giving our economy the tools it needs to grow and prosper. I stand ready to work with anyone who is willing to do that, but I cannot support this proposal that damages the ability for southern Minnesotans to achieve the American Dream.

Dear Friends,
April has been a busy month both at home in Minnesota and in Washington. I wanted to give you a quick update on some of the things I&#8217;ve been working on the past month. Keep the faith. As always, it is an honor to serve you.
Sincerely,

<![endif] A
New Health Clinic for Veterans
Last Friday April 25 th , I was honored to give the keynote address at the grand opening of the new VA Community-based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Albert Lea. This new
clinic will increase access to care for veterans in southern Minnesota by providing primary care, mental health counseling, and telemedicine services. Plus, having a new clinic close to home will reduce unnecessary trips to the Twin Cities for local veterans,
which can be a significant hardship for veterans of all ages. Last fall, after advocating tirelessly for a new CBOC for southern Minnesota, I announced the VA had chosen Albert Lea as its location. This clinic was a long time coming, and I could not be more
proud of our communities&#8217; commitment to our nation&#8217;s heroes.
