Dear Fellow Delawarean,
On December 7, 1787, Delaware's elected delegates gathered at the
Golden Fleece Tavern in Dover and unanimously voted to become the first
state to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Now, I like to imagine Delaware's
Founding Fathers enjoying some hot chocolate on that chilly day, but,
whatever beverage it was, they made the right decision! More than 200
years later, our nation still enjoys the freedoms granted by that
historic document. And our state enjoys that unique place in American
history as "The First State" - something no other state can claim. On
Delaware Day, we not only honor this special day for our state, but we
also pause to honor the fallen heroes of the attack on Pearl Harbor on
December 7, 1941.
Today, Delaware remains at the forefront of American ingenuity and
progress. The success of Delaware's economy can be traced back
centuries to the early gunpowder factories of Irenee DuPont to the
Fortune 500 companies that light up Wilmington's skyline today.
Delaware's a great place for small businesses and startups, too, and we
haven't forgotten our agricultural roots. Delaware farmers are
internationally renowned for their high quality corn, apples, and
poultry.
This week, I was able to take part in a special
event showcasing some of the best food and beverages Delaware has to
offer at the 4th annual "Taste of Delaware
" reception in Washington,
DC. The event was made possible thanks to the Delaware State Chamber of
Commerce and my friend and fellow Delawarean, Senator Chris Coons. Each
year more and more folks come out and rave about Delaware. It fills me
with a lot of state pride, and I hope today you're feeling similar
pride in our state's past, present, and future.
So on this Delaware Day, let us remember Delaware's Founding Fathers
and cheers our hot chocolate to the First State and the United States
that followed!
Cheers,
