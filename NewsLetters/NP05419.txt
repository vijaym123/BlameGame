SUPPORTING POLICE OFFICERS: As a member of the House Judiciary Committee who staunchly defends programs that help support our local police departments, I was proud to announce recently that more than $1.3 million from the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office is headed to DeKalb County to hire 15 more officers.
It is part of a $121.4 million COPS Hiring Program (CHP) nationwide to create and/or preserve law enforcement jobs. Grants will be made to 212 different local law enforcement agencies across the country.
As a former county commissioner, I know how critical COPs grants are in strengthening key law enforcement capabilities and providing communities with the resources they need to protect our citizens. I will continue to fight to maintain these important programs as a member of Congress. For more, click HERE .
