Building Support for North Dakota's Servicemembers
North Dakotans have always answered the call to serve our nation, many
of whom do so right here in our home state in Minot and Grand Forks.
Their dedication and selfless sacrifices are what keep us safe, so it's
important that we do everything in our power to make sure our
servicemembers have the support they need.
This week, U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James and U.S. Air
Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh visited Minot Air Force Base to
see firsthand the efforts underway to improve resources for and boost
the morale of all those who help maintain our nuclear mission.
Last fall, I joined then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at Minot Air
Force Base where we had an open and honest discussion with hundreds of
servicemembers on the importance of modernizing our nation's nuclear
mission through billions of dollars of investments, and also the need
to continue to find ways to improve the lives of military personnel and
their families.
And on the eastern side of the state, Grand Forks Air Force Base has
been right in the middle of building out exciting and practical new
technology with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Wednesday marked the
signing of an official agreement between Grand Forks County and the
U.S. Air Force, which will lead to the opening of the Grand Sky
business and technology park - a 217-acre park on Grand Forks Air Force
Base aimed at developing and expanding the use of UAS technology
throughout North Dakota. The potential of this technology and its uses
are great for our state. Farmers will be better able to monitor crop
conditions, energy companies will be able to more easily check for
leaks or ruptures in pipelines, border patrol agents could expand their
efforts to survey the northern border, and law enforcement would get
another resource to help them track down criminals.
I've been working with federal and local officials since joining the
Senate to finalize the Enhanced Use Lease project for Grand Sky and I'm
confident that this is a big step forward for Grand Forks Air Force
Base and the entire surrounding community.
Working together, we can continue to make sure North Dakota's
servicemembers and their families have the resources, skills, and tools
they need to protect our country. We have such a rich tradition of
military service in North Dakota, and I'm proud to be on the front
lines fighting to support them, just as they fight for us.

Servicemembers
North
Dakotans
have
always
answered
the
call
to
serve
our
nation,
many
of
whom
do
so
right
here
in
our
home
state
in
Minot
and
Grand
Forks.
Their
dedication
and
selfless
sacrifices
are
what
keep
us
safe,
so
it's
important
that
we
do
everything
in
our
power
to
make
sure
our
servicemembers
have
the
support
they
need.
This
week,
U.S.
Air

Secretary
Deborah
Lee
James
and
U.S.

Chief

General
Mark

visited
Minot

to

to

And

has
been

of

which
will

of

throughout

The

of
this

and

are

and
law

would

I've

since

I'm

that
this
is
a
big
step
forward
for
Grand

Air

Base
and
the
entire
surrounding
community.
Working
together,
we
can
continue
to
make
sure
North
Dakota's
servicemembers
and
their
families
have
the
resources,
skills,
and
tools
they
need
to
protect
our
country.
We
have
such
a
rich
tradition
of
military
service
in
North
Dakota,
and
I'm
proud
to
be
on
the
front
lines
fighting
to
support
them,
just
as
they
fight
for
us.
