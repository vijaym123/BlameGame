Dear Friend:
Thank you for taking the time to read my e-newsletter as we enter the
Memorial Day weekend.
KEEPING HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION
ON
COURSE
Congress is facing an urgent task that deserves bipartisan support:
ensuring there is no disruption in funding for work on our nations
highways, bridges, and other infrastructure. Its possible that the
federal highway trust fund will be depleted by the end of the summer,
potentially jeopardizing projects that are critically important to our
economy, public safety, and the environment. In a letter to the House
leadership, I called for a long-term reauthorization of federal highway
programs, along with a stable source of funding, so that no
interruption in scheduled construction occurs.

THE
BENGHAZI SELECT
COMMITTEE
The initial steps are being taken to organize the House
select committee investigating the terrorist assault in Benghazi that
resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador
Christopher Stevens. Its formation received my support and I particularly
applaud the appointment of my fellow Judiciary subcommittee chairman,
Congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, as Chairman and the selection
of Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabamas Second District to serve as a
committee member.
FREE TRADE AND FAIR
TRADE
While
the U.S. benefits from international trade, unfair and illegal
practices like dumping are destructive to American jobs and public support
for trade.
Milton Magnus of M &amp; B Metal
Products of Leeds is one of the most knowledgeable business executives on
illegal dumping and duty evasion by foreign competitors and I was
pleased to introduce him when he testified in front of the House Small
Business Committee yesterday.
Congress and our federal
agencies must be vigilant in making sure that our trade laws are strongly
enforced.

Magnus testifies at hearing.

CONSUMERS AND
COMPETITION IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
The proposed mergers between Comcast and Time
Warner Cable and AT&amp;T and DirectTV are further evidence of how the
telecommunications industry is rapidly changing. As Chairman of the
Judiciary Committee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law,
I believe the public needs the full picture of how
these mergers would affect consumers and competition.
The
public hearings we are holding will be an important part of the record as
federal antitrust authorities review these
proposals.
HE SAID
IT.
Sometimes you just cant believe what you hear in
Washington, like we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what
is in it. This week, I asked an architect of the Dodd-Frank Act
former Treasury Department official Michael Barr
why the meetings of
the highly-opaque Financial Stability Oversight Council created by the
law aren't open to Congress and the public .
His
answer was essentially that openness would make it
harder for
Congress to review the FSOC's actions.
That doesn't make
sense to me.
When the government does things in secret, the result
is usually very bad decisions.

ENSURING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF VETERANS
CARE
Our veterans deserve the highest
level of care from a grateful nation. The recent reports of
mismanagement and
shortcomings in the VA health care system are highly
disturbing. Having raised concerns myself about backlogs in Alabama, I
have been supporting efforts to ensure that there is complete
accountability at the very top of the VA and that the single focus is on
providing the absolute best service to the men and women who have served our
country with honor.
THREE SOLDIERS FROM
ALABAMA REMEMBERED ON THE VIETNAM VETERANS
MEMORIAL
This coming Memorial Day
should again cause us to reflect on the sacrifices that have been made to
keep America free.
This month, the names of
three soldiers from Alabama were added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
a poignant ceremony that family members said brought them a sense of
closure and feeling of pride.
The names of PFC Ronald Hall of
Birmingham, SP4 Thomas Charles Littles of Brewton and PFC Danny Joe
Wilson of Florence join an honor roll of brave men and women who gave
their all for their country and freedom.
