DHS accepting comments on Proposed Rule to allow grace period for CW renewals
The Department of Homeland Security is seeking comment on a proposal to allow Commonwealth-only Transitional (CW) workers to keep working for up to 240 days while their renewal application is processed. Enhancing Opportunities for H-1B1, CW-1, and E-3 Nonimmigrants and EB-1 Immigrants was published in the Federal Register
on May 12 and is open for public comment for 60 days. The grace period would apply only if the employer files the renewal petition before the expiration of the CW workers current status, and is limited to the duration of the CW program. The CW program will terminate on December 31, 2014, unless extended by the U.S. Secretary of Labor. The deadline to submit comments on the proposed rule is July 11 and may be submitted here .

WRRDA bill agreement leaves cost waiver provision intact
After months of negotiation, House and Senate conferees reached an agreement on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
leaving intact my provision, Section 1032, that doubles the waiver of the local match requirement for Army Corps projects in the Northern Mariana Islands. This will increase the current $200,000 waiver, set in 1986, to reflect inflation over the last 28 years. The new waiver amount will mean more federal funds invested in the Northern Mariana Islands and Commonwealth money can be used for other priorities. It has been seven years since the last water resources bill was enacted. Once both the House and the Senate vote to approve the negotiated bill it will head to the President for his signature.
