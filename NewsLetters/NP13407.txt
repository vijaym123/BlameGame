Dear David,
2013 has been a year of great opportunities, and addressing deep-seated challenges. For me, the year was focused not just on
tweeting my favorite
recipes - but on expanding job opportunities, protecting consumers, delivering for veterans, and strengthening accountability across the federal government.
As we look to 2014, I wanted to take a moment to highlight
13 in '13
important accomplishments I've been proud to fight for, on behalf of Missouri's families and businesses.
