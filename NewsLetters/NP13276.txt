Dear Friend,
2014 has arrived and with it comes hope that the House and Senate will
reach agreement on a number of issues that are important to the
citizens we serve. The House has made serious efforts to improve the
lives of Americans by passing legislation dealing with such matters as
workplace flexibility, IRS abuse of law-abiding taxpayers, energy
self-sufficiency, and - of course - numerous bills addressing the many
problems with the President's health care law and the need to repeal
it, replace it, or at the very least delay implementation.
Unfortunately, the Senate has failed to follow the lead of the House in
these areas and others.
Hopefully, the new year will bring their
willingness to move forward on these important pieces of legislation.
In the area of health care we are now seeing that the House was right
when it urged the Senate and the White House to repeal or at least put
the brakes on this new legislation which was not ready to be launched.
In the weeks and months leading up to implementation of the new law,
Americans saw evidence, almost on a daily basis, of how the law could
not work. As 2014 begins I pray that citizens who thought they had
enrolled in health care plans are actually enrolled and have access to
coverage should they need it. With its piecemeal exemptions and
extensions, the Obama Administration has already acknowledged the plan
is not ready for implementation. The American people would be best
served by having its representatives approve new replacement health
care legislation that makes health care available and affordable to all
Americans without forcing Americans into a new system that is causing
over 7,000,000 people to lose coverage and others to see their premiums
skyrocket.
We can do better.
My hope is that early in the new year, the Senate will take up and pass
many of the other bills that have been approved by the House but have
collected dust in the Senate. I'll share with you just three of these
many common sense bills that await action in the Senate:
1)
The Working Families Flexibility Act - H.R. 1406 - will allow
private sector workers the option of receiving compensatory time
instead of pay for overtime hours worked. Federal and state employees
currently have this right. It is only appropriate that this right be
extended to those who work in the private sector. With family time at a
premium these days, many Americans would prefer spending time with
loved ones. The Senate
should say "yes.
2)
The STOP IRS Act - H.R. 2565 - expands the grounds for
termination of any Internal Revenue Service employee performing,
delaying, or failing to perform any official action for his or her own
benefit or for a political purpose. We learned of how the IRS had been
playing politics with the tax exempt status of mostly conservative
groups - in violation of both IRS policy and our tax laws. This bill
that cleared the House awaits action in the Senate. It is time for the
Senate to say "yes."
3)
The Energy Consumers Relief Act - H.R. 1582 - is one of several
energy-related bills passed by the House and awaiting Senate action.
This bill would, among other things, require the Department of Energy
to determine whether any rule put forward by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) would cause any increase in energy prices for
consumers, an adverse effect on energy supply and distribution, or will
cause significant adverse effects to the economy. Again, it is time for
the Senate to say "yes."
There is good news in that we are making important progress in one very
important area. An issue I am optimistic about agreeing on early this
year is a comprehensive five-year Farm Bill that will serve the
interests of both consumers and farmers while ensuring the United
States has a safe, plentiful, and affordable supply of food for many
years to come. There are still a few differences between the House and
Senate versions of the Farm Bill that need to be ironed out, but
negotiators for both chambers have been working on the Farm Bill over
the holidays and House-Senate conferees hope to vote on a Farm Bill as
early as next week. What a great way to start the new year!
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
2014
has
arrived
and
with
it
comes
hope
that
the
House
and
Senate
will
reach
agreement
on
a
number
of
issues
that
are
important
to
the
citizens
we
serve.
The
House
has
made
serious
efforts
to
improve
the
lives
of
Americans
by
passing
legislation
dealing
with
such
matters
as
workplace
flexibility,
IRS
abuse
of
law-abiding
taxpayers,
energy
self-sufficiency,
and
-
of
course
&#8211;
numerous
bills
addressing
the
many
problems
with
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law
and
the
need
to
repeal
it,
replace
it,
or
at
the
very
least
delay
implementation.
Unfortunately,
the
Senate
has
failed
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
House
in
these
areas
and
others.
Hopefully,
the
new
year
will
bring
their
willingness
to
move
forward
on
these
important
pieces
of
legislation.
In
the
area
of
health
care
we
are
now
seeing
that
the
House
was
right
when
it
urged
the
Senate
and
the
White
House
to
repeal
or
at
least
put
the
brakes
on
this
new legislation
which
was
not
ready
to
be
launched.
In
the
weeks
and
months
leading
up
to
implementation
of
the
new
law,
Americans
saw
evidence,
almost
on
a
daily
basis,
of
how
the
law
could
not
work.
As 2014
begins
I
pray
that
citizens
who
thought
they
had
enrolled
in
health
care
plans
are
actually
enrolled
and
have
access
to
coverage
should
they
need
it.
With
its
piecemeal
exemptions
and
extensions,
the
Obama
Administration
has
already
acknowledged
the
plan
is
not
ready
for
implementation.
The
American
people
would
be
best
served
by
having
its
representatives
approve
new
replacement
health
care
legislation
that makes
health
care
available
and
affordable
to
all
Americans
without
forcing
Americans
into
a
new
system
that
is
causing
over
7,000,000
people
to
lose
coverage
and
others
to
see
their
premiums
skyrocket.
We
can
do
better.
My
hope
is
that
early
in
the
new
year,
the
Senate
will
take
up
and
pass
many
of
the
other bills
that
have
been
approved
by
the
House but
have
collected
dust
in
the
Senate.
I&#8217;ll
share
with
you
just
three
of
these
many
common
sense
bills
that
await
action
in
the
Senate:
1)
The
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act
-
H.R.
1406
&#8211;
will
allow
private
sector
workers
the
option
of
receiving
compensatory
time
instead
of
pay
for
overtime
hours
worked.
Federal
and
state
employees
currently
have
this
right.
It
is
only
appropriate
that
this
right
be
extended
to
those
who
work
in
the
private
sector.
With
family
time
at
a
premium
these
days,
many
Americans
would
prefer
spending
time
with
loved
ones.
The
Senate
should
say
&#8220;yes.
2)
The
STOP
IRS
Act
&#8211;
H.R.
2565
&#8211;
expands
the
grounds
for
termination
of
any
Internal
Revenue
Service
employee
performing,
delaying,
or
failing
to
perform
any
official
action
for
his
or
her
own
benefit
or
for
a
political
purpose.
We
learned
of
how
the
IRS
had
been
playing
politics
with
the
tax
exempt
status
of mostly
conservative
groups
&#8211;
in
violation
of
both
IRS
policy
and
our
tax
laws.
This
bill
that
cleared
the
House
awaits
action
in
the
Senate.
It
is
time
for
the
Senate
to
say
&#8220;yes.&#8221;
3)
The
Energy
Consumers
Relief
Act
&#8211;
H.R.
1582
&#8211;
is
one
of
several
energy-related
bills
passed
by
the
House
and
awaiting
Senate
action.
This
bill
would,
among
other
things,
require
the
Department
of
Energy
to
determine
whether
any
rule
put
forward
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
would
cause
any
increase
in
energy
prices
for
consumers,
an
adverse
effect
on
energy
supply
and
distribution,
or
will
cause
significant
adverse
effects
to
the
economy.
Again,
it
is
time
for
the
Senate
to
say
&#8220;yes.&#8221;
There
is
good
news
in
that
we
are
making
important
progress
in
one
very
important
area.
An
issue
I
am
optimistic
about
agreeing
on
early
this
year
is
a
comprehensive
five-year
Farm
Bill
that
will
serve
the
interests
of
both
consumers
and
farmers
while
ensuring
the
United
States
has
a
safe,
plentiful,
and
affordable
supply
of
food
for
many
years
to
come.
There
are
still
a
few
differences
between
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
the
Farm
Bill
that
need
to
be
ironed
out,
but
negotiators
for
both
chambers
have
been
working
on
the
Farm
Bill
over
the
holidays
and
House-Senate
conferees
hope
to
vote
on
a
Farm
Bill
as
early
as
next
week.
What
a
great
way
to
start
the
new
year!
Have
a
great
week.
