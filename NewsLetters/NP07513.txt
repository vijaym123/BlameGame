WHITE HOUSE: Boehner Has 'Opened The Door' To Impeaching President Obama
This is an all-hands-on-deck moment:
A top White House official just said that
&ldquo;Speaker Boehner&hellip;has opened the door to impeachment&hellip;"
Boehner&rsquo;s unprecedented lawsuit against the President is one thing -- but this would take the assault on the President to a whole new level.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt: Tea Party House Republicans aren&rsquo;t going to stop their attacks against President Obama because we ask nicely. We must defeat them.
There&rsquo;s no time to lose. We need an absolute EXPLOSION of grassroots support in response to the threat of impeachment.
We need 15,724 donations in the next 8 hours. Can you chip in to have the President's back? Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
