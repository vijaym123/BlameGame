Dear Friend, As a lifelong Hoosier, I know the love and diversity that Indiana has to offer.
Last week, I was saddened and disappointed to see the passage of Indiana&rsquo;s SB 101 &ndash; a bill that allows discrimination under the disguise of religious freedom.
There is no place in Indiana, or anywhere in America, for a law like SB 101.
As our country celebrates the 50th anniversary of several pieces of legislation outlawing discrimination and intolerance, Indiana&rsquo;s Governor and members of the State Legislature have chosen to go back to America&rsquo;s days of intolerance and injustice.
I urge our state leaders to repeal this backwards law. The effects of this hurtful legislation are already being seen across our state.
Hoosiers everywhere should not have to suffer the financial and social consequences caused by the passage of SB101.
I hope you will join me in continuing to show the world the hospitality that Hoosiers are known for and making our city a welcoming place for everyone.
