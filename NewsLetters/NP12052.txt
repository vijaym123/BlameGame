Salmon Scores 100% on Pro-Growth, Pro-Economic Freedom Scorecards
Sole Arizonan Representative with 100% lifetime rating from Club for
Growth and FreedomWorks
Washington-Today, Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) released the following
statement regarding his perfect scores from Club for Growth and
FreedomWorks on his 113thCongress voting record.
"I came back to Washington fully committed to making tough choices,
cutting spending and balancing our budget. I am honored to be
recognized for my voting record that reflects those tough fiscal
decisions by the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks," said Rep. Matt
Salmon. "During my time in Congress, I have represented Arizona's 5th
Congressional District by voting to help eliminate this wasteful
government spending and reduce our debt, and I will continue to do so.
We must do this. It will take tough choices and honest debate on what
our country can afford, but failure to act now will merely push those
hard choices down the road and increase the burdens we leave for the
next generation."
"With his score of 100%, and a lifetime score of 100%, Rep. Matt Salmon
has demonstrated that he is a fighter for free markets and limited
government," said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola. "Congress
looks for any excuse to spend our tax dollars and grow government, but
in 2013, the people of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District had Rep.
Salmon standing up for them in Washington. If we had more pro-economic
growth fighters like him serving in Congress today, America would be a
better place."
Rep. Salmon scored a 100% for Club for Growth's 2013 Congressional
Scorecard and maintains a 100% lifetime rating.
He scored a 100% for FreedomWork's 2013 Congressional Scorecard and
maintains a 100% lifetime rating.
Rep. Salmon is the sole Arizonan Representative with a 100% lifetime
rating from both Club for Growth and FreedomWorks.
Club for Growth publishes an annual scorecard so Club members and the
public can monitor the actions and the voting behavior of Members of
Congress on economic growth issues. The Club conducted a comprehensive
examination of each lawmaker's record on pro-growth policies and
computed a score on a scale of 0 to 100. A score of 100 indicates the
highest support for pro-growth policies. Those lawmakers scoring 90 or
higher in 2010- and who also have a lifetime score of 90 or higher-
receive the Defender of Economic Freedom award.
FreedomWorks identifies the most important votes on issues of economic
freedom and scores Members of Congress based on their votes. They also
use a scale of 100, thus the higher the score, the more often the
Member is on the side fighting for lower taxes, less government and
more freedom.

Things

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"

inches

because
they

You

Salmon
Scores
100%
on
Pro-Growth,
Pro-Economic
Freedom
Scorecards
Sole
Arizonan
Representative
with
100%
lifetime
rating
from
Club
for
Growth
and
FreedomWorks
Washington &#8212;Today,
Rep.
Matt
Salmon
(AZ-05)
released
the
following
statement
regarding
his
perfect
scores
from
Club
for
Growth
and
FreedomWorks
on
his
113thCongress
voting
record.
&#8220;I
came
back
to
Washington
fully
committed
to
making
tough
choices,
cutting
spending
and
balancing
our
budget.
I
am
honored
to
be
recognized
for
my
voting
record
that
reflects
those
tough
fiscal
decisions
by
the
Club
for
Growth
and
FreedomWorks,&#8221;
said
Rep.
Matt
Salmon .
&#8220;During
my
time
in
Congress,
I
have
represented
Arizona's
5th
Congressional
District
by
voting
to
help
eliminate
this
wasteful
government
spending
and
reduce
our
debt,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
so.
We
must
do
this.
It
will
take
tough
choices
and
honest
debate
on
what
our
country
can
afford,
but
failure
to
act
now
will
merely
push
those
hard
choices
down
the
road
and
increase
the
burdens
we
leave
for
the
next
generation.&#8221;
&#8220;With
his
score
of
100%,
and
a
lifetime
score
of
100%,
Rep.
Matt
Salmon
has
demonstrated
that
he
is
a
fighter
for
free
markets
and
limited
government,&#8221;
said
Club
for
Growth
President
Chris
Chocola .
&#8220;Congress
looks
for
any
excuse
to
spend
our
tax
dollars
and
grow
government,
but
in
2013,
the
people
of
Arizona&#8217;s
Fifth
Congressional
District
had
Rep.
Salmon
standing
up
for
them
in
Washington.
If
we
had
more
pro-economic
growth
fighters
like
him
serving
in
Congress
today,
America
would
be
a
better
place.&#8221;
Rep.
Salmon
scored
a
100%
for
Club
for
Growth&#8217;s
2013
Congressional
Scorecard
and
maintains
a
100%
lifetime
rating.
He
scored
a
100%
for
FreedomWork&#8217;s
2013
Congressional
Scorecard
and
maintains
a
100%
lifetime
rating.
Rep.
Salmon
is
the
sole
Arizonan
Representative
with
a
100%
lifetime
rating
from
both
Club
for
Growth
and
FreedomWorks.
Club
for
Growth
publishes
an
annual
scorecard
so
Club
members
and
the
public
can
monitor
the
actions
and
the
voting
behavior
of
Members
of
Congress
on
economic
growth
issues.
The
Club
conducted
a
comprehensive
examination
of
each
lawmaker&#8217;s
record
on
pro-growth
policies
and
computed
a
score
on
a
scale
of
0
to
100.
A
score
of
100
indicates
the
highest
support
for
pro-growth
policies.
Those
lawmakers
scoring
90
or
higher
in
2010&#8212;
and
who
also
have
a
lifetime
score
of
90
or
higher&#8212;receive
the
Defender
of
Economic
Freedom
award.
FreedomWorks
identifies
the
most
important
votes
on
issues
of
economic
freedom
and
scores
Members
of
Congress
based
on
their
votes.
They
also
use
a
scale
of
100,
thus
the
higher
the
score,
the
more
often
the
Member
is
on
the
side
fighting
for
lower
taxes,
less
government
and
more
freedom.
