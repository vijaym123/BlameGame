Hello Friends!
Welcome to the
April Fools' edition of the Moore Connection! Unfortunately, the
Republicans' drive to blame poverty on the poor, hold up comprehensive
immigration reform and repeal our landmark health care reform law is not a
joke. Rest assured that I've been busy in Washington standing up for
you!
I joined
PoliticsNation to discuss the
"culture"
of Black men
in the inner cities in response to Rep. Paul Ryan
remarking that there is a tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in
particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even
thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work. I
joined Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Chair Marcia Fudge
in a letter to Rep. Ryan
expressing our
offense to his comments and inviting him to speak with the CBC. He
accepted our offer, and we are scheduled to meet with him later this
month.
Earlier last month, I responded to both
Rep. Ryan's poverty report and President Obama's
budget . I hope that my Republican colleagues join Democrats in
working to expand opportunity to all Americans, not just the
wealthy.
For
too long our aspiring Americans have stood in the shadows of our nation.
It's past time to pass comprehensive immigration reform to keep
families together and bolster our economy. Late last month, I stood on the
Capitol steps to support our immigrant families. I signed a discharge
petition to force a vote on comprehensive immigration reform as well.

I also
celebrated
International Women's Day
with the bipartisan Congressional Womens
Working Group on Immigration Reform. To draw attention to the unique
plight of immigrant victims of domestic violence,
I wrote this op-ed
in the
Huffington Post . We
have an opportunity to help tens of thousands more faceless victims
across our country - by passing comprehensive immigration
reform.
Last week, I joined the Congressional Black Caucus in
an effort to mobilize Black men to enroll in the Affordable Care Act
(ACA). Regardless of race, I have been encouraging all people to enroll
in health care coverage for many months. March 31 was the deadline to
enroll in coverage.
Despite the law's success, this
week will mark the 52nd time House Republicans have attempted to
repeal, dismantle or otherwise undermine the Affordable Care Act. Attacks
aside, the ACA will remain law. It's already helping millions of
Americans, including young adults,
women , seniors, those with pre-existing conditions, those who have
reached their lifetime limits on health care coverage and so many
more!
A note on enrolling: If you'd like to join the more than
7 million people who have successfully enrolled in the ACA (but
experienced technical difficulties on March 31) you may still be able to
enroll! Visit
healthcare.gov
to
learn more.
