Should IRS employees who have tax compliance issues or conduct demerits get bonuses?
Most of us would say the answer is obvious: of course not. The Internal Revenue Service, however, answered yes. A
recent report
from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reveals that the IRS dished out cash bonuses, performance awards, and other incentives to employees with misconduct and tax problems.
Bottom line:
Once again, the IRS undermines taxpayers confidence and breaks trust with the American people. This may not surprise us, but it is still outrageous and unacceptable. The federal government has a duty to use Americans tax dollars in the most efficient and effective means possible, and the IRS must face consequences for failing to uphold that obligation.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I have been very active in the fight to hold the IRS accountable to the American people, supporting the Taxpayer Transparency and Efficient Audit Act,
H.R. 2530 , as well as the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act,
H.R. 3865 , and sending a
letter
to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting a nonpartisan official be appointed to lead the investigation into the inappropriate targeting of conservative organizations. I will continue to fight for consequences for these actions, and answers for the American people.
