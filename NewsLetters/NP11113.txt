Dear Friend,
Last week, I was honored to attend the ceremony at Naval Air Station
Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base for the arrival of the upgraded KC-130J
aircraft that Marine Corps Reserve Squadron 234, known as The Rangers,
will begin flying.
Squadron 234 supports various training and global operations that
deliver air-to-air refueling, assault support and close air support to
organizations across the Department of Defense. For example in 2013 the
234th:
*	Flew a total of 3,675 hours
*	Flew more than 1,200 sorties that carried over 3,000 passengers
*	Delivered one million pounds of cargo
*	Off-loaded 1.8 million pounds of fuel to over 300 aircraft
Last April, the Marine Corps made the announcement that the new model
of the KC-130 would be coming to Fort Worth. The move to replace the
older version of the aircraft is part of a larger congressionally
mandated program that began in 1997 to ensure that the aircraft given
to the Marine Corps was worthy of the demands placed on the Marines.
While the conflicts of the last decade are winding down, the continuous
threats to the United States and our allies are a constant reminder
that we must remain vigilant. For the Marine Corps Reserves this means
their work is never done, which is why so many of us fought hard for
Squadron 234 to receive the upgraded airplanes.
As vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, I am
especially grateful to the Marine Corps for their commitment to the
vitally important mission of the Marine Corps Reserves at our base in
Fort Worth.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
I
was
honored
to
attend
the
ceremony
at
Naval
Air
Station
Fort
Worth
Joint
Reserve
Base
for
the
arrival
of
the
upgraded
KC-130J
aircraft
that
Marine
Corps
Reserve
Squadron
234,
known
as
The
Rangers,
will
begin
flying.
Squadron
234
supports
various
training
and
global
operations
that
deliver
air-to-air
refueling,
assault
support
and
close
air
support
to
organizations
across
the
Department
of
Defense.
For
example
in
2013
the
234th:
Flew
a
total
of
3,675
hours
Flew
more
than
1,200
sorties
that
carried
over
3,000
passengers Delivered
one
million
pounds
of
cargo Off-loaded
1.8
million
pounds
of
fuel
to
over
300
aircraft
Last
April,
the
Marine
Corps
made
the
announcement
that
the
new
model
of
the
KC-130
would
be
coming
to
Fort
Worth.
The
move
to
replace
the
older
version
of
the
aircraft
is
part
of
a
larger
congressionally
mandated
program
that
began
in
1997
to
ensure
that
the
aircraft
given
to
the
Marine
Corps
was
worthy
of
the
demands
placed
on
the
Marines.
While
the
conflicts
of
the
last
decade
are
winding
down,
the
continuous
threats
to
the
United
States
and
our
allies
are
a
constant
reminder
that
we
must
remain
vigilant.
For
the
Marine
Corps
Reserves
this
means
their
work
is
never
done,
which
is
why
so
many
of
us
fought
hard
for
Squadron
234
to
receive
the
upgraded

As
vice
chairman
of
the
Defense
Appropriations
subcommittee,
I
am
especially
grateful
to
the
Marine
Corps
for
their
commitment
to
the
vitally
important
mission
of
the
Marine
Corps
Reserves
at
our
base
in
Fort
Worth.
