Constituent Survey - What Matters to You in 2014?
As the second session of the 113th Congress begins, I want to know what is most important to you.
I would be deeply grateful if you would kindly take a few moments to participate in a short survey on the issues currently facing our nation.
Please click the link in the picture below and answer the four brief questions. I also encourage you to note any other issues, ideas, or suggestions you may have in the comment boxes.
Feedback from constituents in the 24th
District is very important to me and plays an essential role in helping
me better serve you in Congress.
Thank you for your time and participation.
