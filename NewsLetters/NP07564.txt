LEGISLATION
July 27, 2014
Dear
David,
Last week, I
met with the Department of Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for
Benefits Allison Hickey to seek answers about the misconduct that has been
uncovered at Oakland Regional Office.
As we continue to learn
more about the failures that are plaguing the VA, it is becoming
increasingly clear that this pattern of wrongdoing and unethical conduct
is not isolated to one or two facilities. The excessive wait times,
second-rate care, fraudulent records, destroyed or hidden files, and
general incompetence have not only prevented our veterans from receiving
the care they deserve, but likely also cost veterans
lives.
In addition to speaking out against this unacceptable mismanagement,
I also shared reports my office has received from whistleblowers at
the claims processing facility in Oakland during the House Veterans
Affairs Committee hearing, including one citing thousands of veterans
documents sitting on a cart or a janitors closet or in the hallway by
the directors office for years and even decades." Following the
reports, the Assistant Inspector General for audits and evaluations
announced that the Inspector Generals office was opening a formal inquiry
into the Oakland VA. You can watch a video of my remarks
here.
The system can be fixed, but some bureaucrats in
DC just dont get it. Just last week, in addition to retaliating
against the same whistleblowers that exposed this incompetence, Acting VA
Secretary Sloan Gibson demanded billions of dollars in new funding to
pay an additional 10,000 clinic staff. When will Washington understand
that this incompetence and waste is not going to change, no matter
how many billions of taxpayer dollars are spent, without addressing the
culture of unaccountability and mismanagement? Our veterans deserve a
system that works for them, a system that fulfills the most basic
promise we made to these men and women.
I am committed to do
all I can to ensure our men and women of the armed services received the
care they deserve. If you or anyone you know is currently facing
issues receiving their benefits, please do not hesitate to reach out to my
office.
Sincerely,
