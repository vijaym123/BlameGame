Recently in
Washinton
Attended Israel Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahus Speech
I had the privilege of hearing
Israel PM Netanyahu address the joint session of congress. I was
impressed by what he had to say regarding our administrations treaty with
Iran, and I too would agree that Iran is working against our national
interest. I am skeptic in trusting a nation that has been listed as a
state sponsor of terror for more than 30 years as a positive partner.
Watch my reaction below:
Fighting for
Veterans
Fellow veteran, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and I introduced the
Veterans TRICARE Choice Act to help create more healthcare options for
Veterans. It allows veterans to voluntarily pause their TRICARE
benefits and to participate in a Health Savings Account (HSA) program. These
programs are not only an effective way to pay for medical costs, but
also a chance to save for future medical
expenses.
Voted against the Department of Homeland
Security funding bill
I am extremely
disappointed with the outcome of the funding of Homeland Security vote.
This result funds not only Homeland Security, but most importantly
President Obamas illegal executive amnesty. I understand the importance of
the Department of Homeland Security, but I do not support the
unconstitutional actions of executive amnesty. Watch my explanation
below:
The FCC approved Net
Neutrality Rules
I do not support the
FCCs reclassification of the internet as a utility. The growth of the
internet and internet based economy has now been stunted. Read my op-ed

Daily Caller

Expressed my opinion of the treaty with
Iran in
Wall Street Journal
editorial
I had the honor of having my op-ed featured in the Wall Street Journal
which allowed me to share my opinion of the Iran treaty with the rest
of America.
Iran has become a primary supplier of weapons to
two other state sponsors of terror along with foreign terrorist
organizations. Compliance with the terms of a nuclear-weapons treaty cannot be
based on trust alone. Read my
editorial here .
