this article
with you from the Wall Street Journal on 5 key things to watch for as the Senate debates the Keystone XL Pipeline.
My take:
We are in a global energy race. The United States regularly competes with growing economies like China for available energy resources around the world. As we enter an era of energy innovation, our nations ability to become energy independent will not only impact our position as a global leader, it will also directly impact job creation, manufacturing, and energy affordability for American families.
A presidential veto of the pipeline
which holds the potential for both great energy security and economic benefit for our nation
would mean that
America loses out on this opportunity to begin breaking our dependency on foreign oil . Its my hope that the Senate will join together in bipartisan support for this critical economic project, and pressure the President to consider the Keystone.
Ill keep you posted. Its time to build.
Yours in service,
Randy
