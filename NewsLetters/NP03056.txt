The State of the Union
I was honored to have Kathie Leonard, the owner and co-founder of
Auburn Manufacturing, Inc., as my guest at the State of the Union
Address
. The State of the Union is as much about where we are today as
where we want to be tomorrow. The question before us now is whether we
want a 21st century economy that connects to the rest of the world
through high-speed broadband, that cultivates a spirit of innovation
and entrepreneurship in manufacturing and keeps good jobs here in
America - just like Kathie Leonard has done at AMI.

Scenes from Maine
I am grateful to have played a small role in recognizing the service of
Army veteran Oscar Gerry
, who finally has the medals
he earned for his service to our country. That's Oscar in the middle,
with my staffer Claire Bridgeo and Peter Ogden, Director of the Maine
Bureau of Veterans' Services.
On January 23rd, I visited the University of Maine at Farmington to
discuss the foreign policy lessons
I've learned as a member of
the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees.
Policy Update
*
Most of the legislative action on the Senate floor this week
has focused on a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. I voted no
on the bill.
I cannot justify supporting legislation that circumvents an
established and long-standing process of Presidential-approval in order
to issue a construction permit for a private company - especially when
the project will facilitate the transport of some of the world's
dirtiest and most climate-harming oil through our country.
*
Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina) and I reintroduced the
Repay Act
, our bill that would simplify
federal student loan repayment programs. I've also joined Senators
Lamar Alexander (R- Tennessee) and Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) in their
effort to streamline the application for federal student aid
into a single postcard.
*
President Obama has established an Arctic Executive Steering
Committee
aimed at coordinating Arctic policy across
different federal government agencies. Having traveled to the Arctic
last year
, I look forward to working with the administration on issues
concerning this important region.
Scenes from Washington
General Daniel Allyn, the Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, grew up
in Berwick. He has certainly made Maine proud!
My trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Israel
After several days of productive and informative conversations with
Saudi, Qatari, Israeli, and Palestinian leaders
, as well
as with members of Syrian opposition forces, I am convinced that strong
and thoughtful American leadership and diplomacy is not only welcome -
but necessary - to the future of the Middle East.

of the Saudi General Intelligence Protectorate. That's Senator John
McCain (R-Arizona) on my left and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South
Carolina) on my right.
