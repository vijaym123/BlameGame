Protecting Energy
Jobs
The Obama Administration
issued new EPA regulations that would lower the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to
65-70 parts per billion.
This could reduce
U.S. GDP by $270 billion per year and threaten more than 100,000
energy-related jobs.
I oppose these regulations.
We
should be rolling out the red carpet for these energy jobs, not the red
tape.
Empowering Congress on Flood
Risk
I urged
President Obama not to implement an executive order to change the Federal
Flood Risk Management Standard.
Federal investment decisions
throughout the country could be discouraged, and flood risk policy reforms
included in the Grimm-Cassidy Substitute Amendment to the Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act could be at risk.
The
President is not the only person who knows about flood risk.
He is
doing a disservice to the American people by failing to include others
opinions that may differ from his.
Scientists, Congress and the
American people should be consulted when flood risk is determined by
the federal
government.
Celebrating Thanksgiving
I
hope you and your family had a wonderful Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving
reminds us of the blessings we have as Americans.
It is a
blessing for me to represent you in Congress.
If you ever have a
comment, concern, or need assistance with a federal agency, please do
not hesitate to contact my office.
