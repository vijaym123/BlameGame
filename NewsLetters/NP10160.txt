On September 19, 2008, backers of the Keystone XL pipeline first submitted an application to the U.S. State Department to build this energy infrastructure project, designed to bring both jobs and greater energy security to the United States of America.
Its been
over five years
since that day.
This past January, the State Department
issued
its Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the permit application, confirming the project is safe and will have limited environmental impacts. Despite this, the Obama Administration recently
announced
that it is indefinitely extending its long-awaited review of the Keystone XL pipeline.
It is unacceptable for politics to continue to delay a project that will spur economic growth and move us towards greater energy independence.
Its been 5 long years. Americans are waiting. It is time to build. Click

Yours in service,

P.S.
I have supported the Northern Route Approval Act ( H.R. 3 ), which removes any need for presidential approval of the pipeline, and the Keystone For a Secure Tomorrow Act ( H.R. 334 ), which would allow Congress to directly and immediately approve the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.
