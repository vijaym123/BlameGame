Dear Friend,
The Koch brothers -- the big oil billionaires whose right-wing network of donors has become synonymous with outside spending -- have pledged to spend
nearly $900 million
on the 2016 elections.
There are only about 300 ultra-wealthy donors in the Koch network, and they&rsquo;re going to make their voices heard. Today, we&rsquo;re doing the same. I&rsquo;m joining with some of my colleagues to gather 1,OOO signatures for every Koch donor and to rededicate ourselves to getting rid of
Citizens United . Sign our petition and become one of the 3OO,OOO dedicated to fighting the Koch empire and overturning
Citizens United .
The President has announced his support for a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to regulate campaign finance. The American people have said for years that they don&rsquo;t want a few wealthy donors controlling our elections. And Democrats in Congress continue to submit amendment proposals that would overturn the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in
Citizens United.
The only people who seem to want to keep
Citizens United
on the books are Congressional Republicans and their big money allies in the Koch network. Our democracy gives a seat at the table to all Americans -- not just those who can afford to buy one. Today, we&rsquo;re standing up for that principle and rejecting Koch-fueled elections. Demand an end to
Citizens United
and limitless spending in our elections. Sign our petition and become one of the 3OO,OOO people who are fighting back.
Thanks for your support.
