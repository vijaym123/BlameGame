Dear David,
Keeping faith with the men and women who've served in uniform is an important part of my job as a U.S. Senator, and something I take personally. It's clear we need to keep working to support our veterans transitioning back to civilian life.
On Thursday, the President signed into law a bill
I proudly supported
with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help prevent suicide among veterans, expand veterans' access to mental health services, and improve the quality and effectiveness of the VA's programs that address traumatic brain injury, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or depression.
The
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Ac t is an important step towards ensuring our veterans can readily access mental health services of the highest quality. But there's still more work to be done. That's why I'm asking for your help in my continued effort to improve veterans' healthcare across Missouri.
If you or a veteran you know would like to participate in my Veterans' Customer Satisfaction Program, visit my website
McCaskill.senate.gov/VCSP
and complete the confidential survey. Responses can be submitted after each health care visit.
With this
veterans secret shopper program , we're putting power back into the hands of veterans and ensuring that we make good on the promises made to those who served. My goal is to continue to have an aggressive program that holds our VA medical centers accountable for providing the best healthcare possible to our veterans.
Whether a veteran is seeking physical or mental health services, transitioning back to civilian life shouldn't be made more difficult by a lack of quality care.
Please join me in helping spread the word to the veterans in your life about how they can voice their confidential opinions at
McCaskill.senate.gov/VCSP .
All the best,
P.S. I want to hear from you about the issues impacting Missouri veterans. Let's stay in touch via
