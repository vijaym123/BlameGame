This week has
been another busy week for many reasons. We have spent a lot of this
week focusing on the growing number of individuals, including the
unaccompanied children, crossing our Southern border. I was one of seven
House members chosen to join the
House working
group
to find solutions to stop the flood of these illegal immigrants at
our border. President Obama has created this crisis though his
unilateral policies and it requires immediate attention to stop it from
spiraling out of control.
Additionally this week,
the House passed three bills aimed at lowering gas prices and easing
the squeeze on the Middle Class through increasing American energy
production. On Tuesday, the House passed
H.R. 3301 ,
the North American Energy Infrastructure Act ( See
Roll Call #354 ). This bill establishes a new, more efficient
approval process for cross-border oil pipelines and electric transmission
facilities, which enables the U.S. to utilize cross-border energy
projects that are in the nations best interest.
On
Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 6 , the Domestic
Prosperity and Global Freedom Act ( See Roll Call
#359 ). This legislation will increase the United States exports of
liquid natural gas which has both economic and geopolitical benefits.
It is expected to create at least 665,000 jobs nationwide by 2035, and
155,713 jobs in Texas alone.
Thursday, in an
effort to lower the rising cost of gasoline, the House passed
H.R. 4899 , the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an
America that Works Act of 2014 ( See Roll Call #368 ).
This bill strengthens U.S. energy security and ensures all of
Americas vast energy resources are used to meet domestic energy
demands.
This afternoon, I spoke with the acting Veteran
Affairs Secretary, Sloan Gibson, about investigations that occurred at
the Temple VA facility in 2011 and the need for follow up action from
the VA leadership and further investigation by independent watchdogs.
My staff and I were actively engaged in 2011, have been active since,
and will continue to push the VA to find solutions to this situation
and ensure our Texas veterans are receiving the care they deserve. I
have also talked to FBI Director, James Comey, who assured me the FBI
will be completing an investigation into the Temple
VA.
I am headed home to spend a week in the district before
coming back to Washington on July 8. I am looking forward to seeing all of
you at the Fourth of July parades.
