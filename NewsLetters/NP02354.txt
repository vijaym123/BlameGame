Nuclear Armed Iran Not an Option
Dear Friends,
This week I had the honor of attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus address to a joint session of Congress.
He spoke of Americas repeated support of Israel in the past and the need of Americas support in the future.
The Prime Ministers concerns for the survival of his country, our closest ally in the middles east, are justified.
The peoples of both Israel and America recognize the threat of a nuclear armed Iran and remain adamant that this cannot be allowed to happen.
But despite this, the latest round of negotiations and deal making between the Obama administration and the government of Iran may just let nuclear development continue.
It is absolutely critical that, whatever comes from these negotiations, Congress get the opportunity to provide its input on any deal to ensure that a nuclear armed Iran is not an option.
Please continue to share your
thoughts and concerns
with me on these and other issues.
Sincerely,
