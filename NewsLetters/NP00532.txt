Dear Friends,
As your representative in Congress, I rely on your input to address the challenges that the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our nation face.
While I always appreciate interactions on the policy issues we deal with, I also think its vitally important to hear how my staff and I are doing assisting you in other areas.
To allow me to best represent you and be responsive of your requests, I am conducting a 2015 Constituent Services Survey to seek your input on how my staff and I can better assist you.
Rest assured that your individual results will not be disclosed. The objective of the survey is to let me know how we can better serve you and our fellow Kentuckians.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to be a part of my 2015 Constituent Services Survey and helping me better represent you in Washington.
Sincerely,
BRETT GUTHRIE
Member of Congress
