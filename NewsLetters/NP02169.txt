I Want to Hear From You! ISIS
militants in the Middle East continue to grow the territory they occupy
in Syria and Iraq, posing a threat to stability in the region. They
have committed unspeakable atrocities including beheadings, burning
captives alive, and holding public executions of Christians.
Several
Americans have been tortured and executed by ISIS.
ISIS has
successfully recruited fighters from around the world and security
analysts have raised concern that they could return home to commit terrorist
acts. Under the Constitution, the President must ask Congress for
authorization to use military force to combat ISIS. Should Congress grant authorization for
the use of military force to the President to stop ISIS? Yes, but only with limited
airstrikes, not ground troops. Yes, with the possibility of using ground troops if military
commanders believe it is essential to complete the mission
effectively. No, the President should
not be given authority to use military force to combat
ISIS. *By
