Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
In the 1950s, elementary schools in Topeka, Kansas were racially
segregated. But a courageous father named Oliver Brown was determined
to give his third-grade daughter Linda, a fair shot at a good
education. Mr. Brown tried unsuccessfully to enroll his daughter, Linda, in
the neighborhoods all-white elementary school. But the doors of that
school were shut to Linda, because she was African-American. Instead,
Linda was forced to walk seven blocks to a bus stop, where she waited
for a bus to take her to an all-black elementary school. Rather than
accept the status quo, the Browns and fellow parents brought a civil
case against the Topeka school board, challenging the school districts
segregation policy.
The case, which is now commonly known as
Brown v. Board of Education, eventually was argued before the United
States Supreme Court. The plaintiffs were represented by the NAACP and
its chief counsel, future-Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall.
In rendering its decision, the Supreme Court under the leadership of
Chief Justice Earl Warren unanimously held that racially-segregated
public schools were "inherently unequal," overturning half a century of
institutional racism. The status quo of separate but equal in our
nations public schools was struck down, and soon other children like
Linda Brown were able to attend class with white boys and
girls.
This past Saturday marked the 60th anniversary of the United States
Supreme Courts landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Although six decades have passed, our nation still owes a debt to the few
brave individuals who stood against racial segregation in American
schools. The Brown family, their fellow plaintiffs, the legal teams, and
the nine Supreme Court justices, all refused to let inequality go
unchallenged. It was difficult, and scary, and courageous for Oliver and
Linda Brown to pursue legal recourse in the face of insults, slanders,
and threats. But the Brown family and their fellow plaintiffs stood
firm in the face of opposition. Their legal teams didnt waiver. And
their supporters had their backs from the beginning to the end. These
parents couldnt give up. They knew that it was their job
their
responsibility
to fight for justice.
Today, along with my Senate
colleagues, I express my gratitude for the men, women and children
whose iconic efforts helped bring racial segregation to a screeching
halt. Our nation is still far from perfect, and sadly, we still see
racism rear its ugly head. But no one can dispute that we are better off
because of the Brown v. Board of Education decision. It is my hope that
we recognize and support those like little Linda Brown, in doing our
part to defend equality and fairness in our society. And as we do that,
we will complete the unfinished work of Brown v. Board of
Education.
