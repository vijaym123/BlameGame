Dear Friends,
Last week, President Barack Obama provided an update on our nation's involvement in Iraq. Over the past several days, the American people have watched as our military and the Administration continue to monitor the area closely, recently relocating some staff out of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq's capital.
It is clear today as it has been for years; the United States cannot afford to police the world and go it alone in what continues to be an area requiring global and regional support. As the current situation develops, it is crucial that you have an opportunity to share your thoughts on our involvement going forward. That is why I will be holding a community forum on the situation in Iraq this
Sunday
from
5PM - 7PM
at the
West Hartford Town Hall :
Forum on Iraq
