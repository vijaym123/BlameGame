Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
April 17, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took action to
protect our nation's security by unanimously passing the Iran Nuclear
Agreement Review Act of 2015
. I was proud to vote in support of this critical legislation,
which allows Congress to act on behalf of the American people by
examining each detail of a proposed nuclear agreement between the
United States and Iran.
We must do everything we can to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear
weapons capability. Relaxing sanctions against Iran should not even be
a consideration until Iran ends its work toward obtaining these
weapons.
I remain very concerned about a nuclear agreement in part because there
are
reports of conflicting details about the agreed-upon
framework for a deal with Iran. As I told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on
Sunday
, I believe this administration is negotiating what the other
side wants before securing our own national interests.
Time to Abolish the IRS and Obamacare
On "Tax Day," I again called on Congress to enact a fairer, simpler tax
code, to remove Americans' personal health information from tax
returns, and to abolish the IRS once and for all. I am proud to say
that I co-sponsored the Fair Tax Act of 2015
in January to abolish the IRS.
Medicare Physician Access
This week the Senate passed legislation to permanently repeal and
replace the Sustainable Growth Rate, a badly flawed formula that had
repeatedly threatened drastic cuts to physicians' Medicare payments and
reduced access to medical services for Medicare beneficiaries. I have
been fighting to secure reforms to the Medicare payment system for 17
years to ensure that seniors can keep their doctors and to put Medicare
on a long-term, sustainable path. With this legislation, Congress has
taken an important first step forward on strengthening Medicare and
reforming entitlements.
WWII Veterans Fly-In
It was an honor this week to welcome members of
the "Greatest Generation"
to our nation's capital. This
special event was part of the Roswell
Rotary Club's Honor Air program, which provides
these heroes a free day trip to visit the WWII Memorial. As a nation we
must never forget the sacrifices of these brave men and women who
selflessly served in battle so future generations could live in
freedom.
Returning Education to Local Hands
Much of my week was spent on amending and eventually passing out of
committee the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization
legislation that will come to the Senate floor. Most recently known as
No Child Left Behind, the new Elementary and Secondary Education Act
will do exactly what I have been working toward for many years, and
that is to begin putting education progress and decisions back in the
hands of parents, teachers, and state and local governments. The
legislation passed unanimously out of the Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee on Thursday.
The Fight Against Ambush Elections
On Tuesday, I continued the fight to end ambush union elections by
joining my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and House to introduce the
Workforce Democracy and Fairness Act
. This legislation will preserve
long-standing union election procedures by safeguarding the rights of
workers to make informed decisions about union representation, ensuring
the ability of employers to communicate with their employees, and
protecting the privacy of workers and their families.
I have been fighting against these unfair rulings by the National Labor
Relations Board since President Obama took office. This bill protects
free speech and ensures that workers are afforded the opportunity to
make informed decisions about their right to organize, while
safeguarding their personal information and privacy.
Using Our Offshore Energy Resources
Last week, I joined senators from other Southeast Atlantic states by
sending a letter to the leadership of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee
requesting that our states receive a
portion of revenue from offshore energy production, just as Gulf Coast
states currently receive, for oil and gas drilling off their shores.
This would help our state create new jobs, generate new revenue and
make the United States more energy secure.
Easter and Passover Recess
It was a pleasure to be home visiting constituents all over the state
during this last recess. I especially enjoyed the opportunity to
visit Dr. Chuck Bullock's class at the
University of Georgia. These students are the future leaders of our
nation and I was privileged to speak with them.
Also, I am looking forward to meeting with more students at my annual
Military Academy Day
on May 9, 2015. This event is the largest
of its kind in the country, and it is designed to familiarize students
in grades eight through 12 with the application and nomination process
for our nation's five military service academies. In addition to
meeting members of the Georgia delegation, students can also meet
representatives from all five academies.
What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will resume consideration of the Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015
, and I will continue to urge my colleagues to
pass this important legislation to end modern slavery.
Additionally, the Senate will consider the Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act of 2015
.

Johnny Isakson

Dear
Friends,
This
week,
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
took
action
to
protect
our
nation's
security
by
unanimously
passing
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
of
2015 .
I
was
proud
to
vote
in
support
of
this
critical
legislation,
which
allows
Congress
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
American
people
by
examining
each
detail
of
a
proposed
nuclear
agreement
between
the
United
States
and
Iran.
We
must
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
Iran
from
achieving
a
nuclear
weapons
capability.
Relaxing
sanctions
against
Iran
should
not
even
be
a
consideration
until
Iran
ends
its
work
toward
obtaining
these
weapons.
I
remain
very
concerned
about
a
nuclear
agreement
in
part
because
there
are
reports
of
conflicting
details
about
the
agreed-upon
framework
for
a
deal
with
Iran.
As
I
told
Fox
News'
Maria
Bartiromo
on
Sunday ,
I
believe
this
administration
is
negotiating
what
the
other
side
wants
before
securing
our
own
national
interests.

On

I

Congress
to

simpler
tax
code,
to
remove
Americans'
personal
health
information
from
tax
returns,
and
to
abolish
the
IRS
once
and
for
all.
I
am
proud
to
say
that
I
co-sponsored
the
Fair
Tax
Act
of
2015
in
January
to
abolish
the
IRS.
Medicare
Physician
Access
This
week
the
Senate
passed
legislation
to
permanently
repeal
and
replace
the
Sustainable
Growth
Rate,
a
badly
flawed
formula
that
had
repeatedly
threatened
drastic
cuts
to
physicians'
Medicare
payments
and
reduced
access
to
medical
services
for
Medicare
beneficiaries.
I
have
been
fighting
to
secure
reforms
to
the
Medicare
payment
system
for
17
years
to
ensure
that
seniors
can
keep
their
doctors
and
to
put
Medicare
on
a
long-term,
sustainable
path.
With
this
legislation,
Congress
has
taken
an
important
first
step
forward
on
strengthening
Medicare
and
reforming
entitlements.

It
was
an

of
the
"Greatest

to
our

This
special
event
was

of
the
Roswell

which
provides
these

As

we
must
never

the

of
these
brave
men
and
women
who
selflessly
served
in
battle
so
future
generations
could

Returning
Education
to
Local
Hands
Much
of
my
week
was
spent
on
amending
and
eventually
passing
out
of
committee
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act
reauthorization
legislation
that
will
come
to
the
Senate
floor.
Most
recently
known
as
No
Child
Left
Behind ,
the
new
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act
will
do
exactly
what
I
have
been
working
toward
for
many
years,
and
that
is
to
begin
putting
education
progress
and
decisions
back
in
the
hands
of
parents,
teachers,
and
state
and
local
governments.
The
legislation
passed
unanimously
out
of
the
Health,
Education,
Labor
and
Pensions
Committee
on
Thursday.
The
Fight
Against
Ambush
Elections
On
Tuesday,
I
continued
the
fight
to
end
ambush
union
elections
by
joining
my
colleagues
in
the
U.S.
Senate
and
House
to
introduce
the
Workforce
Democracy
and
Fairness
Act .
This
legislation
will
preserve
long-standing
union
election
procedures
by
safeguarding
the
rights
of
workers
to
make
informed
decisions
about
union
representation,
ensuring
the
ability
of
employers
to
communicate
with
their
employees,
and
protecting
the
privacy
of
workers
and
their
families.
I
have
been
fighting
against
these
unfair
rulings
by
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board
since
President
Obama
took
office.
This
bill
protects
free
speech
and
ensures
that
workers
are
afforded
the
opportunity
to
make
informed
decisions
about
their
right
to
organize,
while
safeguarding
their
personal
information
and
privacy.
Using
Our
Offshore

Resources
Last

I
joined
senators
from
other
Southeast
Atlantic
states
by
sending
a
letter
to
the
leadership
of
the
Senate
Energy
and
Natural
Resources
Committee
requesting
that
our
states
receive
a
portion
of
revenue
from
offshore
energy
production,
just
as
Gulf
Coast
states
currently
receive,
for
oil
and
gas
drilling
off
their
shores.
This
would
help
our
state
create
new
jobs,
generate
new
revenue
and
make
the
United
States
more
energy
secure.
Easter
and
Passover
Recess
It
was
a
pleasure
to
be
home
visiting
constituents
all

the
state
during
this
last
recess.
I
especially
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to

Dr.
Chuck

at
the
University
of
Georgia.
These
students
are
the
future
leaders
of
our
nation
and
I
was
privileged
to
speak
with
them.
Also,
I
am
looking
forward
to
meeting
with
more
students
at
my
annual
Military
Academy
Day
on
May
9,
2015.
This
event
is
the
largest
of
its
kind
in
the
country,
and
it
is
designed
to
familiarize
students
in
grades
eight
through
12
with
the
application
and
nomination
process
for
our
nation's
five
military
service
academies.
In
addition
to
meeting
members
of
the
Georgia
delegation,
students
can
also
meet
representatives
from
all
five
academies.
What's
on
Tap?
Next
week,
the
Senate
will
resume
consideration
of
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
of
2015 ,
and
I
will
continue
to
urge
my
colleagues
to
pass
this important
legislation
to
end
modern
slavery.
Additionally,
the
Senate
will
consider
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
of
2015 .
