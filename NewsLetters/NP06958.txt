David,
I normally have mixed feelings about my birthday, what with getting a year older and all.
But this year was truly something special. I can't tell you how overwhelmed I am by the outpouring of support and friendship I have received. In the heat of a very competitive election, your kind words and good wishes have made this birthday one of my best ever.
I am blessed to have you on my team.
Thanks for making my day wonderful.
Regards,
Brad
