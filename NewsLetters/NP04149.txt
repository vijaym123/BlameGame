The
application to build the Keystone XL pipeline was submitted to the U.S.
Department of State over six years ago.
The Keystone XL is a simple
extension of the existing Keystone pipeline and represents a great
opportunity to strengthen our domestic energy security and provide Americans
with jobs.
On November 14, the House again passed
legislation to build this infrastructure project by a vote of 252 to 161.
Then the Harry Reid-led Senate rejected legislation to move
forward on the pipeline by one vote on November 18.
There is
strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to build this
pipeline, but President Obama has repeatedly dragged his feet delaying
construction of this state-of-the-art energy infrastructure project.
The House and Senate will send legislation next year to President
Obama and he will have to act.
Time will tell if President Obama
will veto this legislation and say no to the jobs and domestic energy
security that would come with the construction of the Keystone
XL.
The Keystone XL is an opportunity to lessen our dependence
on oil from the Middle East.
The U.S. Department of Energy
indicated the pipeline would be able to move up to 830,000 barrels of oil
per day.
This is half the amount of oil our country imports from
the Middle East.
Construction of the pipeline would also
support 42,100 jobs, both direct and indirect, according to the U.S.
Department of State's Environmental Impact Statement.
I
remain steadfast in finding a solution to ensure the Keystone XL gets
built so we can strengthen our domestic energy security while providing
hard working Americans with good paying jobs.
