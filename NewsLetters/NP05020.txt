I don't know about you, David, but I would rather not be kicking myself the day after this election.
I just can't stand the idea of dealing with Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McConnell and the biggest Republican majority since Truman was President.
So David, I&rsquo;m asking you to lend a hand.
My friends at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are doing great work. They&rsquo;ve already knocked on more than 3 million doors and registered tens of thousands of voters -- but they&rsquo;re looking to rev up their get-out-the-vote program for the final push to Election Day. They need to invest another $33O,OOO in to battleground races. Can you chip in $5 or more today? All Donations to this Email
Triple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Donna
