Blaine's Bulletin
This Veterans Day, it is important to give recognition to the brave men and women who served this country with great honor and distinction. Not only do our veterans deserve our respect and gratitude, but we also need to recognize the sacrifices made in defense of America to protect the liberties we enjoy each and every day.
This year, Congress made some positive steps forward in improving care for our nations veterans. Earlier this year, the House and the Senate came to a bipartisan agreement, and the president signed into law, legislation that would repair and improve our Veterans Affairs (VA) system.
This law made several reforms, including provisions which would allow veterans to receive care at non-Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and a requirement that the VA provide a Veterans Choice Card for eligible veterans to receive care provided by non-VA providers. Eligible veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health system as of August 1, 2014, newly discharged veterans who are unable to secure an appointment at a VA facility within 30 days, or veterans who live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility.
This law is a great first step in improving our nations care to our veterans. However, I know there are still many questions lingering about this law or veterans benefits, in general. That is why, on November 25, I am holding my fifth Veterans Benefits Workshop. This workshop is organized to provide assistance to 3 rd
district constituents who have served our nation. My staff and I will lead a discussion and assist veterans from 10 a.m. to noon at 100 North Main St. in OFallon, Mo.
Whether a veteran has a question about benefits, the new VA law, or is looking for job opportunities, this workshop provides the necessary information needed to receive the service they deserve from the VA. This workshop is designed to provide free advice and guidance for those who need assistance filing veterans claims applications, completing necessary documents, as well as understanding how the VA processes claims.
As a member of Congress, the least I can do is ensure the veterans in the 3 rd
Congressional District are receiving the benefits and assistance you deserve and I will continue oversight over the VA to prevent history from repeating itself.
Without our nations veterans, we would not have the rights and privileges that we take for granted as Americans.
Our veterans are the reason that our nation stands as a shining example for other freedom-loving nations around world.
