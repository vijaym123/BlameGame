Dear Friend:
It has been another busy two weeks in Washington, DC, and throughout
North and Northwest Florida. In order to keep you up-to-date, this
week's newsletter includes the latest news and developments from
Florida's Second Congressional District.
Fighting for Gadsden County
I was extremely disappointed to learn that the administration had
chosen to close the doors on Quincy's Social Security Administration
(SSA) office on March 28th. With more than a quarter of Gadsden County's
residents living below the poverty line, the closure will have a
devastating impact on the well-being of local seniors and disabled
residents who will no longer have easy access to the SSA's services.
For this reason, I authored a letter to U.S. Commissioner of Social
Security Carolyn W. Colvin requesting an immediate meeting regarding
the closure and reinforcing the need to explore other options that will
keep these vital services in place in Gadsden County.

Meeting with North Florida Job Creators
As North and Northwest Florida continues to diversify our economic
opportunities and grow jobs, I fully understand the impact that
decisions made in Washington can have on hardworking families and job
creators back home. This past week, I had the pleasure of meeting with
Mettron Contracting President Sharen Hannah to tour a construction site
on FAMU's campus and discuss issues relating to the local construction
business. I also toured a Tallahassee Lowe's Home Improvement to meet
employees and see the store's operations firsthand.
Military Service Academy Day 2014
I recently hosted our annual Military Service Academy Day in Panama
City and Tallahassee. Academy Days provide young people with an
interest in serving America an opportunity to meet academy
representatives, cadets and midshipmen. If you know someone who has an
interest in attending one of our U.S. Service Academies, please click

Speaking with North Florida Students
Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking to high school students at
Rutherford and Bay High Schools in Panama City. As always, I was very
impressed with the engagement and depth of knowledge displayed by the
juniors and seniors. I am looking forward to continuing such visits to
other high schools on a regular basis.
Remembering Governor Askew
Florida lost a great public servant this week when former Governor
Reubin Askew passed away. Governor Askew holds a special place in the
hearts of the Southerland Family, as he appointed my grandfather to the
Florida funeral regulatory board in the early 1970s.
His legacy will
live on and his commitment to the people of Florida will not be
forgotten.
I join my fellow Floridians in offering my thoughts and
prayers to the Governor's family and friends during this difficult time.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
