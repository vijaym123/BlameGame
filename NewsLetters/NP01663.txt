Hi David --
I need a quick second. Take our 1-question survey and tell us what issues are important to you.
Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m counting on your response: Congress returns to session next week. That means our team needs 100,000 Democrats to respond by Friday afternoon to move our agenda forward. Your response is pivotal to our success.
So before Congress gets back to work next week -- will you take one minute to let me know what your top issues are?
Equal pay &gt;&gt;
Social Security and Medicare &gt;&gt; College affordability &gt;&gt; Climate change &gt;&gt; Something else? Let me know &gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;m reaching out to you because you&rsquo;re a top Democrat. You&rsquo;re paying attention to key issues. It&rsquo;s your feedback that helps guide our decision-making every day.
Share your input with us, so we know what to focus on in the coming weeks.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to your response,
Ben Ray Luj&aacute;n
