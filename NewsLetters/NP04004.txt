New Report Debunks Benghazi Conspiracy
Theories
The House
Intelligence Committee has spent nearly two years looking at every
aspect of the Intelligence Communitys activities during and after the
terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which
killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
The
Committee recently released its final
report .
In
the words of the Republican Chair of the Committee, Rep. Rogers of
Michigan, the bipartisan panel concluded that there was no stand down
order issued by or to the intelligence community personnel, and there
was no denial of air support to intelligence community officers on the
ground.
The Committee report also shows there was no
intelligence failure surrounding the Benghazi attacks.
Even with the results of this latest
investigation in hand, House Speaker Boehner recently announced plans to
commission yet another taxpayer-financed investigation of Benghazi, which
would be the 8 th
investigation into these
events.
No Social Security for Nazis
Act Clears House
Responding to recent revelations that some Nazi war criminals who
moved to the United States after WWII were receiving Social Security
benefits, Rep. Levin and other concerned lawmakers introduced
legislation [ H.R. 5739 ], the No Social Security for
Nazis Act.
The bill stops Social Security benefit payments to those
denaturalized due to participation in Nazi persecutions or who
voluntarily renounced their citizenship as part of a settlement with the
Department of Justice related to their participation in such
persecutions.
Congress never
intended for Nazi war criminals and collaborators to be able to receive
Social Security benefits.
This bipartisan legislation reaffirms
that intent, said Rep. Levin.
The House approved H.R. 5739 on
December 2.
Rep. Levin Supports Resources Needed to Combat Ebola
Outbreak
Rep.
Levin recently joined over 60 of his House colleagues in writing a
letter
to the House
Appropriations Committee to support the Obama Administrations emergency
funding request to strengthen the U.S. response to Ebola.
The
Administration has requested $6.18 billion to be invested throughout various
government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, USAID, and the Department of Defense, to name a few.
These funds will enable to the United States to continue the vital and
lifesaving work necessary to bring an end to the largest and most
widespread outbreak of Ebola ever at its source in West Africa, safeguard
the American public from further spread of the disease, and support the
development of innovative
treatments.
House Approves Girls Count
Act
In some
countries around the world, girls and women still struggle for the
right to go to school, own property, and control their own destiny.
Rep. Levin has been a long-time supporter of legislation that would
increase the agency of women around the world, and decrease
discrimination and abuse.
On
November 19, the House passed the Girls Count Act [ H.R.
3398 ], which authorizes the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Department of State to support and promote
programs that will improve birth registration and vital statistics
registration systems.
The bill also encourages those agencies to support
programs that address discrimination against girls, and that enhance
property rights for women.
H.R. 3398 is awaiting consideration in
the U.S. Senate.
