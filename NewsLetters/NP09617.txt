The Center for Immigration Studies recently
reported
that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released over 36,000 convicted criminals in deportation proceedings in Fiscal Year 2013 alone. Those released back into the public include individuals convicted of homicide, sexual assault, or drunk driving.
Last month, I joined House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte and other members of the Committee in sending a
letter
to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Johnson requesting the number of criminal illegal immigrants released into U.S. communities and the specific crimes they committed.
The letter also asks why they were released in the first place, and the legal justification for not prioritizing these individuals for detainment and removal.
To date, the Department has failed to respond to the letter.
I will continue working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to hold the Administration accountable, keep our communities safe, and get the answers the American people deserve.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I have also
introduced
legislation to provide the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General with the power to deport or make inadmissible an individual who they know or have reason to believe is, or was, a member of a criminal gang and/or participated in criminal gang activities.
