Friend,
Wow. I can&#39;t thank you enough for all that you do. It was pretty remarkable to see the way that everything came together in the days before the June 3rd primary.
Our grassroots volunteers, donors and supporters all stepped up to the plate in a big way.
Here are the results:
Bera - 47%
Ose - 27%
Birman - 17%
Emken - 7%
We had a strong showing yesterday, but we know the tough race we have ahead of us. We still have work to do to ensure we earn over 50% of the vote in November. How will we do that? By staying just as involved, and keeping up our grassroots energy.

As for me, I&#39;ll rest today. I&#39;ll spend some long overdue time with Janine and Syd, run some errands, and go to an event tonight in support of one of our favorite non-profits, the Sacramento Tree Foundation.
But tomorrow - right back at it. There is still so much we need to do to give our parents and grandparents, our veterans, and our children, the present and the future that they deserve.
Onward. Let&#39;s go win in November.
Be Well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S. Because of your amazing support during our dollar-for-dollar matching program we raised over $36,000 - our best online fundraising drive ever! Thank you.
