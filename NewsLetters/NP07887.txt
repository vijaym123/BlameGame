Friends,
I'm writing today about two bills I'm backing to help address the border crisis.
To be clear, the Obama Administration has failed to secure our borders and has loosely interpreted the law to allow tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States.
The first step to bringing an end to this crisis is to amend the law so its clear that illegal immigrants from Central America and elsewhere can and will be quickly deported.
I believe this will be a deterrent and ultimately the best humanitarian action we can take because it will spare people, especially children, from the extraordinary dangers of the journey to our southern border.
The president has also failed to communicate the gravity of this crisis to the American people. The public deserves to know how many illegal immigrants have crossed the border, where they are located in the United States, how many have missed court appearances, as well as other critical information.
Here are the specifics on the two bills that I outlined above:
The Expedited Family Reunification Act of 2014 (H.R. 5053) amends the 2008 Human Trafficking and Victims Protection Act to allow for the expedited deportation of unaccompanied children.
H.R. 5015 forces the Administration to publicly disclose detailed information about the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border, where they are being located throughout the United States and statistics on the judicial process.
We will have to do much more to secure our border, but these are some immediate and practical steps we can take.
Please feel free to contact me with your views on the border crisis. Links to my social networks and phone numbers for our offices are below.
