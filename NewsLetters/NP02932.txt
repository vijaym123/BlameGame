Supporting Small
Business
2/5/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 527, the Small Business
Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2015. This common sense
legislation gives small businesses more of a role in the regulatory process,
eliminates loopholes used by the IRS to avoid timely communication with
small business owners, and ensures that agencies review and reduce
existing regulations.
"With
half of Americans working at a small business, why shouldn't
hard-working taxpayers have fewer costly regulations placing their jobs in
jeopardy? H.R. 527 will cut back on the burdens placed on our job
creators by an out-of-control federal
government."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
