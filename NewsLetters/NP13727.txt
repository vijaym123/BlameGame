Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter! Here are some of the
issues I've been working on this week:
Budget Proposal
I have long said that Washington's method of budgeting from crisis to
crisis is no way to run a business, much less the federal government.
This kind of short-term, band-aid budgeting was at the root of October's
government shutdown and it certainly isn't the best way for Congress to
responsibly manage taxpayer dollars.
That's why I was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were able to
come together this week to negotiate a long-term budget agreement that
makes tough choices about spending.
However, I do have significant concerns about this proposal. First and
foremost, it asks too much from the men and women of our military, who
would be forced to sacrifice thousands of dollars from their retirement
funds. In fact, one estimate says that a 42-year old retiring at the
rank of Lt. Colonel would lose nearly $110,000.
I'm also skeptical about the way this plan structures new spending and
new savings. We will see two years of new spending up front offset by
savings spread over a decade. Unfortunately, that makes it all too easy
for Congress to undo these savings a few years down the road.
I'm encouraged by the willingness we've seen from both sides to sit
down and negotiate a budget agreement for the first time in years, but
I will not be able to support this plan.
Harry Reid's Power Grab
Last month, Senate Democrats led by Harry Reid changed the rules in
order to make it easier for them to confirm nominees who support their
agenda. This is an unprecedented power grab that diminishes the ability
of the Senate to uphold its constitutional duties. I spoke on the
Senate floor during an all-night debate earlier this week:

you.

Dear
Friends,
Thank
you
for
subscribing
to
my
e-newsletter!
Here
are
some
of
the
issues
I&#8217;ve
been
working
on
this
week:
Budget
Proposal
I
have
long
said
that
Washington&#8217;s
method
of
budgeting
from
crisis
to
crisis
is
no
way
to
run
a
business,
much
less
the
federal
government.
This
kind
of
short-term,
band-aid
budgeting
was
at
the
root
of
October&#8217;s
government
shutdown
and
it
certainly
isn&#8217;t
the
best
way
for
Congress
to
responsibly
manage
taxpayer
dollars.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
encouraged
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
were
able
to
come
together
this
week
to
negotiate
a
long-term
budget
agreement
that
makes
tough
choices
about
spending.
However,
I
do
have
significant
concerns
about
this
proposal.
First
and
foremost,
it
asks
too
much
from
the
men
and
women
of
our
military,
who
would
be
forced
to
sacrifice
thousands
of
dollars
from
their
retirement
funds.
In
fact,
one
estimate
says
that
a
42-year
old
retiring
at
the
rank
of
Lt.
Colonel
would
lose
nearly
$110,000.
I&#8217;m
also
skeptical
about
the
way
this
plan
structures
new
spending
and
new
savings.
We
will
see
two
years
of
new
spending
up
front
offset
by
savings
spread
over
a
decade.
Unfortunately,
that
makes
it
all
too
easy
for
Congress
to
undo
these
savings
a
few
years
down
the
road.
I&#8217;m
encouraged
by
the
willingness
we&#8217;ve
seen
from
both
sides
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
a
budget
agreement
for
the
first
time
in
years,
but
I
will
not
be
able
to
support
this
plan.
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
Power

Last

Harry
Reid

is
an

that
diminishes
the

of
the

its
constitutional
duties.
