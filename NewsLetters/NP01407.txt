David -- Huge news just broke:
Hillary Clinton just laid out her top priorities at her first campaign event -- and called for an END of dark money in politics.
How inspiring is this?! Hillary announced:
&ldquo;We need to fix the dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all
-- even if that takes a constitutional amendment!&rdquo;
Hillary is right -- our campaign finance system is broken. We can&rsquo;t let the Republicans buy any more elections. It&rsquo;s time to get big money out of politics NOW! Add your name: Demand Congress pass a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United!
Let&rsquo;s get one million Democrats on board!
