Statement on the Framework Agreement with
Iran
Congressman Doug
Lamborn has issued a statement, following the recent announcement of a
framework nuclear agreement with Iran.
Im afraid that President Obama and Secretary of State
Kerry are selling snake oil on this nuclear deal with Iran. Iran gets
to keep their underground nuclear research facility with centrifuges in
place. Iran is not required to come clean on the past military
dimensions of their nuclear program. Additionally, we are supposed to trust
that Iran will be unable to operate a covert nuclear program. Im also
afraid that President Obama has turned his back on American allies in
the Middle East and elsewhere by agreeing to Irans nuclear
enrichment program.
The Obama
Administration must be completely transparent with Congress and with
the American people on the details of this deal. This is too important
to simply trust the Iranians or hope that the Iranians wont develop a
bomb covertly. Any final deal must be approved by
Congress.
