Demanding Action on the Keystone XL Pipeline
President Obama has had 5 years to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline and
bring much-needed jobs to the United States, but he continues to stall.
This past week, I joined 55 of my colleagues on a bill that would give
Congress the authority to finally approve the pipeline, cutting out the
politics that are being played with this important energy measure.
I spoke on the Senate floor in support of American energy independence
and finally building the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Keeping our Promise to South Carolina
South Carolina agreed to have a mixed oxide nuclear fuel (MOX) plant
built in our state at the Savannah River Site in order to fulfill an
international treaty to dispose of 68 metric tons of weapons grade
nuclear material -not to allow it to sit half-finished while dangerous
radioactive material is stored in the state.
Through letters to President Obama and DoE Secretary Moniz as well as
multiple meetings with Secretary Moniz, joint efforts have been
successful in keeping construction of the plant going through the end
of this fiscal year.
It has been an integral part of agreements with
Russia and other countries, and will be used to produce nuclear fuel
that can be part of an effective "all of the above" strategy for
American energy.

Obamacare Must Go
My stance on Obamacare hasn't changed, and with the confirmation
hearing for Sylvia Burwell as the President's new Department of Health
and Human Services Secretary this coming week, we have an opportunity
to ask some very important questions.
Obamacare must be repealed and
replaced with sensible reforms, and it seems unlikely that Secretary
Burwell or anyone else could fix the mess this bad legislation has
made.
In case you missed it, you can read the guest post I wrote for
Red State here

It is an honor to represent you in the United States Sunday, and my
