Dear Friend &ndash;
Representing Orange County in Congress and working for you back home is truly an honor and a privilege. As 2014 draws to a close, I want to share with you some of what I've been working on this year.
Over the course of the year, my casework team
resolved over 150 issues
between residents and federal agencies. In total, we
helped return almost $145,000 to residents
from federal agencies like the Veterans Administration and the Social Security Administration.
Throughout 2014 I visited countless schools and businesses and held over
47 Orange County community events , including:
13 income
tax assistance
days
10 events about the
Affordable Care Act
7 college
financial aid
nights
7 workshops and information sessions for
veterans, students and homeowners
6 Town Halls
In Washington, D.C,
I sponsored and co-sponsored 54 bills , including:
The Middle Class CHANCE Act , which makes college more affordable by restoring the strength of federal Pell Grants
The Central American and USA Initiatives Act , which addresses the humanitarian crisis at our border by helping secure Mexico&rsquo;s southern border and making our short term detention standards more humane
The Human Trafficking Detection Act , which gives Homeland Security officials the training they need to identify trafficking victims and save lives
The She is Ready (SIR) Act , which removes artificial barriers for women to enter military combat positions
And as your voice in Congress, I make it a priority to listen to and respond to your concerns. This year,
I sent almost 30,000 pieces of mail or email in response to resident inquiries . Please always feel to reach out to my office with any question or concerns &ndash; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.
Thank you for staying connected to my office, and I hope to keep in touch in 2015.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
