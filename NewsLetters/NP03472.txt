Dear David,
Twenty-two veterans commit
suicide every dayand this must stop.
Our nations most
sacred oath to veterans is to provide them with the best possible care upon
their return. One veteran lost to suicide is one veteran too
many.
Thats why Im a proud cosponsor of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt
Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act, which I voted for
this week as it unanimously passed the U.S. House of Representatives.
This bill is named after Clay Hunt, a veteran who
committed suicide on March 31, 2011. Clay was one of nearly 600,000
veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who suffer from traumatic brain
injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. I hope that the
Senate will quickly pass this bill so it can be signed into law by
President Obama, and our veterans can start receiving better mental health
services.
The original G.I. Bill of 1944 recognized that
veterans have made greater sacrifices than the rest of us, and they are
entitled to definite action to help take care of the special problems.
I believe that the Clay Hunt SAV Act is yet another step toward
ensuring that our veterans have access to the care they deserve. I look
forward to continuing to work to fulfill our obligation to care for our
veterans, especially the more than 70,000 veterans living in the
Rochester area.
If you or someone you know is a veteran who needs
help, the VA Veterans Crisis Line is 1-800-273-8255. I urge you to reach
out for assistance.
Sincerely,
Louise
