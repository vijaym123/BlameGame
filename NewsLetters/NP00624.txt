CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER ON CNN:
GROWING NEXUS BETWEEN ORGANIZED CRIME AND
TERRORISTS
This morning, I joined
CNN's Carol Costello to discuss the need to target operational funding
for terrorist organizations, including ISIS.
Click here for full video
of Congressman Pittenger's
interview with CNN's Carol
Costello.
Their recent capture of another archeological site is part
of a strategic effort by ISIS to sell these antiquities over the black
market.
They did the same thing in Mosul, and they'll go
wherever they can to find resources.
ISIS thinks
strategically about what they need to do in terms of trade-based money
laundering and other means to find resources and convert into cash as
needed.
As a highly-complex organization, they need food,
medical supplies, and other resources to continue fighting their
war.
Their financing efforts now include working through
international criminal organizations.
As Vice
Chairman of the Bipartisan Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, I
am preparing legislation to increase collaboration between banks to
help them better track and identify terrorism financing moving through
the global financial system.
To learn more about our efforts to
target terrorism financing, please call my Washington office at
202-225-1976.
The nexus between criminal elements and
terrorist groups are continuing to grow.
These people are
not backyard criminals.
They are very knowledgeable, and very
capable.
