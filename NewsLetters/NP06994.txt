Confronting
ISIS
The brutal murder of American journalist Jim Foley by the terrorist
organization ISIS
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
was meant
to send a message to the United States. ISIS, which controls an area
the size of Belgium that some analysts describe as Syr-Rac, was
described yesterday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel as, beyond anything we
have seen. They represent a clear danger to the region and to the
United States.
The Administration needs to send a clear
message back to these barbarians: we will firmly and decisively act to
protect our nation and our people from these terrorists. No more
'redlines' to ponder as intellectual constructs, please!
Yesterdays
Wall Street Journal
editorial
makes
this point clearly and convincingly.
Hows the Pivot
to the Pacific Going?
As chair of the House
Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I just returned from leading a
Congressional delegation to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore where
I met with public officials and other leaders, including Philippine
President Benigno Aquino, to evaluate the progress (or lack thereof) of
President Obamas much-heralded pivot to the Pacific.
The
delegation included Congresswoman Kay Granger (TX-12) (who is the vice
chair of my committee and also the chair of the House Foreign
Operations Appropriations Subcommittee), Congressman Ken Calvert (CA-42) and
Congressman James Moran (VA-8).
I also visited with members
of our Armed Forces, all volunteers, who are stationed in this region
of the world and thanked them for their service.

information about my fact-finding mission can be found

A Threat to the Medicine Chest of
the World
New Jersey has long been known as the
Medicine Chest of the World due to the many life-saving medical
innovations created here by the men and women (many of whom are my
constituents in the 11 th
Congressional District) who work in our
states pharmaceutical, life sciences, and biotechnology
industries.
The United States has far outpaced the rest of the world in the
discovery and development of new treatments and therapies to battle
disease. As this
piece
from the
Wall Street
Journal makes clear, our standing as the world leader will be at
risk if we institute price controls on the innovative medicines and
products that do so much to improve the health of people around the
world.
Turkey:
NATO
Ally?
Worth a
read : who would think Turkey would ever
replace Egypt as the major player in the Middle East? That was the
assumption given conditions that developed in Egypt, prior to and after
President Morsi's removal.
But Turkeys new reelected prime
minister has made some deeply disturbing statements recently that call into
question whether Turkey will be a reliable partner in the
region.
Perhaps when the Kurds move further towards their ultimate
goal of establishing Kurdistan, which to a great extent already exists,
our NATO 'partner' may reexamine their leader's deliberate 'pivot' away
from the secular Turkish state established by their modern founder,
Ataturk.
And, considering the overall state of American
foreign policy, the Administration has done a pretty good job of
alienating just about anyone who is a player!
Boehner: GAO
Confirms Obama Administration Ignored the Law on the Taliban
Five
This
is worth a
read.
Salute: Centenarian Herman Hy
Goldman
Hanover Township's own Herman Hy Goldman recently celebrated
his 101 st
birthday, which in and of itself is a cause for
celebration. But what makes this Whippany World War II veteran extra-
special is the fact that he is still working
and at the same employer
he joined 73 years ago! Mr. Goldman began working for Capitol Lighting
in East Hanover back in 1941, and except for a brief interruption to
serve in the U.S. Army, hes been there ever since!
Visit
CBS News/New Yorks website for a heartwarming
story
about this remarkable man, who proves youre only as old as you
feel!
Salute: James Caldwell Post 185 American
Legion
Congratulations to the members of the James
Caldwell Post 185 American Legion on receiving the S.M. Sam Kent
Service Above Self Award from the Rotary Club of the Caldwells. Post 185
was recognized for raising more than $12,000 to assist families who
lost their homes in a fire this past January.
I salute the
members of Post 185 for their service to the community and the Rotary
Club of the Caldwells for the work they do to put service above
self.
