WOW -- I
literally
cannot believe this:
This morning, Nancy Pelosi asked you to step up for Brad. When I went to check the numbers, I saw something AMAZING:
Your response was spectacular (ok, I expected that)
But as of 3pm, we&rsquo;re within striking distance of $1 MILLION(!!!) raised online for Brad.
SERIOUSLY.
$1,000,000.00 has
A LOT
of zeroes. And honestly, your support
COULD NOT
have come at better time. Why? This week alone, Boehner and billionaire Republicans are pounding the Chicago airwaves with over $2.5 million against Brad.
So David, we need your help right away.
Chip in for Brad, answer Nancy's call-to-action, and help us reach $1 MILLION strong!
