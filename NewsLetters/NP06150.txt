Want to know the problem with the Koch Brothers?
-- It&rsquo;s not that they are conservative.
-- And it&rsquo;s not that they are billionaires. The problem with the Kochs is simple -- they&rsquo;re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to drown out the voices of millions of voters.
Progressive proposals like raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid sick leave are overwhelmingly popular. But the Koch brothers stand against them. They&rsquo;re fighting for tax breaks for billionaires (like themselves).
This November, we have the chance to elect Democrats who will fight for a fairer America. But we need to take on Republican outside spending first. That's why it's so critical you and I raise $1,OOO,OOO before Wednesday's ad buy deadline to fight Koch-funded attacks with the facts.
This is one of the most critical ad buy deadlines of the entire election. Can you pitch in $5 right now? All Gifts Today Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
