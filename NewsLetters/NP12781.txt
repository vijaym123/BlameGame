David -- We're not making this up.
The
Washington Post
just named Cheri&rsquo;s reelection one of the TOP TEN races in the entire country.
Despite that, Cheri&rsquo;s opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, just couldn&rsquo;t contain his true Tea Party colors.
In an utterly shameful and crude email to his donors, Schilling called pro-choice advocates supporters of genocide.
Cheri defeated Bobby Schilling once. It&rsquo;s clear he hasn&rsquo;t learned any lessons. Let&rsquo;s do it again in 2014 and make sure his Tea Party nonsense doesn&rsquo;t return to Congress. MIDNIGHT DEADLINE:
Chip in $3 right now to help Cheri hit back against Schilling&rsquo;s divisive anti-woman agenda &gt;&gt;
Cheri&rsquo;s fighting hard to keep jobs in the Quad Cities and to help our veterans and seniors get the services they&rsquo;ve earned.
Let&rsquo;s keep her fighting for Illinois&rsquo; 17th district in 2014 and beyond. http://action.cheribustos.com/Midnight-Deadline
Thanks for having Cheri&rsquo;s back,
Alex
