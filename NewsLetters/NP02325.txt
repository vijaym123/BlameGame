The Supreme Court just heard arguments for
King v. Burwell , a case that could
destroy
the Affordable Care Act (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) -- the successful health care reform law that&rsquo;s insured 11 million people and counting.
The consequences of a negative ruling would be devastating.
MSNBC
reports that &ldquo;if [the Supreme Court] sides with the plaintiffs,
it could spark a crisis that could force upwards of 9.6 million people off insurance in as many as 37 states.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s absolutely outrageous.
Tell the Supreme Court: Protect the health care of millions of Americans! Over 52,000 supporters have already signed on -- can we get to 75,000 by midnight tonight?
King v. Burwell
was bankrolled by right-wing activists who want to dismantle President Obama&rsquo;s landmark law at any cost -- even if it means ripping health care away from millions of people. It&rsquo;s not just us saying it -- the
New York Times
called the case a &ldquo;baseless attack on one of the most important pieces of social legislation of the last generation.&rdquo;
We need your help to fight back. Tell the Supreme Court: Don&rsquo;t destroy Obamacare!
Thanks,
