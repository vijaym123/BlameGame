Congratulations to the record number of talented
artists who entered the competition this year. These impressive pieces show
that these students have bright futures ahead. It was a pleasure to
meet Carolina after she won the award last year, and I look forward to
visiting with her and her family again this year to honor her
unprecendeted back-to-back
win.
Carolina's winning artwork will hang in the U.S. Capitol for
one year, displayed alongside artwork from winners across the country.
She will also be invited to an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., in
June.
Megan's
second-place entry will be displayed in Rep. Joyce's Washington D.C.
office. Joanna's third-place entry will hang in Joyce's Painesville
district office, and Emily's fourth-place entry will hang in the
Twinsburg district
office.
Thank you to Mary Urbas and everyone at Lakeland Community College
for hosting our competition and providing a space for these talented
students to display their work.
Strong National Defense
On Friday, I voted for the
National Defense
Authorization Act , which makes sure that our troops have the funding
and resources they need to serve and defend our country. This $612
Billion bill assures our forces are ready to meet an unprecedented array
of threats by establishing sound strategies to protect America.
Honoring Our
Veterans
As the son of a WWII Veteran, one
of the greatest honors of serving in Congress is the chance to greet
the Honor Flights of veterans coming to the National World War II
Memorial. For many, this is their first trip to visit the memorial
honoring their service. It is a remarkable and humbling experience, and
I thank all who have served and sacrificed to make our nation the
greatest on Earth.
Iran
On Thursday, we passed H.R.
1191, Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bill requires
Congressional approval of any deal the Administration negotiates with
Iran, and I was proud to support it.
It is an honor to be your voice in
Congress.
