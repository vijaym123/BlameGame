Last Saturday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) participated in the
170th Commencement exercises at Wittenberg University in Springfield
for the graduating Class of 2015.
"Wittenberg is an extraordinary institution with an exceptional history
of producing leaders since it first opened its doors in 1845," Portman
said. "I was honored to be at Wittenberg to be a part of such a special
occasion for the graduates, their families, and the entire Wittenberg
community for the 170th commencement to celebrate the class of 2015.
Many of the graduates may think this is the end of a journey. The truth
is, after a world-class educational experience at Wittenberg, this is
just the beginning."
On Monday, Portman hosted a roundtable at the Chalmers P. Wylie VA
Ambulatory Care Center to focus on mental health treatment for
veterans. The Columbus VA Care Center houses a local mental health
treatment clinic.
Portman recently introduced the Medical Evaluation Parity for
Servicemembers (MEPS) Act
, legislation which will improve the way the military identifies
and assesses mental health issues. The MEPS Act would institute mental
health assessments for incoming recruits and also ensure servicemembers
separating from active duty receive screenings as well.
Portman also continues to urge
the Department of Veteran Affairs to
establish inpatient care for veterans in the Central Ohio region. With
no Columbus location, veterans and their families are currently forced
to travel across the state to Cincinnati and Dayton to receive
inpatient care. Portman's recommendation comes in response from direct
feedback from Columbus-area veterans during a series of town hall
meetings he hosted over the past summer to focus on VA issues.

On Tuesday, Portman, co-chair of the Senate Caucus to End Human
Trafficking, announced three of his bills to combat human trafficking,
the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, the Ensuring a Better Response
for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking, and major provisions of the
Combat Human Trafficking Act are headed to the President for signature
. These passed the
House and Senate as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act,
a bipartisan and comprehensive trafficking bill introduced by U.S.
Senator John Cornyn (R-TX).
"Today marks an important step in the fight to end this form of
modern-day slavery," Portman stated. "My measures included in the
trafficking bill will allow us to improve the way we find missing
children, strengthen the prosecution against buyers of sex acts from
trafficking victims, rightly define victims of child sex trafficking as
victims of child abuse and ensure that children who are sex trafficked
or sexually exploited are treated as victims, not criminals. We have a
duty to protect the most vulnerable among us, and I'm pleased these
critical measures will now be law so that we can work to end this
heinous crime."
The Bringing Missing Children Home Act
is bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to improve the way
we find missing kids by refining and streamlining how cases of missing
children are handled and enhancing the critical information needed for
law enforcement to investigate cases of missing and abducted children.
Specifically, for the first time ever, law enforcement will be required
to add a photograph to the missing child's file if available. Portman's
bill also replaces the term "child prostitution" with "child sex
trafficking," reinforcing that children who are sex trafficked or
sexually exploited are victims, not criminals, and making it clear that
we must save these children from abuse.
Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking was
originally part of the Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act
, bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to amend the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) to require that child
victims of sex trafficking are considered victims of child abuse. Under
the amendment, CAPTA state plans must also contain provisions and
procedures requiring identification and assessment of all reports
involving children known or suspected to be victims of sex trafficking,
training for child protective services workers to identify and provide
comprehensive services victims and a
description of efforts to
coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and social
service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to better
serve victims of sex trafficking.
The Combat Human Trafficking Act
is bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to strengthen law
enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute all who commit sex
trafficking crimes, particularly the buyers of sex acts from
trafficking victims. Enforcement efforts often focus on prosecuting the
sellers of these acts because of challenges in prosecuting buyers.
Portman's legislation sends a clear message to those who victimize
children that we will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. By
strengthening laws against buyers, we can take steps toward reducing
demand for child victims and ensuring criminals are fully prosecuted.
Also on Tuesday, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) offered an
amendment addressing currency manipulation
to the Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) legislation. The amendment, authored by Portman and
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and cosponsored by Brown, puts
teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding countries
accountable to International Monetary Fund standards. It would add
explicit and enforceable currency language necessary to ensure that
foreign competitors don't use their exchange rates to subsidize their
exports at the expense of products made by American workers. The
amendment is backed by American auto companies and manufacturers such
as Ford, GM, FCA, U.S. Steel, Nucor, and AK Steel.
"When foreign competitors tilt the playing field by manipulating their
currencies, Ohio workers suffer," Portman stated. "That means
American-made exports are more expensive, while our competitors'
exports into the United States are cheaper. That's not fair for
American workers who can compete with anyone on a level playing field.
I'm pleased to introduce this bipartisan amendment that cracks down on
currency manipulation to ensure that our trade negotiators treat
currency rules just as seriously as other negotiating objectives laid
out by Congress."
Portman and Brown also offered an amendment that would level the
playing field for U.S. industries
- like
the steel industry - by increasing their ability to fight back against
unfair foreign trade practices. Last week, the Senate passed the
Leveling the Playing Field Act with bipartisan support as part of the
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reauthorization.
"Ohio workers can compete and win globally, but we must ensure that the
playing field is fair," Portman stated. "I'm pleased to support this
amendment that says we must hold foreign competitors accountable when
they skirt the rules."
Video of Portman discussing these amendments on the Senate floor can be
found here
.
On Wednesday, Portman introduced the State Transportation Flexibility
Act
,
legislation that would allow state transportation departments to opt
out of the Federal-Aid Highway and Mass Transit programs and direct
more gas tax revenues into priority road and bridge projects.
This
will give these states the freedom to manage and spend the gas tax
revenue collected within their states on transportation projects
without federal mandates, while ensuring that the current Interstate
System is maintained by the states.
"This legislation will help to ensure high priority road and bridge
projects, such as the Brent Spence Bridge in my hometown of Cincinnati,
are completed by giving states the freedom to use highway revenue how
they see fit and reducing federal regulations that slow down progress,"
Portman stated. "The one-size-fits-all approach isn't working, and by
returning power to the states, we can put transportation funding on a
sustainable path."

The State Transportation Flexibility Act will put transportation on a
path toward fiscal stability and give states the flexibility they need
to innovate and better align transportation projects with their state
and local needs.

Also on Wednesday, Portman again urged passage of his bipartisan
amendment
to crack
down on currency manipulation that hurts Ohio exports. The amendment
puts teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding countries
accountable when they tilt the playing field against American workers
through currency practices.

On Thursday, Portman introduced the Microbeads Free Waters Act of 2015
, legislation that would address plastic microbeads
which are found in common household products and are detrimental to
wildlife and human health. Because of the detrimental effect microbeads
have on our natural resources, companies have already agreed to phase
them out of production. This bipartisan legislation would implement a
commonsense way for companies across the country to do so on a level
playing field by establishing a definition of microbeads and setting
uniform dates for the prohibition of manufacture and sale of products.
The bill was coauthored by U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and
cosponsored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Mark Kirk
(R-Ill.)
"Plastic microbeads are devastating to wildlife and human health, and
this bill implements a commonsense way to phase them out in a way that's
fair to Ohio companies and keeps them on a level playing field with
their competitors," Portman stated. "Lake Erie is not only one of our
precious natural resources, it's also essential for Ohio jobs and
tourism, and our legislation takes appropriate steps to protect this
important asset for Ohio."
Microbeads are tiny synthetic plastic particles used as an abrasive in
many personal-care and beauty products, such as facial scrubs, soaps
and toothpastes. When consumers use products containing microbeads, the
microbeads don't dissolve, but instead are rinsed down the drain.
Because of the small size and buoyancy of microbeads, they escape
treatment by sewage plants and are discharged into lakes and rivers.

Also on Thursday, Portman and Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) introduced a
bipartisan bill
to make sure that young people and veterans who have faced
homelessness don't have to make the difficult choice between a place to
call home and a good education.
This important legislative fix would close a loophole that prevents
many full-time students-including veterans-from qualifying for
affordable rental housing funded through a key tax credit. Sens.
Portman and Franken's proposal would allow youth and veterans who
experience or have recently experienced homelessness to become eligible
for low-income housing while they attend school full-time.
"Students shouldn't have to choose between stable housing and going to
school full-time," said Portman. "By giving low-income students access
to affordable housing while they attend school, we can help to ensure
that they are able to graduate and succeed."

.
Portman, Congressman Brad Wenstrup (R-OH-2), and Congressman Bill
Johnson (R-OH-06) on Thursday demanded that the Department of Energy
(DOE)
detail
its plan for avoiding disruptions in the decontamination and
decommissioning (D&D;) operations at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion
Plant following a unilateral decision by DOE to place new restrictions
on a program that has been critical to funding work at the site. This
environmental clean-up and restoration work employs nearly 2,000
individuals and is critically important to southern Ohio.
"In recent years, the D&D; operations at Piketon have been supplemented
by the sale of excess uranium," the lawmakers wrote. "Your previous
secretarial determination covered transfers up to the equivalent of
2,055 metric tons of natural uranium (MTU) per year, in natural uranium
hexafluoride provided to contractors for cleanup services at the
Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The 2015 determination, however,
reduces covered transfers down to 1,600 MTU for the 2016 calendar year,
creating a shortfall of 455 MTU. We respectfully request that DOE
explain, in detail, how workforce disruptions will be avoided in 2016
given the potential funding shortfalls described above."

.
Portman also announced this week that the Senate-drafted Fiscal Year
2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the Senate
Appropriations Bill for Military Construction includes critical funding
for a number of Ohio military assets, including:
*	$9.4 million for an upgrade to the indoor firing range facility
at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station (YARS)
, home to the 910th Airlift
Wing;
*	$3.3 million for an upgrade to the Ravenna Joint Military
Training Center
firing range in Ravenna, Ohio;
*	$6.6 million to construct a new satellite pharmacy at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
.
On Friday, Portman urged the Administration to help Iraqi Christians
and other religious minorities
fleeing violence and
persecution in Iraq and seeking to come to the United States. The U.S.
Consulate in Erbil does not currently process immigrant visas, forcing
Iraqi Christians to make the life-threatening and virtually impossible
journey through ISIS-controlled territory to reach the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad. In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Portman asked
the Administration to begin allowing the Consulate in Erbil to process
visas and to take adequate steps in addressing the needs of the growing
refugee population in Kurdistan.
"We understand the U.S. policy regarding a unified Iraq," the senators
wrote. "However, allowing for the processing of immigrant visas in the
place where the majority of the people seeking them live strikes us as
a common-sense response to an urgent humanitarian crisis, not an effort
to undermine U.S. support for a unified Iraqi state. Visa processing
times are already notoriously slow, and allowing immigrant visas to be
processed in Erbil could help alleviate this problem. It would also
demonstrate to the U.S. Senate, the refugee population, and the world
that the United States government is committed to helping the thousands
Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities who have suffered
enormously because of their faith."
The Islamic State has forced Christians in the territory it controls to
flee their homes, convert to Islam, or face execution. With over one
million people displaced by the violence in Iraq, the situation remains
critical, and the targeted harassment, persecution, and killings of
Iraqi religious minorities by the Islamic State continues.

On Social Media:
Portman runs for wounded soldiers
Day to day your elected officials can be seen at the U.S. Capitol. But
these lawmakers are trading the floor, for the pavement. Senator Rob
Portman of Ohio was dubbed fastest Senator last year and was back again
to reclaim his title.
"It's like being the best surfer in Kansas, it's a dubious distinction,"
Portman said.
But for Senator Portman and other members of Congress it is more than
just a race.
"I participated in the last few years and my whole staff comes out
here. We have two teams of five each, so it's a great effort to try and
help our wounded warriors," he added.
The ACLI Capitol Challenge is an annual race that raises money for the
Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, giving new hope to men and women blinded
during their time serving in the military.
"Lieutenant Brad Snyder he was injured by an IED in Afghanistan and
blinded him and yet he's out here today with his guide dog Gizzy. He
actually ran in the race today, so it's a good cause and I'm really
delighted to support it," Portman said.

Portman's 'pilot project' aimed at better health for seniors
Members of the board of Menorah Park Center for Senior Living in
Beachwood said they liked U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's presentation of his
new "pilot project," based on his Better Health Rewards legislation.
Better Health Rewards is a Medicare program that helps seniors set and
meet goals designed to improve their health and well-being.
"We appreciate what Sen. Portman is doing to support the senior
citizens," said Ken Bravo, chair of Menorah Park's government relations
committee, "and it begins with the residents of Menorah Park."
"I chose Menorah Park because it is cutting-edge, and is one of the
finest facilities of its kind in the country based on an independent
rating," said Portman, a Republican from suburban Cincinnati who lived
in Shaker Heights until he was 5 years old.
"These seniors are good shoppers," Portman said of senior citizens.
"They're smart, competitive, and certainly able to take care of
themselves with some added incentives."
The program rewards those who reach their health goals and lowers
overall health costs by giving them a chance to share in the savings.
The voluntary, three- year project ties "wellness visits" to goals,
rewarding those who meet the goals. Under the program, participating
providers would use information gathered during annual wellness visits
to establish achievable health goals for participating patients.
"I consider Menorah Park a pilot program for what we are trying to do,"
said Portman. "Under Medicare you have an annual visit, and during that
annual visit on a voluntary basis you would be allowed to partake in an
incentive program to improve your health."
The Better Health Rewards program is based on the notion that
improvements in senior health would save Medicare money.
Portman seemed confident in the efficiency and effectiveness of the
program, and he hopes to spread the program across the country in the
near future.
"We appreciate the wonderful partnership with you, and we thank you for
developing such an innovative national model," said Richard Schwalberg,
Menorah Park administrator. "We look forward to serving as the model
site."

Portman finds support for military mental-health screening
While spending a large part of three decades homeless and on the
streets after leaving the Marine Corps, Craig Neuvirth knew something
was off.
But, his mental health problems were worse than he had been told -
worse than the case of post-traumatic stress disorder not diagnosed
until a decade after his three years in the military.
His life might have been different had he received a mental-health
screening upon leaving active duty. A bill proposed by Sen. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio would require mental-health assessments for incoming
recruits to establish a baseline and then also mandate assessments when
service members leave the military.
Too many veterans, particularly from the Iraq and Afghanistan
conflicts, are departing the military with undetected illnesses such as
post-traumatic stress disorder, Portman says.
"It's not an easy issue to work on," Portman said during a roundtable
discussion yesterday at the VA health center. "It's the invisible
wounds of war ... our system still has some significant gaps."
Portman joined Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., in introducing the Medical
Evaluation Parity for Servicemembers Act in March to help detect mental
illness among veterans earlier and more effectively.
Dr. Chrisanne Gordon, who founded the Resurrecting Lives Foundation to
assist veterans dealing with traumatic brain injuries, said the
military too often fails to answer the question, "Who do we have here?"
when service members depart.
"We're dealing with consequences of honor ... thanks for helping to
bring this problem to the forefront," she told Portman.
Language in the pending Pentagon budget would instruct the military to
prepare to do the evaluations to be established in his bill, Portman
said.

Federal bill would name VA center for fallen Ohio soldier
Legislation to honor an Ohio solider who died in the Vietnam War by
naming a Veterans Affairs clinic for him has been introduced in
Congress.
Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman introduced a bill this past week
in the Senate to designate the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs
clinic in Newark as the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans
Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic.
The senators said in a statement that Kinnard served as a medic in
Vietnam and was awarded a Bronze Star for tending to wounded men in his
unit while under fire.
The legislation is supported by various veterans groups in Ohio.

Vienna air reserve station closes in on project funding
The air reserve station in Vienna is closer to getting the money it
needs for an improvement project.
U.S. Senator Rob Portman announced Thursday that over $9 million has
been approved in a bill for military construction, according to a
release from Portman's office.
The release states that the Air Force included the funding in its
budget proposal and the Senate has taken the first step in approving
that proposal with today's news.

Give All Students a Chance to Walk Across the Stage
College graduations are being held across the country. They are a time
for celebration and remind us of the importance of higher education.
During this season, it can be hard to imagine not being able to go to
college. But the reality is, college study still remains out of reach
for many. Rising college costs can be intimidating, and the weight of
mounting debt can turn students away altogether.
There are approximately 300 early college high schools nationwide, and
14 in Ohio. Research conducted by Columbia University shows that early
college participants are significantly more likely to complete high
school, enroll in college, and earn college degrees. In addition, early
college high schools save money for students and their families by
allowing students to complete up to two years of college credits while
still in high school. These savings range from approximately $27,200 up
to $72,600 for two years of college tuition at public and private
colleges, respectively.
In Ohio, we've seen the success of these programs firsthand. Founded in
2013, the Dayton Early College Academy (DECA) was Ohio's first early
college high school program. DECA operates as a nontraditional charter
high school and has served 465 students in its first full school year.
In 2014, 100 percent of DECA'S graduates were college-bound or serving
in the military, and 95 percent of the graduates entered Ohio colleges
or universities.
Simply put, early college works. More students have access to a college
education because of these programs. Although free to students and
families, school districts often cannot support early college programs
due to tuition costs, causing program instability.
So, we introduced the Go to High School, Go to College Act to expand
education opportunities to more young Americans and support school
districts and programs. Specifically, our bill allows low-income
students enrolled in early colleges to use Pell Grants to help pay for
college while maintaining accountability. This way we can work to
ensure every dollar spent on earned college credits protects students
and increases the effectiveness of the Pell Grant program.
We know Congress can and should do more to help students get to
college. Based on proven models of success, the Go to High School, Go
to College Act is commonsense legislation to allow more students access
to higher education. A lack of financial resources should not prevent
America's students from achieving a college degree. So, as we celebrate
the class of 2015, let's look forward to the next generation. Let's
give every student a chance to walk across the stage.

Enforcement
efforts
often
focus
on
prosecuting
the
sellers
of
these
acts
because
of
challenges
in
prosecuting
buyers.
Portman&#8217;s
legislation
sends
a
clear
message
to
those
who
victimize
children
that
we
will
prosecute
them
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law.
By
strengthening
laws
against
buyers,
we
can
take
steps
toward
reducing
demand
for
child
victims
and
ensuring
criminals
are
fully
prosecuted.
Also
on
Tuesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Sherrod
Brown
(D-Ohio)
offered
an
amendment
addressing
currency
manipulation
to
the
Trade
Promotion
Authority
(TPA)
legislation.
The
amendment,
authored
by
Portman
and
U.S.
Sen.
Debbie
Stabenow
(D-Mich.)
and
cosponsored
by
Brown,
puts
teeth
into
addressing
currency
manipulation
by
holding
countries
accountable
to
International
Monetary
Fund
standards.
It
would
add
explicit
and
enforceable
currency
language
necessary
to
ensure
that
foreign
competitors
don't
use
their
exchange
rates
to
subsidize
their
exports
at
the
expense
of
products
made
by
American
workers.
The
amendment
is
backed
by
American
auto
companies
and
manufacturers
such
as
Ford,
GM,
FCA,
U.S.
Steel,
Nucor,
and
AK
Steel.
&#8220;When
foreign
competitors
tilt
the
playing
field
by
manipulating
their
currencies,
Ohio
workers
suffer,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;That
means
American-made
exports
are
more
expensive,
while
our
competitors&#8217;
exports
into
the
United
States
are
cheaper.
That&#8217;s
not
fair
for
American
workers
who
can
compete
with
anyone
on
a
level
playing
field.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
introduce
this
bipartisan
amendment
that
cracks
down
on
currency
manipulation
to
ensure
that
our
trade
negotiators
treat
currency
rules
just
as
seriously
as
other
negotiating
objectives
laid
out
by
Congress.&#8221;
Portman
and
Brown
also
offered
an
amendment
that
would
level
the
playing
field
for
U.S.
industries
&#8211;
like
the
steel
industry
&#8211;
by
increasing
their
ability
to
fight
back
against
unfair
foreign
trade
practices.
Last
week,
the
Senate
passed
the
Leveling
the
Playing
Field
Act
with
bipartisan
support
as
part
of
the
U.S.
Customs
and
Border
Protection
(CBP)
reauthorization.
&#8220;Ohio
workers
can
compete
and
win
globally,
but
we
must
ensure
that
the
playing
field
is
fair,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
to
support
this
amendment
that
says
we
must
hold
foreign
competitors
accountable
when
they
skirt
the
rules.&#8221;

On
Wednesday,
Portman
introduced
the
State
Transportation
Flexibility
Act ,
legislation
that
would
allow
state
transportation
departments
to
opt
out
of
the
Federal-Aid
Highway
and
Mass
Transit
programs
and
direct
more
gas
tax
revenues
into
priority
road
and
bridge
projects.
This
will
give
these
states
the
freedom
to
manage
and
spend
the
gas
tax
revenue
collected
within
their
states
on
transportation
projects
without
federal
mandates,
while
ensuring
that
the
current
Interstate
System
is
maintained
by
the
states.
&#8220;This
legislation
will
help
to
ensure
high
priority
road
and
bridge
projects,
such
as
the
Brent
Spence
Bridge
in
my
hometown
of
Cincinnati,
are
completed
by
giving
states
the
freedom
to
use
highway
revenue
how
they
see
fit
and
reducing
federal
regulations
that
slow
down
progress,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;The
one-size-fits-all
approach
isn&#8217;t
working,
and
by
returning
power
to
the
states,
we
can
put
transportation
funding
on
a
sustainable
path.&#8221;

on
Wednesday,
Portman
again
urged
passage
of
his
bipartisan
amendment
to
crack
down
on
currency
manipulation
that
hurts
Ohio
exports.
The
amendment
puts

On
Thursday,
Portman
introduced
the
Microbeads
Free
Waters
Act
of
2015 ,
legislation
that
would
address
plastic
microbeads
which
are
found
in
common
household
products
and
are
detrimental
to
wildlife
and
human
health.
Because
of
the
detrimental
effect
microbeads
have
on
our
natural
resources,
companies
have
already
agreed
to
phase
them
out
of
production.
This
bipartisan
legislation
would
implement
a
commonsense
way
for
companies
across
the
country
to
do
so
on
a
level
playing
field
by
establishing
a
definition
of
microbeads
and
setting
uniform
dates
for
the
prohibition
of
manufacture
and
sale
of
products.
The
bill
was
coauthored
by
U.S.
Senator
Kirsten
Gillibrand
(D-NY)
and
cosponsored
by
Senators
Debbie
Stabenow
(D-Mich.)
and
Mark
Kirk
(R-Ill.)
&#8220;Plastic
microbeads
are
devastating
to
wildlife
and
human
health,
and
this
bill
implements
a
commonsense
way
to
phase
them
out
in
a
way
that&#8217;s
fair
to
Ohio
companies
and
keeps
them
on
a
level
playing
field
with
their
competitors,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Lake
Erie
is
not
only
one
of
our
precious
natural
resources,
it&#8217;s
also
essential
for
Ohio
jobs
and
tourism,
and
our
legislation
takes
appropriate
steps
to
protect
this
important
asset
for
Ohio.&#8221;
Microbeads
are
tiny
synthetic
plastic
particles
used
as
an
abrasive
in
many
personal-care
and
beauty
products,
such
as
facial
scrubs,
soaps
and
toothpastes.
When
consumers
use
products
containing
microbeads,
the
microbeads
don&#8217;t
dissolve,
but
instead
are
rinsed
down
the
drain.
Because
of
the
small
size
and
buoyancy
of
microbeads,
they
escape
treatment
by
sewage
plants
and
are
discharged
into
lakes
and
rivers.
Watch

of
the
legislation

Also
on
Thursday,
Portman
and
Senator
Al
Franken
(D-Minn.)
introduced
a
bipartisan
bill
to
make
sure
that
young
people
and
veterans
who
have
faced
homelessness
don&#8217;t
have
to
make
the
difficult
choice
between
a
place
to
call
home
and
a
good
education.
This
important
legislative
fix
would
close
a
loophole
that
prevents
many
full-time
students&#8212;including
veterans&#8212;from
qualifying
for
affordable
rental
housing
funded
through
a
key
tax
credit.
Sens.
Portman
and
Franken&#8217;s
proposal
would
allow
youth
and
veterans
who
experience
or
have
recently
experienced
homelessness
to
become
eligible
for
low-income
housing
while
they
attend
school
full-time.
&#8220;Students
shouldn&#8217;t
have
to
choose
between
stable
housing
and
going
to
school
full-time,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;By
giving
low-income
students
access
to
affordable
housing
while
they
attend
school,
we
can
help
to
ensure
that
they
are
able
to
graduate
and
succeed.&#8221;
Read
a
summary
of
the
bill
and

a
list
of
endorsers
here .
Portman,
Congressman
Brad
Wenstrup
(R-OH-2),
and
Congressman
Bill
Johnson
(R-OH-06)
on
Thursday
demanded
that
the
Department
of
Energy
(DOE)
detail
its
plan
for
avoiding
disruptions
in
the
decontamination
and
decommissioning
(D&amp;D)
operations
at
the
Portsmouth
Gaseous
Diffusion
Plant
following
a
unilateral
decision
by
DOE
to
place
new
restrictions
on
a
program
that
has
been
critical
to
funding
work
at
the
site.
This
environmental
clean-up
and
restoration
work
employs
nearly
2,000
individuals
and
is
critically
important
to
southern
Ohio.
&#8220;In
recent
years,
the
D&amp;D
operations
at
Piketon
have
been
supplemented
by
the
sale
of
excess
uranium,&#8221;
the
lawmakers
wrote.
&#8220;Your
previous
secretarial
determination
covered
transfers
up
to
the
equivalent
of
2,055
metric
tons
of
natural
uranium
(MTU)
per
year,
in
natural
uranium
hexafluoride
provided
to
contractors
for
cleanup
services
at
the
Portsmouth
Gaseous
Diffusion
Plant.
The
2015
determination,
however,
reduces
covered
transfers
down
to
1,600
MTU
for
the
2016
calendar
year,
creating
a
shortfall
of
455
MTU.
We
respectfully
request
that
DOE
explain,
in
detail,
how
workforce
disruptions
will
be
avoided
in
2016
given
the
potential
funding
shortfalls
described
above.&#8221;

Portman
also
announced
this
week
that
the
Senate-drafted
Fiscal
Year
2016
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
and
the
Senate
Appropriations
Bill
for
Military
Construction
includes
critical
funding
for
a
number
of
Ohio
military
assets,
including: $9.4
million
for
an
upgrade
to
the
indoor
firing
range
facility
at
the
Youngstown
Air
Reserve
Station
(YARS) ,
home
to
the
910th

million
for

upgrade

Ravenna,
Ohio; $6.6
million
to

Base .
On
Friday,
Portman
urged
the
Administration
to
help
Iraqi
Christians
and
other
religious
minorities
fleeing
violence
and
persecution
in
Iraq
and
seeking
to
come
to
the
United
States.
The
U.S.
Consulate
in
Erbil
does
not
currently
process
immigrant
visas,
forcing
Iraqi
Christians
to
make
the
life-threatening
and
virtually
impossible
journey
through
ISIS-controlled
territory
to
reach
the
U.S.
Embassy
in
Baghdad.
In
a
letter
to
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry,
Portman
asked
the
Administration
to
begin
allowing
the
Consulate
in
Erbil
to
process
visas
and
to
take
adequate
steps
in
addressing
the
needs
of
the
growing
refugee
population
in
Kurdistan.
&#8220;We
understand
the
U.S.
policy
regarding
a
unified
Iraq,&#8221;
the
senators
wrote.
&#8220;However,
allowing
for
the
processing
of
immigrant
visas
in
the
place
where
the
majority
of
the
people
seeking
them
live
strikes
us
as
a
common-sense
response
to
an
urgent
humanitarian
crisis,
not
an
effort
to
undermine
U.S.
support
for
a
unified
Iraqi
state.
Visa
processing
times
are
already
notoriously
slow,
and
allowing
immigrant
visas
to
be
processed
in
Erbil
could
help
alleviate
this
problem.
It
would
also
demonstrate
to
the
U.S.
Senate,
the
refugee
population,
and
the
world
that
the
United
States
government
is
committed
to
helping
the
thousands
Christians,
Yazidis,
and
other
religious
minorities
who
have
suffered
enormously
because
of
their
faith.&#8221;
The
Islamic
State
has
forced
Christians
in
the
territory
it
controls
to
flee
their
homes,
convert
to
Islam,
or
face
execution.
With
over
one
million
people
displaced
by
the
violence
in
Iraq,
the
situation
remains
critical,
and
the
targeted
harassment,
persecution,
and
killings
of
Iraqi
religious
minorities
by
the
Islamic
State
continues.

Portman&#8217;s
&#8216;pilot
project&#8217;
aimed
at
better
health
for
seniors
Members
of
the
board
of
Menorah
Park
Center
for
Senior
Living
in
Beachwood
said
they
liked
U.S.
Sen.
Rob
Portman&#8217;s
presentation
of
his
new
&#8220;pilot
project,&#8221;
based
on
his
Better
Health
Rewards
legislation.
Better
Health
Rewards
is
a
Medicare
program
that
helps
seniors
set
and
meet
goals
designed
to
improve
their
health
and
well-being.
&#8220;We
appreciate
what
Sen.
Portman
is
doing
to
support
the
senior
citizens,&#8221;
said
Ken
Bravo,
chair
of
Menorah
Park&#8217;s
government
relations
committee,
&#8220;and
it
begins
with
the
residents
of
Menorah
Park.&#8221;
&#8220;I
chose
Menorah
Park
because
it
is
cutting-edge,
and
is
one
of
the
finest
facilities
of
its
kind
in
the
country
based
on
an
independent
rating,&#8221;
said
Portman,
a
Republican
from
suburban
Cincinnati
who
lived
in
Shaker
Heights
until
he
was
5
years
old.
&#8220;These
seniors
are
good
shoppers,&#8221;
Portman
said
of
senior
citizens.
&#8220;They&#8217;re
smart,
competitive,
and
certainly
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
with
some
added
incentives.&#8221;
The
program
rewards
those
who
reach
their
health
goals
and
lowers
overall
health
costs
by
giving
them
a
chance
to
share
in
the
savings.
&#8230;
The
voluntary,
three-
year
project
ties
&#8220;wellness
visits&#8221;
to
goals,
rewarding
those
who
meet
the
goals.
Under
the
program,
participating
providers
would
use
information
gathered
during
annual
wellness
visits
to
establish
achievable
health
goals
for
participating
patients.
&#8220;I
consider
Menorah
Park
a
pilot
program
for
what
we
are
trying
to
do,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;Under
Medicare
you
have
an
annual
visit,
and
during
that
annual
visit
on
a
voluntary
basis
you
would
be
allowed
to
partake
in
an
incentive
program
to
improve
your
health.&#8221;
&#8230;
The
Better
Health
Rewards
program
is
based
on
the
notion
that
improvements
in
senior
health
would
save
Medicare
money.
Portman
seemed
confident
in
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
program,
and
he
hopes
to
spread
the
program
across
the
country
in
the
near
future.
&#8220;We
appreciate
the
wonderful
partnership
with
you,
and
we
thank
you
for
developing
such
an
innovative
national
model,&#8221;

Richard
Schwalberg,

Park
administrator.
&#8220;We
look
forward
to
serving
as
the

Portman
finds
support
for
military
mental-health
screening
While
spending
a
large
part
of
three
decades
homeless
and
on
the
streets
after
leaving
the
Marine
Corps,
Craig
Neuvirth
knew
something
was
off.
But,
his
mental
health
problems
were
worse
than
he
had
been
told
&#8212;
worse
than
the
case
of
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
not
diagnosed
until
a
decade
after
his
three
years
in
the
military.
His
life
might
have
been
different
had
he
received
a
mental-health
screening
upon
leaving
active
duty.
A
bill
proposed
by
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
R-Ohio
would
require
mental-health
assessments
for
incoming
recruits
to
establish
a
baseline
and
then
also
mandate
assessments
when
service
members
leave
the
military.
Too
many
veterans,
particularly
from
the
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
conflicts,
are
departing
the
military
with
undetected
illnesses
such
as
post-traumatic
stress
disorder,
Portman
says.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
not
an
easy
issue
to
work
on,&#8221;
Portman
said
during
a
roundtable
discussion
yesterday
at
the
VA
health
center.
&#8220;It&#8217;s

Give
All
Students
a
Chance
to
Walk
Across
the
Stage
College
graduations
are
being
held
across
the
country.
They
are
a
time
for
celebration
and
remind
us
of
the
importance
of
higher
education.
During
this
season,
it
can
be
hard
to
imagine
not
being
able
to
go
to
college.
But
the
reality
is,
college
study
still
remains
out
of
reach
for
many.
Rising
college
costs
can
be
intimidating,
and
the
weight
of
mounting
debt
can
turn
students
away
altogether.
&#8230;
There
are
approximately
300
early
college
high
schools
nationwide,
and
14
in
Ohio.
Research
conducted
by
Columbia
University
shows
that
early
college
participants
are
significantly
more
likely
to
complete
high
school,
enroll
in
college,
and
earn
college
degrees.
In
addition,
early
college
high
schools
save
money
for
students
and
their
families
by
allowing
students
to
complete
up
to
two
years
of
college
credits
while
still
in
high
school.
These
savings
range
from
approximately
$27,200
up
to
$72,600
for
two
years
of
college
tuition
at
public
and
private
colleges,
respectively.
In
Ohio,
we&#8217;ve
seen
the
success
of
these
programs
firsthand.
Founded
in
2013,
the
Dayton
Early
College
Academy
(DECA)
was
Ohio&#8217;s
first
early
college
high
school
program.
DECA
operates
as
a
nontraditional
charter
high
school
and
has
served
465
students
in
its
first
full
school
year.
In
2014,
100
percent
of
DECA&#8217;S
graduates
were
college-bound
or
serving
in
the
military,
and
95
percent
of
the
graduates
entered
Ohio
colleges
or
universities.
&#8230;
Simply
put,
early
college
works.
More
students
have
access
to
a
college
education
because
of
these
programs.
Although
free
to
students
and
families,
school
districts
often
cannot
support
early
college
programs
due
to
tuition
costs,
causing
program
instability.
So,
we
introduced
the
Go
to
High
School,
Go
to
College
Act
to
expand
education
opportunities
to
more
young
Americans
and
support
school
districts
and
programs.
Specifically,
our
bill
allows
low-income
students
enrolled
in
early
colleges
to
use
Pell
Grants
to
help
pay
for
college
while
maintaining
accountability.
This
way
we
can
work
to
ensure
every
dollar
spent
on
earned
college
credits
protects
students
and
increases
the
effectiveness
of
the
Pell
Grant
program.
&#8230;
We
know
Congress
can
and
should
do
more
to
help
students
get
to
college.
Based
on
proven
models
of
success,
the
Go
to
High
School,
Go
to
College
Act
is
commonsense
legislation
to
allow
more
students
access
to
higher
education.
A
lack
of
financial
resources
should
not
prevent
America&#8217;s
students
from
achieving
a
college
degree.
So,
as
we
celebrate
the
class
of
2015,
let&#8217;s
look
forward
to
the
next
generation.
Let&#8217;s
give
every
student
a
chance
to
walk
across
the
stage.
(&#8220;Give
All
Students
a
Chance
to
Walk
Across
the
Stage,&#8221;

Fudge
