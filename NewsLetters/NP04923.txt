URGENT: MIDNIGHT DEADLINE This may be our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Donate $5 before tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline.
David -- We have a MAJOR crisis on our hands&hellip;and only a few hours left to find a solution.
It&rsquo;s now in the books that Boehner&rsquo;s allies will spend $25 MILLION this week against Democrats -- the most of the entire election. They&rsquo;re leaving nothing on the table. They want to destroy us in the final days of the election -- and it looks like it&rsquo;s working.
Polls all around the country show that Republicans&rsquo; Obama-bashing TV ads are taking their toll on our Democratic candidates. We&rsquo;ll be blunt:
Tonight&rsquo;s deadline is our last chance to turn things around.
The final week ad buy deadline is tonight at MIDNIGHT. David, if you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we need your help:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
We need 2 people from 60659 zip code to step up before midnight, if we&rsquo;re going to hit our goal for this deadline. It&rsquo;s the only way Democrats can survive to Election Day. https://action.dccc.org/Chip-In
