Dear friend:
Mother's
Day is a good time to show how much we appreciate the most important
people in the world to us: our mothers. Our mothers gave us life. They
fed us, comforted us, shaped our character, and most importantly, they
never stopped loving us.
My mother, Blanche Mary Wharton
Rangel, is the reason I am here today. She worked two jobs to support
me and my two siblings. Despite many hardships, she never gave up on
our family and believed in our success. She taught us never to complain.
I will always be grateful to her.
There are amazing
mothers like mine everywhere. Women who are working hard to support their
families deserve our help. That is why I am fighting hard to raise the
federal minimum wage, ensure equal pay for equal work, expand access to
paid sick and family leave, and expand access to affordable child
care options. It's time women and their families have the opportunity to
get ahead, and not just get by.
To my mother Blanche, to all the mothers in our district,
New York City, and America, thank you for your unconditional love and
sacrifice.
Please
visit my website at
www.Rangel.house.gov
for
frequent updates. I value your feedback, so please leave me your
comments. Don't forget to like me on
Facebook
and follow
me on
Twitter . It's always a great honor
serving you.
Best regards,
Charles Rangel
