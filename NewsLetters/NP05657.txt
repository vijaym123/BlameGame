Friend,
I&#39;m standing in the green room with my family, about to walk onto the stage to debate Doug Ose. I hope you&#39;ll be able to tune in - the debate is airing at 7 pm on KVIE local channel 6. You can also listen to it on the radio at 90.9 FM, or you can listen online by

I look forward to debating Doug Ose on the issues that matter - from the future of Social Security to creating jobs in Sacramento County, I&#39;m eager to hear once and for all where he stands.
I&#39;m confident that it will be clear which of us has the best interests of the 7th District in mind.
Thank you for your support - I&#39;ll be in touch again soon.
Wish me luck!
Best,
Ami Bera, MD
