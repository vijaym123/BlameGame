Dear Friend,
This week I voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress. She
acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional rights of United
States citizens while working at the IRS. As John Adams said, "facts
are stubborn things." The facts establish that Mrs. Lerner had a
blatant disregard for basic civil liberties and used a government
agency to harass, target, intimidate and threaten lawful, honest
citizens. This smells like the worst form of authoritarianism. Click
HERE
or on the
picture below to watch my statement prior to the contempt vote.
President Obama erroneously claimed that there isn't even a 'smidgen of
corruption' in the IRS targeting scandal, and yet a trail of emails
prove otherwise. Further, Mrs. Lerner is still refusing to testify on
the grounds that she fears criminal prosecution. She should. She lied
to Congress. She abused her position. She violated the rights of
Americans. She tried to harm the electoral process and intimidate
voters. Click HERE
to read more.
Cutting Waste
My effort to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse continued this week.
After learning that NASA is purported to be spending $3 million to
teach employees how to lobby Congress, I led a legislative effort to
prohibit the executive branch from using funds in such a way. With the
federal government's $17-trillion-plus debt, the last thing we need to
be doing is spending money to teach bureaucrats how to lobby for even
more spending. Click HERE
to read a Breitbart article about my effort.
Balancing the Budget
I voted in favor of the Ryan Budget on Thursday. One of my top
priorities is getting our nation back on a fiscally sustainable path by
cutting spending and balancing the budget. Although I would have
preferred to see it adhere to the spending caps put in place by the
sequester, this budget cuts spending by $5.2 trillion and balances the
budget in 10 years. It also repeals ObamaCare, expands onshore and
offshore energy development, and institutes a work requirement for most
welfare benefits.
This budget is a step toward bringing our nation back from the brink of
insolvency and setting it on a path to prosperity. I was sent to
Washington to change the direction of this country and, even though it
isn't perfect, this budget turns our nation back toward fiscal security
and economic growth. Click HERE
to read more.
Protecting the Role of States
On Wednesday, I successfully amended a bill in the Natural Resources
Committee to require coordination between the federal government and
the states concerning wildlife management on lands adjacent to military
installations. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that states
have an active role in determing natural resources and wildlife
management policies for lands within their borders. It prevents
military installations from implementing by fiat new wildlife and
natural resources management plans that contradict states' management
objectives. Click HERE

War on Youth
One of the highlights of my week was meeting with Generation
Opportunity, a group that advocates for millenials. We talked about the
Obama administration's war on youth and how federal policies, such as
ObamaCare and our massive debt, disproportionately affect them. One of
the reasons why I love this group is the great content they produce,
such as their Creepy Uncle Sam videos. You can watch those videos by
clicking HERE
and HERE
.
(Rep. Gosar with, from left to right, Evan Feinberg, Luke Kenwothy, and
Nathan Leamer from Generation Opportunity, March 10, 2014)
Fighting for Veterans
We found out this week that as many as 40 veterans died waiting to
receive care at the Phoenix VA Hospital. Allegedly, the VA kept two
sets of records in order to conceal the length of wait times. This is
completely unacceptable and I will monitor this closely. Situations
such as these are why I co-sponsored H.R.4031, which will hold
officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable for this
type of malfeasance. Our veterans have done so much to protect us and
secure our rights. The least we can do for them now is ensure they
receive the quality health care they earned.
Speaking with Entrepreneurs
I held two Small Business Fridays yesterday, one in Prescott Valley and
one in Prescott. I was happy to see so many smiling faces at both of
these events. From ObamaCare to the massive federal debt, we discussed
all the major issues facing small business owners and entrepreneurs.
These are the businesses that drive our economy, so it's vital that the
federal government get out of their way.
(Rep. Gosar speaking to constituents at Sally B's in Prescott Valley,
April 22, 2014)
Downwinders Field Hearing
As I told you last week, I will hold a Downwinders field hearing this
Monday, April 14, 2014 in Kingman. As a reminder, Downwinders are
people who developed cancer due to radiation exposure from U.S. nuclear
weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. At the hearing, we will discuss
the history of nuclear weapons testing in Nevada and the bill that I
introduced to make all affected residents of Mohave County eligible for
benefits. Currently, only the part of Mohave County north of the Grand
Canyon is eligible. You can find the details of the hearing in the
"Mark Your Calendar" section below or by clicking HERE
. If you cannot be at the
hearing in person, you will be able to watch it on Monday live online
by clicking HERE

2014 Easter Card Competition Winners
On Tuesday, I announced the winners of the 2014 Easter Card
Competition, which was open to children 13-years-old and younger.
Members of Poston Butte High School's student council judged the
competition.
Entrants were broken up into two age groups for the purpose of judging:
seven and younger and eight and older. The winners are as follows:
Seven and younger:
First Place - Daisy Solis Esquer of Bullhead City
Second Place - Franky Sandoval of Yuma
Third Place - Harmony Flanigan of Yuma
Eight and older:
First Place - Aiden Jensen of Yuma
Second Place - James Triggs of Prescott Valley
Third Place - Marissa Bell of Prescott Valley

Dear
Friend,
This
week
I
voted
to
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress.
She
acted
with
reckless
disregard
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
United
States
citizens
while
working
at
the
IRS. As
John
Adams
said,
"facts
are
stubborn
things."
The facts
establish
that
Mrs.
Lerner had
a blatant
disregard for
basic
civil
liberties
and used
a
government
agency
to
harass,
target,
intimidate
and
threaten
lawful,
honest
citizens.
This smells
like
the
worst
form
of
authoritarianism.
Click

or
on
the
picture
below
to
watch
my
statement prior
to the
contempt
vote.
President
Obama
erroneously
claimed
that
there
isn&#8217;t
even
a
'smidgen
of
corruption'
in
the
IRS
targeting
scandal,
and
yet
a
trail
of
emails
prove
otherwise.
Further,
Mrs.
Lerner
is
still
refusing
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
she
fears
criminal
prosecution.
She
should.
She
lied
to
Congress.
She
abused
her
position.
She
violated
the
rights
of
Americans.
She
tried
to
harm
the
electoral
process

Cutting
Waste
My
effort
to
eliminate
waste,
fraud
and
abuse
continued
this
week.
After
learning
that
NASA
is
purported
to
be
spending
$3
million
to
teach
employees
how
to
lobby
Congress,
I
led
a
legislative
effort
to
prohibit
the
executive
branch
from
using
funds
in
such
a
way.
With
the
federal
government's
$17-trillion-plus
debt,
the
last
thing
we
need
to
be
doing is
spending
money
to
teach
bureaucrats
how
to
lobby
for
even
more
spending.

Balancing
the
Budget
I voted
in
favor
of
the
Ryan
Budget
on
Thursday.
One
of
my
top
priorities
is
getting
our
nation
back
on
a
fiscally
sustainable
path
by
cutting
spending
and
balancing
the
budget.
Although
I
would
have
preferred
to
see
it
adhere
to
the
spending
caps
put
in
place by
the sequester,
this
budget
cuts
spending
by
$5.2
trillion
and
balances
the
budget
in
10
years.
It
also
repeals
ObamaCare,
expands
onshore
and
offshore
energy
development,
and
institutes
a
work
requirement
for
most
welfare
benefits.
This
budget
is
a
step
toward
bringing
our
nation
back
from
the
brink
of
insolvency
and
setting
it
on
a
path
to
prosperity.
I
was
sent
to
Washington
to
change
the
direction
of
this
country
and,
even
though
it
isn't
perfect,
this
budget
turns
our
nation
back
toward
fiscal
security
and
economic
growth.

Protecting
the
Role
of
States
On
Wednesday,
I
successfully
amended
a
bill
in
the
Natural
Resources
Committee to require
coordination
between
the federal
government and
the
states
concerning
wildlife
management
on
lands
adjacent
to
military
installations.
The
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
ensure
that
states have
an
active
role
in
determing
natural
resources
and
wildlife
management
policies
for
lands
within
their
borders.
It prevents
military installations
from
implementing
by
fiat
new
wildlife
and
natural
resources
management
plans
that
contradict
states' management
objectives.

War

One
of
the
highlights
of
my
week
was
meeting
with
Generation
Opportunity,
a

that
advocates
for

We
talked
about
the
Obama
administration's
war
on
youth
and
how
federal
policies,
such
as
ObamaCare and
our massive
debt,
disproportionately
affect them.
One
of
the
reasons
why
I
love
this
group
is
the
great
content
they
produce,
such
as
their
Creepy
Uncle
Sam
videos.

Fighting
for
Veterans
We
found
out
this
week
that
as
many
as
40
veterans
died
waiting
to
receive
care
at
the
Phoenix
VA
Hospital.
Allegedly,
the
VA
kept
two
sets
of
records
in
order
to
conceal
the
length
of
wait
times.
This
is
completely
unacceptable
and
I
will
monitor
this
closely.
Situations
such
as
these
are
why
I
co-sponsored
H.R.4031,
which
will
hold
officials
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
accountable
for
this
type
of
malfeasance.
Our
veterans
have
done
so
much
to protect
us
and
secure
our
rights.
The
least
we
can
do
for
them
now
is
ensure
they
receive
the
quality
health
care
they
earned.
Speaking

Entrepreneurs
I
held
two
Small

one
in
Prescott

and
one
in
Prescott.
I
was
happy

these

From
ObamaCare
to
the
massive
federal
debt,
we discussed
all the
major
issues
facing
small

owners
and
entrepreneurs.
These
are
the
businesses
that
drive
our

get
out
