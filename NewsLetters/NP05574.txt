Projection: Democrats 51 - Republicans 49
Friend -- This is huge: Not only are we LEADING in FIVE Southern races -- the GOP is now projected to lose the Senate by
a single seat.
As
ABC News
reports, &ldquo;If Republicans... fall one seat short of controlling the Senate,
it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history.&rdquo;
But
ABC
also warns that &ldquo;Senate control is
so tantalizingly close.&rdquo;
And the FINAL FEC deadline is just 72 hours away -- we NEED you NOW. Even President Obama warned this morning:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be blunt: if you do nothing, we risk losing.&rdquo;
We are launching a SINGLE DAY TRIPLE-MATCH:
It&rsquo;ll take EVERY DEMOCRAT OUT THERE to clinch this election -- can you pitch in NOW?
