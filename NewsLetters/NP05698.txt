Dear
Constituents,
It is an honor to serve as your Representative in Washington, D.C. To
me, serving my constituents is about ensuring that every voice in our
community is heard; that every individual is empowered to pursue
their dreams; and that you have a steadfast advocate when you need
one.
One of the most important duties that I undertake each year
is nominating the next leaders of our nation for admission to four of
the five service academies across our nation. Our world-renowned
service academies are designed to educate and train the future generations
of American military leaders.
The October 15th deadline to apply for
a nomination is quickly approaching. If you know of a fourth-year high
school student interested in attending one of our military service
academies, please have them contact my Director of Constituent Services,
Gina Chapa, for additional information. She can be reached by email
at
Gina.Chapa@mail.house.gov
or by phone at (760)
989-4111. You can also find more information, including the
application, on my website:
www.ruiz.house.gov/service-academies1/ .
As always, I am here to serve
you. If you need help accessing federal resources such as your Social
Security, Medicare, or VA benefits, or need guidance on what resources
are available for job training, job searching, scholarship
opportunities, my office stands ready to be your
advocate.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
Member of
Congress
Serving California's 36th Congressional
District
