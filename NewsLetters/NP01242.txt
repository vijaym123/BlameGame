Rep. Veasey Statement on
Texas Voter ID
DALLAS/FORT WORTH, TX
U.S. Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, released the following statement today as the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit will consider whether to uphold a lower-court decision on the Texas Voter ID law.
Its evident that the Texas Voter ID law discriminates against minority voters in Texas, a fact already proven in court. What separates this court case from others is that now the court will make the very important decision on whether this intentionally discriminatory law will be allowed to stand in Texas.
The record is clear and strong and while it is never wise to predict the outcome of a court decision, I believe the evidence is overwhelming and Im hopeful that this law will ultimately be struck down.
