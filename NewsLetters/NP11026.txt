Undermining Reforms
Some state governors have let down the American taxpayer in the past few weeks. In February, the Farm Bill was signed into law and it had a provision to encourage the unemployed to get back to work and generate savings for years to come. State governors should have applauded this reform.
Instead, eight state governors have pledged to exploit a loophole called "heat and eat" to further drive up costs for taxpayers and undermine these reforms. Counter to the intent of the law, these state governments will continue to give out a small energy subsidy so they can take a
disproportional amount in food stamps. The original reform was estimated to save $20 billion over the next decade and, more importantly, enable the unemployed to return to the workforce. Instead, these state governors have made the short-sighted decision to keep their citizens stuck in a vicious welfare cycle while driving up federal deficits.
Earlier this week, I requested Chairman of the Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, close this loophole, protect taxpayers, and encourage job growth in the 2015 House Budget. I will continue to hold these states accountable and protect the American taxpayers from those who seek to defraud them.
Have a great weekend,
Jack
