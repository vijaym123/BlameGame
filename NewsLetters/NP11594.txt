REMINDER: Join Congressman Tierney TOMORROW for a Veterans' Jobs and Benefits Fair
Friday, March 14, 2014
Dear Friend,
One of my highest priorities as a Member of Congress is supporting our nation&rsquo;s veterans by working to increase access to services and employment opportunities for those who have selflessly served our country.
My staff and I are actively engaged in helping local veterans and their families cut through any &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; and working to resolve other issues in readjusting to civilian life.
Having heard from many veterans who have experienced challenges with obtaining employment after leaving the service, I am proud to announce that I will be hosting my 2014 Veterans Fair
TOMORROW
March 15, 2014 from 9:00 a.m.
1:00 p.m. at Peabody Veterans Memorial High School . This event will bring together local nonprofits, government agencies and businesses in order to ensure that our veterans, service members, and military families receive the high quality support they deserve.
A wide variety of employers and representatives from educational, health, housing, and veterans' advocacy organizations will be in attendance.
I look forward to assisting local veterans and others who have served. If you know a veteran in your community who is looking for work or assistance, please forward this email to him or her. As always, do not hesitate to contact my Peabody office at 978-531-1669 with any questions.
Sincerely,
John F. Tierney
Member of Congress
