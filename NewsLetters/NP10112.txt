April 2014
As your Congressman, it is my privilege and honor to provide you with services to help you and your organization navigate the federal grants process. My office is working especially hard in these tumultuous economic times to make non profits, small businesses and municipalities more aware of grants and funding opportunities at the federal level.
This newsletter is designed to help you search for and apply for grants and to provide you with the most up-to-date grants resources. My office stands ready to assist you with your grants work in any way we can. In addition, we welcome your feedback and comments and encourage your suggestions on how to make this newsletter more helpful to your organization.
Below, you will find a list of recent grants awarded in my Congressional District and a list of some new federal funding opportunities. Please be sure to check with awarding agencies, as this information is subject to change. For a full list of federal funding opportunities and programs, including the newest opportunities, I encourage you to visit:

Sincerely,
News:
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced the availability of $450 million in grants under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative. Over the last three years, these unprecedented investments have helped expand the capacity of the American community college system to provide accessible training programs that connect people to available jobs in growing industries in their communities. These grants are an important part of the Obama administration&rsquo;s job-driven skills agenda and are being implemented in partnership with the U.S. Department of Education. The deadline to apply is July 7, 2014. General information about the TAACCCT program can be found at http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/.
The Connecticut Department of Housing is accepting applications from towns under the Main Street Investment Fund (MSIF). Grants are available for local infrastructure renovation and improvement projects that will attract small businesses, promote commercial activity and increase jobs. The deadline to submit applications is May 30, 2014 at 4:00 p.m. Municipalities should visit http://www.ct.gov/doh/mainstreet to download the instruction and application form.
