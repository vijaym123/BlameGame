VISITING DC
July 04, 2014
Every year, we look forward to the Fourth of July
holiday as an opportunity to celebrate with family and friends by grilling
out, enjoying the warm weather, and viewing the community fireworks
display.
However, as we enjoy the day of fun, we must not let
the significance of our nations birthday escape
us.
Two hundred and thirty-eight years ago our Founding Fathers
signed the Declaration of Independence.
By signing the
Declaration, a new nation was established, ruled by the people and for the
people.
Through the hard work and sacrifices made by the
generations before us, I can confidently say we live in a great
country.
Lets take a moment this holiday weekend to celebrate our
freedoms and reflect on those who paved the way for our nation.
We
give thanks to the brave men and women who have paid the ultimate
sacrifice to protect our liberty and our way of life, and we pray for
those who are currently in harms way serving our nation.
May
God keep safe those serving at home and abroad on this
holiday.
God bless you all and may God bless the United States of America.
Happy Fourth of July.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
