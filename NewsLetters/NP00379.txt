Friend-
I firmly believe limited government is effective government. And a government that spends
billions
in duplicative programs every year is neither.
Thats why I think that, when Congress proposes the creation of a new program or initiative, lawmakers should be required to justify to the American people why the program is necessary and how it adds value, ensuring that it's not duplicative to programs already in place. I cosponsored a bill to do just that. Take a look at
H.RES.45 .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
One of my top priorities will continue to be to aggressively scrutinize the way taxpayer dollars are spent, and work to cut back waste in duplicative, underutilized, and unnecessary government programs. Read about my specific efforts,
