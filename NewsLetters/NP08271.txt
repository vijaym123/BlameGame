Rep. Levin Supports Bill to Protect
Online Privacy
Rep. Levin has joined a bipartisan group of more than 200 House
lawmakers who have co-sponsored legislation to strengthen online
privacy.
Their bill
the Email Privacy Act [ H.R.
1852 ] -- would end the warrantless searches of email records.
Under current law, law enforcement agencies can obtain things like emails
without a warrant if they have been stored electronically for more
than 180 days.
H.R. 1852 would require the government to obtain a
search warrant based on probable cause to obtain the content of
Americans email and other electronic communications when those
communications are requested from a third-party service provider, like Amazon,
Facebook, Google, Yahoo, and countless other cloud
services.

Heller (D-NV).

through the end of June because of the programs December 2013
expiration.

Lawmakers Call for Action on Gun
Control
Following up on our
last
recent Connecto r story on the need to reduce gun violence, Rep.
Levin joined over 150 Members of the House of Representatives in urging
Speaker Boehner to bring substantive legislation to address gun
violence to the House floor for a vote.
The
letter
states, in part: [M]oments of silence on the floor of the House
are not enough.
The last thing these victims and their families
need is further silence from this Congress.
They deserve a
vote.
A Drain-America-First Energy
Bill
The U.S. is in the midst of a natural gas
bonanza.
Over the last few years, production of natural gas has
skyrocketed and the U.S has become the #1 natural gas producer in the
world.
As a result, consumers are looking at decades of low
energy prices to heat our homes, and manufacturers are actually moving back
to the U.S. to take advantage of our low energy
costs.
Snatching defeat out of the jaws of
victory, a majority of House lawmakers voted for two bills last week
to make it easier for energy companies to export large quantities of
U.S. natural gas to foreign countries like, China, Japan and
India.
If these bills [ H.R. 3301
and
H.R. 6 ] become law, they would spell higher natural gas prices
for American businesses and consumers.
Rep. Levin strongly
opposed both bills.
Bill Would Improve Nutrition
Education
Nutrition plays a vital
role in promoting overall health and reducing the risk of chronic
disease.
According to a recent study, 94 percent of physicians
believe that nutrition counseling should be included as part of a patients
primary care visit, but only 14 percent of physicians feel adequately
trained to facilitate these conversations.
Rep. Levin has
cosponsored the ENRICH Act [H.R. 4427] to create a competitive grant
program administered through the Health Resources and Services
Administration in coordination with the National Institutes of Health for medical
schools to integrate nutrition education into their curricula.
The bill would fund nutrition education in at least 30 medical schools
over three years.
