Veterans Programs Boosted in House Appropriations Bill
This week Kevin voted in favor of a 2015 funding bill to increase
funding for veterans programs by $1.5 billion above last year's level.
The appropriations bill increases medical treatment funding for the 6.7
million patients served by the VA system, increases oversight on
expenditures, and provides resources to end the VA disability claim
backlog.
"We made a promise to our veterans when they enlisted, and it is up to
the federal government to keep that promise and make sure they receive
everything from quality medical care to job and skill training
programs," said Kevin. "House Republicans have increased support for
veterans every year since taking the majority, and we are now seeing
meaningful progress in reducing the veterans backlog. [CONTINUE

Kevin Introduces Legislation to Protect Native American Children
Kevin has introduced legislation to create uniform standards for the
placement of Native American children into foster homes. The Native
American Children's Safety Act finally implements an across-the-board
minimum protection for children placed in foster care under the
direction of a tribal court. Senator John Hoeven has introduced the
legislation in the Senate.
"I was astounded to find out that tribal foster care does not have the
same standards as the rest of our country in many cases. While uniform
standards for foster homes exist at the national level, Native American
tribes have a complex and uneven series of procedures and guidelines
which vary from tribe to tribe," he said. "This bill makes sure there
are adequate background checks for people who live in a foster home
before placing a child there. We must expect more from anyone who
aspires to provide a foster care environment for any child." [CONTINUE

Sec. of Energy Responds to Cramer Inquiry on Hydraulic Fracturing
Research
U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz responded to an inquiry made by
Kevin at a hearing of the U.S. House Science, Space and Technology
Committee. Kevin asked about the status of a research plan due to
Congress over a year ago. An interagency working group to coordinate
and plan agency research on unconventional oil and natural gas attained
from hydraulic fracturing was announced in April 2012.
After announcing the group two years ago, the Obama Administration has
missed repeated deadlines while spending taxpayer dollars in presenting
its research plan to Congress. During the hearing, Moniz seemed
unfamiliar with the commitment to Congress but confirmed the group is
"very active" and told Kevin he would look into the issue. Kevin
received a response from Moniz indicating the report is in process and
he is hopeful for a release in the next few months.[CONTINUE READING]

Kevin
Introduces
Legislation
to
Protect
Native
American
Children
Kevin has
introduced
legislation
to
create
uniform
standards
for
the
placement
of
Native
American
children
into
foster
homes.
The
Native
American
Children&#8217;s
Safety
Act
finally
implements
an
across-the-board
minimum
protection
for
children
placed
in
foster
care
under
the
direction
of
a
tribal
court.
Senator
John
Hoeven
has
introduced
the
legislation
in
the
Senate.
&#8220;I
was
astounded
to
find
out
that
tribal
foster
care
does
not
have
the
same
standards
as
the
rest
of
our
country
in
many
cases.
While
uniform
standards
for
foster
homes
exist
at
the
national
level,
Native
American
tribes
have
a
complex
and
uneven
series
of
procedures
and
guidelines
which
vary
from
tribe
to
tribe,&#8221;
he
said.
&#8220;This
bill
makes
sure
there
are
adequate
background
checks
for
people
who
live
in
a
foster
home
before
placing
a
child
there.
We
must
expect
more
from
anyone
who
aspires
to
provide
a
foster
care
environment
for
any
child.&#8221;
