Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s 7pm on October 31st. Our final monthly deadline of this cycle arrives at midnight tonight. We need your contributions to reach our fundraising goal. If each of our supporters steps up to make a contribution right now, we&rsquo;ll blow past our $16O,OOO goal in the next few hours. Chip in $5, or more if you can, and help fuel our campaign through Election Day.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Thanks for continuing to stand with me in this campaign.
Ed
