Dear Friends,
Since 1919, we
have paused to honor the men and women who put themselves at great
risk to preserve our freedoms.
We first called it Armistice
Day, to mark the first anniversary of what was known as the War to
End All Wars. Now we call that conflict World War I, a solemn reminder
that the force of arms remains a necessary tool in a dangerous
world.
This much hasnt changed in 95 years: On
Veterans Day we remember those whose commitment to country means willing
sacrifice.
Today we salute about 20 million living veterans.
Among them is Sgt. Michael Atwell of Osburn, one of 9 million veterans
aged 65 and over.
I met Atwell in August, when he was
awarded the Silver Star for his gallantry during the Battle of Dak To in
Vietnam in 1967.
Atwell received the distinction thanks to
two colleagues who joined him in the fight. Col. Ron Leonard and Maj.
Larry Moore pressed the Army to recognize their friends
valor.
Leonard and Moore traveled from Virginia and Tennessee,
respectively, to see Atwell finally get his due. Characteristically, Sgt. Atwell
credited his fellow soldiers.
We had a lot of good
people, Atwell said. This Silver Star is for all of them
couldnt have
done it without them.
May God bless these three fine men and
all our veterans today, and every other day on the
calendar.
Finally, more than half of my constituent service work is on behalf
of veterans. Please remember that if you or someone you know is
having problems with a federal agency, you can visit my
Constituent Services
webpage for help.
Thank you ,
