Friends,
On this Thanksgiving holiday, I have a lot to be thankful for.
I am thankful for my loving family. I&#39;m thankful to have been born and raised in a country that allowed my parents to immigrate, allowed me to go to great public schools, and gave me an opportunity to go to college and medical school at an affordable price.
I am thankful to be an American, and to have grown up in the land of opportunity.
I am also thankful to the many of you who, through your support, helped reelect me to represent California&#39;s Seventh Congressional District.
It has been an honor and privilege serving you these past two years, and as I enter my second term, I will not forget the faith that so many of you have placed in me.
I will take heart in the fact that I am not in this alone, but with a community of supporters, and in the knowledge that by working together, we can accomplish great things.
Lastly, as we break bread with our families and friends, we must take a moment to thank the heroes among us: our veterans and active duty troops, the men and women of law enforcement who keep our communities safe, and the volunteers that show up day after day and work to make their communities a better place.
We see your work and your selflessness - and we&#39;re grateful.
Thank you, everyone. Have a blessed Thanksgiving.
Be well,
Ami
