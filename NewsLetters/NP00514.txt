CONGRESSMAN PEARCE:
MEMORIAL DAY IS A TIME
FOR REMEMBRANCE AND GRATITUDE
Today, we meet to honor the memory of countless brave young Americans
who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.
They fought
courageously at battles waged in places like St. Mihiel, Chateau-Thierry,
the Ardennes Forest, Normandy, Midway, Saipan, Iwo Jima, Okinawa,
Pusan, Inchon, Khe Sanh, Hue City, Khafji, Kabul, and Baghdad.
Some
were captured, never to return.
Others remain Missing in
Action.
Across our country in cemeteries, parks, town squares and
at monuments, we honor all those fallen heroes -- men and women
known and unknown
who answered the call to defend and protect the
worlds greatest and longest-recorded experiment in
freedom.
Many were like us
New Mexicans
who hailed from cities, small
towns, farms and ranches.
We know by their example that
freedom is not free.
Our freedom was purchased at a great
price.
These men and women, who have gone before us, laid down their
hopes and dreams so that we could live freely, and, without fear of
annihilation.
They passed down to us the liberty that they
themselves inherited, with our exceptional and sought-after way of
life.
In tribute and deep gratitude to our fallen warriors, let us not
forget that they fought and died so that the America they loved could
continue to be a beacon of freedom for the entire world.
The
good news is that they were ultimately successful.
Thanks to
their selfless acts, we can celebrate the victory of freedom over
tyranny and oppression.
Whether you will celebrate
Memorial Day at a barbeque, parade, picnic, or simply by catching up on
time with family and friends, I encourage everyone to take a moment to
remember our fallen heroes.
Let us also recall and pray for their
families and friends, who waited for their return and who today
recount their loss.
May we never forget them or their immense
sacrifice.
And may God continue to bless our nation with men and
women who will always answer the call.
