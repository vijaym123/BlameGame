Listen, there are only two things you need to know:
-- Two right-wing groups launched ads against Ami today (and trust us, they&rsquo;re
brutal )
--
and Election Day is exactly two weeks from today
Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:
Republicans are spending more to defeat Ami than any Democrat in the entire country.
If we don&rsquo;t fight back and set the record straight today, our campaign will face a serious setback.
Please, will you chip in for Ami today -- while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference?
