This past week, the American military, along with other members of a regional coalition, conducted air strikes in Syria against positions held by the terrorist group ISIS. ISIS poses a clear threat to the United States. Two journalists have already been gruesomely murdered by this terrorist group, which has every intention to strike our homeland. ISISs brutal tactics highlight the worst of which humanity is capable, and they must be stopped.
While I support the air strikes against ISIS, they must be a component of a larger strategy to defeat this terrorist group. For more than a year, I've been calling on the Obama Administration - in House Foreign Affairs Committee hearings and in op-eds - to work with Congress for a solution in Iraq and Syria. Ive said that if were serious about destroying this threat and its radical ideology, our coalition must conduct simultaneous operations in Iraq and Syria to deny ISIS a safe haven to plot and plan terrorist attacks. Air strikes alone will not defeat ISIS. The initial assistance of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Qatar is welcome, but these and other nations in the region, specifically Turkey, should play a significant role in future operations.
The Administrations response has been a convoluted mixture of hypocrisy and hesitance. The legal authority President Obama wanted to repeal just months ago is the exact same authority he's using to justify conducting air strikes in Syria and Iraq without the approval of Congress. This lack of a coherent strategy was a major factor in my decision to vote against providing the supposed moderate Syrian rebels with weapons.
I have a number of questions regarding our operations in Iraq and Syria that have yet to be answered. 1) Who has command and control? 2) How is success measured? 3) Were already more than $17 trillion in debt
whos paying for this? 4) How do we conduct operations in Syria without making the situation even worse, and then without being responsible for cleaning it up? Most importantly, 5) why dont these actions require Congressional approval?
While it's important for us to confront the threat that ISIS poses, the questions about our overall strategy must be answered as well. Our fellow Americans, especially our troops, deserve these answers. I'll continue to support our troops, but the haphazard manner in which the Obama Administration thus far has handled this crisis, with the President and his military advisers offering conflicting statements on major strategic issues, doesnt inspire my confidence.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
