Dear David,
Veterans Day was a special opportunity to thank our veterans for their service to our nation - bravely protecting the freedoms we often take for granted. This year, the day had even greater meaning for one Missouri veteran and his family.
Sixty years after being wounded in action during the Korean War, Farmington native Dencil Francis
finally received the Purple Heart
he bravely earned, and I was thrilled to be able to help. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, aiding Missouri veterans in any way I can is one of the most important jobs I have.
Mr. Francis, like many in his generation, never sought out praise or recognition - it was his children who contacted my office looking for help tracking down the medal he had earned. At the request of my office, the Army reviewed its records and determined that Mr. Francis should have been awarded the Purple Heart medal. My office and I were then honored to help arrange a formal award ceremony for Mr. Francis.
After exaggerating his age for the opportunity to serve his country, a seventeen-year-old Dencil enlisted in the United States Army, serving as a light weapons infantryman in the 9th Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division. On October 7, 1951, during the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge, Mr. Francis and a comrade carried a badly wounded soldier back 8 miles from the front line to a field hospital. Upon arriving at the hospital, it was discovered that Mr. Francis himself had been wounded. He then spent the next five days in the hospital recovering, but returned to his unit before he could be awarded the Purple Heart.
It's heroes like Mr. Francis who constantly remind me why it's important we do everything we can to ensure our veterans receive the recognition they deserve, and as a member of the Armed Services Committee, it's something I'll
continue fighting for
as long as I'm in the United States Senate.
All the best,
P.S. As always, I want to hear from you about the issues impacting Missouri veterans. Contact me via
