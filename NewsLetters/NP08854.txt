Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters at a press conference
about reauthorizing the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

Dear Neighbor,
I want to take a moment to share what I have been working on, both at
home in the South Sound and back in Washington, D.C.
The 10th Congressional District may be less than 2 years old, but the
people, businesses, and organizations within its boundaries have been
improving our area for generations. I spend a lot of my time discussing
ideas for economic growth and opportunities to hire more people with
those in our community. I know that by working together, we can find
answers to the challenges we face, now and in the future.
MAKE IT HERE, EXPORT IT EVERYWHERE.
In April, I launched the Make it in Washington tour. While touring many
businesses in our area, I've seen firsthand
what is being produced in the South Sound.
During Small Business Week, I asked my Facebook followers to share
their favorite small business in the South Sound
, and the
responses poured in with suggestions of local companies in every city
and corner of our district. We don't just have one business that we
rely on, but a diverse group of entrepreneurs. As I visit more South
Sound businesses, I'll continue to ask them what federal issues matter
most for their bottom line.
HONORING AMERICA'S FIGHTER ACES.
Since World War I, more than 60,000 American fighter pilots have fought
for freedom and democracy across the globe. Fewer than 1,500 fighter
pilots earned the coveted status of Fighter Ace for destroying five or
more enemy aircraft during aerial combat.
It was an honor and a privilege to work with Congressman Sam Johnson of
Texas, a decorated Korean and Vietnam War veteran, to establish a
Congressional Gold Medal for American Fighter Aces. Before the bill
passed, I spoke on the House Floor about a Navy Fighter Ace now living
in Olympia, Cmdr. Clarence "Spike" Borley.
On May 23, 2014, just before Memorial Day, President Obama signed the
American Fighter Aces Congressional Gold Medal Act into law, ensuring
that Fighter Aces such as Cmdr. Borley receive the recognition they've
earned for their amazing accomplishments in the air.
As always, please let me know your thoughts on any issues you think
Congress should consider. Your participation helps shape the decisions
I make and keeps the democratic process strong.
Thank you,
Denny Heck

Dear
Neighbor,
I
want
to
take
a
moment
to share
what
I
have
been
working
on,
both
at
home
in
the
South
Sound
and
back
in
Washington,
D.C.
The
10th
Congressional

may
be
less
than
2

but
the
people,

have

for
generations.

my
