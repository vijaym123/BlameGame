We now have the opportunity to open the 4X-MATCH for our final push towards election. This is the ONLY time this can happen in 2014. Please make sure we don't miss this opportunity!
The latest Fox News poll has the race for Congress tied:
Democrats 45 - Republicans 44.
Boehner has been launching more TV attack ads than ever to claw back the lead.
