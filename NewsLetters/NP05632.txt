D e ar Friends,
October is breast cancer
awareness month.
Breast cancer is the second most common type of
cancer among women, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Only skin cancer is more prevalent.
NCI estimates that 1
in every 8 American women, or 12.3 percent, will be diagnosed with
breast cancer at some point during her life. The government agency also
expects that 232,670 new breast cancer cases will be reported this
year, and that 400,000 women will die from this deadly disease. Breast
cancer also impacts men, but at a far lower rate than
women.
The American Cancer Society (ACS) says women with a family history
of breast cancer are at a higher risk of contracting breast cancer
themselves.
Early detection is crucial, and the ACS says women can
lower their risk of developing breast cancer. Among their
suggestions:
Limiting alcohol intake: Alcohol consumption increases the
risk of breast, esophagus, liver, and other
cancers.
Eating right: An apple,
along with a variety of other fruits and vegetables, may indeed help
keep the doctor away. Cutting back on processed food will also help
lower your cancer risk.
Get moving:
Exercise is just as
important as maintaining a healthy diet, and knowing your BMI, or Body Mass
Index, will help you determine whether your weight is appropriate for
your height.
The CDC offers a
free online
calculator
to help you learn more about your
BMI.
As a senior member of
the House Energy and Commerces Subcommittee on Health, I have been
working closely with my colleagues in Congress to help fight breast
cancer.
I cosponsored a trio of bills this congressional session
that would raise money for research or help improve treatment options
for breast cancer patients.
First, the
Breast
Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act
seeks to raise money for
breast cancer research by minting commemorative coins. Second, the
Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2013
requires insurers to
cover minimum hospital stays for mastectomies and other surgical
procedures related to breast cancer. Finally, the
Accelerating the End
of Breast Cancer Act of 2013
would set up a federal commission to
help eliminate breast cancer by January 1, 2020.
I have
also urged the House Appropriations Committee to boost funding for the
Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program, an innovative
program that has helped stimulate greater insight and research into
the causes and possible cures for breast
cancer.
Breast cancer has claimed far too many lives, including one of my aunts.
I applaud the survivors who have shared their stories or have found
ways to raise awareness about breast cancer. We must continue to work
together until a cure is
found.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
Congressman Engel supports legislation which gives women access to
comprehensive health services.
