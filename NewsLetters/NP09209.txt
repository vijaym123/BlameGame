Celebrating Our Nation's Veterans
This Memorial Day, we remember and give thanks to those who have given
their lives to defend this nation.
Last week, I had the unique
opportunity to meet Col. Richard E. Cole who co-piloted the lead
aircraft of the Doolittle Raid on Japan in 1942.
We owe our freedom
and our security to brave veterans like Col. Cole and the fallen heroes
who served with him.
As families across America spend time with their families over the long
weekend, I encourage everyone to reflect upon those who have made the
ultimate sacrifice so that we are free.
May God bless those who have
fought for our freedom, and may He continue to bless the United States
of America.
Providing for Today's Troops
Last week, the House passed a bill to authorize $521.3 billion to
provide for our national defense.
The FY2015 National Defense
Authorization Act
provides our men and women in uniform with the
resources they need to keep America safe.
It protects the benefits and
religious freedom of our troops, and works to prevent sexual assault
and suicide in the military.
I'm pleased it strikes a good balance
between providing for a strong national defense while still
prioritizing efficient use of our tax dollars.
We've cut over $30
billion from last year's defense budget, but we're still investing in
vital platforms like our B-1 fleet at Dyess AFB.
Balancing Our National Security and Civil Liberties
Last week, I voted for H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act
to reform the NSA surveillance
program.
This legislation was written by House Members with expertise
in intelligence and the courts to ensure we balance our national
security with protecting the civil liberties of all Americans.
Instead of allowing bulk collection and storage of records by the NSA,
this legislation would require the federal government to use "specific
selection terms" to collect data on a case-by-case basis, with
permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).
It
would ban bulk data collection not just for the controversial telephone
program but also for emails, medical records, financial records, and
firearm purchase records.
The USA FREEDOM ACT also establishes a panel of legal experts to
advocate for civil liberties to the FISC as it approves data searches,
to ensure that protecting the rights and privacy of American citizens
is a top priority of the court.
It also significantly increases
Congressional oversight of this sensitive program.
I understand this is an important issue that comes with a lot of
controversy.
Some argue that this legislation did not go far enough,
but I believe the oversight, limitations, and privacy protections
included in this bill are an important first step to holding the NSA
accountable to American citizens.
My first priority has always been to preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States - it was written not just to protect
our individual liberties and but to safeguard America against our
enemies.
In Congress, my job is to maintain that balance between
freedom and security.
I believe if the USA FREEDOM Act is signed into
law, it will better allow Congress to protect our constitutional
rights.

Last

I
voted
for
H.R.
3361,
the
USA

to
reform
the
NSA

program.
This

was

the

to
ensure

Americans.
Instead
of
allowing
bulk

by
the

this
legislation
would
require
the
federal
government
to
use
&#8220;specific
selection
terms&#8221;
to
collect
data
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
with

It
would
ban
bulk
data
collection
not
just
for
the
controversial
telephone

but
also
for
emails,
medical
records,
financial

and

The

of

is
a
top
priority
of
the

It
also
significantly
increases
Congressional
oversight
of
this
sensitive
program.
I
understand
this
is
an
important
issue
that
comes
with
a
lot
of
controversy.
Some
argue
that
this
legislation
did
not
go
far
enough,
but
I
believe
the
oversight,
limitations,
and
privacy
protections
included
in
this
bill
are
an
important
first
step
to
holding
the
NSA
accountable
to
American
citizens.
My
first
priority
has
always
been
to
preserve,
protect,
and
defend
the
Constitution
of
the
United

&#8211;
it
was
written
not
just
to
protect
our
individual
liberties
and
but
to
safeguard
America
against
our
enemies.
In
Congress,
my
job
is
to
maintain
that
balance
between
freedom
and
security.
I
believe
if
the
USA
FREEDOM
Act
is
signed
into
law,
it
will
better
allow
Congress
to
protect
our
constitutional
rights.
