What I've Been Up
to This District Work Week
This past week, I had the opportunity to travel
throughout Georgia's Third District and visit a variety of facilities and
events. Between site visits, community meetings, and other events,
I had the opportunity to hear what matters most to Georgians and their
businesses so I can continue to represent you in
Washington.
Below are photos of some of what I was up to during this district work
week:
Gave a congressional update and took questions at the
Fayetteville Rotary Club.
Honored our officers at the West
Point Police Department's Salute to Fallen Heroes
Memorial.
Checked out Carver Road Middle School's technology classroom
in Griffin.
Visited Jordan Sawmill in
Barnesville.
Toured Mando
Casting Facility in Hogansville.
