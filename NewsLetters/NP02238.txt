Last month, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed new regulations that would prohibit the manufacturing, sale, and imports of the popular 5.56 mm/.223 caliber M855 or green tip, ammunition used in AR-15 rifles. AR-15 ammunition has been exempt under federal law since 1986, because its primarily used for sporting purposes like hunting and target shooting.
Yesterday, the ATF announced they would be abandoning the ammunition ban.
This announcement comes after huge pressure from a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives. Its great news for those of us who believe the proposed regulations would have established an unduly restrictive standard, and interfered with Second Amendment rights by banning ammunition that law abiding Americans legally purchase. On March 4 th , I joined a group of over 230 Democrat and Republican Members of the House of Representatives in sending
a letter
to the Director of the ATF strongly opposing the ammunition ban, and expressing concern that the ATFs new Framework was not published in the Federal Register, which is required when an administration creates a new rule.
I will keep fighting for every American's constitutional rights.
Yours in service,
Randy
