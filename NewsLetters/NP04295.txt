Friends,
During this time of Thanksgiving, it is important to reflect on all we
have to be thankful for, and take time to thank the people who enrich
our lives and the lives of others.
To recognize those who
have touched our lives this year, my office and I participated in 30
Days of Thanks.
Throughout November, we have given a special thank you to people who go the
extra mile.
As the month comes to an end, our final thank you is
going to someone whose determination, integrity, and selflessness has
inspired our state and nation,
Marine Corporal Kyle
Carpenter.
This young hero
answered the call of service; he was deployed to fight the Taliban in
Afghanistan.
On November 21, 2010, his unit was ambushed and
many of his fellow soldiers were injured.
Kyle and his comrades
were fighting the enemy from a rooftop when a grenade landed beside
them.
Without hesitation, Kyle heroically jumped on top of the
grenade, saving the lives of his friends and comrades.
Kyles injuries were unbelievable.
At first sight, doctors labeled
him P-E-A, patient expired on arrival.
Kyle had suffered
incomprehensible injuries, but miraculously started to recover.
He
has since enrolled in the University of South Carolina, and has been
awarded our nations greatest distinction, the
Medal of
Honor.
I'm very pleased with how
far I've come, and I see my injuries and my scars and all my buddies
and everybody that was at Walter Reid with me, you know I see it
almost as a form of character," Kyle told CBS News. "I'm totally fine
knowing that I gave part of myself to a bigger purpose and a bigger cause,
to not only serve my country but try to make a better way of life for
other people and much less fortunate
people."
Kyle, on behalf of South Carolinas Seventh
District, thank you for all you have done for our nation.
Your heroism, courage, and fortitude continue to inspire and encourage
us all.
Happy Thanksgiving to you and your loved
ones,
