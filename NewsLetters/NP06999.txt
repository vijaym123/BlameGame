Dear Friends,
I had the privilege of speaking
today at the Charleston Job Corps' commencement and 50th anniversary
celebration. Ive long supported the Job Corps because of what it does
helps train young people and prepare them for success.
As
the economy struggles to recover, young people in particular have
faced obstacles in finding employment and building a career. That's where
programs like the Job Corps come in, providing training, specialized
education and hands-on experience to better prepare our young people
to compete in the job market and secure employment.
Last
month, the president signed into law the bipartisan Workforce Innovation
and Opportunity Act, which I strongly supported. This law will improve
workforce training programs and help more West Virginians acquire the
skills they need to compete in the job market.
Nationally,
82 percent of Job Corps graduates go on to employment, higher
education or the military, and more than 700 young West Virginians benefit
annually from the Charleston Job Corps' training opportunities. As a
member and past chairwoman of the Congressional Job Corps Caucus, I am
proud to support the important work this program has done in Charleston,
in Harpers Ferry, and across our country.
INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE
I
joined Mason County residents in Hartford recently to celebrate the
completion of much-needed upgrades to the town's wastewater collection
and treatment system.
I helped secure funding for these
system improvements through the Central West Virginia Environmental
Infrastructure Fund, section 571 of the Water Resources Development
Act. In February 2012, I joined Colonel Robert Peterson in Hartford for
the signing of a partnership between the town of Hartford and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers for $171,000. These funds were used to
improve the systems pump stations, water treatment and
manholes.
Numerous other dignitaries also attended the celebration, including
Hartford Mayor and Chief of Police Sam Anderson, New Haven Mayor
Charles Yonker and Hartford City Council members.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the
conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
