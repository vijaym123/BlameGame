A Big Win for Citrus
USDA Announces Funding to Fight Citrus Greening
Citrus is a key part of the Florida economy. Apart from being a symbol for the state, it is an important contributor to our way of life. Citrus accounts for $9 billion of the states annual economy and supports 76,000 jobs. Floridas 18th Congressional District is home to over 45,000 citrus groves.
Reps. Murphy and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) discuss funding to combat citrus greening in 2014
I am proud that working across the aisle with members of the Florida delegation helped secure $125 million for citrus research. The USDA announced $30 million of this will go towards eradicating citrus greening.
Citrus greening is a serious disease which has had a devastating effect on Floridas agriculture industry. Infected trees produce fruit that is green, bitter, and misshapen, making it unsuitable for sale and consumption. Once a tree is infected, it cannot be cured and typically dies within years. In the past decade alone, orange production has dropped by over half due to citrus greening.
The recently announced funding awards will go towards long-term and short-term research projects that will help citrus growers better cope with greening. This includes efforts to improve early detection methods, find ways to keep infected plants productive, and develop trees resistant to the disease.
This announcement is a big win for citrus, a staple of our economy. In Congress, I will continue working across the aisle on the issues that matter most to the 18th District and to Florida.
