Each year since 2002, the statutory method for determining the annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule, known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, has resulted in a reduction in the reimbursement rates.
And, each year Congress has passed bills to override the reductions. On March 31 st , physicians will see a 21% reduction in their reimbursements under the current SGR formula if Congress fails to act and, once again, reverse these cuts.
Last week, the House not only passed legislation to forestall these cuts, it also approved a
bipartisan bill
to permanently eliminate the problematic SGR formula and put in place new Medicare reimbursement and delivery reforms designed to foster stability for our physicians and improve access to enhanced care for our nations seniors. The way in which our doctors are reimbursed by Medicare is an important issue for all Americans, because it is crucial to maintaining a high level of accessible care for all patients.
It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly to join the House in passing this reform.
As Congress moves forward with this positive step towards addressing this issue, I will continue to work to advance our physician payment system further in a direction that provides doctors and patients with lasting solutions for accessible and quality care for American seniors and military families.
Yours in service,
Randy
