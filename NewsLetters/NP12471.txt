Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
There has been a lot of fanfare about the most recent economic forecast
put out by the Congressional Budget Office, the nominally nonpartisan
office charged with analyzing the effects of federal fiscal policy.
The main takeaway has been that the report delivered an election year
hammer blow to ObamaCare, and, to be sure, the report is brutal, as it
forecasts ObamaCare to mean 2 million less full time employees by 2017,
31 million still without any health insurance by 2024, between 6 and 7
million losing their employer-provided plans, a decline in after-tax
income and the creation of a significant disincentive to work.
Perhaps
most significantly, the report predicted lackluster economic growth
driven in large part by declining workforce participation, which is
being partially fueled by ObamaCare.
CBO, though, has a history of getting things wrong.
In fact, CBO
initially predicted that ObamaCare would insure far more, and cost far
less, than they now must admit -- and their initial analysis was used
by ObamaCare proponents as justification for the law's passage in 2010.
CBO has also whiffed on issues ranging from the effects of a reduction
in the capital gains tax rate to the cost of Medicare Part D.
In my view, CBO has been wrong so often because the analysts at CBO
generally ascribe to a Keynesian worldview and fail to take adequately
into account the way government policies skew incentives and, thus,
behavior.
So while I think CBO is right to highlight the negative
effects of ObamaCare and I am glad they are correcting their previous
forecasts, my guess is that they likely underestimated the negative
effects of provisions such as the employer mandate.
One interesting nugget is that when the ObamaCare bill was being
debated in 2009-2010, CBO estimated the 10 year cost of the program to
be roughly $850 billion.
Now, CBO projects the ten year cost to be a
staggering $2 trillion!
This week, the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic
Growth, Job Creation and Regulatory Affairs held a hearing on the
administration's investigation of the targeting of conservative groups
by the IRS. Watch my questioning by clicking here.
The targeting of conservative groups isn't a phony scandal as the
President would claim; it has had the real effect of chilling political
speech. Furthermore, there seems to be no interest from the Obama
Administration in holding anyone accountable. It has become abundantly
clear that the Department of Justice cannot be trusted and a special
prosecutor should now be appointed.
The American people deserve answers. On Sunday, I will be joining
Shannon Bream on Fox News at 1 PM to discuss this hearing and the need
for a real investigation into this gross abuse of government power.
Please tune in!

This week, the President signed a $1 trillion farm bill into law. I
voted nay when the bill came before the House because the farm bill
conference report is a bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in
the way of meaningful reforms. I have previously written on the
less-than-transparent process that produced the farm bill
. The
farm bill conference committee (operating behind closed doors) removed
a provision which would have required members of Congress to disclose
any farm subsidies they receive
. This
is a classic example of the political class taking care of itself at
the expense of the American people.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office

Dear
Friend&#8211;
There
has
been
a
lot
of
fanfare
about
the
most
recent
economic
forecast
put
out
by
the
Congressional
Budget
Office,
the
nominally
nonpartisan
office
charged
with
analyzing
the
effects
of
federal
fiscal
policy.
The
main
takeaway
has
been
that
the
report
delivered
an
election
year
hammer
blow
to
ObamaCare,
and,
to
be
sure,
the
report
is
brutal,
as
it
forecasts
ObamaCare
to
mean
2
million
less
full
time
employees
by
2017,
31
million
still
without
any
health
insurance
by
2024,
between
6
and
7
million
losing
their
employer-provided
plans,
a
decline
in
after-tax
income
and
the
creation
of
a
significant
disincentive
to
work.
Perhaps
most
significantly,
the
report
predicted
lackluster
economic
growth
driven
in
large
part
by
declining
workforce
participation,
which
is
being
partially
fueled
by
ObamaCare.
CBO,
though,
has
a
history
of
getting
things
wrong.
In
fact,
CBO
initially
predicted
that
ObamaCare
would
insure
far
more,
and
cost
far
less,
than
they
now
must
admit
--
and
their
initial
analysis
was
used
by
ObamaCare
proponents
as
justification
for
the
law's
passage
in
2010.
CBO
has
also
whiffed
on
issues
ranging
from
the
effects
of
a
reduction
in
the
capital
gains
tax
rate
to
the
cost
of
Medicare
Part
D.
In
my
view,
CBO
has
been
wrong
so
often
because
the
analysts
at
CBO
generally
ascribe
to
a
Keynesian
worldview
and
fail
to
take
adequately
into
account
the
way
government
policies
skew
incentives
and,
thus,
behavior.
So
while
I
think
CBO
is
right
to
highlight
the
negative
effects
of
ObamaCare
and
I
am
glad
they
are
correcting
their
previous
forecasts,
my
guess
is
that
they
likely
underestimated
the
negative
effects
of
provisions
such
as
the
employer
mandate.
One
interesting
nugget
is
that
when
the
ObamaCare
bill
was
being
debated
in
2009-2010,
CBO
estimated
the
10
year
cost
of
the
program
to
be
roughly
$850
billion.
Now,
CBO
projects
the
ten
year
cost
to
be
a
staggering
$2
trillion!
This
week,
the
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Subcommittee
on
Economic
Growth,
Job
Creation
and
Regulatory
Affairs
held
a
hearing
on
the
administration's
investigation
of
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups
by
the
IRS.
Watch
my
questioning
by
clicking
here.
The
targeting
of
conservative
groups
isn&#8217;t
a
phony
scandal
as
the
President
would
claim;
it
has
had
the
real
effect
of
chilling
political
speech.
Furthermore,
there
seems
to
be
no
interest
from
the
Obama
Administration
in
holding
anyone
accountable.
It
has
become
abundantly
clear
that
the
Department
of
Justice
cannot
be
trusted
and
a
special
prosecutor
should
now
be
appointed.
The
American
people
deserve
answers.
On
Sunday,
I
will
be
joining
Shannon
Bream
on
Fox
News
at
1
PM
to
discuss
this
hearing
and
the
need
for
a
real
investigation
into
this
gross
abuse
of
government
power.
