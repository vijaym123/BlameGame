Friends,
It was a busy week both
at home in Ohio's
14th
Congressional District and in our Nation's
Capitol.
Great
Lakes
This week, we passed
H.R. 212, The Drinking
Water Protection Act , a bill I was proud to cosponsor with my
colleague from Northwestern Ohio, Rep. Bob Latta. As you probably know,
algal blooms in Lake Erie made the water undrinkable in Toledo for three
days this summer. That's unacceptable, so we worked together to pass a
bill that requires the EPA to develop a plan to deal with the algal
toxins in drinking water.
I had a chance to
directly question EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy about this problem when
she testified before me, since I serve on the Interior &amp;
Environment Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee.
I'm leading the charge in Congress to make sure our Great Lakes
are preserved and protected. So this week I was invited to speak before
the
Great Lakes Commission
and the
Northeast-Midwest Institute
to give them an update on our
efforts in Congress.

In Congress I serve on the House
Appropriations Committee, and the main function of that agency is
appropriate, or determine, how your tax dollars are spent. Since I serve on that
Committee, I get to directly question Cabinet members and leaders of
federal agencies about the money they spend. Each year, after they
submit a budget request to Congress, they must come before the
Appropriations Committee and explain why they need the amount of money they asked
for.
It is this process that enables me to
really scrutinize how different agencies are spending your money. This
week, the House Appropriations Committee held over 19 different
hearings where leaders came before us. Here are some of the leaders
I directly questioned this week.
