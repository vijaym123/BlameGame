Weber Sends Keystone XL Letter to Canadian Prime Minister
On Friday, April 4, Congressman Randy Weber sent a letter to thank the
Canadian government for their continued support of the construction of
the Keystone XL Pipeline.
"I believe that the President and his Administration do not see the
importance of building the Keystone XL Pipeline. I, however, understand
that this project means new jobs, new spending in our economy, a
reduction in our energy costs, and an increase in our energy
independence from foreign oil. I wanted to send a letter to the Prime
Minister thanking him for his continued support, and to let him know
that there are members in Congress who are working diligently to get
the permits approved."- Rep. Weber.

Things

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"

inches

1500

because
they
will

You

stack
