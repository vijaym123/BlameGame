Dear Friend,
Today I began my sit-in visits
to the Veterans Administration (VA) Headquarters in Washington to get
the VA to make a decision regarding the future of the Baldwin Park VA
medical complex.
Since the beginning of the year, 180
nursing and domiciliary care beds have sat vacant and the VA has failed
to decide their fate and the future of the clinic at Lake
Baldwin.
In 2012, I
wrote
then VA Secretary, Eric
Shinseki about developing plans for the Baldwin Park clinic and
medical care units.
In April of this year, I initiated a bipartisan
Congressional Delegation
letter . Still there
was no decision.
As I announced last week, I will
personally be at the Veterans Administration office until I secure a positive
response.
Sincerely,
John L.
Mica
