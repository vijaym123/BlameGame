The Conaway Chronicle: An Aggressive Agenda for the 114th Congress, Lamesa Cotton Day, Young Professionals in the Energy
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District:
Strengthening Our Economy:
My fellow House Republicans and I will take an aggressive approach to strengthening our nation's economy. We will work with the Senate to eliminate unnecessary regulations and get the government out of the way of businessmen and women who create jobs. This agenda is important for our energy industry, whose prosperity is vital for our local economy, our national economy, and our national security.

Cotton Field Day in Lamesa:
Plains Cotton Growers, Lamesa Cotton Growers, and the Texas Farm Bureau, joined with Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service to put together a cotton field day in Lamesa on Oct. 31. I visited with cotton farmers about their crops. They shared their concerns and ideas with me. Our Texas farmers produce the food that sustains us and the fiber that clothes us.
Young Professionals in Energy:
We are blessed to have some smart young men and women working in the energy industry in Texas. I had a great conversation with the Young Professionals in Energy in Midland on the night of Nov. 3rd. They had some outstanding ideas and questions. With men and women like this out there, the energy industry in Texas has a bright future.
HEB Feast of Sharing:
HEB in San Angelo will be holding their annual Feast of Sharing on Sunday Nov. 9th.
This will be the 18th year that this Holiday Dinner event has been held.
We are blessed in the 11th District to have companies like HEB that are committed to giving back to the communities in which they do business.
The Feast of Sharing will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Pavilion at 50 E 43rd Street.

Cpl. Eddie Lee Ephraim:
The city of Brownwood will be honoring Cpl. Eddie Lee Ephraim on Saturday Nov. 8th at 8:15 a.m.
Cpl. Ephraim was the first Brownwood resident to die in combat in Vietnam.
During his senior year at Brownwood High School, Cpl. Ephraim enlisted in the Army.
After graduating he went to Fort Polk for basic training, where he became a member of the elite 101 Airborne Division, The Screaming Eagles.
At the age of 20, Cpl. Ephraim was killed by Viet Cong gunfire while in battle in Hue, Vietnam.
He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and many other honors. The city will be dedicating a section of West Austin Ave. in honor and memory of Cpl. Ephraim.
The ceremony will take place at the corner of Booker and West Austin by the Central Fire Station.
This ceremony comes 46 years after his death.
It breaks my heart that it took our nation far too long to recognize and honor Cpl. Ephraim and the other heroes from the war in Vietnam. I want his family to know that we appreciate the sacrifice that he made and that he is not forgotten.
Veterans Day:
On Tuesday, Nov. 11th, America will be honoring and remembering our veterans.
Everyone in the 11th District should attend their local Veterans Day event.
When we do honor our veterans, we need to fully grasp the importance of what they did.
Our veterans fought because evil exists in this world.
Whether it is the Nazis or the Communists or the Islamic jihadists we face today, America has stood and always will stand against evil.
Our veterans have stepped into the breach to directly confront the evil that exists in the world.
In these pictures are San Angelo-native Sarah Ford in Afghanistan in 2007 and my colleague in Congress and my hero Sam Johnson in Korea in 1953.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
