Dear Friends,
Recently I invited high schools students from around our district to participate in our annual Congressional Art Competition. The program is a great way to highlight the importance of art education and an opportunity to showcase the talent of our students.
For the second year in a row, I am inviting students, their families, and constituents to pick a &ldquo;Fan Favorite.&rdquo;
The winning artwork will be displayed in our district office or in a city facility in the winner&rsquo;s home city and will also receive a $200 gift card for art supplies.
To view and vote on your favorite artwork, click here.
The &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; winner, along with other category winners, will be announced at a reception on Thursday, May 15, 2014 at the Pico Rivera Centre for the Arts from 5-7 PM. To RSVP, please call (562) 450-0968.
Hurry and cast your vote today! Voting for the &ldquo;Fan Favorite&rdquo; ends Wednesday, May
14th.
Sincerely,
Linda T. S&aacute;nchez
Member of Congress
