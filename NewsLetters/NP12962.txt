Dear Friends,
In 2010,
my Republican colleagues and I made a pledge to America that we would
cut spending to below 2008 levels and make our government more
responsible.
This weeks passage of the omnibus spending package honors
that pledge and continues the momentum of changing the culture in
Washington from spending and expanding to reducing and improving.
Although we did not get everything we wanted in the negotiations,
House Republicans have been successful in bringing fiscal discipline to
Washington, reducing spending 4 years in a
row.
For far too long, Washington has created an
environment that was unpredictable and chaotic, making business uneasy and
unwilling to invest and create jobs.
House Republicans have been
adamant that Washington should operate more like you and me by setting a
budget and focusing on being a smarter and leaner government.
This legislation also puts the decision making back in the hands of the
legislative branch, as directed by the Constitution, not Obama
bureaucrats in Washington.
The bill focuses on national security
and infrastructure priorities and does not allow the Presidents
priorities to continue on autopilot.
In addition to spending
reforms, we were able to enforce strict and increased oversight over agencies
like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Health and Human Services
(HHS), which are responsible for implementing the train wreck that is
ObamaCare.
This is not a final victory, but it is a
common sense, clear path to getting our economy and job creation moving in
a positive, sustainable direction.
Stay in touch and God
bless,
Tell a Friend
