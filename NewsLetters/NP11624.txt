Action for Congress on Executive Overreach
Think back to civics class &ndash; one of the first lessons you probably learned
was about the three branches of the United States government.
The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches were created as three co-equal
branches of our government under the belief that any one branch should not gain too much power.
Our Constitution is clear: Congress
writes
our laws, the Judiciary
interprets
them,
and the President
enforces
them.
But for the past five years, President Obama repeatedly has waived, amended, or ignored our laws and has
bypassed the Congress, issuing executive decrees from the Oval Office rather than working with Americans&rsquo; elected representatives in Congress.
In response to these actions, the House Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has held two hearings to
further examine this issue and consider possible legislative approaches.
Just a few days ago, the Committee approved three bills that will help rein
in this growing problem.
One of the bills was the
ENFORCE the Law Act
( H.R. 4138 ), which I joined Representatives Trey Gowdy and Darrell
Issa in introducing.
This legislation would
allow the House of Representatives or the Senate to challenge executive overreach in the courts by filing a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for
failure to faithfully execute the laws.
It would also speed up consideration of those challenges, first through a three-judge panel at the federal
district court level and then by providing for direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
It is ultimately up to the Congress and the courts
to check the President&rsquo;s overreach and restore balance to our system of government.
President
Obama may have his pen and his phone, but we have the Constitution and we must abide by it.
I look forward to the House of Representatives taking
action on these bills soon.
