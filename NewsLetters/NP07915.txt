Dear Friends,
We live in one of the most beautiful areas of our country and I invite you to capture and share that beauty in my Scenic 14th Congressional District Photo Contest. The contest started on July 1 and will run until August 1. We have wonderful submissions that you can find in this
photo album on my Facebook Page .
The winning photo will be determined by the most &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; it receives and will be featured as my cover photo for the month of August.
Please send one photo per person to
speier.photocontest@mail.house.gov
and I will add it to the album.
Thank you for participating and sharing your love for our beautiful and scenic district!
All the best,
P.S.: I am participating in the
2014 Democratic Whip&rsquo;s Online All-Star Competition . I hope you will help me bring the 14th Congressional District to the top of the charts! Find out how
