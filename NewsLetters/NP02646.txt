Dear Friends,
Yesterday, I was honored to have the
opportunity to address a joint session of the New Mexico Legislature
to discuss my efforts to grow our economy and create a strong middle
class.
This mean working day in and day out to ensure every New
Mexican has a good paying job, food on the table, and education for
their children.
I know that too many New Mexicans feel like this
vision is slipping away.
That is why we must diversify our
economy by taking advantage of New Mexicos unique resources.
From
our federal labs to our renewable resources, from our majestic lands to
our crops like chile that are the best in the world, these resources
are essential to our future.
Click
here to read my speech and about my efforts to support these sectors
that are vital to New Mexicos economy.
The most
treasured resource we have is every man, woman, and child who calls New
Mexico home.
We must invest in our people.
We must educate our
children from their earliest days and get them on the right path from
the very beginning.
And we must make higher education and job
training programs more affordable and accessible.
Investing in the
people of New Mexico will enable us to grow the middle class and
combat the cycle of poverty.
New Mexico is at a
crossroads.
We have struggled through the deepest recession in a
generation.
The signs of an economic recovery are all around us, yet seem to
be passing us by.
The choices we make today will determine if we
continue along this road or if we chart a new course that puts us back
on the path to prosperity.
By focusing on middle-class
economics and the people that make New Mexico so strong, we can work together
to strengthen working families, rebuild our economy and create more
opportunities for the people of New Mexico.

speech.
Sincerely,
Ben Ray Lujn
