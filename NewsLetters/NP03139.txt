ICYMI:
Last week, I was selected by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn to serve on the Democratic Outreach &amp; Engagement Task Force. This task force will focus on increasing voter participation and supporting legislation that will make voting easier for all Americans.
Fifty years after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act it is vital that we preserve this basic civil right through legislation that rectifies the various ways the right to vote has become increasingly restricted. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the task force to address this critical issue.
