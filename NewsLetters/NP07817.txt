Dear David,
The
Highway Trust Fund is running out of money and, according to the Department
of Transportation, up to 700,000 construction-related jobs are at
risk. What should Congress do to address the need for investment in our
roads, bridges, tunnels, and other surface transportation
infrastructure?
Thank you for taking the time to fill out this survey. I
am honored to serve you.
Sincerely,
JULIA
BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
How should we pay for our roads, bridges, tunnels, and other
surface transportation infrastructure? By raising the gas tax. We should let the Highway Trust Fund expire, because the
private sector can do it. By closing tax loopholes for foreign-owned
corporations. We should let the Highway Trust
Fund expire and give the authority to states and local
governments. By giving companies a
corporate tax holiday (repatriation). By replacing the gas tax with a fee for miles
traveled. Other *By answering
