Carper's Connection

Dear Friends,
As the seasons change, the leaves fall, and temperatures drop, I urge
all Delawareans to get vaccinated before the annual flu season hits.
Each year, peak flu season begins as early as October and lasts until
May.
This week, to prepare for the season, I received my annual flu shot and
I encourage all Delawareans to do the same. We have a shared
responsibility to protect our families and our communities by
protecting ourselves and getting vaccinated.
Here are some ways to stay healthy this flu season from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
Avoid those who have the flu, and if you show symptoms, stay at
home. The flu virus is transmitted from person to person and can be
spread to others from about 6 feet away.
Always wash hands with soap and water. Personal hygiene is
important to stop the spread of the virus and a person may get sick by
touching a surface with the flu virus on it and then touching their
face or mouth.
Get Vaccinated! The CDC recommends all persons six months or
older get vaccinated for the flu.
The flu vaccine can be found at many locations including doctors'
offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies, and college health
centers. You can visit
the website of the Delaware Department of
Health and Social Services at dhss.delaware.gov
for the schedule and location of
clinics offering the flu vaccine.
This season, get vaccinated to stay safe and healthy so you can enjoy
all that fall in Delaware has to offer!
Dutifully yours,
