Dear Friend,
Me (on my mother's lap) with my mother and
brothers
This week, I spoke with more than 14,000 Memphians in a telephone town
hall meeting, introduced legislation to help the Memphis Aerotropolis
develop more quickly, passed two bills that I helped lead through the
House, and a lot more. Keep reading to learn what else happened this
week, and don't forget that Sunday is Mother's Day. Although she passed
away in 2010, I will be thinking of my mother (I'm sitting on her lap
in the photo about surrounded by my brothers) on Sunday, as I do on all
days.

Working for Regional One Health (The MED)
This week, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet with representatives from
the Tennessee Hospital Association, including several from Regional One
Health (formerly The MED), St. Francis, and Baptist. Thanks to my work
alongside members of Tennessee's Congressional Delegation, our state's
hospitals are closer to being on level footing with other states'
hospitals in the way they are reimbursed for the charity care they
provide. I am still working for a permanent fix, but our work has so
far led to an amendment to TennCare that will allow Regional One Health
to receive an estimated $10 million in payments they would not have
otherwise received over the next year. Those funds will go a long way
towards ensuring that Memphis and Regional One Health are able to
continue providing care for those among us who need it most. However,
some Tennessee hospitals have closed and others are in danger of
closing. A huge help would be the State opting into Medicaid expansion
provided by The Affordable Care Act which would benefit our citizens
and our hospitals.
Listening to Constituents
On Tuesday, I hosted another telephone town hall meeting for the
citizens of the Ninth District. I enjoyed the opportunity to speak to
more than 14,000 constituents and discuss a number of issues, including
my efforts to raise the minimum wage, concern for the nearly 300 girls
kidnapped in Nigeria, the confirmation by the U.S. Senate of Sheri
Lipman-my recommendation to the President-as a new Federal Judge, and
my new legislation to help reformed ex-offenders re-enter the workforce.
These town hall meetings offer Memphians like you another way to speak
directly with me and share what's really on your mind. I appreciated
having this opportunity to listen to your perspective on the issues
facing our city and enjoyed discussing my work and legislation with
you. Hearing the perspective, opinions and ideas of the citizens of
Ninth District citizens like you help me best represent the Ninth
District in Congress."

halls, please fill out this form

halls.
Honoring Mothers and Reducing Infant Mortality
Sunday, May 11 is Mother's Day. While we all think about our Mothers
and all they have done for us, it is important that we think of the
many Mothers who need our help. Today, before I flew back to Memphis I
reintroduced my NEWBORN Act, which would help reduce tragically high
rates of infant mortality in this country. For every 1,000 children
born in this country, more than 6 die before their first birthday-and
almost 11 out of 1,000 die in Shelby County. That puts us far behind
other developed countries like the United Kingdom where about 4 out of
every 1,000 die and even further behind Japan, where just slightly over
2 of every 1,000 infants die before they turn one. We cannot claim to
care about children if we do not seek to help the mothers who will
provide them the care they need to survive and thrive.
Infant mortality rates are important indicators of the overall health
of our country. Sadly, Memphis has one of the highest infant mortality
rates in the nation-but high rates are a troubling issue that is not
isolated to urban communities. They are seen throughout our country in
rural areas as well. We must do more to make sure women have the
resources they need to deliver healthy babies, and my NEWBORN Act is a
step in the right direction.
Helping Develop the Memphis Aerotropolis
Last night, I reintroduced two bills aimed at boosting the development
of "aerotropolis" transportation systems both in Memphis and across the
country. My bills, the Aerotropolis Act of 2014 and the Leading and
Expediting Aerotropolis Development (LEAD) Act of 2014, would enhance
economic competitiveness and spur job growth in cities like Memphis by
helping to increase the pace at which burgeoning aerotropolis projects
can develop. In 2010, I also helped secure $1.26 million in funding for
the Memphis Aerotropolis master plan, which Mayor A C Wharton released
to the public last week at the University of Memphis FedEx Institute of
Technology.
The Memphis Aerotropolis is more than a transportation network-it is an
economic development engine for the Mid-South. The need to ship and
receive goods more quickly and over longer distances is increasing by
the day. Establishing aerotropolis transportation systems in Memphis
and across the country will kick-start economic growth, create jobs,
improve our freight transportation network, and enable us to compete
more effectively in the modern global economy.
Supporting Memphis Small Businesses
This week, I announced that Immuno Technologies, Inc., a Memphis-based
medical research and development company, was awarded $1 million in
funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to further develop
a new technology. This funding will support an innovative Memphis small
business developing new technology to help with rapid diagnosis and
treatment of Americans suffering from Lyme disease.
Protecting Homeowners and Helping Families Keep Their Homes
Foreclosures in Memphis have unfairly hurt the middle class, put
unneeded stress on already-struggling families, and torn apart local
communities and neighborhoods. On Wednesday, Congressman Jim McDermott
of Washington State joined me in reintroducing the Limiting Investor
and Homeowner Loss in Foreclosure Act, which would prevent foreclosures
and help struggling families. Our bill would help families keep their
homes and cut down on foreclosures by giving banks and homeowners a
chance to sit down and hammer out a resolution that allows both sides
to benefit, and I hope the bill gets a vote as soon as possible.
Promoting Diversity in Media
On Wednesday, I met with Alfred Liggins, the President and CEO of Radio
One, the largest African-American-owned broadcasting company in the
nation which also co-owns TV One. We discussed the need to ensure a
diversity of voices in radio and television, especially as large media
companies continue to consolidate. As the Ranking Member on the
Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, which
oversees civil rights, and a member of the Intellectual Property
Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over a variety of media issues, I
will continue to advocate for diversity in media.
Helping Bring Our Girls Back
Last month, more than 200 young Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko
Haram terrorists-and over the weekend, the terrorists kidnapped an
additional 8 girls. In recent years, Boko Haram has targeted churches,
schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions,
and entertainment venues across Nigeria to strike fear in local
communities. As a member of the Human Trafficking Caucus, I am
concerned about the trafficking of children both throughout the world
and right here in the United States.
Last week, I reached out to the U.S. Department of State and the House
Foreign Affairs Committee to see what we could do to help rescue the
kidnapped girls. This week, after President Obama's Administration
announced that they had sent an interdisciplinary team to help Nigerian
authorities save these girls, I helped lead a bipartisan Congressional
letter to Secretary of State John Kerry stressing our commitment and
support of the Administration's efforts to help resolve this tragedy.
Working for Sane Marijuana and Criminal Drug Policy
This morning, I joined a House Oversight and Government Reform hearing
on Washington, D.C.'s new law that decriminalizes possessing small
amounts of marijuana. Already, 2 states allow personal use of the drug,
21 states allow for the medical use of marijuana. Late Supreme Court
Justice Louis Brandeis said that states should be the laboratories of
democracy, and while Washington, D.C., is not a "state" it is still a
local government with more than 600,000 citizens and it should be able
to determine its own laws. I strongly support the District's autonomy.
You can watch my opening remarks from this hearing here
.
Protecting Human Rights Around the Globe
On Tuesday morning, I joined my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission
U.S. Senators Ben Cardin of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of
Connecticut as well as Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Jeff
Flake of Arizona in meeting with and welcoming to the U.S. Capitol
Nadya Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina of the Russian protest group
Pussy Riot. Both women have experienced firsthand the harsh and
political nature of Russia's judicial system after they were jailed for
a musical performance. You can watch my remarks following our meeting
here
.
In 2012, when I heard about the fate of these young women, I sent a
letter to President Putin urging their release. In the nearly two years
since, I've met with members of Pussy Riot and their representatives
and responded to their requests to keep their situation in the public
eye. Nadya and Maria are heroes to people everywhere - they stood in
the face of danger, and they were imprisoned for their beliefs. They
have risked their lives and liberty for things Americans enjoy but
often take for granted like free speech. As we reflect upon their
courage, our nation should reinvigorate our resolve when it comes to
defending and protecting human rights and free speech throughout the
world. We must stand up against violations wherever they occur and do
everything in our power to ensure that all human beings have the same
rights we in this country enjoy: the rights to free speech, life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Paying My Respects to the Late Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar
Over the weekend we lost a great man from Minnesota, Congressman Jim
Oberstar. Congressman Oberstar chaired the House Transportation
Committee for the first four years of my tenure on the Committee,
departing Congress at the end of 2010. He knew more about-and cared
more about-our nation's infrastructure and transportation systems than
just about anyone I've ever known. He was also a strong advocate for
bicycling and making bikes an important part of our nation's
transportation system, and he was an avid biker himself. He often said
that the nation needs to switch "from a hydrocarbon-based system to a
carbohydrate-based system."
Chairman Oberstar was also passionate about energy efficiency and
successfully passed legislation requiring solar panels to be installed
at the U.S. Department of Energy headquarters. The photo above is from
one of his last days on Capitol Hill. Chairman Oberstar was the epitome
of a fine public servant. He loved our country and he worked on a daily
basis to make it a better place for all of us.
Protecting Privacy and Ending Domestic Spying
This week, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a bill
that would end the bulk collection of telephone metadata of Americans.
The bill was the result of bipartisan negotiations and compromise, and
I was pleased to support it. I will continue working, as I have been
with my FISA Court legislation
, to protect personal privacy and liberty while keeping our
nation safe and secure from terrorists.
Mourning the Benghazi Tragedy
The death of four Americans in Benghazi, including Ambassador Stevens,
was and remains a national tragedy. Using their deaths as a political
and campaign strategy is wrong. House Republican leaders are doing
everything they can to politicize the killings and distract America
from issues that can help make our country better like raising the
minimum wage, renewing unemployment insurance, and passing a jobs bill.
This week, Republican leaders chose to form a Select Committee to
investigate Benghazi, despite the fact that four Republican House
committees have already investigated it and found no evidence of a
conspiracy or cover-up. The American people deserve better than a
partisan political stunt like this, but when Democrats proposed that
the Select Committee's membership be even between Democrats and
Republicans, we were blocked by the GOP. On Monday, I went on FOX News
to discuss this issue
, and later that night joined MSNBC's Chris Hayes to discuss the
Republican's Benghazi Derangement Syndrome
.
Even a Republican Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon of the Armed Services
Committee, is now criticizing how partisan these investigations have
become. The Select Committee is just another effort to obscure the
facts and there's no reason to think it will uncover anything the other
partisan committee investigations haven't. It's time for Republicans to
stop politicizing this tragedy and work with the Administration to make
the changes we need to make so that it can never happen again.
Protecting Precious Artwork and Helping Make It Available to Americans
This week, the House of Representatives passed the Foreign Cultural
Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Act, a bipartisan bill that I helped
lead with Republican Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio which would make
foreign art more accessible in American museums. Currently, American
museums and universities are too often denied the opportunity to borrow
art owned by foreign governments due to unnecessary legal barriers and
the fear of artwork being caught up in our legal system. Our bipartisan
legislation, which I spoke about on the House floor
, would remove those barriers and make foreign artwork and
artifacts more accessible to the public to view, study and appreciate
in American schools and museums while preserving important protections
in current law for Holocaust-related claims. I am pleased that it
passed and I hope the Senate takes it up soon.
On Wednesday, I also enjoyed the opportunity to see Robert Edsel, the
author of The Monuments Men book (which led to the recent film of the
same name) about the men and women who helped rescue priceless artwork
from the Nazis during World War II. In 2007, I voted for the first
Congressional bill to recognize the work that the Monuments Men did to
protect and preserve important art and culture, and I have joined my
colleague Congresswoman Kay Granger, a Republican from Texas, to see
that they receive the Congressional Gold Medal that they deserve.
Increasing Government Transparency
On Tuesday night, the House also passed a bipartisan bill that I
introduced with Republican Representative Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to
increase government transparency. Our bill, the Open Book on Equal
Access to Justice Act, would reinstate tracking and reporting
requirements of certain payments awarded through the Equal Access to
Justice Act (EAJA) to help ensure the American people have access to
this important information.
Americans have a right to know what their government is doing and their
government has a duty to be as transparent as possible. Without
adequate reporting, citizens' rights cannot be fully protected and the
government risks failing in its duty to its people. I am glad our
bipartisan Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act passed the House
and I appreciate all of Representative Lummis's work to reopen the
government's books and help ensure that all Americans have access to
this information. You can watch my speech in support of the bipartisan
bill here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Find Jobs
First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden recently announced the
launch of a new integrated employment tool to connect veterans and
service members with employers, and to help translate military skills
into the civilian workforce. The Veterans Employment Center
, an integrated, online tool connecting
veterans, transitioning service members and their spouses with both
public and private-sector employers, is the result of an interagency
effort to improve, simplify and consolidate the current array of
employment resources for veterans. Additionally, this will provide one
comprehensive database of resumes for employers who are seeking to
leverage the skills and talents of veterans, service members, and their
spouses. A video tutorial on how to use the Veterans Employment Center
can be viewed here
.
Happy Mother's Day!
As always, I remain.

Working
for
Regional
One
Health
(The
MED)
This
week,
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
representatives
from
the
Tennessee
Hospital
Association,
including
several
from
Regional
One
Health
(formerly
The
MED),
St.
Francis,
and
Baptist.
Thanks
to
my
work
alongside
members
of
Tennessee&#8217;s
Congressional
Delegation,
our
state&#8217;s
hospitals
are
closer
to
being
on
level
footing
with
other
states&#8217;
hospitals
in
the
way
they
are
reimbursed
for
the
charity
care
they
provide.
I
am
still
working
for
a
permanent
fix,
but
our
work
has
so
far
led
to
an
amendment
to
TennCare
that
will
allow
Regional
One
Health
to
receive
an
estimated
$10
million
in
payments
they
would
not
have
otherwise
received
over
the
next
year.
Those
funds
will
go
a
long
way
towards
ensuring
that
Memphis
and
Regional
One
Health
are
able
to
continue
providing
care
for
those
among
us
who
need
it
most.
However,
some
Tennessee
hospitals
have
closed
and
others
are
in
danger
of
closing. A
huge
help
would
be
the
State
opting
into
Medicaid
expansion
provided
by
The
Affordable
Care
Act
which
would
benefit
our
citizens
and
our
hospitals.
Listening
to
Constituents
On
Tuesday,
I
hosted
another
telephone
town
hall
meeting
for
the
citizens
of
the
Ninth
District.
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
more
than
14,000
constituents
and
discuss
a
number
of
issues,
including
my
efforts
to
raise
the
minimum
wage,
concern
for
the
nearly
300
girls
kidnapped
in
Nigeria,
the
confirmation
by
the
U.S.
Senate
of
Sheri
Lipman&#8212;my
recommendation
to
the
President&#8212;as
a
new
Federal
Judge,
and
my
new
legislation
to
help
reformed
ex-offenders
re-enter
the
workforce.
These
town
hall
meetings
offer
Memphians
like
you
another
way
to
speak
directly
with
me
and
share
what&#8217;s
really
on
your
mind.
I
appreciated
having
this
opportunity
to
listen
to
your
perspective
on
the
issues
facing
our
city
and
enjoyed
discussing
my
work
and
legislation
with
you.

Honoring
Mothers
and
Reducing
Infant
Mortality
Sunday,
May
11
is
Mother&#8217;s
Day.
While
we
all
think
about
our
Mothers
and
all
they
have
done
for
us,
it
is
important
that
we
think
of
the
many
Mothers
who
need
our
help.
Today,
before
I
flew
back
to
Memphis
I
reintroduced
my
NEWBORN
Act,
which
would
help
reduce
tragically
high
rates
of
infant
mortality
in
this
country.
For
every
1,000
children
born
in
this
country,
more
than
6
die
before
their
first
birthday&#8212;and
almost
11
out
of
1,000
die
in
Shelby
County.
That
puts
us
far
behind
other
developed
countries
like
the
United
Kingdom
where
about
4
out
of
every 1,000
die
and
even
further
behind
Japan,
where
just
slightly
over
2
of
every
1,000
infants
die
before
they
turn
one.
We
cannot
claim
to
care
about
children
if
we
do
not
seek
to
help
the
mothers
who
will
provide
them
the
care
they
need
to
survive
and
thrive.
Infant
mortality
rates
are
important
indicators
of
the
overall
health
of
our
country.
Sadly,
Memphis
has
one
of
the
highest
infant
mortality
rates
in
the
nation&#8212;but
high
rates
are
a
troubling
issue
that
is
not
isolated
to
urban
communities.
They
are
seen
throughout
our
country
in
rural
areas
as
well.
We
must
do
more
to
make
sure
women
have
the
resources
they
need
to
deliver
healthy
babies,
and
my
NEWBORN
Act
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
Helping
Develop
the
Memphis
Aerotropolis
Last
night,
I
reintroduced
two
bills
aimed
at
boosting
the
development
of
&#8220;aerotropolis&#8221;
transportation
systems
both
in
Memphis
and
across
the
country. My
bills,
the
Aerotropolis
Act
of
2014
and
the
Leading
and
Expediting
Aerotropolis
Development
(LEAD)
Act
of
2014,
would
enhance
economic
competitiveness
and
spur
job
growth
in
cities
like
Memphis
by
helping
to
increase
the
pace
at
which
burgeoning
aerotropolis
projects
can
develop.
In
2010,
I
also
helped
secure
$1.26
million
in
funding
for
the
Memphis
Aerotropolis
master
plan,
which
Mayor
A
C
Wharton
released
to
the
public
last
week
at
the
University
of
Memphis
FedEx
Institute
of
Technology.
The
Memphis
Aerotropolis
is
more
than
a
transportation
network&#8212;it
is
an
economic
development
engine
for
the
Mid-South.
The
need
to
ship
and
receive
goods
more
quickly
and
over
longer
distances
is
increasing
by
the
day. Establishing
aerotropolis
transportation
systems
in
Memphis
and
across
the
country
will
kick-start
economic
growth,
create
jobs,
improve
our
freight
transportation
network,
and
enable
us
to
compete
more
effectively
in
the
modern
global
economy.
Supporting
Memphis
Small
Businesses
This
week,
I
announced
that
Immuno
Technologies,
Inc.,
a
Memphis-based
medical
research
and
development
company,
was
awarded
$1
million
in
funding
from
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
to
further
develop
a
new
technology.
This
funding
will
support
an
innovative
Memphis
small
business
developing
new
technology
to
help
with
rapid
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
Americans
suffering
from
Lyme
disease.
Protecting

and
Helping

Foreclosures
in
Memphis
have
unfairly
hurt
the
middle
class,
put
unneeded
stress
on
already-struggling
families,
and
torn
apart
local
communities
and
neighborhoods.
On
Wednesday,
Congressman
Jim
McDermott
of
Washington
State
joined
me
in
reintroducing
the
Limiting
Investor
and
Homeowner
Loss
in
Foreclosure
Act,
which
would
prevent
foreclosures
and
help
struggling
families.
Our
bill
would
help
families
keep
their
homes
and
cut
down
on
foreclosures
by
giving
banks
and
homeowners
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
hammer
out
a
resolution
that
allows
both
sides
to
benefit,
and
I
hope
the
bill
gets
a
vote
as
soon
as
possible.
Promoting
Diversity
in
Media
On
Wednesday,
I
met
with
Alfred
Liggins,
the
President
and
CEO
of
Radio
One,
the
largest
African-American-owned
broadcasting
company
in
the
nation
which
also
co-owns
TV
One.
We
discussed
the
need
to
ensure
a
diversity
of
voices
in
radio
and
television,
especially
as
large
media
companies
continue
to
consolidate.
As
the
Ranking
Member
on
the
Constitution
Subcommittee
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee,
which
oversees
civil
rights,
and
a
member
of
the
Intellectual
Property
Subcommittee,
which
has
jurisdiction
over
a
variety
of
media
issues,
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
diversity
in
media.
Helping
Bring
Our
Girls
Back
Last
month,
more
than
200
young
Nigerian
girls
were
kidnapped
by
Boko
Haram
terrorists&#8212;and
over
the
weekend,
the
terrorists
kidnapped
an
additional
8
girls.
In
recent
years,
Boko
Haram
has
targeted
churches,
schools,
mosques,
government
installations,
educational
institutions,
and
entertainment
venues
across
Nigeria
to
strike
fear
in
local
communities.
As
a
member
of
the
Human
Trafficking
Caucus,
I
am
concerned
about
the
trafficking
of
children
both
throughout
the
world
and
right
here
in
the
United
States.
Last
week,
I
reached
out
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
State
and
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
to
see
what
we
could
do
to
help
rescue
the
kidnapped
girls.
This
week,
after
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
announced
that
they
had
sent
an
interdisciplinary
team
to
help
Nigerian
authorities
save
these
girls,
I
helped
lead
a
bipartisan
Congressional
letter
to
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
stressing
our
commitment
and
support
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
efforts
to
help
resolve
this
tragedy.
Working
for
Sane
Marijuana
and
Criminal
Drug
Policy
This
morning,
I
joined
a
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
hearing
on
Washington,
D.C.&#8217;s
new
law
that
decriminalizes
possessing
small
amounts
of
marijuana.
Already,
2
states
allow
personal
use
of
the
drug,
21
states
allow
for
the
medical
use
of
marijuana.
Late
Supreme
Court
Justice
Louis
Brandeis
said
that
states
should
be
the
laboratories
of
democracy,
and
while
Washington,
D.C.,
is
not
a
&#8220;state&#8221;
it
is
still
a
local
government
with
more
than
600,000
citizens
and
it
should
be
able
to
determine
its
own
laws.
I
strongly
support
the
District&#8217;s
autonomy.
You
can
watch
my
opening
remarks
from
this
hearing
here .
Protecting
Human
Rights
Around
the
Globe
On
Tuesday
morning,
I
joined
my
colleagues
on
the
Helsinki
Commission
U.S.
Senators
Ben
Cardin
of
Maryland
and
Richard
Blumenthal
of
Connecticut
as
well
as
Senators
Chris
Murphy
of
Connecticut
and
Jeff
Flake
of
Arizona
in
meeting
with
and
welcoming
to
the
U.S.
Capitol
Nadya
Tolokonnikova
and
Maria
Alyokhina
of
the
Russian
protest
group
Pussy
Riot.
Both
women
have
experienced
firsthand
the
harsh
and
political
nature
of
Russia&#8217;s
judicial
system
after
they
were
jailed
for
a
musical
performance.
You
can
watch
my
remarks
following
our
meeting
here .
In
2012,
when
I
heard
about
the
fate
of
these
young
women,
I
sent
a
letter
to
President
Putin
urging
their
release. In
the
nearly
two
years
since,
I&#8217;ve
met
with
members
of
Pussy
Riot
and
their
representatives
and
responded
to
their
requests
to
keep
their
situation
in
the
public
eye. Nadya
and
Maria
are
heroes
to
people
everywhere
&#8211;
they
stood
in
the
face
of
danger,
and
they
were
imprisoned
for
their
beliefs.
They
have
risked
their
lives
and
liberty
for
things
Americans
enjoy
but
often
take
for
granted
like
free
speech.
As
we
reflect
upon
their
courage,
our
nation
should
reinvigorate
our
resolve
when
it
comes
to
defending
and
protecting
human
rights
and
free
speech
throughout
the
world.
We
must
stand
up
against
violations
wherever
they
occur
and
do
everything
in
our
power
to
ensure
that
all
human
beings
have
the
same
rights
we
in
this
country
enjoy:
the
rights
to
free
speech,
life,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
Paying
My
Respects
to
the
Late
Minnesota
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar
Over
the
weekend
we
lost
a
great
man
from
Minnesota,
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar.
Congressman
Oberstar
chaired
the
House
Transportation
Committee
for
the
first
four
years
of
my
tenure
on
the
Committee,
departing
Congress
at
the
end
of
2010. He
knew
more
about&#8212;and
cared
more
about&#8212;our
nation&#8217;s
infrastructure
and
transportation
systems
than
just
about
anyone
I&#8217;ve
ever
known.
He
was
also
a
strong
advocate
for
bicycling
and
making
bikes
an
important
part
of
our
nation&#8217;s
transportation
system,
and
he
was
an
avid
biker
himself.
He
often
said
that
the
nation
needs
to
switch
&#8220;from
a
hydrocarbon-based
system
to
a
carbohydrate-based
system.&#8221;
Chairman
Oberstar
was
also
passionate
about
energy
efficiency
and
successfully
passed
legislation
requiring
solar
panels
to
be
installed
at
the
U.S.
Department
of
Energy
headquarters.
The
photo
above
is
from
one
of
his
last
days
on
Capitol
Hill.
Chairman
Oberstar
was
the
epitome
of
a
fine
public
servant. He
loved
our
country
and
he
worked
on
a
daily
basis
to
make
it
a
better
place
for
all
of
us.
Protecting
Privacy
and
Ending
Domestic
Spying
This
week,
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
unanimously
approved
a
bill
that
would
end
the
bulk
collection
of
telephone
metadata
of
Americans.
The
bill
was
the
result
of
bipartisan
negotiations
and
compromise,
and
I
was
pleased
to
support
it.
I
will
continue
working,
as
I
have
been
with
my
FISA
Court
legislation ,
to
protect
personal
privacy
and
liberty
while
keeping
our
nation
safe
and
secure
from
terrorists.
Mourning
the
Benghazi
Tragedy
The
death
of
four
Americans
in
Benghazi,
including
Ambassador
Stevens,
was
and
remains
a
national
tragedy.
Using
their
deaths
as
a
political
and
campaign
strategy
is
wrong.
House
Republican
leaders
are
doing
everything
they
can
to
politicize
the
killings
and
distract
America
from
issues
that
can
help
make
our
country
better
like
raising
the
minimum
wage,
renewing
unemployment
insurance,
and
passing
a
jobs
bill.
This
week,
Republican
leaders
chose
to
form
a
Select
Committee
to
investigate
Benghazi,
despite
the
fact
that
four
Republican
House
committees
have
already
investigated
it
and
found
no
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
or
cover-up.
The
American
people
deserve
better
than
a
partisan
political
stunt
like
this,
but
when
Democrats
proposed
that
the
Select
Committee&#8217;s
membership
be
even
between
Democrats
and
Republicans,
we
were
blocked
by
the
GOP.
On
Monday,
I
went
on
FOX
News
to
discuss
this
issue ,
and
later
that
night
joined
MSNBC&#8217;s
Chris
Hayes
to
discuss
the
Republican&#8217;s
Benghazi
Derangement
Syndrome .
Even
a
Republican
Committee
Chairman,
Buck
McKeon
of
the
Armed
Services
Committee,
is
now
criticizing
how
partisan
these
investigations
have
become.
The
Select
Committee
is
just
another
effort
to
obscure
the
facts
and
there&#8217;s
no
reason
to
think
it
will
uncover
anything
the
other
partisan
committee
investigations
haven&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s
time
for
Republicans
to
stop
politicizing
this
tragedy
and
work
with
the
Administration
to
make
the
changes
we
need
to
make
so
that
it
can
never
happen
again.
Protecting
Precious
Artwork
and
Helping
Make
It
Available
to
Americans
This
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Foreign
Cultural
Exchange
Jurisdictional
Immunity
Act,
a
bipartisan
bill
that
I
helped
lead
with
Republican
Congressman
Steve
Chabot
of
Ohio
which
would
make
foreign
art
more
accessible
in
American
museums.
Currently,
American
museums
and
universities
are
too
often
denied
the
opportunity
to
borrow
art
owned
by
foreign
governments
due
to
unnecessary
legal
barriers
and
the
fear
of
artwork
being
caught
up
in
our
legal
system.
Our
bipartisan
legislation,
which
I
spoke
about
on
the
House
floor ,
would
remove
those
barriers
and
make
foreign
artwork
and
artifacts
more
accessible
to
the
public
to
view,
study
and
appreciate
in
American
schools
and
museums
while
preserving
important
protections
in
current
law
for
Holocaust-related
claims.
I
am
pleased
that
it
passed
and
I
hope
the
Senate
takes
it
up
soon.
On
Wednesday,
I
also
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
see
Robert
Edsel,
the
author
of
The
Monuments
Men
book
(which
led
to
the
recent
film
of
the
same
name)
about
the
men
and
women
who
helped
rescue
priceless
artwork
from
the
Nazis
during
World
War
II.
In
2007,
I
voted
for
the
first
Congressional
bill
to
recognize
the
work
that
the
Monuments
Men
did
to
protect
and
preserve
important
art
and
culture,
and
I
have
joined
my
colleague
Congresswoman
Kay
Granger,
a
Republican
from
Texas,
to
see
that
they
receive
the
Congressional
Gold
Medal
that
they
deserve.
Increasing
Government
Transparency
On
Tuesday
night,
the
House
also
passed
a
bipartisan
bill
that
I
introduced
with
Republican
Representative
Cynthia
Lummis
of
Wyoming
to
increase
government
transparency.
Our
bill,
the
Open
Book
on
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act,
would
reinstate
tracking
and
reporting
requirements
of
certain
payments
awarded
through
the
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
(EAJA)
to
help
ensure
the
American
people
have
access
to
this
important
information.
Americans
have
a
right
to
know
what
their
government
is
doing
and
their
government
has
a
duty
to
be
as
transparent
as
possible.
Without
adequate
reporting,
citizens&#8217;
rights
cannot
be
fully
protected
and
the
government
risks
failing
in
its
duty
to
its
people.
I
am
glad
our
bipartisan
Open
Book
on
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
passed
the
House
and
I
appreciate
all
of
Representative
Lummis&#8217;s
work
to
reopen
the
government&#8217;s
books
and
help
ensure
that
all
Americans
have
access
to
this
information.
You
can
watch
my
speech
in
support
of
the
bipartisan
bill

Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
Helping

Jill
Biden
recently
announced
the
launch
of
a
new
integrated
employment
tool
to
connect
veterans
and
service
members
with
employers,
and
to
help
translate
military
skills
into
the
civilian
workforce. The
Veterans
Employment
Center ,
an
integrated,
online
tool
connecting
veterans,
transitioning
service
members
and
their
spouses
with
both
public
and
private-sector
employers,
is
the
result
of
an
interagency
effort
to
improve,
simplify
and
consolidate
the
current
array
of
employment
resources
for
veterans. Additionally,
this
will
provide
one
comprehensive
database
of
resumes
for
employers
who
are
seeking
to
leverage
the
skills
and
talents
of
veterans,
service
members,
and
their
spouses.
