Dear
David,
Today, the Social Security Administration (SSA)
announced that the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) for millions of
Social Security beneficiaries -- most of them senior citizens -- would be
a meager 1.7 percent. This marks the third straight year COLA will be
increased less than two percent. I believe this is not high
enough.
Social Security is a pledge to hard
working Americans that they will retire with the dignity they deserve. The
rising cost of groceries, gas, and other goods far outpace the extra
$20 on average per month that seniors in the Capital Region and across
the nation will receive as their cost-of-living-adjustment this year.
In Congress, I continue to push legislation that would increase
benefits for current beneficiaries while making Social Security stronger for
future generations.
As I said, a 1.7%
raise for our seniors is not going to cut it. That is why, in addition to
voting stop annual pay raises for Congress, I continue to work in
Washington to strengthen Social Security, make the program work harder
for our seniors, and enhance its solvency by taking the following
actions:
Voting against the Ryan
Plan : I voted against every budget plan offered by the Republican
House majority that has aimed to privatize Social Security, increase
the retirement age, and cut benefits.
Cosponsoring the
Strengthening Social
Security Act :
I am an original cosponsor of the
Strengthening Social Security Act of 2013
(H.R.
3118) ,
which would change the way COLAs are calculated to
more accurately reflect the costs seniors face, and would keep the
program solvent by ensuring payroll taxes apply fairly to every dollar of
wages.
Introducing the
Support Our Seniors COLA Act:
In
2011, I authored legislation that would have provided a $250 flat payment
to seniors in years there were no COLA, as was the case in 2010 and
2011.
In the Capital Region, nearly one in
five people
including senior citizens, disabled individuals, and
children
rely on Social Security. COLA is based on the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) and is intended to adjust benefits based on increases in
the cost of basic necessities. Due to the economic downturn that
followed the Wall Street collapse in 2008, seniors have seen only three
annual COLA increases since 2009.
If you or
someone you know has questions or concerns about Social Security,
Medicare, or any other federal programs, please do not hesitate to give my
office a call.
My door is always
open.
