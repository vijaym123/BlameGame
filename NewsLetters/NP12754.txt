David -- The
Washington Post
just reported that we&rsquo;re in a TOP TEN race with ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling.
Pundits have always had their eyes on this district, but now it&rsquo;s official. Our rematch against Bobby Schilling is going to be one of the biggest races in the entire nation.
Back in 2012, Schilling&rsquo;s campaign had plenty of mud to sling at us. This time around, they&rsquo;re already saying they will raise $2 million to spend against us.
David, will you help us reach our grassroots goal for our very first 2014 deadline before midnight tomorrow? 24 HOURS TO GO:
Click here to chip in $3 or more to help Cheri hit her FIRST grassroots goal of 2014 &gt;&gt;
We won in 2012 because our grassroots team simply outworked Schilling and his team. Let&rsquo;s make sure we can pull off a win again this November.
Donate $3 or more to help Cheri keep fighting for Illinois&rsquo; 17th district in 2014 and beyond. http://action.cheribustos.com/Top-Ten
