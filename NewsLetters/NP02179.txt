Friend,
Over
800
people signed their name in support of campaign finance reform
and we can&rsquo;t thank you enough.
Our democracy is not for sale and we need to give the power back to the people.
That&rsquo;s why Ami cosponsored the Government by the People Act to give a voice back to the American people and reduce the power of corporate special interests.
If you&#39;d still like to add your name to the petition,

We can strengthen our democracy by addressing campaign finance reform, and we&#39;re grateful to have you standing with us.
Thanks again for your help and engaging with our campaign.
