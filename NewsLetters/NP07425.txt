ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
July 29, 2014
D e ar Friends,
Congress cannot
continue to neglect our nations aging
infrastructure.
U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony
Foxx sent a letter on July 1, to transportation officials in all 50
states warning them that federal funding for road work, construction
projects, and mass transit will soon be cut if Congress failed to renew
authorization for the Highway Trust
Fund.
The House passed legislation to reauthorize federal funding just
in the nick of time, however, the bill only extends financing through
the end of next May.
My concern
is that this short-term fix fails to address the scope of the work
needed to maintain our complex transportation
system.
The New York State Department of Transportation
estimates that over 12 percent of the states 17,000 bridges are
structurally deficient and just over 27 percent are functionally
obsolete.
New Yorks public roads havent
fared any better. According to the White House, an estimated 23
percent of the public roads across the state are in poor
condition.
But New Yorkers don't need statistics to tell
them that the Tappan Zee Bridge is in dire need of a replacement, or
that many of our highways are in need of repair. These are
longstanding issues that must be addressed.
I
have long called on Congress to do more to fix our aging infrastructure
with greater urgency. Its a critical safety issue that we must
address, and one that would boost our economy by creating more jobs.
Our bridges, roads, and highways are
too important to be ignored. I will continue working with my
colleagues to find a solution that addresses Americas long-term transportation
needs.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS

Congressman Engel believes that Congress should work together on a bipartisan
solution that would ensure the Highway Trust Fund remains solvent for
years to come.
