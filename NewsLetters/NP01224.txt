In celebration of Earth Week,
I've highlighted some of the East Bay's most beautiful places . From a local community garden in West Oakland to the breathtaking view at Lake Merritt, the 13th Congressional District is an incredible place to live!
Rest assured, I will continue working in Congress to take bold action that preserves our environment for future generations.
On Sunday, April 25th
enjoy the Earth Day Festival in Alameda
at Washington Park from 10am to 3pm. There, you can browse the farmers market and learn more about energy, health, and recycling.
Happy Earth Week,
Congresswoman Barbara Lee
