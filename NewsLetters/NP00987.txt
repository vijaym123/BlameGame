FROM YORK COUNTY TO
ISIS? CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO RESTRICT TRAVEL TO
SYRIA
Were you surprised to learn a
teenager from York County was plotting to attack U.S. soldiers and join
ISIS?
This troubled young man could have traveled to
Syria, received training from ISIS, and with a valid passport, returned
home to carry out a terrorist attack. With ISIS actively recruiting via
social media, we must enhance our ability to identify and intercept
those individuals who wish to bring harm upon their fellow
Americans.

on
legislation Congressman Pittenger has co-sponsored to restrict travel
to Syria.
That's why
last month, I joined Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA) to introduce
legislation to restrict travel to Syria and other global hot spots where
foreign terrorist organizations are active and recruiting new
members.
If approved, the new legislation
would:
Require the President to compile a list of countries where the
government, or rebel forces, is allowing a foreign terrorist organization to
engage in armed conflict.
Require U.S. citizens wishing
to travel to one of the designated countries to obtain a
license.
This would allow for family visits, humanitarian work, and other
legitimate activity, but would enable authorities to better identify and
intercept individuals planning to join a terrorist
organization.
Impose penalties, including fines and imprisonment for up to
20 years, on anyone violating the travel
restrictions.
As Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and
Unconventional Warfare, I have been working on this issue since August
2014 and co-sponsored an earlier version of the legislation.
Following feedback from the House Armed Services Committee, the legislation
has been updated and was re-introduced last month.
We must
never live in fear, but we should be aware of the new and emerging
threats to our security and take appropriate steps to minimize those
threats.
Earlier this year, I produced a
Preparedness Manual for Terrorist Attacks , including
common sense suggestions on preparing your home, family, and
business.
The manual is available for
free download at PrepareNow.com , or by calling my Charlotte office
at 704-362-1060.

ARDREY
KELL SOPHOMORE WINS 2015 CONGRESSIONAL ART
COMPETITION
Congratulations to Claire Liu, a sophomore at
Ardrey Kell High School, for winning the 2015 Congressional Art
Competition!
"Popo" by Claire Liu, winner of the 2015
Congressional Art Competition.
Click here to view an album
of all 39
entries.
Everyone who visited my Charlotte office
during the
competition
stopped and stared at Ms. Liu's incredible oil
painting
of "Popo," her 100-year-old great-grandmother.
As
winner of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition, Ms. Liu's painting
will now hang in a busy corridor of the United States Capitol,
where
I am confident it will create traffic jams as even more people
have the opportunity to admire her artwork .
Ms.
Liu will also receive a scholarship offer from a prestigious
southeastern arts university, a full scholarship to a summer arts studio program
in Charlotte, and two complimentary tickets to fly her and a guest to
Washington, D.C. to attend a reception in her honor.
The 2015
Congressional Art Competition is carried out at no expense to the
Federal Government.
All expenses are provided locally in the
community.
Congressman Pittenger and Claire Liu, winner of the 2015 Congressional
Art Competition.
Claire
Liu was one of 39 students from Mecklenburg, Union, and Iredell to
enter the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
Each student
displayed tremendous talent and creativity,
and I have
greatly enjoyed looking at each entry.
An album of
all 39 entries is available on my Facebook page , and
I hope
you'll take a moment to view the artwork and consider leaving a note
of encouragement for the students
in the comments
section.
We should all be proud of the great students and great
teachers in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District.
As your Congressman, I'm
also available to assist you with issues involving federal agencies,
including Social Security, Medicare, IRS, passports, and Veterans
benefits.
