Standing Up for Consumer Protection
Recently, Jeff led the charge in the Senate to stand up for consumer
protection against attacks in the Republican budget. Joined by Senators
Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, Jeff underscored the need for
financial reform:
"In less than five years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has
returned more than $5 billion to ordinary American families who have
been ripped off by predatory financial practices - and has saved them
countless billions more by preventing more of these schemes. But this
budget tries to weaken and undermine the CFPB, and aims to roll back
the rules of the road for Wall Street."

On the Road in Oregon
Earlier this month, Jeff held town halls across Oregon to answer
questions and engage with voters on how we can tackle the challenges
facing Oregon and America. In counties throughout the Columbia River
Gorge, Willamette Valley, the coast, and central and southern Oregon,
Jeff highlighted the need for an agenda that prioritizes working
families and makes it easier for middle class Americans to get ahead.
To do this, we need to expand access to child care, make higher
education more affordable, cut taxes for working families, and ensure
equality for all Americans.
Fun fact: Jeff has now completed 19 town halls in 2015 - and 235 as a
U.S. Senator!

Secure Rural Schools
Recently, Congress passed and the President signed a bill that provides
much needed relief for Oregon timber counties and rural communities.
The extension of the Secure Rural Schools program, also known as county
payments, is a critical lifeline for roads, schools, and public safety
in so many Oregon communities.

A Milestone for Medicare
The same bill that extended county payments also included an historic
bipartisan agreement to ensure that seniors on Medicare will continue
to have access to their doctors. Almost every year for more than a
decade, seniors risked losing their doctors because of an antiquated
payment system that would dramatically cut physician reimbursements. By
prioritizing quality, value and accountability, we can ensure Medicare
is there for seniors for decades to come.
