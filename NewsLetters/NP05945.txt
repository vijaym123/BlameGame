Friends,
Last week, my wife, Renee, and I hosted a Womens
Symposium to highlight the tremendously positive impact women have on our
economy and our communities and unite local leaders to discuss ideas
that advance opportunities and return decision-making power back to our
families and away from Washington.
I dont think I
need to tell you that our economy and our nation face a lot of challenges
right now, and Im so grateful for all of the women who attended the
summit to help solve these problems.
We were extremely fortunate
to be joined by a tremendous leader and someone who knows what it
takes to succeedN.C. Department of Commerce Secretary Sharon Decker.
Secretary Decker led an informative discussion about taking
control of your own life, reminding yourself each day about all that you
have to be thankful for, and pursuing your
dreams.
The event featured four workshop sessions:
Business Perspectives from Eighth District Chamber Presidents;
Navigating Health Care in a Changing Landscape; Capital, Contracting, Credit
&amp; Cyber Security; and Common Sense Self
Defense.
Our district is privileged to be home to 10 female
Chamber of Commerce Presidents
all women who are leading the way in our
communities and helping cultivate an environment where businesses can
succeed and create jobs.
The panel of four Chamber presidents provided
insight into their professional backgrounds and experiences and discussed
issues facing small businesses in our region today. Everyone agreed
that change is not going to come from Washington because its not our
government that makes us great, but our people when they have the freedom
and initiative to find work, provide for their families and turn
their ideas into
businesses.
There is no doubt women have transformed
America and are playing a bigger role in the economy than ever before.
The key to continuing to grow womens role in the economy is
through the exact same policies that will benefit everyone.
The
main takeaway for me from the conference is our families want a fiscally
responsible government that focuses on creating genuine
opportunity.
But at this very moment, while some folks struggle to find work and
others take home less of their paychecks, our federal government continues
to get bigger, intrude on our lives and spend more.
According
to an analysis released last week by
Bloomberg Government ,
healthcare.gov, the federal governments flawed Obamacare
enrollment system, has cost more than $2 billion.
This staggering
cost far exceeds estimates originally provided by the Administration and
is just another prime example of Obamacares burden on hardworking
taxpayers.
On top of squandering taxpayer dollars, Obamacare is
forcing our families to deal with rising health care costs, restricted
access and cancelled insurance plans.
The
Carolina
Journal
reported last week that a large number of North Carolina
residents are receiving termination notices, and others face up to 60%
increases in premiums within the next two years.
And at the heart of
the Presidents disastrous health care reform is excessive government
overreach.
Here in North Carolina we neither want nor need
bureaucrats in Washington telling us what plan is best for us or what
doctor suits our
needs.
The answer to our nations growing
problems isnt more government - its less.
Its ensuring our
families have the ability to make their own health care decisions; its
getting government off the backs of our job creators; and its returning
control back to our local communities. I chose to run for Congress
because I believe in empowering individuals, families and small
businesses to make their own decisions.
I will continue to work to
eliminate the governments never-ending authority and give you the
ability to control your own
life.
Until next week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of
Congress (NC-08)
