Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
I had a great time giving a Capitol tour to students with the
Native American Political Leadership Program.
Stop Government Abuse
This week in the House we passed several bills to stop government abuse
by creating more accountability and fighting against overregulation. It
is now the Senate's job to continue the work and help keep America on
the right track.
IRS Targeting
We voted in the House to stop the IRS targeting of political groups.
H.R. 3865 prohibits for one year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
from amending rules and regulations pertaining to 501(c)(4) groups. The
legislation was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote
of 243-176.
In light of what we have learned about the IRS improperly scrutinizing
the applications for tax-exempt status based on groups having names
including the words "Tea Party" or "Patriots" it is clear this kind of
legislation is needed. Any changes to the rules should be evaluated
only after the ongoing investigation of the IRS's targeting of
conservative groups has been completed to see if any changes are truly
warranted or needed.
For over 50 years, an organization has been eligible for a 501 (c)(4)
tax exemption if it is primarily engaged in promoting social welfare.
Current law does not consider non-partisan get-out-the vote efforts,
voter registration drives or candidate forums as political campaign
intervention. However, the proposed Department of Treasury regulations
published in November 2013 would mean organizations who engage in these
types of activities would be in jeopardy of losing their 501(c)(4)
status.
The free exercise of First Amendment rights must be protected. This
Administration should not use the tax code or the IRS to stifle a
group's rights to engage in the freedom of speech.
We had numerous students from the Second District compete in the state
robotics competition last Saturday. The Howe Lions FLL Robotics Team
from LeFlore County was one of the teams that represented our district
well!
Taxpayers Right-to-Know
There is a need in our nation to provide more public accountability of
federal agencies and to reduce waste and duplication in government
agencies. That's why I supported the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act, H.R.
1423, which was authored by fellow Oklahoman U.S. Rep. James Lankford.
The legislation requires every federal agency to provide to taxpayers
an annual report of its programs, costs, and expenditures. It also
would require a report on the number of program recipients. All of the
information would be required to be available on the agency's website
so the public can view this information.
Additionally under H.R. 1423, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
would be required to publish a report online identifying duplicative
programs and recommendations to reduce fraud, abuse and waste.
Quite often federal agencies are so bloated and bureaucratic that
common sense and good business practices are absent. These agencies
forget who funds them in the first place - the American taxpayers.
Requiring accountability is a logical step to protect taxpayers. In the
private sector detailing this kind of information is common sense
standard procedure. Sadly, there is often little common sense in the
operation of our federal government.
Thanks to Michael Nasche of Baker Hughes for coming and testifying
before the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee, discussing the
importance of hiring veterans. Baker Hughes has more than 70
self-identified veterans in Oklahoma and more than half of those
individuals reside in Claremore and surrounding areas.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
H.R. 3193, the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness
Improvement Act of 2013, is aimed at restructuring the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau for greater accountability and improved
consumer privacy. The legislation passed the House by a vote of
232-182.
The current structure of this agency lacks both checks and balances as
well as accountability to Congress or the Executive Branch.
The legislation changes the structure of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was created as part of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. H.R. 3193 would
replace the CFPB's director with a five-member bipartisan commission
serving staggered terms. Members would be appointed by the President
and confirmed by the Senate.
This legislation boosts consumer privacy protection by requiring the
Commission to get consent from consumers prior to collecting their
private personal information.
A look inside the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
Hearing Room as I participate in a Highways and Transit Subcommittee
hearing.
Week Ahead
Four energy bills have the possibility of hitting the House floor next
week. These bills deal with coal mining regulations, propane issues,
environmental reviews and climate regulations that would impact our
state.
The propane crisis continues to affect Oklahomans trying to heat their
homes. One of the four energy bills next week, H.R. 4076, particularly
deals with the propane issues many states like Oklahoma currently face.
This week I cosponsored H.R. 4076, the Home Heating Emergency
Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act of 2014. This bill would
improve our distribution of propane and increase supply.

Dear

Thank
you
very
much
for

IRS

3865

for

year
the
Internal

Service
(IRS)
from
amending
rules
and

pertaining
to
501(c)(4)
groups.
The
legislation
was
approved
by
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
by
a
vote
of
243-176.
In
light
of
what
we
have
learned
about
the
IRS
improperly
scrutinizing
the
applications
for
tax-exempt
status
based
on
groups
having
names
including
the
words
&#8220;Tea
Party&#8221;
or
&#8220;Patriots&#8221;
it
is
clear
this
kind
of
legislation
is
needed.
Any
changes
to
the
rules
should
be
evaluated
only
after
the
ongoing
investigation
of
the
IRS&#8217;s
targeting
of
conservative
groups
has
been
completed
to
see
if
any
changes
are
truly
warranted
or
needed.
For
over
50
years,
an
organization
has
been
eligible
for
a
501
(c)(4)
tax
exemption
if
it
is
primarily
engaged
in
promoting
social
welfare.
Current
law
does
not
consider
non-partisan
get-out-the
vote
efforts,
voter
registration
drives
or
candidate
forums
as
political
campaign
intervention.
However,
the
proposed
Department
of
Treasury
regulations
published
in
November
2013
would
mean
organizations
who
engage
in
these
types
of
activities
would
be
in
jeopardy
of
losing
their
501(c)(4)
status.
The
free
exercise
of
First
Amendment
rights
must
be
protected.
This
Administration
should
not
use
the
tax
code
or
the
IRS
to
stifle
a
group&#8217;s
rights
to
engage
in
the
freedom
of
speech.
We
had
numerous
students
from
the
Second
District
compete
in
the
state
robotics
competition
last
Saturday.
The
Howe
Lions
FLL
Robotics
Team
from
LeFlore
County
was
one
of
the
teams
that
represented
our
district
well!
Taxpayers
Right-to-Know
There
is
a
need
in
our
nation
to
provide
more
public
accountability
of
federal
agencies
and
to
reduce
waste
and
duplication
in
government
agencies.
That's
why
I
supported
t he
Taxpayers
Right-to-Know
Act,
H.R.
1423,
which
was
authored
by
fellow
Oklahoman
U.S.
Rep.
James
Lankford.
The
legislation
requires
every
federal
agency
to
provide
to
taxpayers
an
annual
report
of
its
programs,
costs,
and
expenditures.
It
also
would
require
a
report
on
the
number
of
program
recipients.
All
of
the
information
would
be
required
to
be
available
on
the
agency&#8217;s
website
so
the
public
can
view
this
information.
Additionally
under
H.R.
1423,
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
(OMB)
would
be
required
to
publish
a
report
online
identifying
duplicative
programs
and
recommendations
to
reduce
fraud,
abuse
and
waste.
Quite
often
federal
agencies
are
so
bloated
and
bureaucratic
that
common
sense
and
good
business
practices
are
absent.
These
agencies
forget
who
funds
them
in
the
first

&#8211;
the
American
taxpayers.
Requiring
accountability
is
a
logical
step
to
protect
taxpayers.
In
the
private
sector
detailing
this
kind
of
information
is
common
sense
standard
procedure.
Sadly,
there
is
often
little
common
sense
in
the
operation
of
our
federal
government.

the
