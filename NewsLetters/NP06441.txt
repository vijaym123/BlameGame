Dear David,
Yesterday, I was privileged to honor the fallen heroes of 9/11 at the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. Working with the Families of Flight 93 and members of Congress, we advanced the construction of the memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
I&#39;m grateful that so many family members of the heroes of Flight 93 were able to attend the ceremony.
Today, we pay tribute to and draw inspiration from the heroes who were lost on September 11, 2001. On that bright sunny day, in New York, at the Pentagon and in the skies above Pennsylvania - heroic Americans confronted the darkness with bravery and fortitude. Countless patriots acted selflessly on behalf of our nation. Let us today recommit ourselves to honoring their sacrifice. May God bless them, God bless their families and God bless America.
Sincerely,
