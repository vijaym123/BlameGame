Nate Silver: &ldquo;Democrats could win in a shocker&rdquo;
Friend -- We&rsquo;re still pushing for every last vote.
Races are tied in KY 44-43 (McConnell), NC 43-42, GA 47-47, CO 45-43, IA 47-47, and AK 46-45.
That&rsquo;s SIX deadlocked races. If we win just three, we&rsquo;ll keep the Senate. We HAVE to do it.
