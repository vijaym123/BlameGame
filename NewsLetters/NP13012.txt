Bipartisan Budget Deal
The House-Senate passed HR 3547, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2014 by large bi-partisan margins. The agreement contains all 12 of the annual appropriations bills.
The agreement's total spending level is within the cap on discretionary spending set by the Bipartisan Budget Act (PL 113-67), which rolled back a portion of scheduled cuts under sequestration and set new caps for defense and nondefense spending.
To learn more about the spending bills, visit the
Appropriations Committee website .
After the government shutdown last year, Congress was able to belatedly pass a budget and spending bills for the current fiscal year.
Hopefully, that spirit of working together can extend to other issues, such as finding a way to continue extended unemployment benefits.
Farm Bill
The House-Senate conference charged with negotiating a final agreement on reauthorizing farm and food programs is still without a deal.
The future of such programs as the dairy program, country-of-origin-labeling, and SNAP will likely be decided by early February.
