URGENT request
Folks, I know I emailed you last night, but this can&rsquo;t wait.
This morning, we found out Doug Ose gave himself $1 MILLION dollars for the final week of his campaign.
Look, I won&rsquo;t lie: with 5 days left, that money gives Ose a serious advantage.
I promised I wouldn&rsquo;t let money alone determine the outcome of this election, but if we don&rsquo;t respond immediately, we risk falling short at the worst possible time.
So please, I have an URGENT request
-- can you rush a contribution of any amount to our campaign? Every dollar makes a difference.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;ve never needed you more, friend.
Be well,
Ami
