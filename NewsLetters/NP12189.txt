Do you think raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour will be good
for our economy?
Yes -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would raise wages for
nearly 25 million Americans, thus giving hard-working people more
take-home pay to then spend on goods and services
Maybe -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would be good for
families, but it could result in businesses offering fewer jobs than
expected
No -- Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 is bad for businesses,
families, and the economy

This week the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a
study on raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per
hour. According the report, for families whose income is between one
and three times the poverty threshold, increasing the minimum wage to
$10.10 an hour would add $12 billion to their annual incomes.
I am currently a cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which raises
the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and I fully support the
President's recent executive action to make this hourly rate the
standard for federal contractors.
Whether it is for the public or private sector, it is time to raise the
wage.
Reducing Gun Violence
In a previous edition of The 47th Flyer, I said that gun violence is a
public health epidemic. While dozens of bills have been introduced in
Congress this year aimed at reducing the prevalence of this epidemic,
none of these bills have been brought to the House Floor for a vote.
That is why I have, with Representatives Mike Thompson and Elizabeth
Esty, introduced a resolution to ensure that the issue is not
forgotten. In case you missed it, I wrote a commentary about the gun
violence resolution in the Orange County Register, which was published
on February 6th. I encourage you to read the commentary by visiting:

Investing in Education
Last week I became a cosponsor of H.R. 1343, the Project Ready STEM
Act, which would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award grants for science,
technology, engineering, and math education (STEM) programs in
elementary and secondary school. STEM education investments are
critical to the success of future generations and their ability to
innovate and stimulate our economy. These kinds of investments must
continue if we are to sustain a well-educated and highly skilled
workforce.
Family Leave No Matter Where You Work
I have also become a cosponsor of H.R. 3712, the Family and Medical
Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, which would establish the Office of Paid
Family and Medical Leave within the Social Security Administration and
give working women and men the ability to earn up to 12 weeks of paid
family and medical leave. Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton
signed into law the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act, which
requires larger employers and public agencies to provide up to 12 weeks
of unpaid leave. Sadly, about 40 percent of workers fall through the
cracks because the law only requires many companies with 50 or more
employees to comply. The FAMILY Act would change that by using existing
Federal resources to create a paid family and medical leave insurance
program for all workers, regardless of the size of the company they
work for. The United States is one of the only modernized countries not
to have a national family and medical leave policy and this needs to
change.
Protecting Seniors From Fraud
Another health care-related bill that I have recently decided to
cosponsor is H.R. 3616, the Protecting Seniors from Health Care Fraud
Act of 2013. This bill would require the Department of Health and Human
Services' (HHS) National Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program to
generate a report with policy recommendations on the most prevalent
health care fraud schemes across the nation. HHS would then mail
seniors a list detailing the top ten health care fraud schemes and how
to avoid them. Our nation's seniors are all too often subject to
fraudulent health care programs and scams. We must ensure that our
seniors are equipped with the latest information about criminal and
malicious behavior so they can protect themselves.
Manufacturing in Long Beach
On Tuesday, I visited the Cunico Corporation in Long Beach to see
firsthand the skilled jobs and business that the production of U.S.
Navy aircraft carriers brings to the region. The Long Beach company is
providing parts for the construction of Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the
first ship in the newest class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers,
which was christened on November 9, 2013, and for the overhaul of USS
Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), which is undergoing its 3-and-a-half year
upgrade.
It was truly a pleasure to meet the hardworking employees at Cunico
Corporation and learn more about the significant contributions they
make to the local economy. This tour provided me with the opportunity
to see how important aircraft carrier new construction and maintenance
funding is to skilled jobs and businesses in our community.
Innovation in Cypress
On Wednesday, I took a tour of Cypress-based ADC Energy USA. This
hi-tech firm has created and developed a wiring infrastructure that
provides both AC- and DC-electricity at receptacles. This eliminates
the need for convertors, such as the small transformers that charge our
phones, and the energy lost in the typical conversion process. ADC's
innovations are providing high-skilled jobs to our region, while
showcasing the talented and creative minds that the 47th District has
to offer.
"Germane"
When offering an amendment to a bill, Members of Congress must ensure
that it is "germane," meaning it must be relevant to the main issue
being addressed in the bill. For example, one cannot offer an amendment
about Syria to a bill that addresses the drought in California. That
amendment would not be germane, and could not be brought to the House
floor for a vote.
The House requires germaneness of an amendment at all times unless an
exception is made by special rule. However, in most circumstances, the
Senate does not require germaneness. Senate rules permit Senators to
offer amendments on any subject even if unrelated to the bill's topic.
Was it wise for Congress to vote on a clean debt ceiling proposal with
no strings attached?
67.1%
Yes - When it comes to the full faith and credit of the United
States, Congress should focus solely on being able to pay its bills on
time
4.1%
Maybe - Congress still had two more weeks to debate the
issue; they should have waited a little longer to weigh the options
26.0%
No - The debt ceiling proposal should have been tied to the
defunding or consolidation of other government programs, such as the
Affordable Care Act.

(CBO)
released
a

on
raising
the

According
the

for

is
between
one

the

increasing
the

Reducing
Gun
Violence
In
a
previous
edition
of
The
47th
Flyer,
I
said
that
gun
violence
is
a
public
health
epidemic.
While
dozens
of
bills
have
been
introduced
in
Congress
this
year
aimed
at
reducing
the
prevalence
of
this
epidemic,
none
of
these
bills
have
been
brought
to
the
House
Floor
for
a
vote.
That
is
why
I
have,
with
Representatives
Mike
Thompson
and
Elizabeth
Esty,
introduced
a
resolution
to
ensure
that
the
issue
is
not
forgotten.
In
case
you
missed
it,
I
wrote
a
commentary
about
the
gun
violence
resolution
in
the
Orange
County

which
was
published
on
February

Last

I
became
a

of
H.R.

the
Project
Ready

which
would
amend
the
Elementary

the

award

STEM

investments
are
critical
to
the
success
of
future

and
their
ability
to
innovate
and
stimulate
our
economy.
These
kinds

must
continue
if
we
are
to
sustain
a
well-educated
and
highly
skilled
workforce.
Family
Leave
No
Matter
Where
You
Work
I
have
also
become
a
cosponsor
of
H.R.
3712,
the
Family
and
Medical
Insurance
Leave
(FAMILY)
Act,
which
would
establish
the
Office
of
Paid
Family
and
Medical
Leave
within
the
Social
Security
Administration
and
give
working
women
and
men
the
ability
to
earn
up
to
12
weeks
of
paid
family
and
medical
leave.
Twenty
years
ago,
President
Bill
Clinton
signed
into
law
the
landmark
Family
and
Medical
Leave
Act,
which
requires
larger
employers
and
public
agencies
to
provide
up
to
12
weeks
of
unpaid
leave.
Sadly,
about
40
percent
of
workers
fall
through
the
cracks
because
the
law
only
requires
many
companies
with
50
or
more
employees
to
comply.
The
FAMILY
Act
would
change
that
by
using
existing
Federal
resources
to
create
a
paid
family
and
medical
leave
insurance
program
for
all
workers,
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
company
they
work
for.
The
United
States
is
one
of
the
only
modernized
countries
not
to
have
a
national
family
and
medical
leave
policy
and
this
needs
to
change.
Protecting
Seniors
From Fraud
Another
health
care-related
bill
that
I
have
recently
decided
to
cosponsor
is
H.R.
3616,
the
Protecting
Seniors
from
Health
Care
Fraud
Act
of
2013.
This
bill
would
require
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services&#8217;
(HHS)
National
Health
Care
Fraud
and
Abuse
Control
Program
to
generate
a
report
with
policy
recommendations
on
the
most
prevalent
health
care
fraud
schemes
across
the
nation.
HHS
would
then
mail
seniors
a
list
detailing
the
top
ten
health
care
fraud
schemes
and
how
to
avoid
them.
Our
nation&#8217;s
seniors
are
all
too
often
subject
to
fraudulent
health
care
programs
and
scams.
We
must
ensure
that
our
seniors
are
equipped
with
the
latest
information
about
criminal
and
malicious
behavior
so
they
can
protect
themselves.

On
Tuesday,
I

to
see

the

business
that
the
production
of
U.S.

The
Long

is

which
was

and
for
the

which
is
undergoing
its
3-and-a-half

It
was
truly
a
pleasure
to
meet
the
hardworking
employees
at
Cunico
Corporation
and
learn
more
about
the
significant
contributions
they
make
to
the
local
economy.
This
tour
provided
me
with
the
opportunity
to
see
how
important
aircraft
carrier
new
construction
and
maintenance
funding
is
to
skilled
jobs
and
businesses
in
our
community.
Innovation
in
Cypress
On
Wednesday,
I
took
a
tour
of
Cypress-based
ADC
Energy
USA.
This
hi-tech
firm
has
created
and
developed
a
wiring
infrastructure
that
provides
both
AC-

This
eliminates
the
need
for

such
as
the

and
the
energy
lost
in
the

ADC&#8217;s

are

high-skilled

while
showcasing
the
talented
and
creative
minds
that
the
47th
District
has
to
offer.
&#8220;Germane&#8221;
When
offering
an
amendment
to
a
bill,
Members
of
Congress
must
ensure
that
it
is
&#8220;germane,&#8221;
meaning
it
must
be
relevant
to
the
main
issue
being
addressed
in
the
bill.
For
example,
one
cannot
offer
an
amendment
about
Syria
to
a
bill
that
addresses
the
drought
in
California.
That
amendment
would
not
be
germane,
and
could
not
be
brought
to
the
House
floor
for
a
vote.
The
House
requires
germaneness
of
an
amendment
at
all
times
unless
an
exception
is
made
by
special
rule.
However,
in
most
circumstances,
the
Senate
does
not
require
germaneness.
Senate
rules
permit
Senators
to
offer
amendments
on
any
subject
even
if
unrelated
to
the
bill's
topic.
Was
it
wise
for
Congress
to
