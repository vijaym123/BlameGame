LEGISLATION
December 15, 2013
Dear
David,
Last week, I
voted in favor of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, the first bicameral
and bipartisan budget agreed upon since 1986. Let me be clear, the
deal is not perfect. It does not solve our nations spending problem or
fix the long-term problems that plague our economy. However, it is a
positive step in the right direction to put us on the path to permanent
reforms that will help us get our country back on a fiscally
sustainable track. While I would support a proposal that further reduces
spending to "sequester" levels, there are not the votes to pass that plan.
This budget recognizes the realities of divided government while
staying true to conservative principles. Weve protected the military from
cuts, passed federal pension reform and included new protections
against waste, fraud and abuse. The bill,
H.J. Res. 59 ,
was negotiated by the chairmen of the House and Senate budget
committees and passed the House on a bipartisan 332-94
vote.

The fact that the last real budget we have to
work with was passed in 1997, under a democratic majority is simply
unacceptable. Continuing the cycle of enacting temporary stop gap funding
bills only kicks the can down the road. Now is the time for Congress
and the President to agree on a long term plan to reduce the deficit
and balance the budget.
The two-year agreement settles
federal funding for the coming fiscal year at $1.012 trillion, a reduction
of $115 billion from the $1.127 trillion the government was spending
when I took office.
According to spending figures included in the
2013 Congressional Research Service report, The
Budget Control Act of 2011: The Effects on Spending and the Budget
Deficit, "
the agreement spends less than Democrats request and
previous Republican budgets as illustrated in the chart
below.
Key provisions of the bill include
eliminating wasteful entitlements, ending favoritism in corporate
welfare, and creating real reforms that start to address the real problems
our country faces. The agreement does not raise taxes, makes
responsible spending cuts, maintains a strong military, and ensures the
government continues to provide essential services. By implementing permanent
reforms to mandatory spending programs, it would reduce the federal
deficit by approximately $23 billion over the next two
years.
This agreement brings transparency to the budget process and returns
control of spending to Congress by ending the practice of passing
Continuing Resolutions, which essentially rubber-stamp the Presidents
spending plans and empower bureaucracies. Passing a budget means that the
House will hold open hearings and consider each program on its merits
in a true appropriations process, rather than imply giving the
President a lump sum to use as he sees fit. Were moving away from the
status quo and restoring Congress power to restrain spending through an
open appropriations process.
By returning the budget process
back to regular order, the agreement provides certainty to businesses
and families across
America.
