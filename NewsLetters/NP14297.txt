Video Address Text
Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning in to our Monthly Video
Address. Today, I am at the Callands War
Memorial in Pittsylvania County, which pays
tribute to those who have given the
ultimate sacrifice for their country during
World War II, the Korean War and the
Vietnam War.
We as a nation sincerely thank
the brave men and women who have selflessly
served our nation. Throughout the
generations, our veterans have courageously
preserved our freedoms, and for that, we
are forever grateful.
To the over 800,000 veterans who
call Virginia home, I thank you for the
immeasurable sacrifices you have made. I am
proud to serve you in Washington.
As we work to address the
challenges facing our nation, we do so with
the sacrifices of our veterans in mind.
This month, the House of Representatives
passed numerous pieces of legislation to
aid our veterans, including H.R. 2189,
which is an important step in addressing
the unreasonable backlog of disability
claims we now have with the Department of
Veterans Affairs. Today, the backlog of
veterans disability claims stands at
approximately 410,000 and the average
waiting period at the regional VA office in
Roanoke is 448 days. Our veterans should
never be forced to wait over 400 days for
the medical benefits they deserve. I am
encouraged by the passage of this
legislation, and it is my sincere hope that
it will move us closer to providing a
solution to the current backlog.
The House also passed legislation
this month to reduce veteran homelessness
by putting in place meaningful reforms to
the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which provides housing
assistance to disabled veterans.
Additionally, we approved the Veterans
Economic Opportunity Act, which establishes
programs to provide economic opportunity
assistance to our veterans.
We must ensure that our veterans
receive the benefits they so genuinely
deserve in a timely manner, and it is my
sincere hope that the legislation passed by
the House this month moves swiftly through
the legislative process so that we may
rectify the faults in our current
system.
I am grateful for the opportunity
to represent you in Washington as we look
for ways to make a brighter future for our
country. And this Veterans Day, we remember
that it is because of our nations
veterans and its military servicemen and
women that we have the freedom and liberty
to work toward a better future for our
children and grandchildren.
Again, thank you for tuning in to
our monthly video address. I encourage you
to sign up for more frequent updates at our
website at

and join the conversation on our social
media pages. Thank you.
