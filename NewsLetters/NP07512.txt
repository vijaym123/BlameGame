Dear
Friends:
This week, I joined Donald Trump to mark the
beginning of work in turning the DC Old Post Office from a multi-million
dollar a year loss to the U.S. Treasury to a multi-million dollar
gain for the taxpayers.
Hearings I conducted in the
partially vacant structure, located two blocks from the White House,
forced GSA bureaucrats to act and now a thousand jobs will be realized in
reconstruction and future operation of the Trump Hotel and Commercial
Center. With more than 14,000 properties vacant or underutilized, we
can and we will save billions as I move forward with this
effort.
With my
regards and best wishes, I
remain
Most respectfully,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
