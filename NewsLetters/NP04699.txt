Honoring Our Veterans
Tomorrow is Veterans Day, and all across the country communities will
be honoring the lives and legacy of our nations veterans. We are so
blessed to live in a nation that has provided the greatest amount of
opportunity for the greatest number of people the world has ever known.
But that prosperity and opportunity has only been possible thanks to
the men and women of our military who have answered the call to defend
and protect our freedoms.
So
while on Veterans Day we will pause to thank our veterans and their
families, let us each and every day be mindful of their service and
sacrifice and forever grateful to live in a country so richly blessed and
courageously defended.
May God
bless our veterans, their families and the United States of
America.
Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to
Obamacare
Subsidies
On Friday, the Supreme Court
agreed to hear a case
King v. Burwell
challenging whether the
government can provide subsidies for the purchase of health care
coverage from federally run exchanges in states that chose not to establish
their own exchanges under Obamacare. The plain language of the law
makes it clear that subsidies are only to be provided for the purchase
of health coverage through exchanges setup by the states. Nevertheless,
the Obama Administration and others are asking the courts to
disregard the letter of the law and instead rule based on bureaucratic
rewrites and revisions.
Obamacare is
doing real harm to American families. Its driving up out-of-pocket
costs, narrowing access to choices, and taxing innovation. But the
larger principle under threat here is the rule of law in this country. What
good are our laws
even those we may believe are disastrous to the
American people
if their substance can be unilaterally altered based
on the whims of a White House aided by unaccountable regulators?
Rather than continue to force the American people to live under a law that
even its drafters and defenders seem incapable of implementing without
illegal carve outs and caveats, lets put in place real health care
reform that puts patients, families and doctors in charge of health
care decisions, not Washington.
Solutions for Jobs, Health Care
&amp;
American Energy
Last
Tuesday, I joined CNBC for an interview on the state of our economy
and what can be done to encourage more growth and opportunity. We talked
solutions for a balanced budget, jobs, American energy independence
and health care. I hope youll take a moment to
watch
here .
