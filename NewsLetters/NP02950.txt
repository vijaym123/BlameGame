Conaway Chronicle: New Healthcare Solutions, Chris Kyle Day,
President's Budget Proposal, Odessa Citizen of the Year

Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
New Healthcare Solutions
The Affordable Care Act is not only not affordable; it's just not working for the millions of Americans who were promised a solution to their healthcare problems. This week, the House of Representatives passed legislation to repeal Obamacare, but the bill passed doesn't stop there. It also instructs the relevant House committees to begin creating a free-market alternative to ensure that Americans will have access to affordable healthcare plans that meet each family's individual needs, instead of one-size-fits-all policies dictated by Washington bureaucrats.
The House passed similar legislation in the past, yet this is the first time with a Republican-controlled Senate. While the Democrats will have the ability to stall progress, the pressure of families losing their healthcare, rising insurance costs, and businesses firing employees to relieve the pressure from Obamacare will be squarely on their shoulders. They will have two decisions to choose from: repeal a piece of legislation that shattered Americans access to affordable, quality care or continue to ignore the heartfelt outcry of their constituents. Last November, the Democrats who chose the latter were not sent back to Congress.
Republicans will craft a plan that meets Americans needs and we will do this with their input. Americans wont have to wait for us to pass a bill to see whats in it. Once Leader McConnell brings this to the floor, it will be time for both Republicans and Democrats to act to save the American people from further self-imposed pain. I urge the Senate to take this bill up immediately.
Chris Kyle Day in Texas
Governor Abbott declared Tuesday, February 2nd, Chris Kyle Day in honor of Chris Kyle's dedication and service to our country. Born in Odessa, Kyle joined the Navy SEALS in 1999 and served four tours in Iraq, saving the lives of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of American soldiers. This week, we honored the memory of Chris Kyle, a true American hero. His commitment to our nation and the great sacrifices he made will never be forgotten.
President Obama's Budget Proposal
This week, President Obama released his proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. And like a broken record, the Presidents latest budget proposal calling for higher taxes and more spending doesnt sound any better to hard-working Americans than it did the first time around. Simply put
this budget will hurt the economy and cost American jobs.
Rural America is no exception. Under the Presidents proposed tax increases, including the elimination of stepped-up basis, the next generation of young producers would find it harder to take over the family farm or ranch. At the same time, the Presidents ill-timed proposal on crop insurance would jeopardize the ability of producers to insure their crops in a climate of collapsing crop prices, major crop losses, and falling farm income. These tired proposals for higher taxes and more spending, along with EPAs long list of choke-hold regulations, reflect the agenda of a President who is out of touch with the everyday concerns and lives of working families in rural America.
Dr. David Watts Named Odessa Citizen of the Year
Congratulations to Dr. David Watts for being named the Odessa Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year for 2014. This well-deserved recognition is a long time coming for Dr. Watts, the longest serving President of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. UTPB has experienced tremendous growth and advancement under his leadership, which will undoubtedly continue for years to come.
