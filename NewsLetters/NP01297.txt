Friend,
We just got a call from a group of donors who were moved by Ami&rsquo;s thoughts on the current state of Congress.
They want to help out and have decided to MATCH every donation up to $5,000 before our end of the month deadline on April 30 th .
Can you pitch in $5, $25 or whatever you can and have your donation doubled?
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express donate: $5
Express donate: $25
Express donate: $50
Express donate: $100
Express donate: $250
Express donate: other amount
Like Ami said, if we don&rsquo;t elect people who bring a common sense approach to Congress then we shouldn&rsquo;t expect change . But John Boehner&rsquo;s political arm, the NRCC, doesn&rsquo;t want that to happen. They have already named Ami as a top target and funded live phone calls into our district distorting Ami&rsquo;s record to ensure that culture change does not happen.
We know Ami has been working his hardest to make Washington work for the people but he can&rsquo;t do this alone.
Please pitch in $5 or more to help Ami make Congress work for the people.
Thanks again,
Team Bera
P.S. We only have 4 days to complete our match.
Please chip in whatever you can today and have your donation doubled.

My thoughts
Friend,
I&lsquo;ve been thinking this weekend about my vision for a better government-- a Congress that rises above politics to work for the people.
As we work on the issues facing our communities and think through potential solutions, we always come to the same sticking point-- the inability of people to work together.
If there&rsquo;s one thing we can agree on, it&rsquo;s that this is why elections matter.
If we don&rsquo;t elect people who bring a pragmatic approach to Congress then we&rsquo;re just doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. (I think Einstein defined that as insanity.)
I wish I could change the culture in Washington faster but I can&rsquo;t do this alone.
That&rsquo;s why your support and engagement matter.
Anyway, I wanted to share my thoughts with you and I hope you&rsquo;re having a good weekend.
Be well,
Ami
