Dear Friend,
Utah is known
for its scenic beauty and accessible wilderness areas that attract
millions of visitors to the state each year. Several agencies want to make
it easier for families to explore Utahs beautiful landscape by
offering fee free days throughout the year.
The
National Park Service
is offering free admission
to all 401 national parks, including
Utah's five national parks
on the following days:
Feb. 15-17 for Presidents Day weekend
April 19-20 for National
Park Weeks opening weekend
Aug. 25 for National Park Services
98th birthday
Sept. 27 for National Public Lands Day
Nov. 11 for Veterans Day
The Forest Service is also
offering free camping at non-reserved campsites on Presidents Day weekend,
National Get Outdoors Day- June 14, National Public Lands Day -
September 27, and Veterans Day weekend November 8-11.
If you are
looking for an activity thats outdoors and close to home, mark June 7th
on your calendar. The Division of Wildlife Services will be offering
free fishing that day, no licenses needed, across the state. All of
the other rules in the states fishing guidebook will still be in
effect. The guidebook is available at
www.wildlife.utah.gov .
This year, I hope you and your
family will explore Utahs great outdoors. I believe our state is one of
the most beautiful places in the world. As a member of the Congressional
National Parks Caucus and a sixth-generation Utahn, I am committed to
ensuring that our states natural wonders are protected for future
generations.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of
Utah families like yours. As your representative, I always appreciate
hearing from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community. Please
let me know
areas
you find especially interesting or where I can provide you with
additional information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
