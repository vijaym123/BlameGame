If you knew that electing six Democratic women could save the Senate, would you help make it happen?
Friend -- If you knew that electing six Democratic women could save the Senate, would you help make it happen?
If you answered yes, I need you to act this second.
The election is in just eight days -- this is your best chance to make an impact.
It may be our last chance as well -- either we raise enough to fight back against the flood of outside money on the other side, or we let it tip the balance against working families all over our country.
This is one of the most important moments of the entire election.
Will you pitch in to support a strong Democratic Senate? Your gift will be triple-matched until midnight.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Let me tell you something I&rsquo;ve learned:
When women participate in politics, the effects ripple out far and wide.
We could finally have a Senate that embraces compromise over obstruction.
But if you don&rsquo;t act before midnight, our chance to keep control of the Senate -- and make historic gains for women -- will begin to fade.
Pitch in to save the Senate and help Democratic women win. Remember: Your gift will be triple-matched until midnight.
Thank you,
Hillary Clinton
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
