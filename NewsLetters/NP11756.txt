Dear David,
In recent weeks, many New Mexicans have asked for
more information or expressed concerns over the situation at the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).
In that time, I have held two
telephone town halls, and have had very productive conversations with
many of you.
This Friday afternoon, I will host a
town
hall meeting in Carlsbad
to help members of the
community have their questions answered and make their voices heard.
Federal, state, and local officials have been invited to join me to help
answer questions and discuss this important issue.
I
welcome and encourage all New Mexicans to attend, especially local
residents with concerns or questions.
WIPP Town Hall Meeting with Congressman Steve
Pearce
4:00 PM, Friday, March
7
Leo Sweet

I look forward to seeing you
there.
If you cannot attend, I welcome your questions and stand
ready to help: don't hesitate to reach out to my office at
855-4-PEARCE, by
email , or by stopping by my
