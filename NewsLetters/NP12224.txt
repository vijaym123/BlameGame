Friends,
This week, the House of Representatives
will consider legislation to provide better governmental
transparency.
As such, the House Judiciary Committee is hosting a hearing this
Wednesday on Enforcing the Presidents Constitutional Duty to
Faithfully Execute the
Laws.
I will join three of my colleagues to testify before
the Committee about President Obamas frequent
oversteps .
I look forward to discussing how my resolution,
H.Res.442, Stop This Overreaching Presidency
(STOP) , will rein in the executive branch and restore our Country's
separation of powers.
After we
testify about our legislation, a panel of lawyers will discuss standing
and recent executive actions.
The hearing will being at 10:00 AM
ET.

Dillon County is Alive on
95
Dillon County has been
awarded an infrastructure grant to put towards much-needed roadway
improvements along the I-95 corridor .
I applaud this
collaboration between the U.S. Economic Development Administration and Dillon
County officials, as it will generate millions in new economic
activity, create jobs, and signal to the business community that Dillon
County is Alive on 95!
Have a good
