Broun Offers $108 Million in Targeted Spending Cuts
This week, U.S. Representative Paul Broun offered more than $108 million in targeted spending cuts to the fiscal year 2015 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill.
"In our current economic state, we must scrutinize every spending bill that comes to the House floor and look for areas to cut spending and rein in our unsustainable debt. I am pleased to have received bipartisan support for some of these amendments, and I look forward to continuing to work towards ensuring a sound financial future for our children and grandchildren."

Broun Congratulates Final Military Academy Appointments
This week, U.S. Representative Paul Broun announced that five additional young men and women from the 10th Congressional District received prestigious appointments to U.S. Service Academies. Ashlen Bible, Joshua Dugan, and Justin Westbrook received appointments to the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). Micah Johnson also received an appointment to USAFA but has decided to attend the Naval Academy Preparatory School instead. Additionally, Colin Butler received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy (USNA). These students are among the thirteen of Broun's nineteen nominees who received Military Academy appointments this year.
"One of the most gratifying parts of my job is being involved in the academy appointment process. As a Marine and Navy veteran, it is a pleasure to see such talented students answering the call to serve their country. I am very confident that these students will have successful and rewarding careers ahead and wish them all the best as they begin this journey of education and service."
