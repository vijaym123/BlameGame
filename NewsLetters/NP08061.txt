An Update on the Virginia Avenue Tunnel
On Tuesday morning, in response to my June 24 letter, I was notified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
that the review period for the CSX Virginia Avenue Tunnel project Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be extended from 30 to 60 days and that a second public community meeting will be held before the end of the review period.
Although I requested 90 days, I appreciate that the DOT has extended the review period from 30 to 60 days.
I also attended last week's public meeting and look forward to the announcement of a second public meeting.
Remarkable Progress on D.C.'s HIV/AIDS Epidemic
Last week, the District's annual report
on HIV/AIDS showed huge progress in erasing the city's HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The city, as well as D.C. residents who have been tested, deserve the credit for this remarkable progress in containing HIV/AIDS.
Our greatest progress was in getting close to no HIV drug injection transmission cases, a real encouragement I will use to keep Congress from reimposing the deadly ban on needle exchange to the D.C. appropriations bill, which I got removed when Democrats were in the House majority.

Trying to Keep Road and Transit Funds Coming
I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 4985 , the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in America's Infrastructure Act, which closes corporate tax loopholes to help increase revenue for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF).
On Tuesday, President Obama visited the Key Bridge
near Georgetown to warn that the HTF will run out by the end of August, which leaves Congress less than a month to find a solution.
If Congress does not act by the end of the month, it will force the Department of Transportation to ration reimbursements to the states, and will be directly responsible for the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs, for the slowdown of current projects, and for the cancellation of new infrastructure work nationwide.
The greatest danger would be to the economy itself.
Republicans need to face the unavoidable fact that you can't build roads and keep transit running without funds.
Keeping Sherman Circle Safe
Last week, I sent a letter
to National Park Service (NPS) Director Jonathan B. Jarvis and U.S. Park Police (USPP) Acting Chief Robert D. MacLean concerning a dangerous increase in crime in Sherman Circle and the intersection at Crittenden Street.
In my letter, I asked Jarvis and MacLean to increase policing near Sherman Circle.
SCOTUS Decision on Hobby Lobby
Last Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in the Hobby Lobby decision that some corporations can claim a religious exemption regarding covering birth control methods under the Affordable Care Act.
As a result of this decision, many women and families will be unable to prevent unintended pregnancies, particularly the most vulnerable - girls and young women who are not prepared to be parents.
In my release on the subject
I emphasized the limits of the decision and called on the administration to take action that I believe may still make possible "no co-pay" availability of all forms of contraception.
Still, we need women to know that even under Hobby Lobby, most forms of contraception will continue to be covered by the Affordable Care Act's no co-pay provision for birth control.
Returning to Mississippi for the 50th Anniversary of Freedom Summer
This summer marks the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Summer of 1964, when thousands of mostly white students and civil rights workers traveled to Mississippi to help register African Americans to vote, and three student activists, James Chaney of Mississippi and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner of New York, were killed.
I was in Mississippi the summer of 1963 as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to prepare for Freedom Summer and was one of the authors of the brief for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party organized during Freedom Summer to challenge the segregated Mississippi delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention.
Last month, I returned to Jackson, Mississippi where I moderated a plenary panel
of members of Congress at the Freedom Summer 50th Anniversary Commemoration at Tougaloo College.
Tougaloo College was a safe haven for many activists and a gathering place for the civil rights movement.
50th Anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
On July 2, the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, I wrote an op-ed piece
for the Huffington Post that highlighted my own experiences with the movement, and how ironically years later, I was appointed by President Carter to chair the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) established by the Act I had been in the streets trying to get.
I discussed1964 as the year that initiated a fertile period of law-making for racial change. Please take a moment to read the op-ed piece by clicking here .
A Fourth of July Celebration
On Friday, I marched
in the 48th Annual Palisades Fourth of July Parade, organized by the Palisades Citizens Association, with the Girl Scouts of Greater Washington, D.C.
The Palisades Parade is great fun because it is a true hometown parade.
I hope you and your family and friends had a wonderful and safe Fourth of July weekend!
