SMALL BUSINESSES
Rep. Heck sat down with women entrepreneurs from Washington's 10th
District to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with
sustaining a small business.
Dear Neighbor,
Winter is over, and in Washington D.C I am springing into action on a
number of issues that affect you and your family. In the South Puget
Sound, I continue to visit and listen to residents, small businesses
and local officials on how we can work together to make the 10th
Congressional District a better place to live.
CREATING A FASTER COMMUTE.
Our region is fortunate to have the economic development that comes
with the growth of Joint Base Lewis-McChord. At the same time, the
resulting traffic can be frustrating. We need to update our
infrastructure to keep pace with the changes.
I plan to introduce the COMMUTE Act to help relieve some of the traffic
congestion around large military installations like JBLM. This
legislation will speed up the funding process so we can make the
necessary changes to better meet our transportation needs. It also
includes options for mass transit funding. I'm seeking a Republican
cosponsor to join me so we can get this important bill passed as soon
as possible.

OPENING PRAYER DELIVERED BY OLYMPIA PASTOR.
Members of Congress can invite people of all backgrounds to deliver the
daily opening prayer in the U.S. House. John Rosenberg, lead pastor at
the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd in Olympia, opened the U.S.
House with a prayer on Tuesday, March 25.
Pastor Rosenberg is both my friend and my pastor, and I invited him to
deliver the prayer before he retires in June. No taxpayer dollars were
expended for Pastor Rosenberg's travel. I always appreciate visitors
from the 10th Congressional District joining me in Washington, and
Pastor Rosenberg shared encouraging words for members of all faiths and
backgrounds.
As always, please let me know your thoughts on any issues you think is
important that Congress consider during this legislative session. Your
participation helps shape the decisions I make and keeps the democratic
process strong.
Sincerely,
Denny Heck, Member of Congress
