&ldquo;In a breathtaking display of honesty, House Speaker John Boehner tweeted out the Republican Party&rsquo;s five-point jobs plan Tuesday morning&mdash;and it was entirely empty.&rdquo;

Dear Friend, Speaker Boehner and the Republicans seem to be a little light on ideas.
Maybe we can help them out. Help us fill in the blanks -- tell us how you think Congress should focus on job creation.
To the Republican base, calling for impeachment or another government shutdown is a nuanced policy discussion.
Democrats have an actual plan to help the middle class. It involves raising the minimum wage, making it easier for families to pay for college, and guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. It also involves protecting Social Security, Medicare, and the programs upon which millions of Americans rely. Tell us your ideas, and let&rsquo;s show Speaker Boehner what a real jobs plan looks like.
Thank you.
