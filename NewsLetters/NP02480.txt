MILLER STATEMENT REGARDING PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHUS ADDRESS TO CONGRESS
Washington, D.C. - Congressman Jeff Miller (R-FL-01) issued the following statement today:
The United States and Israel have enjoyed a deep-seated alliance and friendship since the founding of the modern state of Israel.
Our citizens share the common values of personal freedom and individual rights, as well as a desire for a peaceful existence.
Israel provides a beacon of hope in a corner of the world marred by darkness, evil, and death.
It is critical that we provide the support needed to help protect the sovereignty of Israel and the right of its people to defend themselves from terrorism and the threat of a nuclear Iran.
We must continue to nurture and reinforce this strong alliance, not just for our own strategic benefit or for the stability brought to an unstable region, but also to show that the world is a brighter place under the light of the freedom provided by our two nations.
I appreciated hearing Prime Minister Netanyahus perspective today.
Mr. Prime Minister, I continue to stand with Israel, and the people of the United States continue to support the Israeli people.
