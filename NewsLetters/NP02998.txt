The 6th District
Fox Guarding the Henhouse at the
VA
Dear Friends:
This past week the Director of the Denver VA,
Lynette Roff, suddenly announced her retirement. It came days after I
demanded an investigation into the Denver VA for hiding a secret
waiting list with hundreds of veterans on it at its sleep lab. Executives
at the VA were artificially manipulating the appointment wait times for
veterans in order to get cash bonuses. They were cooking the books to
line their own pockets.
Thanks to a whistleblower and the good work of
9News , the secret waiting list at the Denver VA was uncovered,
but I fear it could only be the tip of the iceberg.
After
veterans deaths were tied to secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA, a
nationwide audit was conducted to determine if fraudulent scheduling
practices were occurring elsewhere. The Denver VA did not uncover the secret
sleep lab waiting list during that
audit.
Furthermore, when accusations were
brought to the Denver VAs attention about the secret waiting list they
denied it existed, and told the media that they had conducted their own
internal investigation confirming the list did not exist. The VA
official who conducted that internal investigation
Ralph Gigliotti -- had
himself been admonished in July 2014 for inappropriate actions related
to patient scheduling.
It sometimes feels like the fox is guarding the henhouse at
the VA.
I had
high hopes when VA Secretary Shinseki resigned, believing it was an
opportunity to clean house, and build a culture of accountability at an
agency dedicated to serving those who served
us.
Unfortunately, my hopes have
dimmed.
The
current VA Secretary, Bob McDonald, has not gotten the VAs house in order.
Last year, I helped pass the
Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act of 2014 , which in part gave the VA Secretary
greater authority to fire senior managers. Secretary McDonald has not
exercised that authority. He has not led. He has not cleaned up the VA.
And I am greatly disappointed at the missed
opportunity.
I am glad that Director
Roff has left her position. I hope other VA leaders who are incapable
of leading find their way to the exit as
well.
For that is the only way we can fix
the VAs mistakes of the past
with new leadership moving
forward.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

Director of VA
Medical Center announces retirement effective March 1
By Lance
Hernandez
TheDenverChannel.com
Published
February 3, 2015
DENVER - The head of the Veterans Affairs - Eastern Colorado Health
Care System is leaving her job effective March
1.
Lynette Roff, who has held the position
for 10 years, says she has elected to retire after almost 42 years of
government service.
Colorado Republican
Congressman Mike
Coffman
questions whether her "retirement" was
voluntary.
"I doubt that it was," he told 7NEWS. "I
think the timing is a little interesting."
Roff has been under fire because of complaints
about the quality of patient care.
The latest allegations involve a secret waiting list for
veterans to get appointments.
Last month, Coffman wrote a letter to the Deputy Inspector
General requesting an immediate investigation.
He said the VA
issued a statement January 28 claiming that when they were informed of
the allegations at the Denver VAMC, an immediate internal investigation
was conducted of all clinical areas and it revealed no "secret wait
lists."
Coffman says
some hospital employees would get bonuses if they demonstrated they
were bumping down patient wait times.
"Well, what they did was manipulated those wait times
and had two sets of books," Coffman said. "One set was the real one
where veterans were being excluded from care... in order to make the
numbers look better."
Coffman says Roff was either negligent in not knowing what was
happening, or was complicit in the manipulation and sharing in the
bonuses.
There was no mention of
the allegations in Roff's retirement
announcement.
The statement noted that Roff
successfully opened six new community clinics across Eastern Colorado and
expanded and strengthened collaboration with Department of Defense medical
activities.
Denver
VA hospital director doing the right thing by
leaving
By: Denver Post
Editorial Board
DenverPost.com
Published February 5, 2015
The VA is
maintaining that the announced retirement of the director of the Veterans
Affairs hospital in Denver
had nothing to do with
reports by 9News
that her office had kept a secret list of veterans
awaiting appointments in a sleep clinic in
2012.
And no doubt Lynette Roff's retirement
also had nothing to do with the fact that
Rep. Mike
Coffman , R-Aurora, and Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, have called for an
investigation by the VA's Office of Inspector
General.
And, naturally, Roff's retirement
couldn't have had anything to do with the increasing scrutiny of her
domain, either, as evidenced by
a Denver Post story just one day ago revealing unusual wait
times at the hospital and its satellite clinics . It said
patients "wait longer for medical appointments than those at more than
90 percent of regional centers nationwide."
But whether Roff is retiring in the natural
course of events or under pressure, we agree with Coffman, who said, "She
did the right thing by leaving."
