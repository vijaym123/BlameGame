Friends,
As you know, we currently have a crisis along our
southern border.
While the White House continues to claim that
border security is at its strongest in history, tens of thousands of
unaccompanied minors have illegally made their way into the United
States this year.
The administrations slow reaction to this
problem and failure of leadership has led to this humanitarian crisis. To
add insult to injury, as tens of thousands of minors stream across
the border, the President refuses to properly acknowledge the issue or
even visit the border despite the his most recent trip to
Texas.
The administrations policies
have directly resulted in the belief by these immigrants that once they
reach U.S. soil, they will be able to stay here indefinitely. This has
only encouraged other families in Central America to put their
children at risk to make the dangerous journey.
My heart breaks for
these children who are forced to trek hundreds of miles while being
subjected to unimaginable hardships and abuse.
It is
imperative that we reunite them with their families in their home countries
to ensure their safety and discourage other unaccompanied minors from
enduring this dangerous journey. Im proud to cosponsor
The Expedited Family Reunification Act of 2014
(H.R.
5053) a bill that will update our current immigration policy and allow
us to quickly return these children home to their families, sending a
clear signal that
those who arrive here illegally will not be
allowed to stay.
While
President Obama has presented Congress with a request for emergency
funding to solve this crisis,
the request does not take concrete
steps to secure our border, remove the unaccompanied minors, or deter
future immigrants from attempting to come to the United States
illegally.
Out of the total request of nearly $4 billion, the
Department of Homeland Security receives a total of $1.5 billion, of which
only $432 million is for actual border security by U.S. Customs and
Border Patrol.
Of the overall request, merely 11% is actually
used to secure the border.
Even more outrageous, the request
calls for more money for wildfire suppression, at $615 million, than for
border security. This is completely
unacceptable.
The fact is, our border is not secure.
As a Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I know the
importance of securing our border
first
and upholding the
current rule of law. This is not just an immigration issue - it is a
national security issue. We must be able to make intelligent decisions
about who and what crosses our borders. If thousands of unaccompanied
minors are able to make the journey across our border, then our
government has shown it is unable to stop terrorists, human traffickers, drug
cartels and others that wish to harm the United
States.
We must secure the border, enforce our laws, and
ensure that these individuals are dealt with in a humane manner that
is consistent with the American ideals of compassion and family
unity.
As Congress debates a long-term solution to end this crisis,
I will continue to focus on securing our borders
first.
Until
next week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)
