February 12, 2014
Dear Friend,
As the second session of the 113thCongress begins, I wanted to take a
moment to update you on some of what I've been working on in Washington
and LA.
As you may have heard, on Thursday, January 30, I announced
that I would not seek reelection this November.
It has been my great
pleasure to represent the 33rdDistrict of California, and you can count
on me to use my remaining months in Congress to continue to fight for
the issues important to you.
Earthquakes and Fracking
I recently requested
a joint hearing to
investigate possible seismic activity induced by hydraulic fracturing
activities. In October, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Oklahoma
Geological Survey warned that the injection of wastewater generated
from oil and gas activities, such as fracking, may be a potential
contributing factor to the over-tenfold increase in earthquake
frequency in Oklahoma since 2009. It's critical that Congress
investigate this matter.
The Affordable Care Act and You
To date, over six million people have gained access to health insurance
through Medicaid or private health insurance plans through the
Affordable Care Act. One constituent from Redondo Beach shared that
"we're going from $870 for 3 people (1 adult, two kids) to $300 for 4
people. This is the best thing to happen to our family in years."
Have you been affected by the Affordable Care Act? Please tell me your
story about the ACA by clicking here.
The Future of the LA Times
In late 2013 the Tribune Company, which owns the LA Times, announced it
may spin off its newspaper unit. The LA Times is the largest
metropolitan newspaper in the country and the primary source of news
for millions of people in Southern California. I've raised concerns
that provisions of the spin-off, such as the requirement that the
newspaper unit take on additional debt, could endanger its long term
viability. I've asked the Tribune Company for further information about
the potential spin-off and am doing all I can to protect this vital
source of news. You can read my letter here
.
The Dangerous Anti-Environmental Agenda of the House of Representatives
Last Congress was the most anti-environment Congress on record.
Unfortunately, during the first session of the current 113th Congress,
the House has continued down its anti-environment path.
In December, I
released a report
showing that the
Republican-led House voted for the anti-environment position 109 times
in 2013, including 51 votes to benefit the oil and gas industry at the
expense of the environment.
Investigating Pollution at Santa Monica Airport
A recent study released by scientists at UCLA and the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) suggested that ultrafine particle levels-which
can cause a range of health impacts-were between four and thirty-seven
times higher in the area downwind of Santa Monica Airport in a
neighboring area.
I've called for
the South Coast Air Quality Management District to
immediately assess these reports and use its authority to issue
actionable recommendations to address potential problems.
It has been a great honor for me to serve in Congress for nearly 40
years.
I want to thank you for following my work and keeping me
informed of the issues that matter to you.

statement about my retirement on my website
, and a report about my work during my tenure in Congress here

Sincerely,
Henry A. Waxman
