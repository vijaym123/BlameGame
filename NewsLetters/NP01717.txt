Balancing
the Budget for a Stronger America
Dear Friend,
Last week,
the
House passed its annual budget proposal
for the upcoming fiscal year. A budget is a
vision that demonstrates our priorities for
the nation and illustrates what choices
need to be made to responsibly allocate our
limited resources to fulfill those
priorities. A careful examination of our
budget makes clear that our top priority is
restoring American prosperity for this
generation and future generations.
Conversely, the budgetary policy under
President Obama has not had the best
interest of our children and grandchildren
in mind. These policies have put us on a
path to a bankrupt federal government with
trillions in new debt, an anemic economic
recovery, and a federal budget that
continues to run large annual deficits
without balancing or attempting to pay off
our debt. We have a projected $100 trillion
in unfunded liabilities because many of our
most important programs are on an
unsustainable course. For example, Medicare
and Social Security are expected to become
insolvent
in less than twenty years,
which would
be devastating for future retirees.
Our budget recognizes the urgent need to
act to remedy these issues so the United
States does not become the next Greece or
Spain. We reject the premise of leaving
future generations to suffer with a fiscal
crisis. Instead, we reverse these harmful
policies and offer fiscally responsible,
pro-growth solutions to put the nation on a
sustainable fiscal course.
Our plan balances the budget in less
than 10 years without raising taxes and
cuts $5.5 trillion in spending, placing our
nation on a path to pay off the debt by
growing the economy and making government
more efficient, effective, and accountable.
It repeals the Presidents healthcare
law and strengthens vital programs like
Medicare and Social Security to ensure a
secure retirement for seniors and future
recipients. Our budget plan provides for a
strong national defense through robust
funding for troop training, equipment, and
compensation. Rejecting the idea that
Washington knows best, this House budget
gives power back to the states and cuts
waste, eliminates redundancies, and ends
the practice of Washington picking winners
and losers in our economy.
The Senate also passed its budget last
week, and now the House and Senate will
work together to reach a consensus plan in
April. These budget resolutions are not
signed by the President; they instead
establish the framework for Congress to
consider spending and revenue bills. In
May, the House will begin considering 12
annual appropriation bills for the next
fiscal year based on the amount of
discretionary spending we have allocated in
our budget resolution. As we send fiscally
responsible spending measures to the
President, I hope he will join us in the
effort to get our fiscal house in order so
that we can grow our economy and build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
