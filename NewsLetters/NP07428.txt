The
Scalise Capitol Report

Veterans deserve great career
opportunities
For
all the sacrifices made by our troops, we must do everything we can
to ensure that they have great career opportunities when they return to
civilian life. That's why I hosted a Veterans and Military Service
Members Job Fair at Salmen High School in Slidell this weekend. More
than 160 service members attended and more than 40 businesses had
representatives on hand to accept resumes and interview applicants. It was
great to see our local community and business leaders come together at
this event to help our military heroes get good jobs here at home.
Thank you to all who participated in another successful job fair. A couple
of pictures can be found below and you can

My interview on Fox News
Sunday
On Sunday, I sat down with
Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday for my first national TV appearance
since being elected House Majority Whip. We discussed action the
House is taking to solve the border crisis head on, the Presidents
continued executive overreach, and my plans to unify House Republicans
around conservative solutions to our nations problems. I even threw
Chris off when I threw in Geaux Tigers!

Highlight quotes
below:
On the border
crisis:
"The president has been AWOL on this from the very
beginning....This all has to start with securing the border, not
writing the president a blank check to keep doing what hes doing thats
not working, but actually solve the
problem."
On uniting House
Republicans:
"What we need to do is focus on those
things that unite us, not only as Republicans but as
Americans....Thats what Im going to bring to the leadership table -- a way to move
conservative values forward in a way that unites us and solves the
problems facing hardworking
taxpayers."
On Executive
overreach:
"This might be the first White House in
history thats trying to start the narrative of impeaching their own
president. Ultimately, what we want to do is see the president follow
the laws. But the president took an oath to faithfully execute the laws
of this land, and hes
not."
On advocating for an alternative to
Obamacare:
"Lets lower costs for health care.
Lets put patients back in charge of their health-care decisions. So I
absolutely want to see that get done ."
On the
LSU Tigers:
"Geaux
Tigers!"
Confronting
Washington's
out-of-control regulations
Washingtons out-of-control federal regulations not only
strangle small businesses, but they are also responsible for increasing the
costs of all the things we purchase, including food, gas and of
course health care. Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia and I have teamed
up with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who introduced similar
legislation in the Senate, by introducing the National Regulatory Budget Act
of 2014. This much-needed legislation makes unelected, unaccountable
bureaucrats in Washington think twice before proposing job-killing rules
and regulations by increasing transparency and accountability. If our
economy is ever to recover from six years of the presidents failed
economic policies, we must rein in the out-of-control costs of this
Administrations radical regulations.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress.
