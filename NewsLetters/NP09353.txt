Dear
Friends,
This Memorial Day, we offer our
deepest gratitude to those who have selflessly dedicated their lives
protecting our freedom. But I have become increasingly disturbed at the
unfolding scandal surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs and
the care their hospitals are required by law to provide to our nations
veterans. Its possible that as many as 40 veterans have died while
waiting
months
for the care they needed and
deserved.
That the brave men and
women who have served our country may have died because someone was
safeguarding their Christmas bonus and angling for a promotion is
outrageous and criminal.
But we need action now for our veterans on the waiting list.
Thats why I want to hear from all of our veterans living in the 14th
District.
Please watch my video below for more
information.

This week, I supported passage of
H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act of 2014 , which authorizes the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs to quickly remove senior executives if poor
performance warrants it. The bill passed the House with a vote of
390-33.
Previously, I cosponsored
H.R. 241, the Veterans Timely Access to Health Care
Act , to ensure veterans can get access to care within 30 days of
original contact with the VA, as well as
H.R. 2189
which
would establish a task force to examine the backlog of disability
claims at the VA.
I
look forward to presenting a flag to the wife of Lt. Col. William
Robert Holstine, who passed away this year, at Kane Countys Memorial Day
Ceremony on Monday. I will also be participating in the Wauconda
Memorial Day Parade, and I hope to see you
there.
Introducing Legislation to Stop
Human Trafficking
Along with voting for passage of a series of bills aimed at combating
the scourge of human trafficking, this week, I was pleased to introduce
a bill (H.R. 4703) targeting government-sanctioned prostitution as a
major factor contributing to the prevalence of sex slavery. A national
government that tolerates prostitution tolerates sex slaverythey go
hand in hand, and we must hold them accountable for paying lip service
to combating trafficking but winking at one of its root
causes.

well-documented connection between prostitution and sex
trafficking.
Funding our Troops, Ensuring
Waterway Reform
This
week, the House was busy passing several bipartisan pieces of
legislation, including:
H.R. 3080, the Water Resources
Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of
2014 .
In Illinois, wateways like the
Mississippi and ports like the Port of Chicago support more than 48,000 jobs
and directly contribute $6.4 billion to our state's economy. The bill,
now passed through the House and Senate, strengthens water
transportation infrastructure, streamlines the project delivery and authorization
process, improves water infrastructure safety, and promotes fiscal
responsibility by deauthorizing $18 billion worth of old and inactive
projects. WRRDA contains no earmarks and makes major reforms to
increase transparency and accountability.
H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act . H.R. 3361 ends the bulk collection of
Americans records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the FISA pen
register, trap and trace statute and the National Security Letter
statute. It creates a new, narrowly-tailored authority for the collection of
call records and imposes new limitations and safeguards to protect
civil liberties, while preserving national security
capabilities.
H.R. 4435, the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015 . H.R. 4435 authorizes and prioritizes funding for the
Department of Defense (DoD) and other select national security programs
within the Department of Energy for FY 2015. The bill authorizes
a $521.3 billion topline for base national defense programs, which
includes $7.9 billion in mandatory defense spending and $513.4 billion
in discretionary spending. Additionally, the bill authorizes $79.4
billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). H.R. 4435 is
consistent with the House budget, H.Con.Res. 96, which passed on April 10,
2014, and reflects the $22 billion in partial sequester relief
that was enacted in the Ryan-Murray bipartisan budget
agreement.
The House passed
five bills
to address the issue of anti-trafficking :
H.R. 3530, the
Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act .
H.R. 3610, the
Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act .
H.R. 4225, the
Stop Advertising Victims of
Exploitation (SAVE) Act of 2014 .
H.R. 4058, the
Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving
Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act .
H.R. 4573, the
International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand
for Child Sex Trafficking.
