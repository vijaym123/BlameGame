Friend -- I wish I had better news for you, but I don&rsquo;t.
The
New York Times
just warned of a &ldquo;a late flurry of attacks by Republican super PACs&rdquo; -- &ldquo;$6.5 million worth of advertising in six states in the closing days of the election campaign.&rdquo;
We&rsquo;re falling behind in spending and I don&rsquo;t know what else to say. As the DSCC&rsquo;s Field Director, I know --
KNOW
-- that we can win the Senate if we spend every waking hour mobilizing voters.
But I&rsquo;m going to be blunt: money is short -- we don&rsquo;t have enough to fund Get Out The Vote operations in every state.
Our leadership team is facing a tough decision today:
Which battlegrounds should we fund, and which must we cut loose?
I&rsquo;m personally asking for your urgent help: If you pitch in, your gift will be immediately triple-matched and rushed to battlegrounds.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;ve built up a voter mobilization program that&rsquo;s absolutely UNPRECEDENTED for a midterm election. We have thousands of staff and volunteers on the ground who have brought us SO close to clinching Senate victory.
That&rsquo;s why the thought of pulling out of must-win battlegrounds makes me sick to my stomach.
I&rsquo;ll just be honest: If we can&rsquo;t fund GOTV operations in the final 13 days in deadlocked battlegrounds, it&rsquo;ll cost us the Senate. We&rsquo;ll be filled with utter desperation and regret on election night. Don&rsquo;t let that happen.
Thanks for doing your part.
Let&rsquo;s win this thing.
Paul
