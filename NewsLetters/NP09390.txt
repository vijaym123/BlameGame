Dear David,
On this Memorial
Day, we honor the unforgettable sacrifices made by our men and women in
uniform. Now more than ever, we need to come to together as a nation to
honor those who have paid the ultimate price for liberty. We owe an
inexpressible debt of gratitutde to all who have served in
the armed forces.
As we spend time today with family and
friends, I encourage everyone to take a moment to remember what our
Founding Fathers envisioned, as they created this great nation. This passion
for freedom remains strong in the hearts of the families of the men
and women who have paid the price for that freedom. We also honor those
families who share in the sacrifice, so that we may continue to live
free.
I will spend Memorial Day in New Mexico, to attend a
number of ceremonies and events in Las Cruces and Truth or
Consequences.
Have
you heard "Congressional Review" this week?
Every weekend, I'm
on the radio across New Mexico discussing important legislation, events
in New Mexico, and my work in Congress.
Be sure to tune
in!
If you haven't heard the show, call your local radio station to ask
when Congressional Review is on the air in your
hometown! ?xml:namespace prefix = o

Remember, I always look forward to hearing your
thoughts on how to help job growth, veterans, and other issues
important to New Mexicans.
If you have any ideas, suggestions, or
concerns, you can contact my office through
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
email ,
my website
or by calling 855-4-PEARCE.
God bless you, and God bless
America.
Until next
week,
STEVE
