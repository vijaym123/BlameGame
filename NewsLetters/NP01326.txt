Looking Ahead
on Anniversary of Oil Spill
Exactly five
years ago, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11
Americans and set in motion the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history.
For 87 days, more than three million barrels of crude oil flowed
into the Gulf of Mexico and toward the shores of five
states.
For coastal communities in Mississippi and elsewhere, the spill
was a devastating setback, arriving less than five years after
Hurricane Katrina.
Once again, major disruptions to key tourism and
seafood industries put people out of work and local economies on
hold.
A temporary moratorium from the President on offshore drilling in
the Gulf further compounded these economic repercussions.
Meanwhile, marine ecosystems endured unprecedented circumstances, and
countless families saw their way of life completely
uprooted.
Like the response to Katrina, Americans were quick to offer assistance
in the aftermath of the spill.
Thousands of volunteers and
cleanup crews selflessly devoted time and energy to
help.
Others worked to raise awareness about the need for reforms to prevent
a disaster of this magnitude from happening again.
We continue
to be grateful for their outpouring of
support.
A full recovery will be difficult
taking years, if not decades
but local leaders and residents are determined to succeed.
Dozens
of restoration projects have long been underway, rebuilding critical
habitats like oyster reefs and wetlands as well as infrastructure and
recreational attractions.
By targeting both environmental and
economic needs, these projects are poised not only to bring back what
was lost but also make the Gulf Coast even better than
before.
This mission, however, is far from finished.
Years of
litigation with BP over civil penalties have yet to be resolved.
Under
the Clean Water Act, the parties responsible for the disaster are
subject to pollution fines of up to $4,300 per barrel spilled.
If
the courts decide to assess the maximum penalty, the company could face
$13.7 billion in charges.
Those of us representing Gulf
Coast states in Congress recognized the importance of making sure
these fines are used where they are needed most.
The 2012 passage of
the RESTORE Act sent a powerful message to Gulf Coast communities
that they will have a voice in the recovery process.
Under the
bipartisan legislation, 80 percent of the civil penalties will go to
affected states, giving local leaders the flexibility and authority to put
their most critical priorities first.
Without RESTORE, none of
these penalties would have been used to alleviate the harm from
Deepwater Horizon, going instead solely to the federal Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund to be used for future spills.
Like many
Americans, I am hopeful that the courts will deliver a ruling soon, giving
states more certainty regarding the resources available for their
projects.
Since RESTORE became law, states and federal agencies have
joined forces on the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council to put
together a comprehensive plan that equitably addresses the entire
regions environmental and economic needs.
Last year, the U.S. Treasury
moved forward with necessary rules outlining the process for states
and municipalities to apply for grants supported by RESTORE
funds.
The missing piece is the sum to be paid by BP.
We do
not know the long-term effects of what happened on April 20, 2010, and
it may be some time before we fully understand all that was lost.
But we do know that the Gulf Coast is slowly but steadily regaining
ground.
In Mississippi, for example, the seafood industry has
seen a rise in economic growth and jobs in recent years.
As for
energy exploration, analysts expect deepwater oil production in the Gulf
to grow rapidly, possibly reaching a peak next
year.
For tens of millions of Americans, the Gulf Coast more than just a
place to live, work, and visit.
The Gulf of Mexico and its
approximately 1,600 miles of shoreline are a true U.S. treasure where
productive fisheries, recreational sports, bountiful energy resources, and
diverse species coexist.
Taken together, these assets generate an
economic output greater than that of most
nations.
America thrives when our Gulf Coast thrives.
We have an
opportunity to make things right, and we should seize it.
Five years
has not diminished our willpower or resolve to see that the Coast is
made whole again.
