News from Representative Lou Barletta
Protecting Our Nation's Volunteer Firefighters
Monday, March 17, 2014
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed my
legislation to protect volunteer firefighters and emergency responders
from the unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also
known as Obamacare.
H.R. 3979, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency
Responders Act, ensures that emergency services volunteers are not
counted as full-time employees under the Employer Mandate of the ACA,
thereby shielding fire departments from crippling new health care
costs, which would cause many to close their doors.
The bill passed
the House by a vote of 410-to-0.
There is companion legislation, S.
1798, pending in the Senate.
This is a tremendous victory for anyone who lives and works in an area
that depends on volunteer firefighters for their safety - which means
the huge majority of Americans.
Firehouses and municipalities across
the country need assurance that they wouldn't have to pay costly fines
or shut their doors. This bill provides them with that certainty.
Following months of pressure from myself, other members of Congress,
and firefighters, the IRS indicated that it will not count hours of
volunteer firefighters and emergency responders when determining an
employer's full-time employees in compliance with the ACA.
However, I
continued to pursue passage of H.R. 3979 as insurance against future
changes from the IRS.
Public safety is too important to leave in the hands of a federal
agency that could change its policy on a whim, and that's why we are
making this the law.
Volunteer firefighters are just that -
volunteers, and should not be subjected to the Employer Mandate.
It's
just common sense.
I hope my colleagues in the Senate quickly pass
this bill so it becomes law in the near future.
H.R. 3979 has been supported by organizations such as the National
Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs,
Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National Association of
Counties, the National Association of Towns and Townships, the National
Association of EMTs, and the National Association of State EMS
Officials.
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives also unanimously
endorsed the proposal.

Last

the
