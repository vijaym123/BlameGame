Congressman Lamborn Supports the Regulatory Accountability Act of
2015
1/13/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted
in favor of H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015. This
bill includes strong language designed to prevent excessive federal
regulation from harming our economy.
Background information from the House Judiciary
Committee
Requires
advance notice of proposed major rulemakings to increase public
participation and input before costly agency positions are proposed and
entrenched.
Requires agencies to use the best
reasonably obtainable science and choose the lowest cost rulemaking
alternative that meets statutory objectives.
Permits costlier rules when there are needs to protect public health,
safety, or welfare, but requires the benefits of those rules to justify
their additional costs.
Provides
on-the-record but streamlined administrative hearings in the highest-impact
rulemakingsthose that impose $1 billion or more in annual costsso
interested parties can subject critical evidence to
cross-examination.
"The
American people are facing a yearly regulatory burden of $15,000 per
household. It is time to rein in excessive regulation. We cannot continue
to allow regulations to be imposed on the American people without
conducting a thorough analysis of their costs and impacts to the job
creators and taxpayers. The strong reforms in H.R. 185 have been supported
by bipartisan majorities in the last two Congresses, but have been
halted in the Senate. I look forward to the new Republican Senate majority
considering this legislation and partnering with us to lessen the
impact of excessive regulation on the American
people."
