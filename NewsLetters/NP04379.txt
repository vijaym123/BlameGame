Immigration: The President Cannot Do What He Just
Did
Last night, President Obama announced one of the
biggest executive power grabs in American history. He declared
unilaterally that millions of unlawful immigrants can stay in the U.S. without
facing the consequences of violating U.S. immigration
laws.
It is true that the Congress has not agreed on how to legislate reform
of the immigration system.
But that does not mean, on a whim,
the President can ignore the Constitution and alter existing U.S. law
before Congress passes new statutes.
Thats not the way it
works, and the President knows it.
In fact, the President has made
many, many statements over the last few years about his inability to
unilaterally change or ignore immigration law. By Speaker Boehners
count, he admitted 22 times that he could not do what he just
did.
Read the Speakers entire list
here .
President Obama and I agree: the immigration system is broken,
badly broken.
But we cannot begin to fix its many flaws if we do
not first secure the border.
In a time of new terrorist threats
and the spread of deadly diseases, this is a national security
imperative!
Speaker Boehner was right when he wrote: President
Obama should listen to President Obama, drop his plan to expand the
authority of the executive branch into murky, uncharted territory, and
work with Congress rather than insisting on his stubborn, my way or the
highway approach.
Keystone Pipeline: Down But Not
Out
Just a few days after passing the House by a
strong bipartisan vote, the Senate narrowly failed to advance the
job-creating Keystone XL Pipeline.
However, Senator Mitch McConnell,
the incoming majority leader, has pledged to bring the bill back to
the Senate floor in early 2015 when chances of final passage are
improved.
The Administration has been "studying" the project for
six years. The pipeline would move oil from Canada into the United
States and eventually to the Texas Gulf Coast. It would create jobs and
lessen Americas dependence on Middle East oil. A government
environmental impact statement also predicts that a pipeline would result in
less damage to the climate than moving the same oil by
rail.
Condemning Irans Human Rights Record
With
my support, this week the House condemned the inhumane actions of the
Iranian government -- including its violence against women and
religious minorities.
Read more about House Resolution 754
here .
Among its important provisions, the
resolution calls on Iran to comply with its international and domestic
obligations on human rights and civil
liberties.
Irans compliance with other important obligations is the subject
of negotiations in Vienna right now.
The deadline for a pivotal
accord regarding Irans nuclear program is early next week. Any
agreement must include a rigorous, immediate and objective inspections
regime, one designed to halt Iranian nuclear capabilities both now and in
the future.
Five issues to watch in these key
negotiations can be found

NSA
Reform That Only ISIS Could Love
Former CIA
Director Michael Hayden and former U.S. Attorney-General Michael Mukasey
wrote an on-target op ed piece in the
Wall Street
Journal
on Tuesday on Congressional efforts to change the
way the our intelligence community collects information with which to
better protect Americans and our national security.

Salute -
the long and distinguished service of Sussex Countys State
Senator Bob Littell
who was laid to rest this
week.
A former Marine, I had the pleasure of working with him as
chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
When he
retired from the Senate in 2008, Bob had contributed 40 years of his life
to improving the lives of New Jersey residents, supporting businesses
large and small and protecting our
communities.
Salute
to the Morris County Sheriffs Office which celebrates
its 275 th
Anniversary this weekend.
Thank for you
for keeping our communities safe.
