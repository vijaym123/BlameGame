Dear
Friends,
Welcome to the
latest edition of my e-newsletter .
Idaho State Work Period
Improving Our Approach to Wildfire Suppression, New Pilot
Program Featuring Pulse Crops Grown in Idaho, Gun Safety and
More.
March again brought the opportunity to travel
Idaho.
I was able to meet with many Idahoans throughout the
Treasure Valley, north Idaho and eastern Idaho.
Thank you for
joining me for numerous conversations on finding common sense solutions to
the many critical issues facing our nation today.
A few
highlights from the month below.
I discussed a new provision, in
which I helped secure, contained in the recently passed Farm Bill that
creates a new five-year pilot program for the promotion and further
study of healthy pulse crops, with students in Lewiston. I enjoyed my
visit so much at Jenifer Junior High that we took a class picture
outside the school. Go Burros!
A wide-ranging
discussion was enjoyed with the Nez Perce County Commissioners at their
offices in Lewiston.
It is always great to meet with
members of the Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC) in Lewiston.
The
proven success of a collaborative decision-making model, one that does
not require a sacrifice of principles, but a commitment to
problem-solving and a willingness to understand each others objectivesshould
not be overlooked.
The CBC working groups success in the region
is a perfect illustration of the consensus-based solutions that can be
achieved through collaboration.
Council
members from the Nez Perce Tribe presented me with this years new
official tribal blanket design during a stop in Lapwaiit was quite an
honor to receive the gift.
It was
good to join with Project ChildSafe and the National Shooting Sports
Foundation to tell Idahoans about how they can obtain free gun locks
and other safety information. Joined by my partners in the Idaho
Delegation, I met at Sportsman's Warehouse in Meridian for a skilled
demonstration by Treasure Valley law enforcement on the use of gun
locks.
As we approach yet another fire
season, I joined with U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Sally
Jewell, Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, the entire Idaho
Delegation, Idaho Governor Butch Otter and federal fire officials for a
briefing on the projected 2014 fire season and a productive discussion on
the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2013 at the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise.
The legislation, led by Oregon
Senator Ron Wyden and I, puts Idaho and the entire Western United
States on improved footing to enhance the health of our federal lands,
decrease the threat of catastrophic fires and ensure that firefighters
have the resources needed to protect our communities.
It was a privilege to meet with 9-year old Carson Magee from
Coeur dAlene to thank him for his continued advocacy for important
Type 1 diabetes research.
I joined fellow
Senator Jim Risch in welcoming Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Senator John Barrasso
(R-Wyoming), also on the committee, to the Idaho National Laboratory
in Idaho Falls.
Broken
Promises: Obamacares 4-Year Anniversary
Click

video.
Four years ago
this month, the President signed the Affordable Care Act, more commonly
known as Obamacare, into law.
It was passed in the most partisan
and misguided fashion possibleby a straight party-line vote after
rejecting any serious amendments from the other side of the aisle. Since
then, the American people have been faced with higher premiums,
increased out-of-pocket expenses, limited doctor choice and the unraveling
of the employer-based health insurance market that so many families
rely upon. Most concerning, the millions of Americans, including over
100,000 Idahoans, who fell victim to one of the Administrations most
repeated false pledges, if you like your health care, you can keep
it.
The complete dislocation of the United States health care
economy, coupled with the laws negative effects on the already sluggish
economy and job market, should be a clear indication to the
Administration, as it is to the American people, that this law is simply not
working.
Additionally, the President has repeatedly made selective interpretations of the
law to advance the Administrations political interests.
Another major delay to the law was announced just last week, making the
total number of delays, waivers and extensions issued since the law
took effect surpass thirty (a list of the most notable delays can be
found
here ).
The fundamental foundation the
law was built uponmisguided belief that government bureaucracy would
improve our nations health care systemis a far cry from the true
reforms needed to solidify the nations position as the global leader in
health care innovation and patient care.
We must instead turn to achievable reforms that
result in the affordable health care and improved access to quality care
that Americans want and deserve.
We need to start over with
reforms that address specific issues that would make a positive
difference for all Americans.
A successful health care system would
enable Americans to choose plans that fit specific needs and those of their
families.
Instead of giving the government more power over
health care, individual patients must have more control, choice and
information to make their health care decisions.
We need to renew
focus on health care reforms that will work and have broad public support
without the predicted failures that are inherent in Obamacare. To read
more on my take of successful health care reform, click

All the best,
