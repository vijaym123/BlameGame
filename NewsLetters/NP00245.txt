Week in Review
I wanted to start out this
newsletter with great news! After
much debate in Congress, the
USA
FREEDOM Act
has been signed
into law by President Obama. For
too long, the government has
invaded the privacy of Americans
and Nevadans. I am pleased to see
the PATRIOT Act gutted of Section
215, which allowed the National
Security Agency to sweep up and
store law-abiding Americans' call
records. The
USA
FREEDOM Act
balances the
privacy of innocent citizens across
the country, while at the same time
allowing the intelligence community
to keep us safe.
Did you know the IRS wants the
power to lower the threshold for
reporting slot machines, Keno, and
Bingo winnings? These regulations
would wreak havoc on our state's
gaming industry. I expressed my
concerns to the IRS commissioner
during a Senate Finance Committee
hearing. You can click
here
to watch. I will continue to fight
against these newly proposed
regulations.
I was very excited to see both
Army Sergeant William Shemin and
Army Private Henry Johnson receive
the Medal of Honor last
week.Sgt. Shemin and Pvt.
Johnson courageously served our
country during World War I, and I
am pleased they were awarded
appropriately. Their heroic acts
place them among our nation's
greatest, and we remember them with
pride and gratitude. In 2011, I
introduced the
William
Shemin World War I Veterans Act
(S. 1727), requiring a review of
Jewish World War I veterans'
military records to see if any
qualify for the Medal of Honor. The
legislation was eventually included
in the
National
Defense Authorization Act of
2012 . You can read more about
my efforts
here .
I also recently worked alongside
Senators Ayotte, Casey, and
Shaheen, as well as Congressman
Nadler, on legislation that would
protect
pregnant workers
from workplace
discrimination. Expecting mothers
should not be penalized for being
pregnant. As a father of two
daughters, I believe providing
reasonable accommodations on the
job for pregnant workers is
important to maintain a healthy
pregnancy.
This last week, I filed these
amendments to the National Defense
Authorization Act:
Heller amendment to
increase
military readiness and
strength .
Heller amendment to require
the Department of Defense (DOD)
to
transfer
records to the VA
within 30
days.
Heller amendment to require
the DOD to
perform
physicals on separating service
members .
Heller amendment to delay a
sage grouse listing for
10
years .
Heller amendment to help
Filipino veterans
prove
their military service .
Fortunately, two of my
amendments already passed the
Senate.
Heller amendment to
protect
commissary benefits for service
members .
Heller amendment to help
reduce
the VA backlog .
As a final note, I was honored
to speak at the Smith Valley School
Commencement this year.
Congratulations class of 2015!
Keith Trout with the Reno Gazette
Journal had a good write up of the
graduation. Check it out by
