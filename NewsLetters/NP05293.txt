Dear Friend,
This past week, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) informed my office that an
Ebola patient traveled in Ohios 16
th
District by air on October
13, 2014, the day before she reported
symptoms. Though I remain concerned about
the CDCs lack of stringent
protocols, I am confident in Ohios
strong response.
Over the past week, I participated in
several calls with Governor Kasich to
discuss Ohios response effort. I am
encouraged that Ohio's quarantine protocols
are stricter than the CDCs
guidelines. Ohio will use mandatory
quarantine measures, rather than the
voluntary measures, which allowed the Texas
nurse to travel to Ohio in the first place.
I learned that representatives from the
Department of Health are on-site in Summit
County to support local efforts and are in
ongoing communication with the CDC.
Additionally, the CDC is on the ground to
track the contacts made by the infected
nurse and they have expanded outreach to
include those who flew from Dallas Fort
Worth to Cleveland on October 10, 2014.
Though the vast majority of Ohioans are
not at risk, I share concern with the
people of Ohios 16
th
District regarding Ebola. It
is clear that the protocols the
administration currently has in place can
and should be enhanced
the patient
should have never boarded a flight out of
Dallas. However, the CDC allowed her to
travel. We need answers.
That is why I led a bipartisan
letter signed
by members of the Ohio delegation to the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director
Dr. Tom Frieden requesting support to Ohio
and with questions regarding its protocols.
The letter asks that the CDC provide any
and all necessary support to the state of
Ohio, an explanation as to why they allowed
a caregiver of an infected person to travel
to Ohio, and what changes have been made to
ensure the same situation does not happen
in the future. Additionally, the letter
asks that the CDC keep all options for
containment on the table, including travel
screenings and restrictions.
It is critical that the administration
treats the outbreak at the source, as well
as works to ensure that protocols and
procedures are in place to detect those who
have potentially been exposed to prevent
them from exposing others.A travel
ban should be considered, particularly at a
time when the CDCs protocols have
failed Northeast Ohioans.
We must have efficient and effective
preparedness procedures at the federal,
state, and local levels in order to protect
Ohioans and Americans across the country. I
will continue to monitor the ongoing
situation closely and work across all
levels of government to ensure Ohio has all
of the resources it needs to protect its
residents.
