Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week, I submitted an amicus brief supporting Sen. Ron Johnson's
suit contesting the lawfulness of the ObamaCare subsidies for Members
of Congress, which was submitted on behalf of myself and some of my
colleagues in the House and Senate. 12 Senators and 26 Congressmen
signed on to the brief, which you can read by clicking here
.
Members of Congress lack credibility in standing up against executive
overreach if we are not willing to do so when the overreach benefits
Congress! Overruling the plain meaning of the law to grant special
relief to Members of Congress puts the ruling class before the American
people. Watch my interview with Eric Bolling on this topic here.
Had the Senate not deep-sixed my amendment blocking the subsidies last
year, this suit wouldn't be necessary.
I've been clear on this from day 1: the subsidies are unlawful because
they are not justified by the text of the statute. Thus, they represent
an illicit bailout for Members of Congress and should be overturned.
Rep. DeSantis and World War II veteran Raymond Mitchell.
Ormond Beach resident Raymond Mitchell served our country in the Army
during World War II. Ray participated in some of the iconic battles
during the European campaign, including the invasion of Normandy.
But he was never credited with some of the awards and decorations that
he earned through his service.
My office was able to help Ray get credit for the awards that he earned
during WWII. I was honored to present Ray with his awards at a ceremony
held before his friends and family at Ormond in the Pines. Ray fought
the good fight for us, finished the race and remains faithful to this
day. May God bless this man!
Lastly, one of the most persistent problems with our government is that
many of those who impose and enforce rules on the American people seem
not to follow the same rules themselves.
A recent IRS report demonstrates this phenomenon with stunning clarity.
The report found that the IRS doled out more than $2.8 million in
taxpayer-financed bonuses to IRS employees who had been formally
disciplined for misconduct.
What is more, the IRS paid $1 million in bonuses to employees who didn't
pay their own taxes. These IRS officials wield their power to make sure
the American people do not skimp on their taxes while at the same time
failing to meet their own legal obligations - and they are rewarded for
it!
Congress should protect taxpayers and defund these bonuses during the
next legislative session.
Last year, the House considered a bill
to hold such employees accountable, but
it did not pass because, while it received 250 "yes" votes (including
me) against 159 "no" votes, it was considered under a procedure that
required 2/3rds of the votes.
I hope this measure is brought back up
using the normal procedure so the House can act to protect taxpayers.
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.

Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week, I
submitted
an
amicus
brief
supporting
Sen.
Ron
Johnson's
suit
contesting
the
lawfulness
of
the
ObamaCare
subsidies
for
Members
of
Congress,
which
was
submitted
on
behalf
of
myself
and
some
of
my
colleagues
in
the
House
and
Senate.
12
Senators
and
26
Congressmen
signed
on
to
the
brief,
which
you
can
read
by
clicking
here .
Members
of
Congress
lack
credibility
in
standing
up
against
executive
overreach
if
we
are
not
willing
to
do
so
when
the
overreach
benefits
Congress!
Overruling
the
plain
meaning
of
the
law
to
grant
special
relief
to
Members
of
Congress
puts
the
ruling
class
before
the
American
people.
Watch
my
interview
with
Eric
Bolling
on
this
topic
here.
Had
the
Senate
not
deep-sixed
my
amendment
blocking
the
subsidies
last
year,
this
suit
wouldn't
be
necessary.
I've
been
clear
on
this
from
day
1:
the
subsidies
are
unlawful
because
they
are
not
justified
by
the
text
of
the
statute.
Thus, they
represent
an
illicit
bailout
for
Members
of
Congress
and
should
be
overturned.
Rep.
DeSantis and
World
War
II
veteran
Raymond
Mitchell.
Ormond
Beach
resident
Raymond
Mitchell
served
our
country
in
the
Army
during
World
War
II.
Ray
participated
in
some
of
the
iconic
battles
during
the
European
campaign,
including
the
invasion
of
Normandy.
But
he
was
never
credited
with
some
of
the
awards
and
decorations
that
he
earned
through
his
service.
My
office
was
able
to
help
Ray
get
credit
for
the
awards
that
he
earned
during
WWII.
I
was
honored
to
present
Ray
with
his
awards
at
a
ceremony
held
before
his
friends
and
family
at
Ormond
in
the
Pines.
Ray
fought
the
good
fight
for
us,
finished
the
race
and
remains
faithful
to
this
day.
May
God
bless
this
man!
Lastly,
one
of
the
most
persistent
problems
with
our
government
is
that
many
of
those
who
impose
and
enforce
rules
on
the
American
people
seem
not
to
follow
the
same
rules
themselves.
A
recent
IRS
report
demonstrates
this
phenomenon
with
stunning
clarity.
The
report
found
that
the
IRS
doled
out
more
than
$2.8
million
in
taxpayer-financed
bonuses
to
IRS
employees
who
had
been
formally
disciplined
for
misconduct.
What
is
more,
the
IRS
paid
$1
million
in
bonuses
to
employees
who
didn&#8217;t
pay
their
own
taxes.
These
IRS
officials
wield
their
power
to
make
sure
the
American
people
do
not
skimp
on
their
taxes
while
at
the
same
time
failing
to
meet
their
own
legal
obligations
&#8211;
and
they
are
rewarded
for
it!
Congress
should
protect
taxpayers
and
defund
these
bonuses
during
the
next
legislative
session.
Last
year,
the
House
considered
a
bill
to
hold
such
employees
accountable,
but
it
did
not
pass
because,
while
it
received
250
&#8220;yes&#8221;
votes
(including
me)
against
159
&#8220;no&#8221;
votes,
it
was
considered
under
a
procedure
that
required
2/3rds
of
the
votes.
I
hope
this
measure
is
brought
back
up
using
the
normal
procedure
so
the
House
can
act
to
protect
taxpayers.

more

I
look
forward
to
hearing

you;

you
need
any
