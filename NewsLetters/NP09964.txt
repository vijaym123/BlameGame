Don't Be Left in the Dark
As your voice in Washington, I do my best to keep you informed and updated about what is going on in Congress and what I am doing in the 3rd District of Missouri.
I wanted to let you know that House rules prohibit Member offices from giving notice of official tele-town halls or sending out Congressional newsletters during 'black out' periods. In Missouri, our 'black out' period for the primary election begins on May 7, 2014 and extends through August 5. 2014.
During this time, I encourage you to sign up for my
e-newsletter
so you won't get left in the dark when I send updates on important issues like Benghazi, the IRS scandal, and the president's health care law.
As always, it is my honor to serve you in the House of Representatives.
