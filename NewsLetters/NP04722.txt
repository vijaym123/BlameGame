LaRoche Baseball Complex in Fort Scott :
On
Wednesday, I went to check out the progress of the new, 500 seat,
state-of-the-art LaRoche Baseball Complex in Fort Scott with Nationals first
baseman and Fort Scott native, Adam LaRoche.
It was great
to see the project coming together with construction underway and I am
excited for what this park will bring the community of Fort
Scott.

Sitting Down with Senator Dole in Fort Scott:
I had the opportunity
to join Senator Bob Dole in Fort Scott as he thanked folks for all
their support over the years. It was so interesting to hear his stories
from his time in Congress and his regrets that they were unable to pass
a balanced budget amendment. I hope that we can accomplish this goal
in the next Congress. He also shared some of his war stories when he
served as Majority Leader in the Senate.
Bob Dole has always
been a great mentor and a close friend, and he continues to motivate
me to work across the aisle to get things done. As he said himself,
sometimes youve got to give a little to get a lot.

U.S. Service Academy
Nominations :
Each year, I have the honor of nominating a select
group of Kansans to the U.S. Services Academies. Our U.S. Service
Academies are some of the most selective institutions of higher learning
in the world, and have graduated American heroes like Buzz Aldrin and
Kansas very own Dwight D. Eisenhower.
On November 15th,
the 2nd Districts applicants will have face-to-face interviews to
decide who willget my nomination to service. Nominating these young
individuals is a tremendous privilege, and a very serious undertaking.
Applicants are chosen on the basis of academic performance, intelligence,
leadership, moral character, and physical aptitude. Best wishes to all
of the applicants this year as you pursue your goal of attending one of
the U.S. Service Academies and serving our great
nation.
