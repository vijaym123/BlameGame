Dear Friend,
Education is synonymous with opportunity and I believe every child deserves the opportunity to learn, work hard and succeed in our society.
Unfortunately, the cost of college often stands between a bright young high school student and their chance at success. That is why I make it a priority to connect Orange County students to resources that make college affordable.
Applying for federal aid can be overwhelming and complicated, which is why my office will host workshops across Orange County in January and February to help students and families file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form and explore scholarship opportunities.
No registration is necessary. For more information, please contact Beatriz Fern&aacute;ndez in my Garden Grove office at (714) 621-0102.
