ISSUES
LEGISLATION
August 10, 2014
Dear David,
I am looking forward to spending the
next couple of weeks meeting with constituents across the North State
to discuss the issues most important to California's 1st
Congressional district. I will be holding a number of events throughout the
district to hear your concerns and provide updates on recent legislative
actions. At the bottom of this newsletter, you can find more information
on two of my upcoming events in Oroville and Chico.
Below,
I included an update from the latest legislation passed by the House
of Representatives, including measures to address the VA system as well
as the border crisis.
As always, please feel free to
contact any of my offices if you have any questions or
concerns.
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa presenting the Peninsula Fire District
with a certificate of Special Congressional Recognition for their
service to the North State.
VA Reform Bill
The bureaucratic
failures plaguing the VA are simply unconscionable, particularly in light
of so-called performance bonuses given to senior staff. Destroyed
records, second-rate care, and silenced whistleblowers are an insult to
veterans who have sacrificed tremendously to keep our country safe. I
was pleased to see that the VA reform bill that Congress recently
passed was signed into law last week by the President.
H.R. 3230
improves access to care by giving veterans the option of
private care, especially in cases where veterans have trouble accessing
care due to lengthy wait times or those who live far from VA
facilities. The bill also restores accountability by ensuring that when
misconduct or poor performance occurs at the VA, those responsible are fired
not put on paid vacation.
H.R. 3230, which passed on a
420-5 vote, includes the following
components:
Requires the VA to offer authorization to receive non-VA care to any
veteran enrolled in the VA health care system as of August 1,
2014.
Allows veterans to seek private care if they are unable to
secure an appointment at a VA medical facility within 30 days, or they
live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA medical facility. Also allows
a veteran to seek private care if specialty care is not available
within 20 miles of their residence.
Authorizes up to
$4,534,000 in funding for the expansion of a community based outpatient
clinic in Chico, CA.
Authorizes up to $8,154,000 in
funding for the expansion of a community based outpatient clinic in Redding,
CA.
Authorizes the VA to fire or demote Senior
Executive Service (SES) employees for poor performance or
misconduct.
Requires public college to provide in-state tuition to
veterans and eligible dependents in order for the school to remain eligible
to receive G.I. Bill education payments.
These
common sense and responsible reforms take a step a step forward in building
a system that honors, not punishes, our veterans

Addressing the Crisis at the Southern Border
The Presidents lax
immigration enforcement and unilateral policies allowing blanket
amnesty for individuals who have chosen to unlawfully enter the United
States has created both a humanitarian and national security threat at our
southern border that we can no longer afford to ignore. Before
leaving Washington, the House took action to strengthen our immigration
system and restore rule of law by reining in executive overreach. These
measures will allow us to take immediate action to enforce our
immigration laws, regain control of our border, prevent illegal immigrant, and
ensure the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors can return to
their families safely and quickly.
H.R.
5230
appropriates temporary supplemental funding for increased border
security, enforcement of immigration and custom laws, humanitarian
assistance, and illegal immigration prevention. This short-term funding,
which is fully offset by cutting existing funds, will provide temporary
care for the unaccompanied children and ensure an expedited return to
their country of origin by closing a loophole in current law to
require that all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as minors from
Mexico for the purpose of removal processing. The bill also funds
National Guard deployment along our border, a step I strongly believe is
needed to assist our overwhelmed Border Patrol personnel.
In
addition, the House also passed
H.R. 5272
to
prevent amnesty and make sure that the President cannot abuse his
discretion to allow illegal immigrants who came here as children to obtain a
deportation deferral, also known as DACA.
Importantly, this bill
specifically states that amnesty is prohibited and prevents the
President from authorizing illegal immigrants to work in the United
States.
Unfortunately, the Senate and the President have shown very
little willingness to participate in negotiations from the very
beginning, and failed to even consider any legislation to address the
crisis. We need policies that actually solve the problem, not blank checks.
The American people deserve a government that can demonstrate both
the ability and the commitment to enforcing our nation's laws. These
House-passed measures do both.
