Friend,
Wow! Since Ami&#39;s email
on Tuesday , you&#39;ve stepped up in a big way - and we&#39;re glad you have,
since all donations up to $5200 will be MATCHED from now until
August 15th !
Right now, we&#39;re only $2,505 away from our goal
-
click here now to help us hit it.
Why do we need you to pitch in right now?
We just learned that John Boehner&#39;s political arm, the NRCC, has actually put up a fake news website in order to mislead voters about the issues in Ami&#39;s race. Even worse, they&#39;re not denouncing - or denying - this fact.
When confronted about it, they actually claimed that anyone who was angry about it was &quot;just mad that they didn&#39;t think of it first.&quot;
Can you believe the nerve?! We&#39;re mad alright - not because we didn&#39;t think of it, but because we&#39;re having to deal with these extremely dirty tactics.
This is why grassroots support is critical - because we need to spread the truth about Ami&#39;s record, and push back on Doug Ose, John Boehner, and these deceitful tactics.
Fake news websites to trick voters? Our opponent and his friends are pulling out all the stops. Help us hit our goal and fight back.
Give $5 now, and until this Friday, August 15th, your donation will be matched.
Thanks!
Best,
Team Bera
