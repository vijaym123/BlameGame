Friend &mdash; Here are two thought experiments. Indulge me, won&rsquo;t you?
It&rsquo;s the morning after Election Day. 8 a.m. You stumble out of bed. Make some oatmeal.
Turn on the TV to find out what happened in that Senate race, the one that was too close to call all night, the one all the pundits said would decide control of the Senate.
But you gave an extra $5 by clicking on this link.
And, lo and behold, your favorite Senate candidate &mdash; maybe Kay Hagan, or Mark Udall, or, uh, me &mdash; pulled it out by a few votes.
Oatmeal never tasted so sweet.
But there&rsquo;s another way it could go. 8 a.m. Oatmeal. TV. But in this example, you DIDN&rsquo;T give an extra gift. And, by a few hundred votes, some Tea Party extremist is now a U.S. Senator-elect &mdash; and Republicans have captured the majority.
How&rsquo;s that oatmeal taste now?
You still have time to choose one of those scenarios. But when I say &ldquo;time,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean days. I mean minutes. Don&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t even wait to read the rest of this email.

You&rsquo;ve seen the polls &mdash;
we&rsquo;re neck and neck in race after race.
Moving the numbers just a little bit could mean the difference between victory and defeat &mdash; trust me, I&rsquo;ve been there.
But with just days to go until the polls close, every minute counts. Your extra contribution won&#39;t be funding some far-off future plan.
It&#39;ll be the money that will be put to use first thing tomorrow.
It could be
your
gift that makes the difference for Mary Landrieu, picks up a Republican seat in Kentucky or Georgia, or even saves our majority.
Please make a contribution to the DSCC right now &mdash; it&rsquo;ll be on the air in a battleground state or in the field as part of a get-out-the-vote program by tomorrow morning. And, even better, it will be matched 3-to-1!
If you want to know why I&rsquo;m standing with the DSCC in the final days of this election, here&rsquo;s why: On November 5, I don&rsquo;t want my oatmeal to taste like regret.
I want my oatmeal to taste like victory.
How about you?
Thanks,
Al Franken
