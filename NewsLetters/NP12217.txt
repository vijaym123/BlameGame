Human
Rights Letter to Chinese President Xi
Jinping
As a member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on
China, I collaborated with 10 of my colleagues on a letter to Chinese
President Xi Jinping regarding China's continued violations of human
rights. Since President Xi took office, a major crackdown has taken place
against anti-corruption and rights advocates, people of faith, and
supporters of ethnic minorities in China.
This crackdown,
which has attracted widespread international attention, is especially
troubling because it has targeted many Chinese citizens seeking to work
within the system to address issues that the Chinese government itself
has promoted, including fighting corruption and protecting the rights
of ethnic minorities.
This letter comes at a critical
time, as a growing number of these detained Chinese citizens now await
trial or sentencing. As we continue to push for prisoners of conscience
such as Kenneth Bae in North Korea and Pastor Saeed Abedini in Iran to
be given their rightful freedom, we must also stand up for our many
brothers and sisters facing persecution in China.

11th District Spotlight
Recently,
I had the opportunity to speak at East Burke Middle School in Connelly
Springs. Many thanks to the students for their excellent
questions!
Debbie and I enjoyed meeting owner Dave Reep and the
friendly crew at The Grind Cafe in Morganton. Delicious sandwiches,
homemade baked goods, and of course
great coffee!
