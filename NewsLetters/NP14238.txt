Dear Friend,
Veterans Day is when Americans pause to reflect on freedom and thank
the men and women who protected that freedom for us. We set aside one
day a year to specifically honor those who have worn our Nation's
uniform. We follow the age-old traditions of marching in parades,
attending ceremonies, and sharing the stories of duty, of sacrifice, of
patriotism.
It is a special day, but we know that honoring veterans and military
families requires much more than one day each year. It takes a steady
commitment to serve those who have sacrificed for us, and a willingness
to tackle complex, and oftentimes uncomfortable, challenges.
I was a military spouse and am very proud of my husband's service. In
my five years on the House Armed Services Committee in the United
States House of Representatives - all of them war years - the Committee
has dealt with the array of issues that military families and our
veterans confront every day. Regardless of the nature of the challenge,
we have a responsibility as a community, a state, and a nation to
tackle each one. As I have said many times, "thank you" has to be more
than a phrase. If we want to show our gratitude for their service, we
have to honor our commitments to veterans.
Our service personnel should be able to get an education and a good job
when they return home from military service. I have always enjoyed
welcoming home troops as they return from service overseas, and I am
happy about the legislation that was passed to help them as they leave
the military. We voted for the new GI Bill of Rights in 2008, and this
has helped one million veterans, service members and their families
continue their education. Other legislation has helped veterans start
small businesses, and many organizations have joined together to help
our veterans receive training and find good jobs.
Veterans also give back to their communities, helping each other and
the young, the old, the poor, and the sick. Veterans can be seen
everywhere there is a service project that needs to be done, and they
have a marvelous dedication to volunteerism. They continue to serve,
even decades after leaving the military.
However, we do have work to do to fulfill our commitments. Veterans
need more jobs. Some need housing support, or treatment. After more
than a decade of war, the system needs to be more responsive. For
example, the backlog of disability claims, standing near 400,000, is
unacceptable. I was happy to support a bipartisan package of bills to
address the problem, but it must be one of our foremost priorities to
eliminate the current claims backlog, and to get as many veterans
approved for the care and benefits they qualify for as quickly as
possible.
Patriotic Americans in every generation have stepped up when asked to
serve. They went to places near and far from home, and they had some
experiences that the rest of us cannot imagine. Some served in war;
some served in peacetime. All of them left families and friends and
interrupted their lives to serve this country. Veterans were there for
us, and on Veterans Day and every day, they need to know that our
nation and our people will be there for them.
Best Wishes,
Carol

Dear
Friend,
Veterans
Day
is
when
Americans
pause
to
reflect
on
freedom
and
thank
the
men
and
women
who
protected
that
freedom
for
us.
We
set
aside
one
day
a
year
to
specifically
honor
those
who
have
worn
our
Nation&#8217;s
uniform.
We
follow
the
age-old
traditions
of
marching
in
parades,
attending
ceremonies,
and
sharing
the
stories
of
duty,
of
sacrifice,
of
patriotism.
It
is
a
special
day,
but
we
know
that
honoring
veterans
and
military
families
requires
much
more
than
one
day
each
year.
It
takes
a
steady
commitment
to
serve
those
who
have
sacrificed
for
us,
and
a
willingness
to
tackle
complex,
and
oftentimes
uncomfortable,
challenges.
I
was
a
military
spouse
and
am
very
proud
of
my
husband&#8217;s
service.
In
my
five
years
on
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
in
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives
&#8211;
all
of
them
war
years
&#8211;
the
Committee
has
dealt
with
the
array
of
issues
that
military
families
and
our
veterans
confront
every
day.
Regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
challenge,
we
have
a
responsibility
as
a
community,
a
state,
and
a
nation
to
tackle
each
one.
As
I
have
said
many
times,
&#8220;thank
you&#8221;
has
to
be
more
than
a
phrase.
If
we
want
to
show
our
gratitude
for
their
service,
we
have
to
honor
our
commitments
to
veterans.
Our
service
personnel
should
be
able
to
get
an
education
and
a
good
job
when
they
return
home
from
military
service.
I
have
always
enjoyed
welcoming
home
troops
as
they
return
from
service
overseas,
and
I
am
happy
about
the
legislation
that
was
passed
to
help
them
as
they
leave
the
military.
We
voted
for
the
new
GI
Bill
of
Rights
in
2008,
and
this
has
helped
one
million
veterans,
service
members
and
their
families
continue
their
education.
Other
legislation
has
helped
veterans
start
small
businesses,
and
many
organizations
have
joined
together
to
help
our
veterans
receive
training
and
find
good
jobs.
Veterans
also
give
back
to
their
communities,
helping
each
other
and
the
young,
the
old,
the
poor,
and
the
sick.
Veterans
can
be
seen
everywhere
there
is
a
service
project
that
needs
to
be
done,
and
they
have
a
marvelous
dedication
to
volunteerism.
They
continue
to
serve,
even
decades
after
leaving
the
military.
However,
we
do
have
work
to
do
to
fulfill
our
commitments.
Veterans
need
more
jobs.
Some
need
housing
support,
or
treatment.
After
more
than
a
decade
of
war,
the
system
needs
to
be
more
responsive.
For
example,
the
backlog
of
disability
claims,
standing
near
400,000,
is
unacceptable.
I
was
happy
to
support
a
bipartisan
package
of
bills
to
address
the
problem,
but
it
must
be
one
of
our
foremost
priorities
to
eliminate
the
current
claims
backlog,
and
to
get
as
many
veterans
approved
for
the
care
and
benefits
they
qualify
for
as
quickly
as
possible.
Patriotic
Americans
in
every
generation
have
stepped
up
when
asked
to
serve.
They
went
to
places
near
and
far
from
home,
and
they
had
some
experiences
that
the
rest
of
us
cannot
imagine.
Some
served
in
war;
some
served
in
peacetime.
All
of
them
left
families
and
friends
and
interrupted
their
lives
to
serve
this
country.
Veterans
were
there
for
us,
and
on
Veterans
Day
and
every
day,
they
need
to
know
that
our
nation
and
our
people
will
be
there
for
them.
Best
Wishes, Carol
