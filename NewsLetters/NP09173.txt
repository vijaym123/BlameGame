Dear Friend,
Memorial Day has come and gone. I hope that everyone had the chance to
relax and spend time with family and friends enjoying the start to the
summer season and honoring America's fallen heroes. Though the holiday
will not come again for another year, we must strive to never forget
those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep America free. I
spent the week addressing some of the pressing issues facing our
veterans and visiting with constituents, including the outstanding men
and women in uniform at Whiteman Air Force Base.

On Wednesday, I met with administrators at the Harry S. Truman Memorial
Veterans' Hospital in Columbia.
In light of the recent claims and
allegations of wrongdoing at the Phoenix VA facility, I wanted to meet
with the officials in the district to make sure that our veterans here
locally were receiving access to quality care in a timely manner - that
is what they deserve.
In visiting with the administrators, I was
pleased to see that they are providing quality, timely care meeting or
exceeding national standards in most areas.
In the areas where they
need to make improvements, they have either taken measures already or
they have plans in place to alleviate the problems.
After the meeting I held a press conference to discuss what I had
learned, as well, regarding actions the hospital is taking to make sure
that another tragedy like the one that ended in the unfortunate death
of one of our veterans last year doesn't happen again.
The hospital
administrators told me about the efforts they have taken in response to
the incident, such as staff education, facility renovation, and recent
hiring pushes.
I am hopeful these efforts provide the patient safety
needed to ensure there is no repeat of the tragic events of last year.

Later that day I also had the opportunity to tour the Co-Mo Electric
Cooperative in Tipton. On my tour of the facilities I was impressed
with their new "fiber-to-the-home" efforts. Local consumers have shown
a strong demand for high-speed internet in this area. Co-Mo's efforts
will help further business development, educational opportunities, and
advanced telemedicine. This project will give a much needed boost to
the region and I am proud to be able to represent Co-Mo's interests in
Congress.
I was also able to visit the Gates Corporation manufacturing facility
in Versailles on Wednesday. It was encouraging to see the great
American jobs that are created and sustained by the plant's operations.
The hydraulic couplings and hoses made by the facility's 550 employees
become part of equipment used worldwide in construction, farming, and
mining. It is a blessing to have a company like Gates providing both
quality jobs and a quality product in our district.

Accompanying Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James as she toured
Whiteman Air Force Base on Thursday was a highlight of the week. I am
always glad to visit with the dedicated men and women in uniform who
serve selflessly. Secretary James was able to see first-hand the
pivotal missions and extraordinary capabilities that Whiteman boasts,
such as the B-2 and A-10 operations. Whiteman is home to thousands of
men and women who are making a difference around the world on a daily
basis, and I am glad the Secretary was able to see what makes this
installation so great. Her visit reinforces just how essential the base
and the men and women who serve here are for the Air Force and our
national security.

I will be traveling across Missouri's Fourth next week, hosting panels,
attending rallies, and speaking with you about energy policy during my
All of the Above Energy Tour. I look forward to hearing what you have
to say about this pressing issue. For more information about the events
of the week and where I'll be, visit my

Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

On
Wednesday,
I
met
with
administrators
at
the
Harry

Truman
Memorial
Veterans&#8217;
Hospital
in
Columbia.
In
light
of
the
recent
claims
and
allegations
of

at
the
Phoenix
VA

I
wanted
to
meet
with
the
officials
in
the

to

that
our

here
locally
were
receiving
access
to
quality

in

manner
&#8211;
that
is
what
they
deserve.
In

I
was

I

these

the
tragic
events
of
last
