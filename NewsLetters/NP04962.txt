&ldquo;If Polls Hold True the GOP Will Take Over the Senate&rdquo;
--
Bloomberg , 10/26/2014
Dear Friend,
Late-breaking polls are hitting the news every few hours. The last-minute ad buys are going up all across the country. We&rsquo;re in the final days of this campaign, and it can be easy to get distracted by a close horserace. But until the polls close on November 4th, we need to be focused like a laser on getting out the vote.
That means we need to invest in the ground game, and that means we need your help. Our deadline for October is TOMORROW at midnight, and we&rsquo;re still $14,769 short of our $16O,OOO goal. Give $5 and help our teams keep fighting on the ground.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Here in Massachusetts, there are a lot of races that are just too close to call. So rather than waste time or energy worrying and wondering, we&rsquo;re going to keep our noses to the grindstone.
Our organizers and volunteers are working hard in the last week of this campaign, but if we miss our fundraising goals, we can&rsquo;t run GOTV operations the way we should.
Help us reach $16O,OOO by tomorrow -- chip in $5 right now.
For the next 5 days, we have to stay focused on what it&rsquo;s going to take to win.
Thanks for your support.
