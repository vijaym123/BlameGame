Congressman Lamborn Stands Up for our Veterans and American
Energy
6/20/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn attended two
important Congressional hearings. First, he chaired his Energy and
Mineral Resources Subcommittee as they analyzed two pieces of legislation
designed to increase access to American energy and lower
costs.
"These bills will clarify
and streamline the natural gas infrastructure permitting process. They
will reduce the need for flaring and allow more natural gas to be
brought to market.
As a result of increased energy production, more
jobs will be created, revenue will increase, and the United States can
further distinguish itself as a global leader in energy
production."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)

Statement
The Congressman also attended an Oversight
Hearing of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The hearing reviewed
awarding bonuses to Senior Executives at the VA
Department.
"The incentive-based bonus
system is outrageous and appalling. Bonuses should only be awarded when
actual results are achieved. The last four years at the VA have
been plagued with preventable deaths, huge backlogs, legionella
outbreaks and numerous other failures that have put veterans lives at risk.
Yet, not a single Senior Executive Service employee at the VA has
received a performance rating of less than Fully Successful.
Awarding bonuses based on false metrics and
exaggerated statistics has helped erode the trust between veterans and
those who are supposed to care for them. I will continue to work hard
and lead on this issue until we have improved the care being offered to
our brave veterans."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
This
week, Congressman Lamborn was named as one of eight Republican House
members of special House-Senate Conference to address the
differences between House and Senate VA reform legislation. Work by the
Conference Committee is expected to begin next
week.
