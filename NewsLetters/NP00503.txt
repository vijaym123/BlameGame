Dear Friends,
As
American families celebrate the unofficial start of the summer season this
Memorial Day weekend, may we also remember that our freedom and the
very existence of this great country is due to the sacrifices of the
men and women who have worn and continue to wear the uniform of our
military service.
From
the Civil War to today, this nation and its people have set aside one
day each year to remember and honor our military members who have paid
the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Out of respect to them, the
lives they led, and families they left behind, we pause this Memorial Day
to remember and say thank
you.
On this Memorial Day, we especially mourn the
Oklahomans from across our state who have died in defense of our nation,
most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. Though their lives were cut
short, their memory and legacy lives on through our freedom and
democracy.
Sincerely,
Office Locations
