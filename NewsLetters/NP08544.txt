Friend,
Sometimes, you find advice in some pretty strange places. When I'm home
I get a chance to occasionally read bed time stories to my kiddos, and
I found some terrific words of advice in a series of books called
Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. Some of the advice was
silly. Things like, "If you are allergic to a thing, it is best not to
put that thing in your mouth, particularly if the thing is cats."
But as I read the books, I was struck by how many of the passages
reminded me of growing up in Port Angeles. Some great themes about the
value of education, the importance of pressing forward even during
tough times, the value of taking on difficult challenges, and the fact
that your hometown has a way of becoming part of who you are.
I had a lot of fun this past weekend sharing these thoughts with
Peninsula College's newest graduates. I was honored to speak to them at
this special time - and I got a chance to wear a great hat!
It was fun to meet a lot of the students and to hear what they've got
planned next. We are all excited to see what these graduates accomplish
out in the world. I know they will make our region proud. Go Pirates!
Time for Canada to stop dumping waste
Last week, graduations weren't the only thing happening at home. For
years now, Victoria, British Columbia and its surrounding communities
has been dumping sewage into the pristine waters of the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. The government of British Columbia planned to build a
treatment plant at McLoughlin Point by 2018, to ensure that raw
effluent from 300,000 residents no longer disturbs our shared waters.
Because the local community has refused to move forward with the
facility, British Columbia is now without a plan to end the pollution
of these waters. As someone born and raised in the region, I take pride
in how we care for our water and keep it clean.
That's why I took the lead in sending a letter - signed as well by both
Washington senators and House members from the Puget Sound region --
calling on the Premier of British Columbia to ensure that local
communities are following national and international standards and
addressing this problem.
Our letter is a call to action. I want Canada to live up to its
commitments and solve this problem. As a founding member of the Puget
Sound Recovery Caucus, it's important to me that we are good stewards
of our waters and preserve our region's most critical natural asset.

.
Bringing jobs to our region
I also joined a number of my colleagues to announce that a new package
of bills is being added to the House Democrats' "Make It In America"
agenda. This initiative seeks to produce more goods and create jobs
here at home. I'm happy to report that two of my bills are now part of
the agenda.
The first of these bills, the TRANSFER Act, would help innovative ideas
move from basements into boardrooms. It would provide needed tools to
entrepreneurs and small businesses so that they may better use research
to launch new commercial ventures. This bipartisan bill can aid small
businesses by turning proposals into reality and bringing new
investments to the table.
The Regional Innovation and Entrepreneurship Enhancement Act would
strengthen programs that foster innovation and the commercialization of
new technologies. It would also bolster regional partnerships that can
accelerate the growth of local businesses by taking advantage of the
expertise of our workforce and infrastructure.
The President has already signed ten bills from the Make It In America
agenda into law. I'll be pushing to get these bills to his desk as well.
Housing Native Heroes Act
I went to the floor to join my colleagues, both Democrats and
Republicans, in calling attention to the need to fully fund our Native
Americans Housing programs. In particular, I stressed the importance of
ensuring that tribal veterans at risk of homelessness have access to
the resources and support offered by the HUD-Veterans Affairs
Supportive Housing Voucher (HUD-VASH) program. I introduced the
bipartisan Housing Native Heroes Act last November to address this
issue. We have an obligation to all of our veterans to take care of
them when they return home. Watch here: http://youtu.be/SvcdhNAbvY8
So far..I've got an ok attendance record
I'm a little reticent to share the next bit of news because it feels a
bit like talking about a no-hitter in the middle of a ballgame. However
(to mix my baseball metaphors), I'm working toward the Cal Ripken Iron
Man Award.
The Hill published an article last week
regarding representatives who have yet to miss a vote
this Congress (since January 2013). I am proud to have not yet missed a
single vote over the past 17 months and to be one of only four
representatives to have not missed a vote during my tenure. Because I
work for you, I want to do my best to represent you.
Meanwhile, back home
We joined friends, family, and community members in recognizing Gordon
"Alex" Graham's military service with awards that were long overdue
since his deployment to Vietnam. Alex had contacted our office because
he had failed to receive medals that he had earned for his service. Our
team worked with him and with the Air Force, and last week I was
honored to present him with his medals and thank him for his service to
our country.
One of the best parts of my jobs is helping folks like Alex cut through
bureaucratic red tape to get what they've earned. Whether you are
looking to be properly recognized for serving your country or need help
securing Social Security benefits, don't hesitate to reach out to my
office. We are here for you.
Read more about Alex's unique story here in the Peninsula Gateway
.
While I was in Clallam County on Saturday, I also got a chance to visit
the Matt Albright Native Plant Center to learn more about plants that
are being used as part of the Elwha River restoration project. As you
can see, they put me to work!
And last, but never least, I got to spend part of my Father's Day this
past Sunday at the Manchester Salmon Bake with my kiddos. It was my
tenth year attending. (I've graduated from serving beans to serving
salmon.) Once again it was a great event that helped the local library.
Thanks for reading.
As always, I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek

Friend,
Sometimes,
you
find
advice
in
some
pretty
strange
places.
When
I&#8217;m
home
I
get
a
chance
to
occasionally
read
bed
time
stories
to
my
kiddos,
and
I
found
some
terrific
words
of
advice
in
a
series
of
books
called
Lemony
Snicket&#8217;s
Series
of
Unfortunate
Events.
Some
of
the
advice
was
silly. Things
like,
&#8220;If
you
are
allergic
to
a
thing,
it
is
best
not
to
put
that
thing
in
your
mouth,
particularly
if
the
thing
is
cats.&#8221;
But
as
I
read
the
books,
I
was
struck
by
how
many
of
the
passages
reminded
me
of
growing
up
in
Port
Angeles. Some
great
themes
about
the
value
of
education,
the
importance
of
pressing
forward
even
during
tough
times,
the
value
of
taking
on
difficult
challenges,
and
the
fact
that
your
hometown
has
a
way
of
becoming
part
of
who
you
are.
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
this
past
weekend
sharing
these
thoughts
with
Peninsula
College&#8217;s
newest
graduates.
I
was

to

&#8211;
and
I
got
a

to
wear
a

It
was

to

a

of
the

and
to
hear
what
they&#8217;ve

planned
next. We
are
all

to

what
these

accomplish
out
in
the
world. I
know
they
will
make
our

Pirates!
Time
for
Canada
to
stop
dumping
waste
Last
week,
graduations
weren&#8217;t
the
only
thing
happening
at
home.
For
years
now,
Victoria,
British
Columbia
and
its
surrounding
communities
has
been
dumping
sewage
into
the
pristine
waters
of
the
Strait
of
Juan
de

The
government
of
British
Columbia
planned
to
build
a
treatment
plant
at
McLoughlin
Point
by
2018,
to
ensure
that
raw
effluent
from
300,000
residents
no
longer
disturbs
our
shared
waters.
Because
the
local
community
has
refused
to
move
forward
with
the
facility,
British
Columbia
is
now
without
a
plan
to
end
the
pollution
of
these
waters.
As
someone
born
and
raised
in
the
region,
I
take
pride
in
how
we
care
for
our
water
and
keep
it
clean.
That&#8217;s
why
I
took
the

in

it&#8217;s
important
to
me
that
we
are
good

I&#8217;m

The

my

both
Democrats
and
Republicans,
in
calling
attention
to
the
need
to
fully
fund
our
Native
Americans
Housing
programs.
In
particular,
I
stressed
the
importance
of
ensuring
that
tribal
veterans
at
risk
of
homelessness
have
access
to
the
resources
and
support
offered
by
the
HUD-Veterans
Affairs
Supportive
Housing
Voucher
(HUD-VASH)
program.
I
introduced
the
bipartisan
Housing
Native
Heroes
Act
last
November
to
address
this
issue. We
have
an
obligation
to
all
of
our
veterans
to

of
them
when
they
return

So
far&#8230;.I&#8217;ve
got
an
ok
attendance
record
I&#8217;m
a
little
reticent
to
share
the
next
bit
of
news
because
it
feels
a
bit
like
talking
about
a
no-hitter
in
the
middle
of
a
ballgame. However
(to
mix
my
baseball
metaphors),
I&#8217;m
working
toward
the
Cal
Ripken
Iron
Man
Award.
The
Hill
published
an
article
last
week
regarding
representatives
who
have
yet
to
miss
a
vote
this
Congress
(since
January
2013).
I
am
proud
to
have
not
yet
missed
a
single
vote
over
the
past
17
months
and
to
be
one
of
only
four
representatives
to
have
not
missed
a
vote
during
my
tenure. Because
I
work
for
you,
I
want
to
do
my
best
to
represent
you.
Meanwhile,
back
home
We
joined
friends,
family,
and
community
members
in
recognizing
Gordon
&#8220;Alex&#8221;
Graham&#8217;s
military
service
with
awards
that
were
long
overdue
since
his
deployment
to
Vietnam.
Alex
had
contacted
our
office
because
he
had
failed
to
receive
medals
that
he
had
earned
for
his
service. Our
team
worked
with
him
and
with
the
Air
Force,
and
last
week
I
was
honored
to
present
him
with
his
medals
and
thank
him
for
his
service
to
our
country.
One
of
the
best
parts
of
my
jobs
is
helping
folks
like
Alex
cut
through
bureaucratic
red
tape
to
get
what
they&#8217;ve
earned.
Whether
you
are
looking
to
be
properly
recognized
for
serving
your
country
or
need
help
securing
Social
Security
benefits,
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out
to
my
office.
We
are
here
for
you.

about
Alex&#8217;s
unique
story
here
in
the
Peninsula
Gateway .
While
I
was
in
Clallam
County
on
Saturday,
I
also
got
a
chance
to
visit
the
Matt
Albright
Native
Plant
Center
to
learn
more
about
plants
that
are
being
used
as
part
of
the
Elwha
River
restoration
project.
As
you
can
see,
they
put
me
to
work!
And
last,
but
never
least,
I
got
to
spend
part
of
my
Father's
Day
this
past
Sunday
at
the
Manchester
Salmon
Bake
with
my
kiddos.
It
was
my
tenth
year
attending.
(I've
graduated
from
serving
beans
to
serving
salmon.) Once
again
it
was
a
great
event
that
helped
the
local
library.
.
Thanks
for
reading.
As
always,
I&#8217;m
honored
to
work
for
you.
