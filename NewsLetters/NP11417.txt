event hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation
at Googles headquarters in
Washington, DC. He delivered
remarks detailing new policies to unleash
American innovation and create well
paying, middle class jobs.

past.I think that the 21
st
century
istailor-made for what America
is good at
innovation and job

to make a fewchanges if we want

Rubio, Colleagues Introduce The
Venezuela Defense Of Human Rights And
Civil Society Act
As members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Marco and Committee
Chairman Robert Menendez (D-NJ), along
with Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL),
introduced the
Venezuela
Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society
Act of 2014 .
This bipartisan legislation authorizes
$15 million in new funding in the FY2015
budget to defend human rights, support
democratic civil society organizations,
assist independent media, and strengthen
good governance and the rule of law in
the face of the massive violence and
repression being carried out by President
Maduro against peaceful protesters.
It also requires President Obama to
impose sanctions on persons that have
been involved in serious human rights
violations against peaceful demonstrators
and others in Venezuela, or that have
directed or ordered the arrest or
prosecution of a person due to their
legitimate exercise of freedom of
expression or assembly.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate
unanimously passed a
resolution
introduced by Marco outlining the
framework for legislative action on
Venezuela.
The full U.S. Congress has
spoken loudly and clearly that we stand
with the Venezuelan people as they
exercise their fundamental rights, and
we condemn the Maduro regimes
deadly wave of repression,
said Rubio . Now
its time for actions that name,
shame and punish the Maduro
regimes murderers and thugs who
are responsible for the crackdown
against innocent Venezuelans.
Now is the time to stand with
the Venezuelan people and increase
pressure on the Maduro regime,
added Rubio . I hope we
can begin to move quickly to consider
this legislation when the Senate
reconvenes on March 24.
Rubio, Kaine Introduce Resolution
Calling For New Humanitarian Strategy
In Syria
On the heels of three devastating
reports released this week that highlight
how more than 5.5 million Syrian children
have been affected by the three-year-long
Syrian crisis (
UNICEF ,
Save
the Children ,
World
Vision ),Marco and Senator Tim
Kaine (D-VA), both members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, led a
bipartisan group of senators in calling
on President Obama to develop and submit
to Congress a more robust U.S. strategy
for addressing the Syrian humanitarian
crisis.
The call came as part of the
Syrian
Humanitarian Resolution of 2014 (S. Res.
384) ,
introduced by 19 senators,
that condemns the unlawful use of
violence against civilians in Syria,
urges all parties in the country to allow
for immediate, unfettered access to
humanitarian aid, supports the immediate
and full implementation of United Nations
Security Council Resolution 2139, and
calls on the international community to
continue assisting innocent victims of
the crisis, both internally displaced
within Syria and in neighboring
countries. If adopted, the resolution
calls for the President to submit the new
humanitarian strategy to relevant Senate
committees within 90 days.
It is clear by now that the
measures taken to try and end Bashar
al-Assads brutality against the
Syrian people have failed,
said Rubio . As long as
the Assad regime continues to ignore
deadlines and break promises without
fear of consequence, millions of Syrian
civilians, including children, will
continue to suffer and even be
indiscriminately killed. The
administration should act quickly to
propose a new strategy that includes
concrete actions to increase pressure
on Assad instead of giving him more
room to maneuver and commit these
atrocities.
Constituent Casework Corner
June is a 90 year old widow living in
an assisted living facility in South
Florida. Her husband was a veteran, so
she applied for widows pension
benefits in early 2013. Since her
application was still pending, she
contacted Senator Rubios office
for assistance. A member of the staff
contacted the Veterans Administration
(VA) and found out they needed a copy of
the late veterans discharge, which
the family misplaced. Senator
Rubios staff then contacted the
National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)
to obtain the document. Once received, it
was faxed to the VA and her application
was approved.
