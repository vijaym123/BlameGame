BREAKING: HOUSE REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE BUDGET TO DESTROY MEDICARE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
We don&rsquo;t have much time, so we&rsquo;ll make this quick:
This morning House Republicans released their budget. It&rsquo;s not good. In fact, it&rsquo;s nearly an exact copy of Paul Ryan&rsquo;s Budget from last year &ndash; cuts to Medicare and defunding the Affordable Care Act all included.
Don&rsquo;t worry: millionaires and billionaires get their opulent tax breaks. Here&rsquo;s what makes this year different. This year Republicans have control over both Houses of Congress. That means this horrible budget could actually pass.
We are launching the Protect the Middle Class Emergency Fund to stop them. We want to get $50,000 in it before the end of today to show Republicans that this budget will not survive.
Will you step up?
