Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Russia's Interference in Ukraine Must Stop
On July 17, tragedy struck over the skies of Ukraine and changed the course of many lives in just moments. Malaysia
Airlines Flight 17, traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down killing all 298 passengers and crew members. The plane was taken down by a
surface-to-air missile over the unstable area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Secretary of State John Kerry has said that
there is evidence that Russia supplied the separatists with the weapon used to shoot down Flight MH17.
The treacherous acts of this group and the destruction left behind are deplorable.
In response, I signed on as a
cosponsor of a resolution in the House of Representatives condemning as terrorists the Ukrainian separatists, illegally occupying the city of Donetsk
and the surrounding territory, for shooting down a civilian passenger airliner. The resolution, which has gained bipartisan support, also condemns the
government of Russia for supplying the arms used in this deadly attack.
Russian President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s support of the separatists in
eastern Ukraine and the Russian government&rsquo;s possible direct involvement in the MH17 incident is extremely alarming.
Russia is no stranger to conflict and under Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s leadership has only increased
tensions with much of the Western world. Russia&rsquo;s aggressive actions and continued interference in Ukraine are unacceptable. The United States
needs to present an effective foreign policy to confront conflict in this region. As we continue to learn more about Flight MH17, the U.S. must work
with the international community to support the Ukrainian government and pressure Russia to take a step back.
I urge the U.S. and the international
community to condemn Russia for their actions. Our nation&rsquo;s thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this terrible
tragedy.
