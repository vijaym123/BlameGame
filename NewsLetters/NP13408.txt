2013 Year in Review
Dear Friend,
Happy Holidays! As 2013 comes to a close, I am delighted to present you
with my "2013 Year in Review," which will be the first-ever iBook
published by a Member of Congress. An iBook is like an electronic book,
yet allows for interactive features such as embedded videos,
interactive charts and audio files. Just click on the image below, or
visit http://honda.house.gov/news/2013-year-in-review to learn more!
2013 Year in Review: Learn more about my work in Washington!
*	Providing services to the residents of Alameda and Santa Clara
Counties;
*	Strengthening Social Security;
*	Advancing STEM education bills to support the innovative
Silicon Valley economy;
*	Rebuilding manufacturing and supporting the development of new
technologies;
*	...and much more
!
In Washington, we faced contentious fights over gun violence reduction,
virulent opposition to the Affordable Care Act that ultimately resulted
in a government shutdown, and an ongoing battle over whether austerity
or investment is best policy for our economy and nation. There were
also, however, moments of hope for a new year. I continued the fight to
strengthen and enhance Social Security, offered multiple proposals to
improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
education to provide the skilled workforce necessary to grow the
innovation economy of Silicon Valley, and authored legislation to
rebuild manufacturing and support the development of new technologies.

It is an honor and privilege to serve you in Congress. I work hard each
day for the constituents of California's 17th district, and will
continue to fight for good jobs, a strong innovation economy, and even
greater educational opportunities for our children. I hope you enjoy
reading these highlights of what my staff and I have been up to this
year, both in Washington and here in Santa Clara and Alameda Counties.
Please don't hesitate to contact my office to tell me what's on your
mind or if you need assistance with a federal agency - remember, I'm
here for you! As always, feel free to reach out to me via email and
social media.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress
