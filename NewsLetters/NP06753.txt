Dear Friend,
During my time in Congress, there have been few
issues more important to me than setting a tone of civility and working
across the aisle to get things done.
I am proud to be, by nearly
every measure, the most independent member of Congress and the most
willing to look beyond partisan politics to focus on solutions.
I
am always looking for likeminded colleagues to work with, and I have
mentioned before that there are other members who share this broader
goal.
There have been many discussions over the last year among
members committed to the idea of looking beyond partisanship.
Some of these discussions have centered on legislative proposals that
are immediate opportunities for Congress to pass commonsense reforms
ideas like thoughtful budget savings, reasonable regulatory reforms or
ways to streamline inefficiencies in government.
To date,
nine bills have been put forth with support from these members and I
am proud to be a cosponsor of each one.
A few highlights
among my bipartisan legislative priorities include:
HR 310 , No Budget No Pay: if Congress cannot pass a
budget and annual spending bills in a timely way, Members of Congress
shouldnt receive pay.
HR 2506 , Dont Duplicate, Consolidate: the Government
Accountability Office has identified a number of duplicative programs in the
federal government that should be combined.
HR 2689 , Wasted Energy, Wasted Dollars: allow the
private sector to use the expertise in identifying energy savings in
federal buildings, and pay for it with the realized
savings.
HR 2590 , 21 st
Century
Healthcare for Heroes: the Department of Defense and the Department of
Veterans Affairs should merge electronic records systems for better, and
more efficient, service.
I am honored to serve in
Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours.
As your
representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues
affecting you and our community.
Please
let me
know
areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide
you with additional information.
I value your ideas and look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
