" (H.R. 2767) this week.
Airports are the gateway to commerce throughout the world and the front door to the communities they connect for millions of passengers who visit the United States each year. It defies logic that we would allow anyone other than law enforcement officials to carry a loaded gun within an airport.
A recent stunt by a man carrying a military-style, semiautomatic AR-15 rifle
meant for the battlefield into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport only highlights the need for this common-sense legislation.

The bill would prohibit people other than local law enforcement and Homeland Security employees from carrying guns - concealed or otherwise - in airport terminals, lobbies, baggage claim areas, ticket counters and outside in pick-up and drop-off areas.
Law-abiding gun owners would still be able to carry guns if they are unloaded and contained in clearly marked, locked cases. Airports would also be required to post signs that clearly indicate they are gun-free zones.
If passed and signed into law, my bill would expand Homeland Security's jurisdiction to include non-secure areas of airports and would take precedence over any city or state laws that allow weapons in any airports nationwide. The gun ban would include public transportation stops within airports if the gun owner departs the transit station at an airport.
I'm proud to have the support of my Georgia colleagues, Reps. John Lewis and David Scott, and 16 other members of Congress from across the country. I also have the support of several national organizations, including: The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, The Violence Policy Center, Center for American Violence, States United to Prevent Gun Violence, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence and GunSense Georgia Coalition.

Dear
F riends,
Seeking to make airports around the nation safer for the general public and the law enforcement officers who patrol them, I introduced the &#8220; Airport
Security Act of 2015 &#8221; (H.R. 2767) this week.
Airports are the gateway to commerce throughout the world and the front door to the communities they connect for millions of passengers who visit the United States each year. It defies logic that we would allow anyone other than law enforcement
officials to carry a loaded gun within an airport.
A recent stunt by
a man carrying a military-style, semiautomatic AR-15 rifle
meant for the battlefield into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport only highlights the need for this common-sense legislation.
