Americans Should Be Able To Keep Their Health Plans Without Penalty
Speaking before the American Medical Association in 2009, President
Obama stated, 'If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your
doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to
keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter
what.' He didn't stop there; he kept on making that promise as recently
as this fall.
As clear as day, we are now seeing a broken promise, made at the
expense of millions of people in Florida and across the nation who are
opening letters from health insurance carriers to find their policies
cancelled. Americans are angry and they have a right to be. One of my
constituents Bryan Joseph Busse, of Jacksonville, is a small business
owner, father of four, and a Democrat.
Bryan wrote to me after his policy was cancelled to express his
disappointment stating, 'I was told that the administration would work
for the middle class and small businessman. I am both, and have never
been so directly and adversely affected by the U.S. government in my
life.'
On November 7, the president apologized, saying 'I am sorry that they
are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got
from me.' And yesterday (11/14), the president offered an
administrative fix.
But with the healthhcare.gov website crashing and only 106,000 signups
to date - a fraction of the participants necessary to sustain the
program - I think the president has zero credibility on this issue.
My reaction: we don't need another political promise; we need
fundamental, long-term change that puts patients, not the government
first. As we work toward that goal, I voted today (11/15) for the Keep
Your Plan Act - a one-page bill that has some teeth in it. The
legislation, which passed the House by a vote of 261-157, will allow
health plan currently available on the individual market to continue
and Americans will have the opportunity to continue to enroll in those
plans without any penalty.
Americans deserve to keep what they have been promised. That is one
reason among many why I have been against Obamacare from the outset and
have voted more than 40 times to repeal, replace, or defund it. The
health care law was bad policy yesterday, is bad policy today, and will
be bad policy tomorrow. Going forward I will remain committed in the
fight against this disastrous law.

Americans
Should
Be
Able
To
Keep
Their
Health
Plans
Without
Penalty
Speaking
before
the
American
Medical
Association
in
2009,
President
Obama
stated,
&#8216;If
you
like
your
doctor,
you
will
be
able
to
keep
your
doctor,
period.
If
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you&#8217;ll
be
able
to
keep
your
health
care
plan,
period.
No
one
will
take
it
away,
no
matter
what.&#8217;
He
didn&#8217;t
stop
there;
he
kept
on
making
that
promise
as
recently
as
this
fall.
As
clear
as
day,
we
are
now
seeing
a
broken
promise,
made
at
the
expense
of
millions
of
people
in
Florida
and
across
the
nation
who
are
opening
letters
from
health
insurance
carriers
to
find
their
policies
cancelled.
Americans
are
angry
and
they
have
a
right
to
be.
One
of
my
constituents
Bryan
Joseph
Busse,
of
Jacksonville,
is
a
small
business
owner,
father
of
four,
and
a
Democrat.
Bryan
wrote
to
me
after
his
policy
was
cancelled
to
express
his
disappointment
stating,
&#8216;I
was
told
that
the
administration
would
work
for
the
middle
class
and
small
businessman.
I
am
both,
and
have
never
been
so
directly
and
adversely
affected
by
the
U.S.
government
in
my
life.&#8217;
On
November
7,
the
president
apologized,
saying
&#8216;I
am
sorry
that
they
are
finding
themselves
in
this
situation
based
on
assurances
they
got
from
me.&#8217;
And
yesterday
(11/14),
the
president
offered
an
administrative
fix.
But
with
the
healthhcare.gov
website
crashing
and
only
106,000
signups
to
date
-
a
fraction
of
the
participants
necessary
to
sustain
the
program
-
I
think
the
president
has
zero
credibility
on
this
issue.
My
reaction:
we
don&#8217;t
need
another
political
promise;
we
need
fundamental,
long-term
change
that
puts
patients,
not
the
government
first.
As
we
work
toward
that
goal,
I
voted
today
(11/15)
for
the
Keep
Your
Plan
Act
&#8211;
a
one-page
bill
that
has
some
teeth
in
it.
The
legislation,
which
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
261-157,
will
allow
health
plan
currently
available
on
the
individual
market
to
continue
and
Americans
will
have
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
enroll
in
those
plans
without
any
penalty.
Americans
deserve
to
keep
what
they
have
been
promised.
That
is
one
reason
among
many
why
I
have
been
against
Obamacare
from
the
outset
and
have
voted
more
than
40
times
to
repeal,
replace,
or
defund
it.
The
health
care
law
was
bad
policy
yesterday,
is
bad
policy
today,
and
will
be
bad
policy
tomorrow.
Going
forward
I
will
remain
committed
in
the
fight
against
this
disastrous
law.
