Friend,
Today we honor our nation's teachers as May 6, 2014, is National Teacher Appreciation Day.
Few other professionals touch as many peoples lives as teachers do.
As a consequence of the recession and ensuing budget shortfalls, our nation lost 300,000 teaching jobs from June 2009 to August 2012.
The loss of teachers has led to larger class sizes and a reduction in course offerings.
The country is already facing a teacher shortage; its estimated that public schools will need more than 280,000 new math and science teachers by 2015, especially those in low-income school districts.
Our education system is the crown jewel of American infrastructure and the key to our long-term economic growth and our competitiveness, and teachers are the backbone of that education system.
Our children deserve dedicated and qualified teachers, and those individuals deserve respect and fair compensation.
That's why I support innovative efforts to provide underserved areas with talented, passionate individuals to engage our students.
In addition, I support strong investment in education and oppose efforts to systematically divert funding away from our schools.
Our schools are the heart of our communities, and we must all work together to make our schools even better!
Make sure to thank a teacher today, tomorrow, and every day.
Sincerely,
