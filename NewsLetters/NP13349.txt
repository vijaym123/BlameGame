A Visit from a Special Secret Santa...
From my family to yours, I would like to wish everyone a very Happy Holiday Season!
The holidays are a time for peace, love, spending time with family, and for giving thanks for the gifts and blessings we have received throughout the year.
This Christmas, our family received two of the greatest gifts we could ask for- the birth of our first great grandchild and the safe homecoming of our grandson-in-law from Afghanistan.
I wanted to share this special video with you. Just a few days before our granddaughter was due with her first child, our grandson-in-law was granted leave to come home.
With the help of friends and family, he pulled off a fantastic Christmas surprise.
Our first great grandchild, Londyn Blaire Dalby, was born perfectly healthy to her proud parents Brittney and Ryan on a wonderful Sunday morning this December.
I would like to extend a special thank you to Ryan and all the brave men and women who are serving our country.
There are many soldiers who are spending the holidays overseas- our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we are forever grateful.
As this year draws to an end and we all gather among our friends and family, we take pause to remember the importance of each other, our faiths, our communities and the blessings that surround us.
Although we continue to face tremendously tough obstacles, I remain confident that together we will forge ahead, bonded by our commonalities, not torn apart by our differences.
Wishing you a joyous time with your friends, family and loved ones!
All the best and Season Greetings,
Buck
