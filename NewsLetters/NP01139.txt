Friend,
We are $2519 away from completing our match
and we can&rsquo;t afford to waste this opportunity.
Even donations of $5 or $10 make a HUGE difference,
especially since they will be matched dollar-for-dollar by our group of supporters.
Can you give $5, $25 or whatever you can before our deadline at midnight tomorrow? Your gift will be doubled.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $25 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in other amount immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Washington isn&rsquo;t going to change by itself and we need leaders like Ami to create the change our country desperately needs .
If we can hit our goal by midnight tomorrow, we will be one step closer to ensuring Ami can continue his mission to make Washington work for the people.
Stand with Ami and let&rsquo;s move our country forward.
Only a little over $2500 to go.
Will you chip in?
Thanks again,
Team Bera
P.S. Remember, with our match, your contribution will be doubled-- $25 = $50, $50 = $100, and so on.
