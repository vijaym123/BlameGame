Working Towards a FY2014 Budget
Last week
, I told
you about how Congress is working on a plan to fund the government for
the rest of FY2014.
Not much has changed since then.
The Budget
Conference Committee is still discussing a final plan, working towards
their December 13th deadline.
I'm hopeful that they're making
progress.
This is a good start, but to tackle our $17 trillion in debt
we'll need to look at entitlement reform.
I also want to go back to
the traditional appropriations process - where Congress debates and
passes separate appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal
year so that we don't run into a threat of a shutdown or a rushed last
minute deal.
I'll keep you updated on how we do at meeting that goal.
Farm Bill Progress
The four principals of the Farm Bill Conference Committee - the
chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Agriculture
Committees - held a series of meetings last week to work on a final
2013 Farm Bill.
Based on my discussions with House Agriculture Chairman Lucas, I'm
optimistic that we're moving in the right direction.
It looks like
we'll reach a final deal on a 5-year Farm Bill - if not by the end of
the year, at the beginning of January.
My priorities are still to pass
a long-term Farm Bill to give our farmers and ranchers certainty.
These people are literally feeding the world.
Farming is an important
part of the American economy, but it's also an important part of our
way of life.
I spoke a bit more about our progress on the Farm Bill, including some
of the policies included in the House version to protect American
taxpayers from abuses in the food stamp program, last week on C-SPAN's
Washington Journal.
You can watch the video here
, or you can read the Washington Times' article
about it here

Innovation Act
Last week, I voted to protect small businesses from patent trolls.
Patent trolls have been around for a long time, targeting American
businesses through frivolous lawsuits.
You can learn how they extort
by watching this short video
.
According to
the Texas Hotel & Lodging Association
, patent troll lawsuits have tripled for small
businesses since 2011, costing our economy $80 billion each year.
I think small businesses should be able to spend their resources on
creating jobs and funding new ideas - not struggling to pay legal fees
and settlements.
That's why I voted to pass the Innovation Act
last Thursday to end abusive patent litigation.
Action Item: the Kids First Research Act
This week the House will vote on a key bill to make sure your tax
dollars are going to worthwhile programs - not perks for politicians.
The Kids First Research Act
eliminates funding for
the President Election Campaign Fund - a total of $126 million - and
instead allocates those funds towards pediatric cancer research.
It
sends your tax dollars to search for a cure for cancer instead of
funding big political conventions.
It doesn't change the amount of
taxes you pay - just where your tax dollars go.
I've always supported
cutting government spending and balancing the federal budget.
But I
think it's a good start to cut inefficient spending and target the
money we do spend on programs that can make a real difference in
American lives.

Innovation
Act
Last
week,
I
voted
to
protect
small
businesses
from
patent
trolls.
Patent
trolls
have
been
around
for
a
long
time,
targeting
American
businesses
through
frivolous
lawsuits.
You
can
learn
how
they
extort
by
watching
this
short
video .
According
to
the
Texas
Hotel
&amp;
Lodging
Association ,
patent
troll
lawsuits
have
tripled
for
small
businesses
since
2011,
costing
our
economy
$80
billion
each
year.
I
think
small
businesses
should
be
able
to
spend
their
resources
on
creating
jobs
and
funding
new
ideas
&#8211;
not
struggling
to
pay
legal
fees
and
settlements.
That&#8217;s
why
I
voted
to
pass
the
Innovation
Act
last
Thursday
to
end
abusive
patent
litigation.
Action
Item:
the
Kids
First
Research
Act
This
week
the
House
will
vote
on
a
key
bill
to
make
sure
your
tax
dollars
are
going
to
worthwhile
programs
&#8211;
not
perks
for
politicians.
The
Kids
First
Research
Act
eliminates
funding
for
the
President
Election
Campaign
Fund
&#8211;
a
total
of
$126
million
&#8211;
and
instead
allocates
those
funds
towards
pediatric
cancer
research.
It
sends
your
tax
dollars
to
search
for
a
cure
for
cancer
instead
of
funding
big
political
conventions.
It
doesn&#8217;t
change
the
amount
of
taxes
you
pay
&#8211;
just
where
your
tax
dollars
go.
I&#8217;ve
always
supported
cutting
government
spending
and
balancing
the
federal
budget.
But
I
think
it&#8217;s
a
good

to
cut
inefficient
spending
and
target
the
money
we
do
spend
on
programs
that
can
