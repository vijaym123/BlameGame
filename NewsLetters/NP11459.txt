Dear Friend:
I am deeply sad that
our beloved community has suffered a tragedy this week, but feel
blessed knowing there are so many people who have stepped up to provide
assistance to their neighbors during this difficult time. I am confident
that we will become stronger and united as we work together to
rebuild our community and heal our spirits.
Gas
Explosion :
While we have to wait for the findings of the
National Transportation Safety Board teams investigation, it is apparent
that poor and outdated infrastructure was a contributing factor
in this catastrophic gas explosion.
For too long, Congress
has ignored the urgent need to provide funding that directly impacts
the health, safety, and welfare of the public. I strongly support
President Obama's FY2015 Budget proposal which calls for critical
investment in upgrading America's infrastructure. Before any other community
across the country suffers great destruction, we must commit to shoring
up our 20th century infrastructure that simply cannot keep up with the
demands of the 21st century.
Extending
Unemployment Insurance : The Senate finally reached an agreement to
extend unemployment insurance benefits to the 2 million jobless
Americans who have not received their checks since the program expired
December of last year.
New York City residents have struggled during
this economic recovery.
Congress should be doing everything we
can to help New Yorkers and the nation get back on their feet.
While this bill renews the benefits only until the end of May, it will
give a major boost.
I am urging Speaker Boehner to bring the
Senate bill to the House floor as quickly as possible. The bill satisfies
his requirements (it is fully paid for and includes provisions to help
the long-term unemployed find jobs) so there should be no reason for
him to delay the vote. I will keep fighitng to renew the benefits,
raise the federal minimum wage, and to pass my bill to extend the EITC for
childless workers.
Affordable Care Act :
For the 51st time, the Republicans made another senseless attempt
to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. Yet my Democratic
Colleagues and I are undeterred. Latest figures show that 4.2 million have
enrolled in Health Insurance Marketplace plans by March 1
including
943,000 who enrolled in February alone.
Young adult enrollment
accounted for 27 percent of enrollments in February. As the proud
sponsor of President Obama's signature law, I am focusing on reaching the
uninsured and encouraging my constituents to enroll in affordable,
quality coverage in the Marketplaces or in Medicaid. To learn more about
your healthcare options and receive enrollment assistance, be sure to
attend my healthcare event on 3/18 Tuesday from 6-8pm at Taino
Towers Gymnasium, 240 E. 123 St - New York, NY
10035.

MY OPED IN TIME
MAGAZINE
" According to the Center for an Urban Futures recently released report, New
York Citys gas mains are on average 56 years old, with most of them
made of materials that are highly leak-prone. Altogether, the City needs
almost $47 billion worth of infrastructure upgrades by 2020. It is
costly, but we will pay a higher and terrible price if we ignore
it."
