Supporting Our
Warfighters
6/12/15
Following the passage of the 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations
bill, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following
statement:
"As a member of the Armed Services
Committee leadership team and a staunch supporter of our brave men
and women in uniform, I was honored to support the 2016 DOD
Appropriations bill. Included in this bill are many good things for our military
members and their families: a 2.3% pay raise, a fully-funded housing
allowance, funding for healthcare programs and suicide and sexual
assault prevention efforts, and full funding for the readiness and training
needed before our sons and daughters are sent into harm's
way.
As the Vice Chairman of the
Strategic Forces Subcommittee and as a senior member of the Armed
Services Committee, I receive classified briefings clearly showing that we
live in a dangerous world; one in which our interests and ideals are
under attack on an almost daily basis. That's why fully supporting our
military is the right thing to do, the moral thing to do, and why it
is a responsibility I take very
seriously.
By considering this bill as a platform for
eliminating budget caps and forcing a government shutdown, Senate
Democrats are making a mockery of our military. Their leader has even
called this funding bill a, "waste of time." It is never a waste of time
to step forward and do the right thing by supporting our military,
their families, and loved ones by giving them every resource they need to
successfully complete their
missions."
