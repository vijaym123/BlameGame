Welcome, Senator Walsh
Dear David,
Yesterday, John Walsh was sworn in as the 22nd U.S. Senator in Montana&rsquo;s history.
Senator Walsh has big shoes to fill.
Replacing Max Baucus &mdash; a Montana legend &mdash; will not be easy.
But I know John is up to the task.
You see, John has spent a lifetime serving Montana.
He&rsquo;s a Butte native, a Carroll College graduate, and a three decade veteran of Montana&rsquo;s National Guard.
While in the Guard, John commanded over 500 Montana Guardsmen in Iraq.
In fact, he is the first combat veteran of that war to serve in the U.S. Senate.
John knows what it takes to lead, a quality missing from too many lawmakers in Washington, D.C.
After his service overseas, John continued to serve Montana as our state&rsquo;s Adjutant General and Lieutenant Governor.
Montanans continue to recognize Senator Walsh as a man of strong character who knows the importance of getting the job done.
John comes to Washington with a willingness to work across the aisle and a commitment to governing seriously to move our country forward.
As someone who has defended our nation and led Montanans into battle, John knows how important it is to work together and to put Montanans first.
That&rsquo;s a trait I know he&rsquo;ll bring with him to the U.S. Senate.
I am proud to serve alongside John as together we fight for all Montanans and bring more Montana common-sense to Washington.
Best,
