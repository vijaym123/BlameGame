The National September 11 Memorial Museum is Officially
Dedicated
Yesterday, the National September 11 Memorial
Museum was officially dedicated in Lower Manhattan.
The memory of
that terrible day in 2001, and of all the people who were killed in the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, United
Flight 93, and so many from New Jersey, is never far from my
thoughts.
Our country, and our state, suffered grievous loss on
that day.
We must never forget the events of 9/11.
We must
always remember those who died and the people who mourn them
still.
And we must forever maintain our determination to protect our
country from anyone who would do America harm
again.
Information about planning a visit to the museum can be found
here .
Americas Economy Continues to Limp
AlongJust Barely
Its not news any longer that the
recovery from the last recession (which ended more than five years
ago) has been exceedingly weak.
It is expected that when the
numbers for the first quarter of this year are reported, the economy will
have only grown by 0.10 percent.
This must-read
article
from
Forbes ,
titled, What Obama's Growth Recession Is Stealing From
Your Wallet, does an excellent job explaining why the economy is growing so
slowly, what that means to Americas families, and what should be done
to get economic growth back on
track.
Obamacare: One Costly Disaster After
Another
Although President Obama has declared victory and told everybody that the
Affordable Care Act is a great success, the facts continue to contradict
the Presidents optimistic, and completely inaccurate
assessment.
Earlier this week
Politico
reported
that ,
Nearly half a billion
dollars in federal money has been spent developing four state Obamacare
exchanges that are now in shambles
and the final price tag for
salvaging them may go sharply higher.
Just when it seems
everything that could go wrong must already have happened, something else
turns up.
And its not over yet.
When the employer mandate
kicks in, things will really get bad.
Pomp,
Cirucmstance, and Conflict
Over the next several weeks,
colleges, universities and high schools across the country will be holding
commencement ceremonies, which almost always include a commencement
speaker.
Theres an old joke that begin many commencement
addresses: A commencement speaker is like the body at an Irish wake.
The organizers need you for the party, but they dont actually expect
you to say much.
Unfortunately, however, this humored
observation is becoming increasingly true on college campuses around the
nation, including right here in New Jersey.
The growing practice
of small groups of faculty and students protesting the presence of
various speakers, often leading to their withdrawal, is an unfortunate
trend. In fact, such short-sighted demonstrations by a handful of faculty
and students at Rutgers University prompted former Secretary of State
Condoleeza Rice to withdraw as this years commencement
speaker.
In this case, the Rutgers community was denied a valuable
opportunity to hear the Secretarys perceptive views on world affairs and her
own downright compelling life story.
A college campus should
be a place where ideas are vigorously and respectfully debated, and
where people of accomplishment can share their own stories of success to
inspire the rising generation of leaders.
On this subject, this
article
from the
Wall Street
Journal
should be of
interest.
Salute: Endangered Species Act Poster Grand Prize Winner Amy
Feng
Today is Endangered Species Day, and I cannot think of a
more fitting time to congratulate Amy Feng, a 16-year-old student at
Livingston High School, for winning the Grand Prize in a nationwide
poster contest sponsored by the Endangered Species Coalition
(ESC).
She recently visited my office with her poster depicting a sea
otter and it was easy to see why she won.
Click
here
to see a photo of her visit on my Facebook page (and while
youre there, you might want to Like the page to keep current with my
activities).
Heres a great
video
of
Amy receiving the award and talking about what inspired her
poster.
Salute: Congratulations to Max Kleinman on
his retirement
Congratulations to Max Kleinman
upon his retirement at the head of the Jewish Federation of Greater
MetroWest New Jersey.
A distinguished and beloved leader, Maxs
vision and philanthropic contributions will continue to make New Jersey a
better place to live, work and raise a family for many years to
come.
Salute: Carmine Biase, Roseland Senior
Citizen of the Year
