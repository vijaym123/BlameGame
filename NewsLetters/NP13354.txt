Dear Friend,
As we approach the holidays and round out the year, I am reminded to
give thanks for the great community I serve.
I want to thank each of you for all you do to make our community such a
great place to live, work and enjoy.
Last week, I gave my first commencement speech at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University. I told the graduates that a great person
strengthens the community they make their home. It is incumbent upon
every individual to get involved in the world around them and make an
impact. Click HERE
to read my speech.
As we approach the new year, that is my challenge to you - to be great,
to strengthen your community. As busy as you may find yourself, please
remember that a great person makes it a priority to give back with
their time, their talents and their resources.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from my family to yours.
Sincerely,
Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S.
Member of Congress
