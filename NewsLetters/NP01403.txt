VISITING DC
April 18, 2015
This
week, my efforts in the Senate were focused on education as the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee worked on
legislation to update the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). I
was pleased to rectify an inequity that has plagued North Carolinas
low income students for several years.
During the week, I was able to fix federal education
funding that for the last 15 years has not only shortchanged North
Carolinas teachers and schools, but also the low-income students they
serve across our state.
Because Congress didnt have the courage to
fix this problem in 2001, funding that was intended to support
low-income students and their teachers has gone to more affluent parts of
the country, leaving North Carolinas poorest children without the money
they deserve.
For North Carolina this means we will have at
least $23.5 million more every year
an increase of 47% - that otherwise
would have went to wealthier parts of our country.
After years
of pretending to steer limited federal dollars to our poorest
children, we are now actually getting that funding into the communities that
need it most. My amendment was approved on a vote of 12 to 10 and the
legislation passed by a vote of 22-0.

This week the Senate continued the budget
process by debating and voting on various provisions that will be
included in the budget agreement with the House. One such provision ismy
student loan amendment, based on
the Repay Act . It
received an unanimous vote of 97-0 to include it in the budget
agreement. This is the second time my amendment with Senator King has passed
with overwhelming bipartisan support. Americans are tired of seeing
their hard-earned tax dollars go to waste in a student loan program that
doesnt adequately serve the interests of those students it is
intended to help. The Repay Act is a common-sense step forward to address the
deficiencies in our student loan programs.
On Tuesday, the Air Force released their
mandatory
Report on C-130 Force Structure
to Congress.
Their report was a
complete disappointment ,
outlining the Air Forces plan to shutter the 440th Airlift Wing at Fort
Bragg. Closing one of the countrys unique training and support
elements for our airborne forces and special operators would be a terrible
strategic decision. I will continue to work with the North Carolina
delegation and my colleagues in Congress to find a solution that preserves
the readiness of our critical airborne, rapid deployment
capability.
On Thursday , I was proud to introduce
The Military Corridor Transportation Improvement Act of 2015 with
Senator Tillis (R-NC) and Congressman G.K. Butterfield (D-NC-01). This
bipartisan bill amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act (ISTEA) of 1991 to ensure that the US-70 Corridor in North Carolina
would become part of the Interstate system once it is fully upgraded
to interstate standards.
This legislation will make it possible to refurbish and expand the
highway system in North Carolina by identifying these highways as high
priority corridors. Improvements to this infrastructure is critically
important to local communities and will make this high transit
corridor safer, faster and more modern, ensuring that North Carolinas
economy continues to be one of the most vibrant in the country. I welcome
this needed legislation and know that North Carolinians do as well. To

As you may know, Congress
was in a state work period for the past two weeks, which allowed me
to spend time visiting different parts of North Carolina. I traveled to
Wake, Guilford, Forsyth, Craven, Onslow, Pitt, Wilson, Rowan,
Kannapolis, Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Ashe, and Watauga counties, giving me an
opportunity to visit countless businesses, join citizen groups
meetings, and speak to many North Carolinians about issues important to them.
