I was very pleased to see today that President Obama is issuing an Executive Order to de-militarize our local police forces. Many of the recommendations in his order are reflected in my bill: The Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2015. For more, click HERE .
I'm also looking forward to attend the CBC TECH 2020 forum -
a new initiative aimed at increasing African-American inclusion in the tech sector. For more, click HERE .
Lastly, every year I look forward to "Foster Youth Shadow Day." This Wednesday, I'll be spending some quality time with young people who have been through the foster care system. For more, click HERE .

I want to thank everyone who came out for our three town hall meetings in Rockdale, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties from May 5-7.
It was especially good to hear what is on people's minds. Listening to constituents and allowing them the opportunity to express their thoughts and concerns is very important to me. There was wide-ranging dialogue around transportation funding, marriage equality, taxes, affordable health care, the budget, trade and education - just to name a few of the topics covered. Coming soon, we'll be holding town halls in Newton County and north-central DeKalb. I'll let everyone know in this e-letter when and where those meetings will be held.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES: More than 120 small business owners attended my forum for Disadvantaged Small Businesses or DBEs on "How to Do Business with the Federal Government" on Friday, May 8 at Georgia Piedmont Technical College. It was important for me to a hold a forum helping our local small businesses during National Small Business Week. We know small businesses are the engines that drive our economy and create jobs. I want to do all I can to ensure small businesses get a fair shot at federal government contracts. For more, click HERE .

MILITARY ACADEMY NOMINATIONS: I'm honored to announce the names of the 21 Fourth District students who have been nominated to attend a U.S. Service Academy - Military Academy (West Point), Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, and Merchant Marine Academy. This year so far, 15 students have received appointments to attend a Service Academy, a record for our office. For more, click HERE

SIMPLFYING TAXES: Last week, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Rep. Mike Bishop (MI-08), the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2015 . The bipartisan and bicameral legislation -- introduced in the Senate by Sens. John Thune and Sherrod Brown -- simplifies state income tax requirements for employees who work multiple days per year outside the state where they live. For more, click HERE .
USA FREEDOME ACT: I voted for H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act, which ends the bulk collection of data and enhances civil liberties protections. As an original cosponsor of the legislation, I applaud my colleagues for working together to craft this compromise. While it's difficult to strike the perfect balance between individual privacy rights versus national security, I believe this bill moves us in the right direction. For more, click HERE .
