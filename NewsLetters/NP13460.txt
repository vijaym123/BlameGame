Dear Friend,
Pennsylvania's communities rely on the thousands of men and women who
generously serve their fellow citizens by volunteering as firefighters
and emergency medical technicians. In Congress, I have fought to ensure
Pennsylvania's firefighters and first responders have the tools and
resources they need to save lives and respond as safely and effectively
as possible. That is why I am urging the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
to protect Pennsylvania's volunteer fire departments from an
unnecessary and potentially harmful health insurance burden.
This week, I called on IRS Acting Commissioner Daniel I. Werfel to act
quickly to ensure that volunteer fire departments across the country
have clarity regarding the application of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
to volunteer firefighters. Some fire companies with more than 50
volunteer firefighters have expressed concerns about whether they are
required to provide health insurance for these volunteers under the
health care law.
Rep. Schwartz meeting with volunteers of Fort Washington Fire Co. No.
1 to highlight a federal grant for critical safety equipment
In Pennsylvania, 97 percent of fire departments rely exclusively or
mostly on volunteers, according to the 2012 National Fire Department
Census. While many volunteers receive nominal benefits, these
individuals typically serve their communities without the expectation
of receiving significant compensation or health care coverage from the
departments for which they volunteer.
Congress clearly intended ACA insurance requirements to apply to
employees, not volunteers. With already tight budgets, many communities
simply cannot afford the burden of providing health care benefits to
volunteers. This could create a dangerous situation in which
communities are forced to eliminate critical volunteer positions,
endangering the safety and welfare of their residents.
Pennsylvania's volunteer firefighters and emergency medical workers
already make incredible sacrifices on our behalf. I will keep fighting
to ensure that the IRS quickly addresses this confusion over the health
care law.

support Pennsylvania's firefighters and first responders.
