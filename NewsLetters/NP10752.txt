Fighting Reckless Spending
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The irresponsible fiscal policies of this
administration have caused the national debt to grow at an astonishing
rate, from $10 trillion to over $17 trillion in just five years. I have
opposed the efforts of President Obama and his predecessors to increase
spending at every turn.
Below, you will find a short summary of the
actions I have taken to stop the government's reckless spending habits:
*	I am the only member of Congress to vote against every increase
in the debt limit over the past 10 years.
*	I am the only member of Congress to vote against every
deficit-raising, debt-filled budget bill over the last 10 years.
These
budget bills raised the federal debt from $8 trillion to over $17
trillion.
*	I am the only member of Congress to vote against every foreign
aid spending bill over the past 18 years.
*	I have voted for every balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution.
*	I voted against the bailouts of Wall Street and Detroit.
*	I voted against President Obama's trillion dollar 'stimulus'
package.
*	I was one of only eight members of Congress to vote against the
pork-filled 2005 highway bill, which included the infamous "Bridge to
Nowhere."
*	I voted against Obamacare, the president's costly government
takeover of our healthcare system, and cosponsored every bill aimed at
repealing or defunding the law.
*	I voted against the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which
- prior to Obamacare - was the biggest entitlement expansion since the
"Great Society."
Thank you for taking the time to read about some of Congressman Jones'
work for the Third District.
