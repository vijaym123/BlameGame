We didn&rsquo;t think Rush Limbaugh could get worse, but this time he has gone too far.
During a rant about rape on college campuses, Rush Limbaugh said:
&ldquo;[According to Ohio State policy,] consent must be freely given, can be withdrawn anytime, and the absence of "no" does not mean "yes."
How many guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that no means yes if you know how to spot it?
... Are these [policies] not lawsuits waiting to happen? &rdquo; -- Rush Limbaugh, yesterday
Make no mistake, Rush Limbaugh is ADVOCATING a tolerance of rape.
It is Limbaugh&rsquo;s type of thinking that leads to an American woman being sexually assaulted every two minutes.
And Limbaugh will continue to perpetuate a culture of sexual assault until his advertisers pull their advertising from his disgusting show. Sign your name and demand that companies pull their advertising from Rush's program&gt;&gt;
