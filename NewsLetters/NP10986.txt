Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I read this week
by Charles Koch titled "I'm Fighting to Restore a Free Society
."
Koch, and his brother, are frequently used as boogeymen by the far
ideological left because of their willingness to combat the influence
of billionaire liberal donors.
The truth is the Kochs are fighting to
protect the Constitution, free enterprise, and individual freedom for
and for future generations.
They are fighting, as Benjamin Franklin
ordered, to Keep the Republic.
We share these beliefs, and they run
counter to the agenda of many liberals.
Much of what Koch writes in this piece are the very things I've been
saying since I first ran for office.
Koch is spot on when he says a
"free society is based on a vision of respect for people and what they
value."
We should respect people and their beliefs.
That also means
giving people the freedom to run their own lives.
When empowered,
people are able to make the right decisions for themselves and can
determine their own lives far better than government can.
Mr. Koch's observations are spot-on and I encourage you to read them
yourself before Harry Reid wastes more time on the Senate floor
berating fellow Americans fighting for liberty,
freedom, success, and our founding documents are.
His remarks were
even labeled "radical" by ABC News.

Empowering People to Live Better Lives - House FY15 Budget
This week, I joined with my House Budget Committee
colleagues in introducing, and passing through committee
, a budget
resolution for Fiscal Year 2015 that balances the nation's budget,
makes responsible reforms to strengthen safety net programs, helps to
create jobs, and grows the economy.
For the third year in a row, the
House budget included Medicaid reforms, like my State Health
Flexibility Act,
to strengthen the program by block
granting funds to the states.
States and local communities can
determine best who is poor and how best to help them..
This budget is another balanced budget that will empower Americans to
build better lives for themselves and their families.
By contrast the
Senate offers no plan and the President's budget raises taxes and
further grows the size and cost of the federal government.
The Path to Prosperity: A Responsible, Balanced Budget
*	Cuts $5.1 Trillion in Spending
*	Balances the Budget
*	Puts the country on a path to paying off the debt entirely.
*	Repeals ObamaCare
*	Reverses Medicaid's eligibility expansions and ends the
ObamaCare exchange subsidies.
*	Reforms Major Entitlements
*	Provides state flexibility in Medicaid starting in 2016.
Strengthens the work requirements in Food Stamps (SNAP).
*	Reforms the Tax Code by Eliminating Special Interest Tax
Loopholes
*	Moves to an internationally competitive tax system.
*	Cuts Cronyism, Corporate Welfare, and Waste
*	Ends Dodd-Frank's bailout of big banks.
*	Ends green-energy slush fund and other corporate subsidies in
the energy industry.

Strengthening Education Through Research
On Wednesday, along with the Ranking Member, Carolyn McCarthy, of the
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education,
on which I serve as Chairman, I introduced the Strengthening Education
Through Research Act, H.R. 4366.
Chairman Rokita Questions Witnesses in an education hearing earlier
this year.
Quality education research is critical to successful schools.
To raise
student achievement levels, teachers and school leaders need good data
on what works - and what doesn't - in the classroom. The legislation we
introduced will improve education research, protect taxpayers by
enhancing program accountability, and help ensure more schools and
students can benefit from effective education practices.
The Strengthening Education through Research Act:
*	Enhances the relevancy of education research at the state and
local levels, helping teachers, students, parents, and policymakers
access more useful information about successful education practices.
*	Streamlines the federal education research system, preventing
overlap, redundancy, and duplication of research efforts.
*	Improves accountability and protects the taxpayers' investment
by requiring regular evaluations of research and education programs.
*	Preserves and enhances focus on research regarding educational
equity and closing achievement gaps.
*	Strengthens privacy provisions to ensure personally
identifiable information collected by IES is secure and protected.
*	Maintains the autonomy of IES, the National Assessment
Governing Board, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(also known as the Nation's Report Card) to shield these entities from
political influence and bias.

Protecting the Dignity of Work - the Save American Workers Act
On Wednesday, the House passed legislation that I cosponsored, the Save
American Workers Act, with bipartisan support.
The 40 hour work week has always defined full-time employment, and is
the backbone of our economic system.
Unfortunately, ObamaCare
redefined the work week to 30 hours. This bill changes the definition
of full-time employment back to 40 hours.
The data shows that 97
percent of Americans who work a full time job will escape and stay out
of poverty.
A full-time job is the best way for Americans to climb the economic
ladder.
Ensuring all Americans can enjoy the dignity that comes with
the blessing that is a full-time job is the best way to help them build
better lives for themselves and their families.
H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which passed with bipartisan
support (248-179), would repeal the provision within ObamaCare that
defines full-time as 30 hours, contrary to the long-held standard
40-hour work week.

Strengthening

On
Wednesday,
along
with
the
Ranking

Carolyn
McCarthy,
of
the
Subcommittee

Early

Quality

To
raise
student

leaders
need
good
data
on
what
works
&#8211;
and
what
doesn&#8217;t
&#8211;
in

The
legislation
we
introduced
will
improve
education
research,
protect
taxpayers
by
enhancing
program
accountability,
and
help
ensure
more
schools
and
students

benefit

The
