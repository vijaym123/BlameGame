Out with the Old and In with the New: Cheers to 2014
Happy New Year!
I wish you and your family a year of happiness and success as we move into 2014. I also would like to thank you for your support in the last year and look forward to working with you in 2014.
A new year means new beginnings and new resolutions for the future. My New Years resolution for 2014 is to continue to work for a smaller, more efficient and effective government that gives you the power to control your life. I'm committed to working with my colleagues in 2014 to create a healthy economy so you can live the life you want.
Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today.
Let us begin.

Oh! Congratulation to the Aggies for an impressive comeback in the Chick-fil-A Bowl last night and Morgans Texas Tech Red Raiders for their win in the Holiday Bowl on Monday.
We arent talking about my Longhorns...
