This Independence Day
We live in a partisan time. Although our nation seems more divided than
ever, I'm hopeful - especially today.
The Fourth of July helps bring us together and offers our nation an
important reminder of America's shared past - that our collective fight
for independence and freedom happened because we joined together, even
if we had differences. It's a lesson so many of us can learn from -
particularly those in Congress.
When our soldiers are called to action around the world to protect us,
they do so standing side-by-side with their brothers and sisters in
arms because if they don't support each other, they won't succeed. It
is the ultimate form of service. And it's another reminder of why it's
so important that we join together to fight for our veterans and
servicemembers to make sure they get the services and benefits they
earned.
Let's not allow the memory of today's holiday to pass us by. Let's
continue to strive daily to meet the standards our Founding Fathers set
as they built our country - to be better people, better members of our
communities, and, most notably, better Americans.

This
Independence
Day
We
live
in
a
partisan
time.
Although
our
nation
seems
more
divided
than
ever,
I'm
hopeful
-
especially
today.
The
Fourth
of
July
helps
bring
us
together
and
offers
our
nation
an
important
reminder
of
America's
shared
past
-
that
our
collective
fight
for
independence
and
freedom
happened
because
we
joined
together,
even
if
we
had
differences.
It's
a
lesson
so
many
of
us
can
learn
from
-
particularly
those
in
Congress.
When
our
soldiers
are
called
to
action
around
the
world
to
protect
us,
they
do
so
standing
side-by-side
with
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
arms
because
if
they
don't
support
each
other,
they
won't
succeed.
It
is
the
ultimate
form
of
service.
And
it's
another
reminder
of
why
it's
so
important
that
we
join
together
to
fight
for
our
veterans
and
servicemembers
to
make
sure
they
get
the
services
and
benefits
they
earned.
Let's
not
allow
the
memory
of
today's
holiday
to
pass
us
by.
Let's
continue
to
strive
daily
to
meet
the
standards
our
Founding
Fathers
set
as
they
built
our
country
-
to
be
better
people,
better
members
of
our
communities,
and,
most
notably,
better
Americans.
