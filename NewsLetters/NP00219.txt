Dear Friend,
Having spent more than 25 years in the
health care industry prior to coming to
Washington, I know first-hand how important
it is that we strengthen the Medicare
program for seniors. As I travel around
Ohios 16
th District, I consistently
hear the same message: the government is
inserting itself into personal health care
decisions. Given that nearly two million
Ohioans rely on Medicare, it is critical
that the program is improved to better
address seniors health care
needs.
That is why this past week, the House
Ways &amp; Means Committee approved 10
bills aimed at making the Medicare program
more transparent, accountable, and
accessible to seniors. As a whole, this
legislation is patient-centered and limits
the federal governments role in an
individuals personal health care
choices. It allows seniors to play a more
active role by giving them the opportunity
to offer their input, and it makes it
easier for individuals to understand their
benefits.
One of the bills approved, the
Protecting Seniors Access to
Medicare Act, repeals the Independent
Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). Created by
the Affordable Care Act, IPAB is a powerful
board of unelected bureaucrats tasked with
saving money by limiting access to health
care for Medicare beneficiaries. Instead of
unaccountable bureaucrats calling the
shots, this decision should rest in the
hands of Congress, which has the power of
the purse. More than 390 groups across the
country comprised of doctors, patients, and
employers and more than 230 Members of
Congress support IPABs repeal.
Another bill, the Protect Medical
Innovation Act, fully repeals the excise
tax on medical devices. A recent
Congressional Research Service report found
that while this tax is imposed on the
manufacturing and importation of devices,
the brunt of it will be passed on to
American consumers. Furthermore, according
to industry executives, this tax has forced
nearly 75 percent of medical device
manufacturers to slow or halt the hiring of
new employees and will stifle innovation.
These are life-saving medical devices, such
as X-Ray machines, MRI scanners, and
pacemakers. We need more of these medical
devices and we need to expand access to
them; the medical device tax stands in the
way of that.
The legislation approved this past week
is commonsense, and Im hopeful that
the House of Representatives will soon have
the opportunity to send it to the Senate.
As a member of the Ways &amp; Means
Committee, I look forward to working with
my colleagues toward real health care
solutions that put Ohio seniors and
patients across the country first.
