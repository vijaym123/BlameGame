Monday:
President Obama emailed you to ask for your support.
Yesterday:
Barack Obama became the FIRST President -- ever -- to be sued by Congress.
Today:
It&rsquo;s the BIGGEST fundraising deadline of the year.
David -- What a month! We&rsquo;re in reach of 5OO,OOO supporters backing up President Obama since Boehner announced his lawsuit.
According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t answered President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action yet. David, we&rsquo;ll need a huge surge of support in these final hours to hit the 5OO,OOO donation mark.
If you&rsquo;ve been planning to make a contribution to defeat the Tea Party Republicans, we could use your support before tonight&rsquo;s federal fundraising deadline.
