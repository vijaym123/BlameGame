Dear
Friends,
I'm sure you have been following the growing Department of
Veterans Affairs scandal and share in my anger that this crucial agency
is letting our veterans down.
It has become exceedingly
clear that the top leadership at the VA is incapable of managing this
troubled agency and ensuring that our veterans are receiving the services
they desperately need. West Virginias veterans deserve to know that
the Department of Veterans Affairs will be there for them, and
increasing evidence shows that the VA is failing them.
Earlier
this week I called on Secretary Eric Shinseki to acknowledge the agencys
failings and step aside. In order for the VA to regain the trust of
our veterans, it must show that accountability applies to everyone,
starting with the secretary.
If you are experiencing or have
experienced problems with care at the VA, please contact one of my
offices:

HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Today I held a summit on human trafficking,
Human Trafficking: What West Virginians Need to Know, at West Virginia
State University in Institute. My panel brought together national,
state and local experts on human trafficking, vulnerable populations and
law enforcement response:
Lara Powers, program
specialist, Polaris Project, a national nonprofit dedicated to combating
human trafficking
Lieutenant Daniel Swiger, director,
Crimes Against Children Unit, West Virginia State
Police
Patrick Kerr, Ph.D., psychology professor, West Virginia University
Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center, Charleston
Division
Emily Chittenden-Laird, executive director, West Virginia Child
Advocacy Network
Damien Arthur, Ph.D., assistant
professor, West Virginia State University
The panel helped
to facilitate a very educational discussion with the audience, which
included federal, state and local officials, community groups,
non-profit organizations and religious leaders. I want to thank everyone for
taking their time to learn more about this very important
issue.
This summit follows the U.S. House of Representatives passage of
five bills on Tuesday that address human trafficking and vulnerable
populations:
International Megans Law to Prevent
Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573)
Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act (H.R. 3530)
Preventing Sex
Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act
(H.R. 4058)
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act
(H.R. 4225)
Stop Exploitation through Trafficking Act
(H.R. 3610)

HONORING THE FALLEN
Monday is Memorial
Day -- a holiday dedicated to remembering and honoring those who have
given their lives in defense of our great nation. As you travel or spend
time with family and friends, please pause to pray for our fallen
service men and women and to remember that freedom comes at a great
price.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
