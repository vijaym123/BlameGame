Dear Friends,
Last Saturday, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and
Immigration and Customs Enforcement assisted Mexican authorities in
arresting the most notorious and ruthless Mexican drug cartel leader,
Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as "El Chapo." The arrest is
significant because U.S. officials and Mexican authorities were able to
penetrate his inner circle, which in the long term will make it more
difficult for the Sinaloa Cartel to operate.
I spoke to the Mexican
Ambassador to the United States following the arrest and urged
extradition of El Chapo to the U.S.
You can watch my interview from
last Sunday on ABC This Week regarding his arrest and extradition below.
This week Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson
appeared before my committee in his first testimony to Congress since
his confirmation.
I am pleased that he understands the urgency of
filling key vacancies within DHS.
He also shares my concerns about
Westerners joining jihadist rebel forces in Syria, receiving training
and returning to their home countries, including the US, with the
capacity to carry out terrorist attacks.
I look forward to working
with Secretary Johnson on a range of homeland security issues including
the security of our borders. You can watch my questioning of him below.
The House of Representatives passed, and I voted for, The Taxpayer
Transparency Act, H.R. 3308
and the Protecting
Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act, H.R. 2531
. The Taxpayer Transparency Act will require
any advertising or educational communications from federal agencies
about government programs and services to say that the material was
produced at taxpayer expense. The Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive
IRS Requests Act prohibits the IRS from asking taxpayers about their
religious, political or social beliefs. These bills are another step in
ensuring an open and transparent federal government and in protecting
Americans' privacy.
