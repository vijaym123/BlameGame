David --
Late last night, Karl Rove&rsquo;s outside group launched a brutal ad campaign targeting Cheri. Rove&rsquo;s coming after us because polls show our race within a single digit.
He thinks with enough cash he can buy our Tea Party opponent a seat in Congress.
David, there&rsquo;s no sugarcoating it: if Rove&rsquo;s attacks take hold with voters, we might as well throw in the towel on Cheri&rsquo;s first re-election campaign.
That&rsquo;s simply not an option. Please chip in right now to help set the record straight:
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250
