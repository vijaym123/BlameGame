Friend,
Last week, I went to the Board of Elections to officially file my candidacy to represent California&#39;s 7th district in the United States House of Representatives.
It&#39;s a humbling experience to file election papers, and it reminds me of why I ran for Congress in the first place - to be the voice of my constituents and to represent your interests in Washington.
I made a pledge to you to make Congress a place of service, and I stand firm in that commitment. That&#39;s why I was one of the original sponsors of the No Budget, No Pay Act - which said that if Congress doesn&#39;t do its job, they don&#39;t get paid. And it&#39;s why I was one of only a handful of Members of Congress who refused to accept a salary when Republicans shut down the government, and donated portions of my salary during the sequester and the shutdown.
As we continue our work, I hope you&#39;ll stay engaged in our efforts. To know the latest, please

I wouldn&#39;t be where I am without you. Thank you for continuing on this journey with me.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
