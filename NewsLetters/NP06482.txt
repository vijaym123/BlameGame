Dear
Friend,
Earlier this year, I introduced H.R.4290,
the Wakefield Act, bipartisan legislation which would ensure that the
only federal program focused solely on improving emergency care for
children and adolescents is able to continue the incredible work it has
already accomplished. This year marks the 30 th
anniversary
of the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Program, which
ensures emergency medical services (EMS) are able to meet the unique
needs of kids and teenagers, such as smaller medical equipment or more
limited doses of medication. Children are not little adults, and this
is no more evident than in medical care. In a similar medical
emergency, children respond differently than adults, and therefore require
and deserve
specialized care . I was very
pleased, and honored, that this week my bill was passed unanimously in the
House of Representatives with bipartisan support.
EMSC grant funds go to
all 50 states and
territories , and have helped to educate, train, and certify medical
professionals in trauma care for children; to ensure that proper medical
equipment is on hand in ambulances and emergency rooms; and ultimately to
make certain that the full spectrum of emergency medical care is
available to children
no matter where they live, attend
school, or travel . The unfortunate fact is that millions of kids
find themselves in our nations emergency rooms every year. Since its
inception, the modest and responsible federal investment in this
program has provided doctors, nurses, and first-responders the tools and
training needed to properly treat injured youth.
The Wakefield Act has the support of members from both sides of the
aisle and has also been introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator
Orrin Hatch, in the U.S. Senate. Our bills have been endorsed by the
Utah Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Intermountain
Healthcare, and Primary Childrens Hospital in Salt Lake City. This is a
program that is worth continuing, and I am proud that my colleagues in
the House of Representatives
from both parties
agree with
me.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah
families like yours. As your representative, I always appreciate
hearing from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community. Please
let me know
areas you find
especially interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
