Dear Neighbor,
Yesterday our office received word that flooding damages in Southern Tier and Finger Lakes counties exceeded the state threshold for federal assistance. Our staff has been on the ground since the flooding helping all those affected through the process of documenting damages and meeting with FEMA to survey the damage.
Now is the time
for Governor Cuomo to make a request on behalf of the state for communities suffering from severe damages. Families and businesses shouldn&rsquo;t have to wait any longer for help to rebuild.
We visited some of the spots hit hardest by the flooding last month including the Village of Penn Yan in Yates County. Seeing the damage firsthand and hearing from individuals and business owners, we&rsquo;ve been encouraging the Governor&rsquo;s office to seek assistance. We&rsquo;re following through to make sure our communities get the help they need.
REED COSPONSORS BILL TO GIVE VETERANS MORE HEALTH CARE FLEXIBILITY
I cosponsored this week&rsquo;s
Veterans Access to Care Act ,
a bill requiring the VA to offer non-VA care to enrolled veterans who experience long wait times or live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility. Regardless of where veterans live, it&rsquo;s only fair they receive timely care close to home. If the VA can&rsquo;t provide care, veterans need the flexibility to seek care elsewhere.
REED SECURES FULL FUNDING FOR ITHACA AIRPORT CONTRACT TOWER
We worked with the Appropriations Committee to make sure this year&rsquo;s Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill
fully funds the Ithaca Airport&rsquo;s contract tower , bringing relief to the community that feared the tower would close last year.
SMALL BUSINESSES, FARMERS TO GAIN UNDER REED-BACKED BILL
The common sense
America&rsquo;s Small Business Tax Relief Act
gives businesses and farmers the certainty they need to make investments in their businesses and hire more employees by making permanent the long-standing tax provision for small business expensing. Hear what local manufacturers, farmers and small businesses are saying about how it will help them grow
here .
REED SUCCESSFUL IN FIGHT FOR FIRST RESPONDER SUPPORT
Caring for and protecting public safety is about giving first responders the tools they need to stay safe and do their jobs. That&rsquo;s why we acted this week to help first responders develop, improve and implement emergency plans for accidents involving the transportation of crude oil by strengthening the Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness program.
We&rsquo;re back in Washington next week with another full week of constituent meetings, bills on the House floor and events in the district.
Best,
Tom
P.S. A very happy Father&rsquo;s Day on Sunday to all of the dads out there!
