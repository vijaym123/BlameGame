Last week, I held town hall meetings in Lower Windsor Township, Upper Allen Township and Fairfield. We had an excellent turnout
more than 70 people at each event. Residents told me of their concerns about many issues including jobs, the economy, the situation at the U.S. border, and what the NSA is doing with their private information.
Wrightsville Town Meeting at the Lower Windsor Township Building
Mechanicsburg Town Meeting at the Upper Allen Township Building
Meeting with people face-to-face and talking with them about issues they care about is a vital part of my job. You help me better represent you in Washington.
Thanks for making the past week a productive one, and I look forward to taking your energy and passion back to Washington.
