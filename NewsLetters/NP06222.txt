Forbes Recognized for His Commitment To Small Businesses
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) was awarded today with the Guardian of Small Businesses Award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nations leading small business association. Congressman Forbes received this distinction for his outstanding voting record on behalf of Americas small business owners in the 113th Congress.
NFIB President and CEO Dan Danner praised Rep. Forbes for standing up for small business. In presenting the groups Guardian of Small Business Award, Danner said, The record shows that Rep. Forbes is a true champion of small business, supporting the votes that matter in the 113th Congress. This award reflects our members appreciation for supporting the NFIB pro-growth agenda for small business.
Small businesses are where you find both the heart of America and the engine that drives our economy," said Forbes. By reducing the crushing regulatory and tax burdens that are on the backs of small businesses today, we not only allow them to expand, innovate, and create jobs, but also to light up our economy and push the country forward. That is my priority, and I will continue to fight to create an environment where government is an enabler of
not a barrier to
economic growth. It is an honor to be presented with this award.
