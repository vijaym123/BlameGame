Dear Friend,
As founder and Chairman of the Congressional Constitution Caucus, I am committed to preserving and protecting your rights as outlined by the Constitution of the United States.
Like you, I believe it is critical to keep Americans safe, particularly without jeopardizing the protection of their civil liberties.
But, recently, news came out that Americans civil liberties might be in jeopardy.
Over the summer, it was revealed that the Obama Administration's National Security Agency (NSA) was engaged in a bulk collection of data, including phone call and text message information, for all Americans.
Though the NSA is apparently not collecting the contents of these calls and text messages, this bulk collection is troubling.
This data can readily be used to establish important facts about citizens, including the patterns of their behavior, their preferences, and who they call and why.
This reveals, beyond the mere collection of the data, information about which citizens typically have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
I have serious concerns that various NSA programs that collect information about American citizens doin principle and in effectviolate both the spirit and letter of the constitutional protections of our civil liberties.
I write to inquire about
your views
regarding the Obama Administration's NSA meta-data collection.
