Dear
Friend,
The
news out of Iraq has been heartbreaking.
It's heartbreaking
to see the people of Iraq, who just want to go about their lives, now
facing a terror force so extreme even Al Qaeda won't associate with
them.
It's heartbreaking to see the ground gained by
some of our bravest and most selfless military men and women over the
last decade taken by those who truly mean to do
evil.
There's been a lot of reporting on insider politics in Washington over the
last two weeks. That's just a part of our process. But I've gone out
of my way to make sure that we're paying attention to what's happening
in Iraq and how those who served feel about it.
Take
a look at the interview
below
from CNN, and
this piece
from DefenseOne that featured several members
of Congress who served in Iraq.
There are a lot of views on how
to handle the situation in Iraq, and I want to know yours.
As
always, you can let me know what you think
here .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member
of Congress
In Case You
Missed It: Congressman Collins on CNN
Congressman Collins was asked about his own service in
Iraq and how he sees the situation developing on the ground by CNN's
Fredricka Whitfield.
You can catch that interview
