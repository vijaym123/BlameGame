Happy Trails - to Jobs and Tourism Up North
That red squiggly line from North Dakota to Vermont would be the
4,600-mile North Country Scenic Trail. The two yellow arrows point to
our proposed reroute - a loop through the Arrowhead and final link up
to the Appalachian Trail in Vermont.
Dear Friend,
We create good jobs by making our region more attractive to tourists
who add billions of dollars to our economy as they join us in hiking,
camping, hunting, fishing and exploring Minnesota's northland. With
that in mind, I have introduced bipartisan legislation (H.R.4736) with
my colleague, Peter Welch of Vermont, to incorporate more than 400
miles of existing trail in the Minnesota Boundary Waters and North
Shore of Lake Superior into more than 4,000 miles of the North Country
National Scenic Trail.
Hiking has become an extremely popular sport for people of all ages,
and a real boon to local businesses across the Eighth District. After a
long hike, there's nothing like dinner at a local restaurant, a hot
shower, a comfortable bed, and a stop at a sweet shop in Grand Marais,
Duluth, or somewhere in between.
Stretching from Sakakawea State Park in central North Dakota to Crown
Point, New York - on the way passing through Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the North Country Scenic Trail is
already the longest of the eleven National Scenic Trails authorized by
Congress.
Combining seed money from the federal government, sweat equity from the
volunteers who will maintain it, and free-will contributions from those
who use it, the new Minnesota stretch will include the existing
Superior Hiking Trail, Border Route Trail, and Kekekabic Trail.
(Speaking of sweat equity, on June 28th, Mary and I will be
volunteering to work the trail near Remer. And we're really looking
forward to it!)
This route actually replaces a 100-mile stretch of proposed trail
between Jay Cooke State Park and the Chippewa National Forest near
Remer - authorized by Congress in 1980 but never constructed out of
concern that it would pass directly through extensive Black Spruce and
Tamarack wetlands we can now be assured of protecting.
Moreover, our bill links the North Country Scenic Trail with the
Appalachian Trail along the eastern coast of the United States. Think
of it as one unified national trail system stretching from the plains
of North Dakota to the forests of Vermont, as far north as Maine and as
far south as the Carolinas.
By including the Minnesota Arrowhead reroute into the national system,
we will create new jobs, honor the contributions of past trail makers,
ensure future generations benefit from their hard work, and continue
the legacy of responsible land stewardship. Check out WDIO's coverage
of my bill from over the weekend by clicking the image below:

Shinseki Resignation Opens the Door for New Management
Secretary Shinseki is a good soldier who did the right thing last week
when he handed President Obama his resignation and opened the door for
new leadership at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the President
said last week, the Shinseki situation was distracting attention away
from the heroes this agency is intended to serve, and from eliminating
the backlog that continues to leave hundreds of thousands of veterans
waiting for benefits they have earned by putting themselves in harm's
way to serve and protect our nation at great sacrifice. Now we need to
move forward and appoint a strong manager to get to the bottom of these
pervasive and systemic management failures at the VA and fix this
agency once and for all.
One critically important improvement would be to allow veterans who
live long distances from VA facilities to utilize local doctors and
clinics for services and treatment. To that end, I have co-sponsored
the Healthy Vets Act (H.R. 635), which would, in fact, enable rural
veterans who live far away from a VA medical facility to use local
healthcare providers in their hometowns. The bill would make treatment
more convenient and less stressful for vets, help reduce appointment
backlogs at veterans medical facilities, and in many instances also
save money.

Nolan Amendment Means Curtains for Invasive (Asian) Carp

President Obama is set to sign the massive Water Resources Reform &
Development Act (WRRDA) into law any day now - including three
amendments I added to the original House version of the bill to: (1)
protect the Minnesota Mississippi watershed, our major northern
Minnesota rivers and lakes, and multi-billion dollar sport fishing
industry from invasive (Asian) carp by closing the St. Anthony Lock &
Dam in Minneapolis; (2) change the official definition of "invasive
species" to include animal life (like invasive carp and zebra mussels)
as well as plant life, to give the Army Corps of Engineers more money
and tools for research and abatement; and (3) boost Iron Range, Duluth,
and Great Lakes commerce by ending raids on the Harbor Trust Fund that
have resulted in a 10-year dredging backlog - costing some $3 billion
in lost jobs and commerce by forcing Duluth Harbor and cargo ships to
operate at just 80% of capacity. It's all here in my op-ed
, which appeared in last Wednesday's
Duluth News Tribune. Take a minute to read it.

Duluth Cleans Up with $400,000 EPA Grant
I was pleased to announce last week that the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has awarded $400,000 to Duluth to help clean up polluted
and contaminated tracts of "brownfield" sites around the city. After
petroleum and other hazardous wastes are properly removed, these lands
will become valuable assets for future projects to generate jobs and
economic development, while contributing to a cleaner, healthier
environment for all who live, work and play in this great city.
Duluth is one of 171 cities throughout the United States set to receive
EPA brownfield clean-up funds this year. In addition to reclaiming
abandoned industrial sites, many communities, including Duluth, use
these grants to repair beaches and shoreline to improve fishing,
protect wildlife and enhance job-generating tourism.
As I've frequently noted before, for every dollar in federal taxes
Minnesota sends to Washington, we receive only about 65 cents back for
worthwhile projects like brownfield abatement and cleanup, while other
states receive as much as $4 and $5 dollars for every dollar they send
to Washington. That's why I'm continuing to work so hard to bring money
for all kinds of worthy projects - from airport repair to education to
pollution control - back to Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District
and the rest of our state as well.

Appropriations Bill Starts Rebuilding America
In ongoing efforts to create good middle-class jobs by redirecting our
priorities homeward to start rebuilding America, the U.S. House of
Representatives made great progress last week when we passed H.R.4660,
the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act. This bill
provides funding for vital law enforcement, national security, and
public safety efforts, while promoting initiatives dedicated to
economic growth, innovation, and creating good paying middle-class
jobs, and I'm proud to say that several programs for which I advocated
were funded at levels I requested. Specifically:
.
The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program -
helping to fight crime at the state, local, and tribal community
levels, saw an increase of $113 million.
.
I voted against an amendment that would have gutted funding
for the Economic Development Administration (EDA); instead, we were
able to increase EDA funding by about $1 million over last year.
.
The National Weather Service (NWS) - currently majorly
understaffed - would be given the resources they need to provide their
life-saving services to Minnesotans and all Americans, protecting
property and people, thanks to language I advocated for and which was
included in the bill.
.
While we did receive less than we wanted for the Coastal
Zone Management Program - a voluntary partnership between the federal
government and U.S. coastal and Great Lake States, I'm proud to say
that this program, so necessary for the protection and restoration of
our nation's coasts and shorelines, received more than $100 million.

We've Been Working on the Railroad
The Northern Lights Express (NLX), shown in the proposed route above,
would take passengers from the Twin Cities to Duluth in a little more
than two hours.
I was happy to welcome to my office Matt Rose, Executive Chairman of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway, last week, to personally
thank him for his support and work on behalf of the Northern Lights
Express (the high-speed rail project currently under review, which
would run along BNSF lines). The Northern Lights Express (NLX) would
take visitors from the Twin Cities to Duluth in a little more than two
hours, at top speeds of 110 mph, generating about 13,800 jobs and $2
billion in business development in the process. Not to mention creating
an environmentally-friendly alternative to highway vehicles.

Finally...
Veridically,* Congrats to Lauren Crabtree
The 8th District's National Spelling Bee Contestant!
National Spelling Bee contestant Lauren Crabtree of Baxter and I share
a laugh in my DC office on the afternoon of her competition.
Congrats to Lauren Crabtree, an 8th grader at Forestview Middle School
in Brainerd, for qualifying as a contestant in the National Scripps
Spelling Bee in Washington! Lauren and her family stopped by my office
for a brief chat and one of my special tours of the U.S. Capitol, where
I take my guests to places the official tour groups aren't allowed to
go. Although Lauren did not advance to the national semifinals, she did
correctly spell *"veridical" - which means "truthfully." Congrats
again, Lauren, on your success. You've made us proud.

Happy

-
to

Tourism
Up
North
That
red
squiggly
line
from
North
Dakota
to
Vermont
would
be
the
4,600-mile North
Country
Scenic
Trail.
The
two

arrows
point
to
our
proposed
reroute
-
a
loop
through
the
Arrowhead
and
final
link
up
to
the
Appalachian
Trail
in
Vermont.
Dear
Friend,
We
create
good
jobs
by
making
our
region
more
attractive
to
tourists
who
add
billions
of
dollars
to
our
economy
as
they
join
us
in
hiking,
camping,
hunting,
fishing
and
exploring
Minnesota&#8217;s
northland .
With
that
in
mind,
I
have
introduced
bipartisan
legislation
(H.R.4736)
with
my
colleague,
Peter
Welch
of
Vermont,
to
incorporate
more
than
400
miles
of
existing
trail
in
the
Minnesota
Boundary
Waters
and
North
Shore
of
Lake
Superior
into
more
than
4,000
miles
of the
North
Country
National
Scenic
Trail.
Hiking
has
become
an
extremely
popular
sport
for
people
of
all
ages,
and
a
real
boon
to
local
businesses
across
the
Eighth
District .
After
a
long
hike,
there's
nothing
like
dinner
at
a
local
restaurant,
a
hot
shower,
a
comfortable
bed,
and
a
stop
at
a
sweet
shop
in
Grand
Marais,
Duluth,
or
somewhere
in
between.
Stretching
from
Sakakawea
State
Park
in
central
North
Dakota
to
Crown
Point,
New
York
&#8211;
on
the
way
passing
through
Minnesota,
Wisconsin,
Michigan,
Ohio,
and
Pennsylvania,
the
North
Country
Scenic
Trail
is
already
the
longest
of
the
eleven
National
Scenic
Trails
authorized
by
Congress.
Combining
seed
money
from
the
federal
government,
sweat
equity
from
the
volunteers
who
will
maintain
it,
and
free-will
contributions
from
those
who
use
it,
the
new
Minnesota
stretch
will
include
the
existing
Superior
Hiking
Trail,
Border
Route
Trail,
and
Kekekabic
Trail .
(Speaking
of
sweat
equity,
on
June
28th,
Mary
and
I
will
be
volunteering
to
work
the
trail
near
Remer.
And
we're
really
looking
forward
to
it!)
This
route
actually
replaces
a
100-mile
stretch
of
proposed
trail
between
Jay
Cooke
State
Park
and
the
Chippewa
National
Forest
near
Remer
&#8211;
authorized
by
Congress
in
1980
but
never
constructed
out
of
concern
that
it
would
pass
directly
through
extensive
Black
Spruce
and
Tamarack
wetlands
we
can
now
be
assured
of
protecting.
Moreover,
our
bill
links
the
North
Country
Scenic
Trail
with
the
Appalachian
Trail
along
the
eastern
coast
of
the
United
States.
Think
of
it
as
one
unified
national
trail
system
stretching
from
the
plains
of
North
Dakota
to
the
forests
of
Vermont,
as
far
north
as
Maine
and
as
far
south
as
the
Carolinas.
By
including
the
Minnesota
Arrowhead
reroute
into
the
national
system,
we
will
create
new
jobs,
honor
the
contributions
of
past
trail
makers,
ensure
future
generations
benefit
from
their
hard
work,
and
continue
the
legacy
of
responsible
land
stewardship.

Sincerely,
Shinseki
Resignation
Opens
the
Door
for
New
Management
Secretary
Shinseki
is
a
good
soldier
who
did
the
right
thing
last
week
when
he
handed
President
Obama
his
resignation
and
opened
the
door
for
new
leadership
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
As
the
President
said
last
week,
the
Shinseki
situation
was
distracting
attention
away
from
the
heroes
this
agency
is
intended
to
serve,
and
from
eliminating
the
backlog
that
continues
to
leave
hundreds
of
thousands
of
veterans
waiting
for
benefits
they
have
earned
by
putting
themselves
in
harm's
way
to
serve
and
protect
our
nation
at
great
sacrifice.
Now
we
need
to
move
forward
and
appoint
a
strong
manager
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
pervasive
and
systemic
management
failures
at
the
VA
and
fix
this

One
critically
important
improvement
would
be
to
allow
veterans

from
VA

to
utilize
local
doctors
and

for
services
and
treatment .
To
that
end,
I
have
co-sponsored
the
Healthy

(H.R.
635),
which
would,
in
fact,
enable
rural
veterans
who
live
far
away
from
a
VA
medical
facility
to
use
local
healthcare
providers
in
their
hometowns.
The
bill
would
make
treatment
more
convenient
and
less
stressful
for
vets,
help
reduce
appointment
backlogs
at
veterans
medical
facilities,
and
in
many
instances
also
save
money.

(1)
protect

our
major
northern

and
multi-billion
dollar
sport
fishing
industry
from

(2)

as
well
as

to
give

that
have
resulted
in
a
10-year
dredging
backlog
&#8211;
costing
some
$3
billion
in
lost
jobs
and
commerce
by
forcing
Duluth
Harbor
and
cargo
ships
to
operate
at
just
80%
of
capacity.
It's
all
here
in
my

which
appeared
in
last

Duluth
News
Tribune.
Take
a
minute
to
read
it.
Duluth
Cleans
Up
with
$400,000
EPA
Grant
I
was
pleased
to
announce
last
week
that
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
has
awarded
$400,000
to
Duluth
to
help
clean
up
polluted
and
contaminated
tracts
of "brownfield"
sites
around
the
city.
After
petroleum
and
other
hazardous
wastes
are
properly
removed,
these
lands
will
become
valuable
assets
for
future
projects
to
generate
jobs
and
economic
development,
while
contributing
to
a
cleaner,
healthier
environment
for
all
who
live,
work
and
play
in
this
great
city.
Duluth
is
one
of
171
cities
throughout
the
United
States
set
to
receive
EPA
brownfield
clean-up
funds
this
year.
In
addition
to
reclaiming
abandoned
industrial
sites,
many
communities,
including
Duluth,
use
these
grants
to
repair
beaches
and
shoreline
to
improve
fishing,
protect
wildlife
and
enhance
job-generating
tourism .
As
I&#8217;ve
frequently
noted
before,
for
every
dollar
in
federal
taxes
Minnesota
sends
to
Washington,
we
receive
only
about
65
cents
back
for
worthwhile
projects
like
brownfield
abatement
and
cleanup,
while
other
states
receive
as
much
as
$4
and
$5
dollars
for
every
dollar
they
send
to
Washington.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
continuing
to
work
so
hard
to
bring
money
for
all
kinds
of
worthy
projects
&#8211;
from
airport
repair
to
education
to
pollution
control
&#8211;
back
to
Minnesota&#8217;s
Eighth
Congressional
District
and
the
rest
of
our
state
as
well.
Appropriations
Bill
Starts
Rebuilding
America
In
ongoing
efforts
to
create
good
middle-class
jobs
by
redirecting
our
priorities
homeward
to
start
rebuilding
America,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
made
great
progress
last
week
when
we
passed
H.R.4660,
the
Commerce,
Justice,
and
Science
Appropriations
Act .
This
bill
provides
funding
for
vital
law
enforcement,
national
security,
and
public
safety
efforts,
while
promoting
initiatives
dedicated
to
economic
growth,
innovation,
and
creating
good
paying
middle-class
jobs,
and
I'm
proud
to
say
that
several
programs
for
which
I
advocated
were
funded
at
levels
I
requested.
Specifically:
&#8226;
The
Community
Oriented
Policing
Services
(COPS)
program
-
helping
to
fight
crime
at
the
state,
local,
and
tribal
community
levels,
saw
an
increase
of
$113
million .
&#8226;
I
voted
against
an
amendment
that
would
have
gutted
funding
for
the
Economic
Development
Administration
(EDA);
instead,
we
were
able
to
increase
EDA
funding
by
about
$1
million
over
last
year.
&#8226;
The
National
Weather
Service
(NWS)
-
currently
majorly
understaffed
-
would
be
given
the
resources
they
need
to
provide
their
life-saving
services
to
Minnesotans
and
all
Americans,
protecting
property
and
people,
thanks
to
language
I
advocated
for
and
which
was
included
in
the
bill.
&#8226;
While
we
did
receive
less
than
we
wanted
for
the
Coastal
Zone
Management
Program
-
a
voluntary
partnership
between
the
federal
government
and
U.S.
coastal
and
Great
Lake
States,
I'm
proud
to
say
that
this
program,
so
necessary
for
the
protection
and
restoration
of
our
nation's
coasts
and
shorelines,
received
more
than
$100
million.

Finally...
Veridically,*
Congrats
to
Lauren
Crabtree
The
8th
District's
National
Spelling
Bee
Contestant!
National
Spelling
Bee
contestant
Lauren
Crabtree
of
Baxter
and
I
share
a
laugh
in
my
DC
office
on
the
afternoon
of
her
competition.
Congrats
to
Lauren
Crabtree ,
an
8th
grader
at
Forestview
Middle
School
in
Brainerd,
for
qualifying
as
a
contestant
in
the
National
Scripps
Spelling
Bee
in
Washington!
Lauren
and
her
family
stopped
by
my
office
for
a
brief
chat
and
one
of
my
special
tours
of
the
U.S.
Capitol,
where
I
take
my
guests
to
places
the
official
tour
groups
aren't
allowed
to
go.
Although
Lauren
did
not
advance
to
the
national
semifinals,
she
did
correctly
spell
*"veridical"
-
which
means
"truthfully."
Congrats
again,
Lauren,
on
your
success.
You've
made
us
proud.
