Dear Friend,
I am pleased to hear from so many of our neighbors that the job market is stronger and getting better.
Now we can focus on higher wages across Tampa Bay and work to ensure that
all
of our neighbors can connect to a good job opportunity.
Just last week in St. Petersburg, nearly
100 employers participated in my fourth annual job fair . I spoke with many who attended my one-stop shop to make personal contact with local companies ready to hire. Thanks to St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, CareerSource Tampa Bay and CareerSource Pinellas for co-hosting this successful event.
On the other side of the Bay, Hillsborough County Commissioner Sandra Murman and I partnered to cut the ribbon on the newest BayCare Hospital -- St. Joseph's Hospital South in Riverview. In addition to the nearly 500 jobs the hospital is bringing to SouthShore, the area will benefit from related economic growth and higher-wage jobs spurred by this state-of-the-art, full-service hospital.

Higher wages and the economic vitality of the Tampa Bay area are my top priorities. We must build on the momentum for families and our small businesses and ensure that our economy works for everyone. I will continue to champion economic investments in education, infrastructure and research that lead to higher-paying jobs and strengthens our economy
Tampa Bays future is bright.
Sincerely,
Kathy Castor
