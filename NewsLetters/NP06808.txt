 to regulate groundwater usage. For a glimpse of what the enviros have already wrought, look at the U.S. Drought Monitors list
of the top U.S. cities that are running out of water
every one of them is in California and six are in the San Joaquin Valley. There was some pushback this week, however, when a group filed a lawsuit
to end the double standard by which San Francisco, with its uninterrupted water supply from Hetch Hetchy, is exempt from the water cutbacks that have plagued the Valley. Read the court filing here .
Separately, as the Department of Veterans Affairs in D.C. struggles to overcome years of neglect, I received a briefing today at the Fresno VA about how its working to improve care for our vets. We owe our veterans a lot, including a functioning VA system that is responsive to their needs.

Dear Friends,
Environmentalists are looking to complete their destruction of the California water supply by pushing
legislation
to regulate groundwater usage. For a glimpse of what the enviros have already wrought, look at the U.S. Drought Monitors
list
of the top U.S. cities that are running out of water
every one of them is in California and six are in the San Joaquin Valley. There was some pushback this week, however, when a group filed a
lawsuit
to end the double standard by which San Francisco, with its uninterrupted water supply from Hetch Hetchy, is exempt from the water cutbacks that have plagued the Valley. Read the court filing
here .
Separately, as the Department of Veterans Affairs in D.C. struggles to overcome years of neglect, I received a briefing today at the Fresno VA about how its working to
improve care for our vets. We owe our veterans a lot, including a functioning VA system that is responsive to their needs.
