Working to #EndTrafficking
Dear Friend:
This week the House of Representatives voted on and approved 12 bipartisan bills to end human trafficking.
For many, human trafficking is seen as something that happens in other countries far away. The reality, however, hits much closer to home. Some 300,000 young Americans are in danger of becoming victims of sex trafficking
which is akin to modern day slavery. Human trafficking, a $32 billion a year industry, is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime. The average age for a girl to enter the commercial sex trade is 12 to 14 years of age, and for boys its 11 to 13.
Human trafficking is an epidemic and the bipartisan bills the House approved this week will strengthen our current laws to combat human trafficking in the United States, provide much needed services to victims of human trafficking, and ensure that the innocent victims of human trafficking are not subject to prosecution.
These bills will build on the bipartisan efforts of bills such as H.R. 4980, the
Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act,
which was introduced by my friend, Rep. Dave Camp, in the 113 th
Congress and was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by the president.
By working together, the House is bringing us closer to our goals of ending domestic and international trafficking and protecting and helping victims of human trafficking. I was proud to take action against this terrible violation of human dignity.
