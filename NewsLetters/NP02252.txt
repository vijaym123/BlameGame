Friend-
Wanted to share an
article
I read in The Virginian-Pilot recently, which shows Virginia exports grew to $19.2 billion in 2014, $1.1 billion higher than 2013 levels -- with manufactured goods accounting for 79% of total merchandise exports. In my opinion, this just goes to show the incredible potential for economic growth found in the Virginia manufacturing sector.
As those numbers demonstrate, our manufacturing industry already plays a key role in creating jobs and generating growth for Virginia. Just imagine the potential if overly burdensome government bureaucracy was lifted from its back. The opportunity is there
from global competitiveness, to national innovation, to American jobs. The federal government needs to be helping to propel the industry forward, not tying its hands. Thats what Im working towards.
Yours in service,
Randy
