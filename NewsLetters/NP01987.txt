Dear Friend, This is the sixth year in a row that the Republicans have tried to end Medicare as we know it.
Part of me can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re still having this discussion. Medicare works, and it provides guaranteed care for our seniors. The Republicans can&rsquo;t say the same for their voucher program. The Republican budget would take away Medicare&rsquo;s guaranteed benefits and give seniors a coupon instead. This is a disaster waiting to happen -- join me and my colleagues and speak out against the GOP attack on Medicare.
Giving seniors a voucher for health insurance is not going to work. How can I be so confident? Because Medicare was created to address the fact that private insurers wouldn&rsquo;t cover senior citizens at
any
price. Coupons are not going to pay for something insurers refuse to sell.
We have had this discussion many, many times before -- and the new Republican majority is insisting that we have it again. Let me be clear: I will not stand by and let the Republicans break the promise of Medicare. I need to know you&rsquo;re with me in this fight. Join me and my Democratic colleagues to say no to the Republicans&rsquo; radical plan to end Medicare as we know it.
Thank you,
Ed
