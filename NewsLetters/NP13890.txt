Happy
Thanksgiving!
From our family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving!
We hope you've been enjoying this wonderful weekend with family and
friends. May you feel God's peace as we celebrate His good
gifts.
Thank you for entrusting me with the honor of being your
representative in Congress. My family and I are truly grateful to serve the
great people of North Carolina's 11th District.
Statement on
Iran
After further review of the proposed deal with Iran, I find it
reckless and must oppose it. In exchange for more than $6 billion in
sanctions relief, this agreement simply requires Iran to temporarily
pause its nuclear development. Our allies in the Middle East, including
Israel, oppose this deal for good reason.
Loosening our
sanctions while not requiring any significant concessions from Tehran is
the wrong course to take. Iran has repeatedly shown itself to be
untrustworthy. Rather than weakening sanctions on Iran and hoping the
regime follows through with its end of the bargain, we must maintain the
sanctions in place until we are confident that the safety of the United
States and its allies is assured.
11th District
Spotlight
It was a true honor to present Major Tom Broom with his
long-deserved Purple Heart on Tuesday. During this Thanksgiving week, we
express our deep gratitude for the sacrifices our military men and
women make to protect the freedoms we hold dear. Thank you, Major Broom,
for your brave service to our nation.

agriculture plays in Western North Carolina's economy while getting
in the Christmas spirit.
