Rep. Veasey Statement on Thanksgiving Holiday
Dallas, Fort Worth, TX
Today, Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, released the following statement in recognition of the Thanksgiving holiday:
Each year, friends and family gather to celebrate the American tradition of giving thanks and reflect on the many blessings God has given us. As we give thanks, we must also remember to lend a hand to those less fortunate. It is truly an honor and privilege to serve the constituents of the 33 rd
Congressional District. I wish you and yours a very safe and happy Thanksgiving.
