A Year in Review
On the night of Wednesday,
December 18 at 7:00 p.m. MT, I will be holding my final tele-townhall of the
year.
We have had a busy year in Washington and there is much I
want to discuss with the people of Utah.
As I look forward to
where we are headed as a country, I believe we need to come together in
an open dialogue about how to best chart a course toward a better
future.

I look forward to having a
discussion about your questions and concerns, observations and
insight.
Below is a list of major developments from the last year that
I hope we can touch on during our discussion.
Read the
bill before you vote
One of the first things that Congress
did in 2013 was pass a deal to avert the "fiscal cliff."
Many
Americans were alarmed to find that Congress approved this legislation
after only having
6 minutes to read the bill .
We saw similar tactics employed when the Senate tried to pass new gun
control laws and when it passed the Gang of 8 comprehensive
immigration reform bill.
On October first, millions of Americans started
experiencing first-hand the consequences of a law that was passed
without many members of Congress ever reading it as Americans across the
country started reading the cancelation notices for their health
insurance plans because of Obamacare. Unfortunately, Americans spent more
time reading these cancelation notices than those who voted for
Obamacare spent reading the bill.
Americans are right to be
outraged.
Americans deserve proposals that offer simplicity
instead of complexity, that work by promoting freedom and flexibility
instead of mandates and coercion, and that can be debated in the open, not
negotiated in secret.
Cut This, Not
That
Throughout the year, Congress has continued to debate spending,
deficits and our debt ceiling.
At the beginning of this year, we
experienced our first round of sequester cuts.
Unfortunately, the
Administration decided to intentionally make these cuts as painful as
possible.
Americans saw through this charade, and together
we identified areas where a government with $17 trillion in
debt can make responsible cuts .
Congress is currently
working on finalizing the budget, and we still havent passed any structural
spending reforms that are necessary to avoid the
fiscal avalanche
I have warned against.
This week, the Senate
is set to debate the most recent version of a budget that makes more
government more expensive. This recent budget deal increases spending,
eliminates concrete spending reductions now for theoretical spending
cuts a decade from now.
A New Year, A New Day, A New
Agenda
The media likes to focus on the discord, dysfunction, and
disruption that come from Washington.
Most Americans would be
surprised to find out how frequently I work with my colleagues from the
other side of the aisle.
This year I have co-sponsored several
bipartisan bills that would
improve our patent
system ,
prevent privacy rights abuse , and limit
domestic surveillance .
I have also recently
been introducing several elements of a
conservative
reform agenda .
We need a positive agenda which lifts and creates
opportunities for those trapped in poverty and relieves pressures
facing the middle class.
Protecting Our Constitutional
Rights
During the spring of 2013 we had a robust debate on
several gun control proposals.
I was encouraged to see so many
American people rally to
defend their Second Amendment
rights .
This year we have also had extended debates about due
process rights and privacy rights.
The freedom of the press has
been threatened.
The freedom of speech is in the crosshairs of the
IRS.
States rights have been subverted.
We are also
witnessing the
erosion of our religious
liberty .
In short, it is becoming painfully obvious to Americans that our
enormous government has grown at the expense of individual liberty.
Americans are finding that a government that costs trillions of
dollars to run comes with other staggering costs that arent so easy to
quantify.
Looking Ahead
Last week, I joined the
vast majority of my colleagues to speak out against recent actions by
the Senate Democrats to overturn centuries-long precedents in the
Senate for confirming presidential nominees.
In my
speech I emphasized the point that these actions take power away from
the American People
and shut them out of the political
process.
I do not believe that the American people will quietly be shut
out.
I am always grateful to see high levels of engagement among my
constituents.
Tomorrows tele-townhall will be a great
opportunity for us to maintain an open dialogue on how we can move forward
as a country.
I am looking forward to your
feedback.
