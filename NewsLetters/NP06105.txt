Rep. Lipinski Stands with Middle
Class;
Supports Revitalize American Manufacturing
and Innovation
Act
On Monday, the House of
Representatives passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and
Innovation Act (RAMI), H.R. 2996. The bill, cosponsored by Congressman Dan
Lipinski, would boost American manufacturing by establishing a
network of public-private manufacturing innovation centers and by
implementing Lipinskis American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act (AMCA). The
AMCA
HR 2447
requires the government to work with the private
sector to evaluate and propose recommendations for promoting American
manufacturing every four years.
"Manufacturing is a linchpin of our nation's
economy," stated Rep. Lipinski.
"It provides the American middle class
with a source of quality jobs making everything from the goods we
rely on for everyday needs, to the equipment that we need for national
security.
I have seen the devastation in my district and across
northeastern Illinois as manufacturing has taken a number of hard hits.
I get frustrated, just like you do, when I go to the store and I
cannot find the words Made in the U.S.A. on any product. But American
manufacturing is making a comeback, and would be greatly aided by passing
this bill into
law."

Rep. Lipinski Votes for Limited Authority
to
Support Syrians Battling ISIL
Congressman Lipinski joined a bipartisan group of members this week in
helping pass an amendment to give the Defense Department authority to
train and equip Syrians fighting the terrorist group ISIL.
The
amendment was added to a bill that will fund operations of the government
until December 11th.
"The terrorist group ISIL is a threat, not only to
people in Iraq, Syria, and the rest of the Middle East, but to the rest of
the world, including all of us here at home," said Lipinski.
"We have seen their inhuman brutality not just in the beheadings of two
Americans, but in the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent
people.
Women are especially subject to horrible acts by ISIL.
Unfortunately, the Administration failed miserably in leadership when
it came to addressing this threat over the past couple of years.
Without leadership from the U.S., no one else has and no one else
will step forward, and ISIL will continue to grow.
We must fight
this threat to our security."

New GAO Report Reveals
that Taxpayer Dollars
are Paying for Health Insurance Plans in
ACA
that Include Abortions
Congressman
Lipinski is reacting to the Government Accountability Offices (GAO)
new report on abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
The report shows that taxpayer dollars are currently going to pay for
over one thousand health insurance plans that include
abortion.
"Under
the Hyde Amendment, which has been included in every government
funding bill for more than two decades, no federal taxpayer dollars are to
be spent for abortions or health care plans that cover abortion, except
in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mothers life," Lipinski
said.
"Despite my fight to include similar language in the ACA,
an accounting gimmick was inserted into the bill instead to try to
alleviate the concerns of the large majority of Americans who oppose their
tax dollars paying for abortion.
This gimmick required health
insurers to create a separate fund to pay for abortions and no taxpayer
dollars were to go into that fund.
Instead, every enrollee in a
plan was to pay their own money into that fund.
We learned this
week that the GAO has identified 1,036 plans that pay for abortions
and do not have a separate fund free of taxpayer dollars, making it
absolutely clear that taxpayer funds are being used to pay for abortions
under the ACA. To stop this, the Senate needs to pass HR 7, the No
Taxpayer Money for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act,
which the House already passed earlier this year.
