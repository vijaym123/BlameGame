Dear Friend,
This week, the late Nelson Mandela was on my mind quite a bit. The life
he led and his steadfast dedication to the principles of forgiveness and
reconciliation stand alone in their impact on the world as we know it
today. The importance and priority that he placed on those principles
played a role in my introducing the first Congressional apology for
slavery and Jim Crow laws to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives
five years ago. Apologizing for past wrongs is the first step towards
forgiveness and reconciliation, and it was an important step for
Congress to take that helped bring people with different backgrounds and
historical experiences together. I spoke with Joie Chen on "America
Tonight" about what Mandela's death means for us and how we can move
closer to the goal of true reconciliation. My interview will air in the
coming days on "America Tonight," which airs at 8PM CT. While the
channel depends on your television provider, you can click here

Passing a Bipartisan Budget Compromise
America is tired of government by crisis and of a Congress that lurches
from one shutdown threat to the next. Last night, I voted for a two-year
bipartisan budget compromise that will provide the stability both the
business community and the American people need and deserve. The
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 passed the House by a 332 to 94 vote,
putting us on course to pass the first budget through a divided Congress
since 1986. You can watch me discussing the budget deal on "America
Tonight" by clicking here
.
While I don't agree with everything in the bill, I joined President
Obama in supporting it because it is a significant step in the right
direction. This budget will also alleviate some of the crippling effects
of sequestration by restoring $25 billion for non-defense discretionary
programs like Meals on Wheels, LIHEAP, and research at the National
Institutes of Health that could lead to cures for debilitating and fatal
diseases.
Still, I am disappointed that this agreement does nothing to help the
more than one million Americans at risk of losing unemployment benefits
just days after Christmas. Before the budget passed yesterday, I voted
to ensure this agreement extended a lifeline to those Americans looking
for work, but Speaker Boehner and his colleagues did not join me and the
vote failed. I will continue to urge the Speaker to keep the House in
session until an extension of the unemployment compensation program is
passed.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health coverage and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not had
access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to afford
quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's
Health Insurance Marketplace
, though the deadline to enroll for coverage that starts on January
1st is just 10 days away. If you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year that you will enroll in, you're already
covered and won't need to enter the Marketplace for your health
coverage. If you aren't sure whether or not you will need to use the
Marketplace to get insurance, call the Marketplace Hotline at
1-800-318-2596 or visit www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option
for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health
insurance, you can sign up
for coverage that will take effect January 1, 2014 until
December 23, 2013. Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open until
March 31, 2014 if you miss the deadline for coverage starting in
January. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at out your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare
paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription medications as
we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health insurance companies
can no longer discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions
and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance
plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit Seedco Mid-South for
in-person help. Seedco is located at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900),
and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341. If you have any other
questions, you should also feel free to call my office at 901-544-4131.
Fully Funding the National Institutes of Health
On Wednesday, the House debated a bill called the Kids First Research
Act. Supporters of the legislation claim the bill will redirect the
spending of the tax dollars that fund political conventions-which amount
to a mere $13 million dollars, or less than 1% of the $1.5 billion cut
from the NIH this year through sequestration-to raise funding for
pediatric research, though in reality the bill does not guarantee that
funding will be used for research at all.
The NIH is our nation's true Department of Defense-it defends us from
cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, AIDS and diabetes. And its budget
for research into new cures is being decimated by sequestration. The $13
million in research funding this bill proposes doesn't replace even 1%
of the cuts made by sequestration. I spoke out about this attempt to
distract America from these cuts on the House floor. You can watch my
speech here
.
Memphis is home to the world's best pediatric cancer center, St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital. They deserve to be protected from these
cuts, as do the countless kids who will be stricken with diseases and
illnesses that research projects could cure if adequately funded. Those
kids-and all of those suffering with a disease or illness that could be
cured with adequate funding-need more than just the window-dressing this
bill would provide. And while the bipartisan budget deal that the House
passed yesterday gets us closer than this distraction, we need to do
more to ensure the NIH is fully funded.
Hope Scholarships
The Commercial Appeal reported this week
that the Tennessee Lottery is projecting enough revenue to fund
Hope Scholarships and other financial aid for as many as 102,000
Tennessee students. I worked for nearly two decades to establish the
lottery when I was in the Tennessee Senate because it would help young
people afford college. For more information about the Tennessee Lottery
Scholarship and other financial aid options available through the State
of Tennessee, visit www.tennessee.gov/tsac.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol Historical
Society calendars available. If you would like to receive next year's
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House, I am only able to mail calendars to residents of Tennessee's
Ninth District. Please feel free to share this email with other citizens
of the Ninth District who may be interested in receiving one but who do
not receive my eNewsletter.
Grants to Memphis
This week, I announced almost $220,000 to help St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital continue providing training for the world's first
class doctors who choose to pursue the path of children's medicine. You
can read more about the grant here
.
White House Internships
The White House Internship Program is currently accepting applications
from young people who are interested in government and devoted to public
service. If you-or anyone you know- would like to spend some time
working at the White House, gaining valuable professional experience and
building leadership skills, I would like to take this opportunity to
urge you to apply. The application deadline is January 5th, 2014. Click

Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my

to
the

stand

in
their

on
the
world
as

The
importance

that
he

played
a

my

Apologizing
for
past
wrongs
is
the
first

and
it
was
an

Passing
a
Bipartisan
Budget
Compromise
America
is
tired
of
government
by
crisis
and
of
a
Congress
that
lurches
from
one
shutdown
threat
to
the
next.
Last
night,
I
voted
for
a
two-year
bipartisan
budget
compromise
that
will
provide
the
stability
both
the
business
community
and
the
American
people
need
and
deserve.
The
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013
passed
the
House
by
a
332
to
94
vote,
putting
us
on
course
to
pass
the
first
budget
through
a
divided
Congress
since
1986.
You
can
watch
me
discussing
the
budget
deal
on
&#8220;America
Tonight&#8221;
by
clicking
here .
While
I
don&#8217;t
agree
with
everything
in
the
bill,
I
joined
President
Obama
in
supporting
it
because
it
is
a
significant
step
in
the
right
direction.
This
budget
will
also
alleviate
some
of
the
crippling
effects
of
sequestration
by
restoring
$25
billion
for
non-defense
discretionary
programs
like
Meals
on
Wheels,
LIHEAP,
and
research
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
that
could
lead
to
cures
for
debilitating
and
fatal
diseases.
Still,
I
am
disappointed
that
this
agreement
does
nothing
to
help
the
more
than
one
million
Americans
at
risk
of
losing
unemployment
benefits
just
days
after
Christmas.
Before
the
budget
passed
yesterday,
I
voted
to
ensure
this
agreement
extended
a
lifeline
to
those
Americans
looking
for
work,
but
Speaker
Boehner
and
his
colleagues
did
not
join
me
and
the
vote
failed.
I
will
continue
to
urge
the
Speaker
to
keep
the
House
in
session
until
an
extension
of
the
unemployment
compensation
program
is
passed.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
coverage
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace ,
though
the
deadline
to
enroll
for
coverage
that
starts
on
January
1 st
is
just
10
days
away .
If
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year
that
you
will
enroll
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014
until
December
23,
2013.
Enrollment
in
the
marketplace
will
remain
open
until
March
31,
2014
if
you
miss
the
deadline
for
coverage
starting
in
January.
Visit
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
look
at
out
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
recent
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay

Fully
Funding
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
On
Wednesday,
the
House
debated
a
bill
called
the
Kids
First
Research
Act.
Supporters
of
the
legislation
claim
the
bill
will
redirect
the
spending
of
the
tax
dollars
that
fund
political
conventions&#8212;which
amount
to
a
mere
$13
million
dollars,
or
less
than
1%
of
the
$1.5
billion
cut
from
the
NIH
this
year
through
sequestration&#8212;to
raise
funding
for
pediatric
research,
though
in
reality
the
bill
does
not
guarantee
that
funding
will
be
used
for
research
at
all.
The
NIH
is
our
nation&#8217;s
true
Department
of
Defense&#8212;it
defends
us
from
cancer,
heart
disease,
Alzheimer&#8217;s,
AIDS
and
diabetes.
And
its
budget
for
research
into
new
cures
is
being
decimated
by
sequestration. The
$13
million
in
research
funding
this
bill
proposes
doesn&#8217;t
replace
even
1%
of
the
cuts
made
by
sequestration.
I
spoke
out
about
this
attempt
to
distract
America
from
these
cuts
on
the
House
floor.
You
can
watch
my
speech
here .
Memphis
is
home
to
the
world&#8217;s
best
pediatric
cancer
center,
St.
Jude
Children&#8217;s
Research
Hospital.
They
deserve
to
be
protected
from
these
cuts,
as
do
the
countless
kids
who
will
be
stricken
with
diseases
and
illnesses
that
research
projects
could
cure
if
adequately
funded.
Those
kids&#8212;and
all
of
those
suffering
with
a
disease
or
illness
that
could
be
cured
with
adequate
funding&#8212;need
more
than
just
the
window-dressing
this
bill
would
provide.
And
while
the
bipartisan
budget
deal
that
the
House
passed
yesterday
gets
us
closer
than
this
distraction,
we
need
to
do
more
to
ensure
the
NIH
is
fully
funded.
