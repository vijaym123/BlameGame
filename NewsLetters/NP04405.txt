Statement on Passage of House
Keystone Pipeline
Legislation
11/14/14
Today,
following passage of H.R. 5682, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement:
Today, I voted in support of H.R. 5682 to approve the Keystone Pipeline.
It is long past time to begin this project. Tens of thousands of
American jobs and the secure transportation of hundreds of thousands of
barrels of oil will be a significant boost to our economy. I sincerely
hope that Senate Democrats will finally drop their arbitrary objections
and allow the Congress to put strong, bipartisan legislation on
President Obamas desk. The President will be making a major mistake if he
does not sign legislation reflecting the will of the American
people.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
