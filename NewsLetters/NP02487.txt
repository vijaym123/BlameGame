SPECIAL EDITION: The Scalise Capitol Report
It was a privilege to have Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address todays joint session of Congress, and an honor to serve as part of his host committee. The world could see that the United States Congress is united in our unwavering defense of Israels right to defend itself as well as our shared interest in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
I share the Prime Ministers concerns that the path we are on in these current negotiations with Iran will not adequately prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons capability. A bad deal with Iran will threaten Americas national security as well as the security of Israel, and threatens to kick off a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. As our closest ally in the Middle East, it was critical to hear firsthand from Israels Prime Minister about the threat that a nuclear armed Iran poses throughout the Middle East and the world.
On this meaningful day, I had the opportunity to host several visitors from Louisiana to watch the prime minister's speech in the Lincoln Room, just steps away from the House Chamber. Thank you to those who attended!
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
