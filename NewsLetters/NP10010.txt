Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
A Day in the Life
When I travel across Oklahoma, many people often ask what a day is like
for me in Washington, D.C. So on my social media this week, I
documented in posts and pictures the various events that happened
throughout the day. Below are just a few of the many snapshots of the
week.
Boarded the plane for an early flight to Washington, D.C.
Arrived in Washington, D.C. and ready to get to work.
Walking to the first vote series of the week and visiting with Capitol
Police.
Meeting with General Deering and the Oklahoma National Guard.
While I was in Washington, D.C., my team back in Oklahoma toured
tornado damage in Quapaw and kept me updated on recovery efforts.
Thanks to the many volunteer firefighters who came to help in aftermath
of Quapaw tornado.
Behind the scenes night tour to Second District residents from Okemah,
Locust Grove, Liberty and Kingston.
I start every morning with a devotion then head to work out.
Conference call with School Superintendents across the Second District.
Great to have Judy and James Wolfe from Eufaula stop by our Washington,
D.C. office.
View from my seat in the House Natural Resources Committee.
Another night tour, this time with folks from Durant.
A morning workout with some of my colleagues at a gym down the street
from the Capitol.
Heading to the final vote series of the week before catching a flight
back to Oklahoma.
Town Halls
This week I also began my fourth round of town halls and I look forward
to next week when I can share how they went. My team and I will be
making a stop in all 26 counties throughout the Second District during
the month of May, so check my website at www.mullin.house.gov
to see when we will be coming to your county.
Military Construction and Veterans Appropriations
Appropriations season in Congress began this week and will continue
through the end of September. One of the first items we voted on was
the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill. We
owe the greatest of debts to all of our men and women who have served
in the armed forces, and this bill will ensure our nation's veterans
have access to quality medical care and important job and training
programs when they return home.
The FY 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations
Bill includes discretionary funding for veterans programs totaling
$64.7 billion. This level of funding will increase access to mental
health care and homeless veterans programs, support continued efforts
to end the disability claims processing backlog, and ensure our
veterans have the support systems and infrastructure they need for a
sound quality of life through family housing and medical and education
facilities.
Votes
The U.S. House of Representatives voted on the following legislation
this week:
H.R. 4192: Regulates the height of buildings in Washington, D.C.
(passed, 267-16)
H.R. 4120: Amend the National Law Enforcement Museum (passed, 384-0)

H.R. 4486: Military Construction and Veterans Appropriations (passed,

H.R. 4487: Legislative Branch Appropriations (passed, 402-14)
Next Week
Two key oversight actions are slated to possibly happen next week. The
first being a vote by the full U.S. House of Representatives to form a
select committee that would look into the terrorist attacks in Benghazi
on September 11, 2012. The second being the consideration of a
resolution to find Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress, because she
would not comply with a subpoena from the House Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform.
