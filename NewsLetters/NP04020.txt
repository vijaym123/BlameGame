Dear Friends,
Our veterans deserve
only the best healthcare available and I am proud that the Veterans
Choice Program is helping make that goal a reality.
This program,
which I voted to help create, will allow those who have sacrificed so
much for our freedom to receive access to quality health care when
they are not being adequately helped by their local VA.
Many
veterans face a VA system that has not taken care of their needs and
has provided unacceptable care.
Under this new program, those who
have served our nation with honor and dignity will be able to visit
doctors in their communities rather than facing long wait times and long
trips to a VA facility.
Soon, every person enrolled in the VA
health system will begin to receive a Choice Card. This card will allow
veterans who live more than 40 miles away from a VA medical facility
and those who will have to wait more than 30 days for a medical
appointment to seek care from a medical provider of their choosing outside
the VA system.
The Veterans Choice Program will work to help
our nations heroes by allowing them to go outside of the system that
has failed them and finally get the care that they earned.
However, there is much work still to be done to reform a VA system which
has failed to serve many of our veterans.
I am committed to
reshaping our VA Health System and will continue to fight for the reforms
necessary to provide those who have made so many sacrifices for our
nation with the healthcare they deserve.
