Dear
Friend,
Like many of my fellow New Mexicans, I was shocked and outraged to
hear of recent reports of misconduct within the Veterans Affairs
Department that has resulted in secret waiting lists and long waits for
veterans seeking medical care.
We have learned that in Albuquerque
as many as 3,000 patients who needed a primary care physician were
placed in a "phantom" panel.
This is simply unacceptable and must
be fixed.
On Thursday, June 19, I will be hosting a
telephone town hall at 7 p.m. to talk with concerned constituents from across
the district about these issues plaguing the VA.
If you or
someone you know has had problems dealing with the VA, I encourage you to
join the discussion and share your story.
Hearing directly from
our veterans and their family members will help me continue to advocate
on their behalf and contribute to efforts to ensure these problems
are fully addressed and prevented from happening again.
If
you would like to participate in the telephone town hall on Thursday,
June 19 at 7 p.m. please
visit my website to sign
up , or call my Santa Fe office at (505) 984-8950 or my DC office at
(202) 225-6190.
Around 7 p.m. on Thursday, you will receive a call
connecting you to the forum.
The call is free to join; all you
have to do is stay on the line.
I hope you'll join us on
Thursday.
Sincerely,
Ben Ray
Lujn
