We're out of people to email you.
In the last week, you should have received an email from:
-- President Obama
-- Nancy Pelosi
-- And every other Democrat on the planet
But it just wasn&rsquo;t enough. The Koch Brothers&rsquo; last-minute ad blitz just made it too tough to catch up before last night&rsquo;s deadline.
We&rsquo;re not making this stuff up. Control of Congress is at stake. We're dangerously behind. And we just fell short on the final public fundraising deadline of the election.
So here&rsquo;s our last ditch effort: we&rsquo;re extending the triple-match TODAY ONLY. We need 9OOO more donations in the next 12 hours if we want any shot at giving President Obama a Democratic victory in this election. We're begging, David. Can you chip in right now?
1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: All Donations Today

If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
