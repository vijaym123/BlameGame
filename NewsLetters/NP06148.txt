Dear
Friends,
The House voted on some important bills last week and I would
like to discuss them with you over coffee.
I will be at four
local restaurants this week in Hartsville, Darlington, and Loris.
If these locations are not near you, I will schedule more coffee
meetings throughout the fall and hope to see you at one of those events.
In the meantime, if you need any assistance or have any questions
please call or email me.

American Solutions for Jobs and
Energy
On
Thursday, the House passed H.R. 4, the Jobs for America Act, and H.R. 2,
the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs
Act.
Together, these bills include more than two dozen
House-passed jobs and energy bills that will make everyday life easier for
American families.
This legislation cuts through the red tape
impeding job creation, approves energy projects like the Keystone Pipeline,
and provides taxpayers with relief by making common-sense tax credits
permanent.
My number one priority in Congress is jobs and the
economy.
I have made it my goal to make America more Competitive
again.
These two bills would make life easier for American
families, lower costs at the pump, and bring jobs back to the Palmetto
State.

House
Prevents Government Shutdown
Last week, the House passed a Continuing Resolution (CR)
to fund the federal government until December 11, 2014.
This
additional time should give Congress the time it needs to negotiate our
countrys financial obligations.
The legislation included
extensions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act through December 11 and the
Export-Import Bank through June 30, 2015.
The CR also included
authorizing language for the Department of Defense to train and equip vetted
Syrian opposition groups through the length of the CR, December 11, or
through the passage of the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization
Act, whichever occurs first.

Resolution

My Plan to Make America
Competitive Again
On Thursday, I introduced H.
Res. 745, the American Competitiveness Resolution.
I worked with
Harvard Business School Professors Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin in
drafting this legislation, which features findings from their intensive
study on American competitiveness.
According to the study, the
United States lags behind when compared to other countries. H.Res.745
instructs Congress to adopt a Contract with America to restore American
Competitiveness, which includes a roadmap to move our country forward.
This contract will be centered around the following eight
points:
Simplifying the corporate tax structure
with lower statutory rates and no
loopholes.
Taxing overseas profits earned by American multinational companies only
where they are earned.
Easing the immigration of
highly-skilled individuals.
Responsibly developing
Americas shale-gas and oil
reserves.
Aggressively addressing distortions and abuses in the international trading
system.
Improving American logistics, communications,
and energy infrastructure.
Simplifying and
streamlining Federal regulation.
Creating a sustainable
Federal budget, including entitlement
reform.
As always,
it is an honor and privilege to serve
you.
Have a good
week,
