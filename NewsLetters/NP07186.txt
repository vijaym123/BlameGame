Boehner's gonna be
FURIOUS. In less than
ONE
hour, he's coming to Colona for a massive fundraiser to rake in checks for Cheri's opponent.
BUT -- since we alerted you of Boehner's big event, something
AMAZING
has happened:
YOU. STEPPED. UP.
And
TOTALLY
wiped that smirk off Boehner&rsquo;s face.
Now, we&rsquo;re in range of
1,OOO
online donations for Cheri -- just in the last 48 hours!!!!
If we can do it, it'll ruin Boehner's hopes of a Republican takeover in Illinois. That sounds GREAT.
