More than 5,000 Participants on Tuesday Telephone Town Hall Meeting -
Thanks Everyone!
I can't do my job without your feedback on the key issues facing
Congress. And, I couldn't think of a more appropriate time to check in
with constituents across the Fourth Congressional District for that
input than last Tuesday evening. Our President put forth his vision for
the coming year in his State of the Union address. I thought your
thinking about our nation's future was equally important.
That's why I hosted a Telephone Town Hall meeting, a useful
communication tools that allowed me to connect directly via phone from
my office in Washington with folks at home in Duval, Nassau, and Baker
counties. More than 5,000 people took time to participate in the call,
listen in, ask great questions, and let me know their opinion on a wide
range of topics, including the economy, jobs, taxes, defense, national
security, and immigration.
Support for low federal spending, low taxes and a fairer tax code like
the Fairtax, a strong military, and opposition to amnesty dominated the
comments. Moving forward, I'll make sure the opinions of the callers
and all my constituents are brought to the debate in Congress.
Students Honored with Congress's Highest Award
It's really great to see our local students being recognized for their
efforts! Congratulations to the First Coast students who are members of
Beaches Habitat Education Program and recently received The
Congressional Award. The honor is the United States Congress's highest
award for young Americans for their achievement in volunteer public
service, personal development, physical fitness, and exploration. From

Farm Bill Provides Florida Citrus Industry with Research Funding to
Combat Citrus Greening Disease
Agriculture is the backbone of our country. In our state, it supports
more than two million American jobs: at $100-billion-per-year, that's
Florida second largest industry. This key economic sector needs support
from common-sense, market-based policies to thrive, and the five-year
House-Senate Farm Bill agreement passed by the House on Wednesday with
my support delivers just that.
In particular, Florida's signature citrus industry - a $9 billion
business - benefits from $125 million in research funding to combat the
devastating citrus greening disease that has taken a toll in our state
and others.
Accountability, reduction in the size and cost of the federal
government, utilization of market-oriented approaches, and most
importantly, a safe, affordable, and reliable food supply: all can be
found in the legislation.
As a result, taxpayers will save nearly $23 billion, and 16 million
Americans whose jobs depend on agriculture will have the certainty they
deserve to grow their businesses and create jobs. That's real progress
in my book.

Thanks
Everyone!
I
can&#8217;t
do
my

without
your

Congress.
And,
I

I
thought
your

about
our
nation&#8217;s
future
was
equally

That&#8217;s
why
I
hosted
a

a
useful
communication
tools
that
allowed
me
to
connect
directly
via

Farm
Bill
Provides
Florida
Citrus

Funding
to

Greening
Disease
Agriculture
is
the
backbone
of
our
country.
In
our
state,
it
supports
more
than
two
million
American
jobs:
at
$100-billion-per-year,
that&#8217;s
Florida
second
largest
industry.
This
key
economic
sector
needs
support
from
common-sense,
market-based
policies
to
thrive,
and
the
five-year
House-Senate
Farm
Bill
agreement
passed
by
the
House
on
Wednesday
with
my
support
delivers
just
that.
In
particular,
Florida&#8217;s
signature
citrus
industry
-
a
$9
billion
business
-
benefits
from
$125
million
in

disease
that

all

and

jobs.
That&#8217;s
real
progress
in
my
book.
