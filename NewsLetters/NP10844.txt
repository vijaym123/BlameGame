Dear Friend,
The legislative events of this week take a back seat to the tragic
shootings at Fort Hood, Texas that left three innocent victims dead and
16 others wounded. Like so many Americans, I am deeply saddened. My
thoughts are with those at Fort Hood, their families, and friends.
Please join me in praying for all those affected by this terrible
tragedy.
This week, the House unveiled its Fiscal Year 2015 Path to Prosperity
Budget that will expand opportunity by growing the economy and
fostering the creation of jobs.
The American people deserve a brighter future in an America that works.
Our budget balances in 10 years and works to pay off the country's
national debt through a $5.1 trillion reduction in spending. This is in
stark contrast to President Obama's proposed budget which never
balances. Our budget also preserves and strengthens health and
retirement benefits by reforming safety net programs through the
elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. With the right government and
spending reforms in place we can get America back on track.
This budget also honors our commitment to national defense and our men
and women in uniform. It provides funding to protect our country and to
provide our troops with the training, equipment, and compensation they
deserve. We must remember that the first responsibility of the federal
government is to protect the country from threats at home and abroad.
Our men and women in uniform have performed admirably as they take on
those threats. Our budget honors our troops and rejects the President's
cuts to national security. And as we honor today's servicemen and
women, this budget keeps faith with veterans who have honorably served
and protected this nation.
If Washington does not get serious about getting spending under
control, it will have to raise taxes on American families. It is
irresponsible to take more money from hardworking families to spend
more in Washington. Every family must live within its budget and
Washington must do the same. As a member of the House Budget Committee
I look forward to advancing this blueprint for America's future
prosperity.
Another piece of legislation passed by the House this week is the Save
American Workers Act, H.R. 2575, to protect American jobs by repealing
Obamacare's 30-hour definition of full-time employment.
The 30-hour rule is resulting in fewer jobs and reduced hours for many
American workers. An example of the impact can be found in the
situation of an hourly employee working 39 hours a week who sees his or
her hours cut to 29. That works out to approximately a week's pay over
the course of a month. There are already widespread reports of
employers reducing the number of hours for their workforces to below 30
hours so as not to trigger the penalty taxes associated with the
employer mandate.
Businesses that provide entry-level opportunities for younger workers,
school districts employing substitute teachers, and part time bus
drivers are disproportionately affected by the 30-hour rule. Recent
Hoover Institution research concluded the 30-hour rule puts 2.6 million
workers with a median income of under $30,000 at risk of losing their
jobs or hours. The research also shows that 89 percent of the workers
impacted by the rule do not have college degrees and that 63 percent
are women.
It is time to restore common sense to employment by restoring the
traditional 40-hour work week as the benchmark for full time
employment. I urge the Senate to take up this good legislation and
follow the lead of the House in approving it.
Lastly, it was a pleasure to have several groups and individuals visit
this week. It was an honor to meet with University of Missouri
President Tim Wolfe, participants from Columbia in Youth Build, and the
senior class of Heartland Christian School in Belton.

Have a great week.

Dear
Friend,
The
legislative
events
of
this
week
take
a
back
seat
to
the
tragic
shootings
at
Fort
Hood,
Texas
that
left
three
innocent
victims
dead
and
16
others
wounded.
Like
so
many
Americans,
I
am
deeply
saddened.
My
thoughts
are
with
those
at
Fort
Hood,
their
families,
and
friends.
Please
join
me
in
praying
for
all
those
affected
by
this
terrible
tragedy.
This
week,
the
House
unveiled
its
Fiscal
Year
2015
Path
to
Prosperity
Budget
that
will
expand
opportunity
by
growing
the
economy
and
fostering
the
creation
of
jobs.
The
American
people
deserve
a
brighter
future
in
an
America
that
works.
Our
budget
balances
in
10
years
and
works
to
pay
off
the
country&#8217;s
national
debt
through
a
$5.1
trillion
reduction
in
spending.
This
is
in
stark
contrast
to
President
Obama&#8217;s
proposed
budget
which
never
balances.
Our
budget
also
preserves
and
strengthens
health
and
retirement
benefits
by
reforming
safety
net
programs
through
the
elimination
of
waste,
fraud,
and
abuse.
With
the
right
government
and
spending
reforms
in
place
we
can
get
America
back
on
track.
This
budget
also
honors
our
commitment
to
national
defense
and
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
It
provides
funding
to
protect
our
country
and
to
provide
our
troops
with
the
training,
equipment,
and
compensation
they
deserve.
We
must
remember
that
the
first
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
is
to
protect
the
country
from
threats
at
home
and
abroad.
Our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
performed
admirably
as
they
take
on
those
threats.
Our
budget
honors
our
troops
and
rejects
the
President&#8217;s
cuts
to
national
security.
And
as
we
honor
today&#8217;s
servicemen
and
women,
this
budget
keeps
faith
with
veterans
who
have
honorably
served
and
protected
this
nation.
If
Washington
does
not
get
serious
about
getting
spending
under
control,
it
will
have
to
raise
taxes
on
American
families.
It
is
irresponsible
to
take
more
money
from
hardworking
families
to
spend
more
in
Washington.
Every
family
must
live
within
its
budget
and
Washington
must
do
the
same.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Budget
Committee
I
look
forward
to
advancing
this
blueprint
for
America&#8217;s
future
prosperity.
Another
piece
of
legislation
passed
by
the
House
this
week
is
the
Save
American
Workers
Act ,
H.R.
2575,
to
protect
American
jobs
by
repealing
Obamacare&#8217;s
30-hour
definition
of
full-time
employment.
The
30-hour
rule
is
resulting
in
fewer
jobs
and
reduced
hours
for
many
American
workers.
An
example
of
the
impact
can
be
found
in
the
situation
of
an
hourly
employee
working
39
hours
a
week
who
sees
his
or
her
hours
cut
to
29.
That
works
out
to
approximately
a
week&#8217;s
pay
over
the
course
of
a
month.
There
are
already
widespread
reports
of
employers
reducing
the
number
of
hours
for
their
workforces
to
below
30
hours
so
as
not
to
trigger
the
penalty
taxes
associated
with
the
employer
mandate.
Businesses
that
provide
entry-level

for
younger
workers,
school
districts
employing
substitute
teachers,
and
part
time
bus
drivers
are
disproportionately
affected
by
the
30-hour
rule.
Recent
Hoover
Institution
research
concluded
the
30-hour
rule
puts
2.6
million
workers
with
a
median
income
of
under
$30,000
at
risk
of
losing
their
jobs
or
hours.
The
research
also
shows
that
89
percent
of
the
workers
impacted
by
the
rule
do
not
have
college
degrees
and
that
63
percent
are
women.
It
is
time
to
restore
common
sense
to
employment
by
restoring
the
traditional
40-hour
work
week
as
the
benchmark
for
full
time
employment.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
take
up
this
good
legislation
and
follow
the
lead
of
the
House
in
approving
it.
Lastly,
it
