Dear
Friend,
Paper currency is an important part of our daily lives
and reflects our values, traditions and history as Americans. A recent
grassroots campaign engaging hundreds of thousands of Americans has
called attention to a big omission on our currency: An American woman.
Thats why last week, I introduced legislation to put a woman on the
twenty dollar bill so that our paper money finally reflects the
significant contributions of women to our country.
Heres
how my legislation would work: It would set up a panel of citizens to
come up with a recommendation for a woman to be on the twenty. The
portrait of the woman chosen would be included in the next redesign of
the bill, which typically happens every seven to ten years. This
process would be similar to the one used to change the portraits on our
currency nearly 100 years ago.
My legislation
follows a tremendous grassroots campaign called
Women on
20s
(or W20). W20 has gathered hundreds of thousands of online
votes in support of getting a woman on the twenty. Im honored to join
them in pursuit of this effort.
I encourage you
to go to the W20 website and vote for who you think should be the new
face of the twenty:
