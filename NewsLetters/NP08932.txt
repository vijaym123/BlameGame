Friend,
The sun is out, the Mariners are winning, and the countdown to the end
of the school year has begun! I know two little Kilmer girls that are
excited about at least two of those things (OK - I'm working on their
love of baseball).
In the two weeks since my last newsletter, there's been a lot going on
(and I've put a lot of miles on my car).
We attended some terrific Memorial Day events to honor all those who
sacrificed on behalf of our country. I was honored to join Lt Col
Stephen Keane, Navy League President Larry Salter, the Chaplain and
others on the USS Turner Joy to commemorate Memorial Day.
I did a bunch of "Kilmer at Your Company" visits - meetings with local
employers. As someone who spent the previous decade working in economic
development, I think it's important to hear what's on the minds of the
small businesses in our area and to find out how I can be helpful in
their efforts to grow local jobs. In the past few days, I met with
Interfor, Rayonier, Coastal Harvest, Wishkah River Distillery,
MultiCare, Crown Distributing, Jim's Pharmacy and others.
I also had the chance to tour a local working forest earlier this week
as part of the Olympic Peninsula Collaborative that we launched earlier
this year. We had a productive, informative discussion with local
leaders from the timber industry, environmental community, and
government agencies about how innovative forestry techniques can
actually improve the health of our forests and watersheds.
Listening to our Veterans
This week, I also had a roundtable discussion with local veterans at a
Tacoma VFW Post to listen to their experiences with the Veterans
Affairs health care system.
As you likely know, we recently received troubling news about the
system that cares for the health of our veterans.
A Veterans' Administration (VA) report released by the agency's own
Inspector General makes clear that they are failing them. Secretary
Shinseki has served our country honorably but this news proved we
needed a leadership change from the top down.
At home, we take pride in the fact that many of our friends and
neighbors are veterans themselves. So it sickens me that the VA has
broken our basic responsibility to provide quality health care to those
who served. It is clear that there must be significant, systemic change
within the VA and that we must hold accountable anyone more concerned
with looking good than doing good.
The necessary changes needed in the VA healthcare system begin with
hearing from those they impact. Having care that comes too little, too
late is not good enough for those who have put their lives on the line
for our nation. We need to regain the confidence of - and do right by -
our veterans and their families. So we are moving forward on bipartisan
bills to fix the problem and hold those who failed our veterans
accountable.
We have an obligation to get this done.
Saying Goodbye to a Great Tribal Leader
A historic leader passed away 2 weeks ago - Puyallup Tribal Council
Chairman Herman Dillon, Sr. Chairman Dillon served on the Puyallup
Tribal Council since 1971, and his life's diligent work for tribal
rights will leave a long-lasting mark on our state's history. The tribe
and our entire region are stronger and more prosperous as a result of
his vision and unwavering efforts to build a brighter future. He will
be sorely missed -- by the tribe, by our region, and by me. I spoke
on the House floor last week to honor Chairman Dillon and
also at his memorial service. Check out this Tacoma News Tribune
article for more details.
Working with the Bainbridge Island Community to Honor Japanese Americans
Earlier this year, I was contacted by the Bainbridge Island Japanese
American Community and the Japanese American Exclusion Memorial
Association asking for my help in formally renaming the memorial on
Bainbridge Island commemorating the experience of the Japanese American
community during World War II, when thousands of Japanese Americans
were forced from their homes. After working with local leaders, last
week I formally introduced a bill in Congress to formally recognize the
memorial as the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial
to appropriately and accurately reflect on this trying time in our
nation's history and to underscore for visitors that this is the first
place in the country where Japanese Americans were forcibly excluded
from their community. You can read about it in the Bainbridge Island
Review here
.
Remember: I Work For You
As I travel around the district I represent, I always try to remind
people that I work for you. If you are grappling with a federal agency -
if you're a veteran having difficulty with the VA, a senior citizen
with a Social Security issue, a small business dealing with a barrier
to success - do not hesitate to reach out to my office. We're here to
help.
Have a safe and enjoyable weekend.
As always, I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek

2014 Friend,
The
sun
is
out,
the
Mariners
are
winning,
and
the
countdown
to
the
end
of
the
school
year
has
begun!
I
know
two
little
Kilmer
girls
that
are
excited
about
at
least
two
of
those
things
(OK
&#8211;
I&#8217;m
working
on
their
love
of
baseball).
In
the
two
weeks
since
my
last
newsletter,
there&#8217;s
been
a
lot
going
on
(and
I&#8217;ve
put
a
lot
of
miles
on
my
car).
We
attended
some
terrific
Memorial
Day
events
to
honor
all
those
who
sacrificed
on
behalf
of
our
country. I
was
honored
to

Lt

Stephen
Keane,
Navy

President
Larry
Salter,
the
Chaplain
and
others
on
the
USS

to
commemorate
Memorial
Day.
I
did
a
bunch
of
&#8220;Kilmer
at
Your
Company&#8221;
visits
&#8211;
meetings
with
local
employers. As
someone
who
spent
the
previous
decade
working
in
economic
development,
I
think
it&#8217;s
important
to
hear
what&#8217;s
on
the
minds
of
the
small
businesses
in
our
area
and
to
find
out
how
I
can
be
helpful
in
their
efforts
to
grow
local
jobs. In
the
past
few
days,
I
met
with
Interfor,
Rayonier,
Coastal
Harvest,
Wishkah
River
Distillery,
MultiCare,
Crown
Distributing,
Jim&#8217;s
Pharmacy
and
others.
I
also
had
the
chance
to
tour
a
local
working
forest
earlier
this
week
as
part
of
the
Olympic
Peninsula
Collaborative
that
we
launched
earlier
this
year. We
had
a
productive,
informative
discussion
with
local
leaders
from
the
timber
industry,
environmental
community,
and
government
agencies
about
how
innovative
forestry
techniques
can
actually
improve
the
health
of
our
forests
and
watersheds.
Listening
to
our
Veterans
This
week,
I
also
had
a
roundtable
discussion
with
local
veterans
at
a
Tacoma
VFW
Post
to
listen
to
their
experiences
with
the
Veterans
Affairs
health
care
system.
As
you
likely
know,
we
recently
received
troubling
news
about
the
system
that
cares
for
the
health
of
our
veterans.
A
Veterans&#8217;
Administration
(VA)
report
released
by
the
agency&#8217;s
own
Inspector
General
makes
clear
that
they
are
failing
them.
Secretary
Shinseki
has
served
our
country
honorably
but
this
news
proved
we
needed
a
leadership
change
from
the
top
down.
At
home,
we
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
many
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
are
veterans
themselves.
So
it
sickens
me
that
the
VA
has
broken
our
basic
responsibility
to
provide
quality
health
care
to
those
who
served.
It
is
clear
that
there
must
be
significant,
systemic
change
within
the
VA
and
that
we
must
hold
accountable
anyone
more
concerned
with
looking
good
than
doing
good.
The
necessary
changes
needed
in
the
VA
healthcare
system
begin
with
hearing
from
those
they
impact.
Having
care
that
comes
too
little,
too
late
is
not
good
enough
for
those
who
have
put
their
lives
on
the
line
for
our
nation.
We
need
to
regain
the
confidence
of
&#8211;
and
do
right
by
&#8211;
our
veterans
and
their
families.
So
we
are
moving
forward
on
bipartisan
bills
to
fix
the
problem
and
hold
those
who
failed
our
veterans
accountable.
We
have
an
obligation
to
get
this
done.
Saying
Goodbye
to
a
Great
Tribal
Leader
A
historic
leader
passed
away
2
weeks
ago
-
Puyallup
Tribal
Council
Chairman
Herman
Dillon,
Sr.
Chairman
Dillon
served
on
the
Puyallup
Tribal
Council
since
1971,
and
his
life&#8217;s
diligent
work
for
tribal
rights
will
leave
a
long-lasting
mark
on
our
state&#8217;s
history. The
tribe
and
our
entire
region
are
stronger
and
more
prosperous
as
a
result
of
his
vision
and
unwavering
efforts
to
build
a
brighter
future. He
will
be
sorely
missed
--
by
the
tribe,
by
our
region,
and
by
me.
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
last
week
to
honor
Chairman
Dillon
and
also
at
his
memorial
service.

Working
with
the
Bainbridge
Island
Community
to
Honor
Japanese
Americans Earlier
this
year,
I
was
contacted
by
the
Bainbridge
Island
Japanese
American
Community
and
the
Japanese
American
Exclusion
Memorial
Association
asking
for
my
help
in
formally
renaming
the
memorial
on
Bainbridge

commemorating
the
experience
of
the
Japanese
American
community
during
World
War
II,
when
thousands
of
Japanese
Americans
were
forced
from
their
homes.
After
working
with
local
leaders,
last
week
I
formally
introduced
a
bill
in
Congress
to
formally
recognize
the
memorial
as
the
Bainbridge
Island
Japanese
American
Exclusion
Memorial
to
appropriately
and
accurately
reflect
on
this
trying
time
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history
and
to
underscore
for
visitors
that
this
is
the
first
place
in
the
country
where
Japanese
Americans
were
forcibly
excluded
from
their
community.

it
