David, I&rsquo;m asking you for your support.
The first FEC fundraising deadline since Tea Party ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling won the nomination is just 24 hours away. But right now, we still have a pretty big hole to fill in our budget.
Last time around, our race against Mr. Schilling cost over $14 million. That&rsquo;s why these deadlines are so important. We can&rsquo;t afford to fall behind with my opponent planning on spending so much cash.
David, I know we can do this -- just like we have before. But I need you to dig deep. Will you help us close the gap? Use this link to rush an urgent donation of $3 or whatever you can to our campaign:
