David, I&rsquo;m asking for your urgent support.
This morning, a
seventh
right-wing group launched a last minute ad buy to drag my name through the mud. Look, I don&rsquo;t care how many of these groups come after me.
I won&rsquo;t stop fighting for the people of Illinois.
I know I can&rsquo;t win this thing on my own. The latest ad buy is almost $300,000 and it starts tomorrow.
So, David, I&rsquo;m counting on you.
Please pitch in what you can before the ads begin. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Every dollar counts.
