Second Round
of Talks Between Havana and Washington Undercut American Values,
Undermine Our National Security, Says
Ros-Lehtinen
(Washington, DC)
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), made the
following statement regarding the talks between the United States and
Cuba:
It is most appalling to see the United States
negotiate with Cuba in the same week it commemorated the
19th anniversary of the Brothers to the Rescue shoot down. Raul Castro pinning
medals to Cuban spy Gerardo Hernandez, who played a role in the murder
of three U.S. citizens and one permanent resident, is an appalling
symptom of the regimes refusal to change its repressive
nature. These misguided talks with the Castro regime, as well as the continued
concessions by the United States, will not help the people of Cuba and
instead only legitimize and embolden the Cuban
tyranny."

Maduro Imposes U.S. Visa Restrictions, Limits Embassy Staff
Amid Growing Tensions
On Saturday, Maduro
said he was producing his own list of U.S. officials who would be barred
from entering Venezuela for their roles in Iraq, Syria and Vietnam.
Topping that list, he said, were President Bush, former Vice President
Dick Cheney and the former head of the CIA George Tenet. Florida
lawmakers Sen. Marco Rubio, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, all Republicans and outspoken critics of Venezuela, are on the
list, as is New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob
Menendez.
Ros-Lehtinen, however, fired back in a statement to the
Herald.
Im honored to be prohibited from entering Venezuela by its
thug-in-chief, Maduro,
she said.
This is just another example of
Maduro taking orders from the Castro regime [in Cuba] and trying to
create a distraction from the deprivations of liberty in Venezuela and
his disastrous policies .
