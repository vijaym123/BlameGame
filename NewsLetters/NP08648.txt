A Minute with Mike
Dear Friend,
For the last month and a half, Congress has been hard at work drafting
the bills that will fund the federal government for Fiscal Year 2015.
As a senior Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I have been
committed to advocating for the needs of my constituents as our
committee develops, and the House considers, these bills. For example,
I am proud to have secured language in the Commerce, Justice, and
Science spending bill to support faster DNA rape kit processing,
support advanced manufacturing, and fund programs combating human
trafficking. You can learn more here: http://1.usa.gov/1p9in2m
.
My work representing Santa Clara and Alameda Counties is about more
than just legislation. I believe it is also essential that I continue
serving as a voice for their concerns and their communities. I am doing
this through activities as diverse as commemorating LGBT Pride Month,
APA Heritage Month, Jewish American Heritage Month, and more.
Celebrating the unique diversity of the American people is an honor and
a privilege.
As always, I am happy to share this update on my work in Congress with
you. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time, by email, or
social media.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress
P.S. I always appreciate your feedback. As I continue finding the best
way to continue our conversations, I would love to know - how often
would you like to receive my newsletter?

APA Heritage Month
As Chair Emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus
(CAPAC), and the proud Representative of the first majority ??Asian
American and Pacific Islander? district in the mainland United States,
I was thrilled to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in
June. This was a chance to reflect on the progress we have made in
advancing civil rights, social justice, and economic opportunity. ??
Thank you for the kind words Joe! (:15s)
To continue this celebration, I was honored to take part in the APA
Heritage Month opening ceremony for the White House Initiative on Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders, where I welcomed Vice President Biden
to the stage!

Bring Back Our Girls
After the shocking kidnapping of 250 Nigerian girls by the militant
group Boko Haram, I was proud to lead on a letter, with Reps. Barbara
Lee and Robert Pittenger, commending President Obama for the actions he
has taken to aid in their rescue. Co-signed by a bipartisan group of
170 of our colleagues in the House, our letter sent a strong message to
the President to bring them home. As we wrote, "The mass kidnapping and
threat of human trafficking are human right violations that cannot be
tolerated. Human trafficking is a form of modern day slavery, which
America must proactively seek to end."

People's Choice Award
Each spring, the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives sponsor a
nation-wide high school arts competition. The Artistic Discovery
Contest is open to all high school students in the 17th District. The
over-all winner of our district's competition, as judged by a panel of
community judges from both Santa Clara and Alameda Counties, will be
displayed for one year in the U.S. Capitol. As one of the most open and
transparent Members of Congress, I wanted to open up the voting process
to everyone! That is why I am excited to recognize the winners of the
second annual CA-17 People's Choice Award. The winners of this award
were selected on Facebook.

Fighting the Impact of Agent Orange
Highlights from our press conference introducing the Toxic Exposure Act
(6:32)
Joined by veterans and their families who were exposed to the toxic
effects of Agent Orange, I was proud to introduce the Toxic Exposure
Research and Military Family Support Act of 2014. This bill will extend
care to a greater number of veterans who have been affected by exposure
to toxic substances.
In addition, it will extend coverage to children, grandchildren, and
subsequent generations, who medical and scientific studies have shown
are also experiencing long term negative effects of exposure. Many are
suffering from various forms of birth defects. It is time for us to
take care of not just those who served, but also their children whose
diseases can be linked to their parent's exposure to Agent Orange.

Climate Change Education Act
Climate Change: It's Time (1:02)
To improve people's knowledge of the risks of climate change, I was
proud to introduce the Climate Change Education Act of 2014. This bill
is an update of the Global Warming Education Act that I first
introduced in 2007.
This bill will create a Climate Change Education Program in the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It will broaden the
understanding of human-induced climate change, the possible long- and
short-term consequences, and potential solutions. The program will
promote education about national strategies for resilience to the
effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising
sea levels, to make sure our infrastructure is safe and reliable. The
latest scientific and technological discoveries will be implemented to
provide formal and informal learning opportunities to people of all
ages.

Summit on Working Families, with Labor Secretary Perez
Speaking at the Summit on Working Families
Too many working families are struggling to make ends meet as they
juggle the competing demands of work and family. When I spoke at the
"Summit on Working Families" along with Labor Secretary Thomas Perez,
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and
others, I stressed the need for paid leave and fair wages, especially
for working parents. Our economy works best when it works for everyone.

City of Fremont Annual Legislative Event
At the City of Fremont Third Annual Legislative event, I was pleased to
discuss regional transportation and infrastructure with local leaders,
including Mayor Bill Harrison, State Senate Majority Leader Ellen
Corbett, Rep. Eric Swalwell, and others. As we all know, transportation
is about so much more than steel and cement - it's about connecting
people with where they need to go. I am proud to be a strong supporter
of Silicon Valley's transportation needs in Congress, fighting to get
federal money for projects essential for our community, like the $900
million I secured for the BART extension to Silicon Valley. Investing
in transportation is good for business, good for the environment, and
good for our way of life.
