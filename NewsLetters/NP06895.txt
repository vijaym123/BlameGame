Dear Friend,
As a father of three, the growing
epidemic of human trafficking deeply
disturbs me.In Ohio, we recognize
that these crimes are increasingly
prevalent. According to the Ohio Human
Trafficking Task Force, more than 1,000
children become victims each year and more
than 3,000 are at risk.
Though it is hard to believe abuse is so
prevalent in Ohio, recent news of
successful recoveries and arrests draw our
attention to just how serious this problem
is. In June, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and its local, state,
and federal law enforcement partners and
the National Center for Missing &amp;
Exploited Children (NCMEC) conducted
Operation Cross Country, a week-long
initiative to address child sex trafficking
throughout the United States. In the
Cleveland area, 16 children were rescued
and 12 individuals were arrested during a
raid that was part of Operation Cross
Country. Earlier this month, Attorney
General Mark DeWine announced the rescue of
three women believed to be victims of human
trafficking. Just last week, 11 people were
arrested after a human trafficking sting at
a Bowling Green hotel.
This week, I had the opportunity to
visit the Medina Childrens Center to
discuss the impact of local area abuse and
the centers work to address it. The
center was founded in 2005 to serve our
local community through a coordinated
approach to helping children and the
families of victims of abuse cut through
the red tape that often hurts the people it
intends to help. Since 2007, the Medina
Childrens Center has helped more
than 1,400 children in Medina County. I met
with the Board of Directors and toured the
facility, and I am truly impressed by the
Centers dedication to initiating
change in our community and I am grateful
for their hard work.
As a member of the House Ways &amp;
Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, I
have participated in an ongoing
investigation into our countrys
foster care system and its connection to
trafficking. What we learned is troubling:
our child welfare system does not go far
enough to protect our youth from becoming
victims of human
trafficking.According to research
cited by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the majority of
trafficked youth experienced abuse growing
up and victims of sexual abuse are nearly
30 times more likely to be involved in
prostitution than those who did not suffer
abuse.
That is why we in the House of
Representatives acted to pass several bills
to stop child trafficking and protect
children in foster care. Just last month,
the House unanimously passed the Preventing
Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families
Act, bipartisan legislation that reflects
agreements reached between House and Senate
negotiators. This legislation is designed
to prevent sex trafficking of youth in
foster care, encourage the adoption of more
children from foster care, and increase
child support collection, among other
important purposes. Additionally, the House
recently passed theStrengthening
Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act,
a bill that improves practices within state
child welfare systems to identify, assess,
and document sex trafficking victims by
adding assurances in the state plan for
grants for child abuse or neglect
prevention and treatment programs.
I applaud Governor Kasich, Attorney
General DeWine, the Childrens Center
in Medina, and all of those in Ohio who are
working hard to fight abuse and stop
trafficking in our state. Though we have
made progress, there is still much work to
be done. I look forward to sharing the
Human Resources Subcommittees
progress in the future, as well as the
House of Representatives ongoing
effort to protect our countrys
children and those who are vulnerable to
abuse.
