Supporting Good American
Jobs
With Joe
Block (left), Mike Corrigan (right) and other Block Steel employees at
their manufacturing center in Skokie, Illinois.
For too long, the U.S. economy has
been rigged in favor of companies that ship jobs and profits overseas.
But not all companies have followed that destructive path. Some
companies, like Block Steel in Skokie, Illinois, have grown their workforce,
paid good wages and benefits (including retirement benefits) and made
their communities stronger.
We must reward employers, like CEO
Joe Block, who put these patriotic values into their business model and
truly care about their employees and our country
not just maximizing
profits. Thats why I introduced the Patriot Employer Tax Credit
Act. Senator Dick Durbin has introduced the Senate version.

for all the details on this
legislation.
In late May, I toured Block Steel. The company would benefit
directly from the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act. I spoke with Joe Block,
Mike Corrigan of Teamsters Local 731 and several Block Steel
employees. They welcome and support this common-sense legislation. All across
our community and country, people need us to strengthen companies like
Block Steel. If the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act is enacted, we
can give substantial tax credits to patriotic employers, paid for by
closing
$50 billion in tax loopholes
for those who ship
jobs and profits overseas. Dont just take my word for it; the Patriot
Employer Tax Credit Act has gotten some media attention. Please see

Addressing the Dangerous Trend of Data
Breaches
Late last month, reports emerged that hackers gained access to past tax
returns of more than 100,000 people. You will be contacted by the IRS
in a letter if your information was affected.

to learn about how you can protect
yourself.
Unfortunately, this is just one of the latest of a series of public and
private data breaches that have harmed consumers across our country. In
fact, as I was writing this, news broke of a data breach at the Office
of Personnel Management. Over the past decade, almost one billion
records with personal information have been compromised
things like
Social Security numbers, birth dates, address and even tax filing
status.
In many cases, those breaches were not highly sophisticated, and
in some cases, consumers were never made aware that their information
was compromised.
As the IRS hack reminds us, those data breaches
have very real consequences.
The Commerce, Manufacturing,
and Trade Subcommittee
where I serve as the top Democrat
has been
considering legislation regarding data breaches. As I have
consistently stated, that legislation must require entities holding
sensitive data to adequately protect it and to notify users or customers in
the event of a breach. Had both of those requirements been in place, the
IRS breach might not have been as effective or wide-ranging as it
was. I will continue to work to enact legislation that prioritizes data
security. Thanks for reading!
