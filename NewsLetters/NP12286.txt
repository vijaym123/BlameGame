A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
February 16, 2014
Dear friends,
When it rains, it pours. Change that to snow and that about sums up
this week.both literally and metaphorically. The House concluded
legislative business one day early to get folks out of town ahead of an
impending snow storm, but not before it considered two of my bills or
before I had the opportunity to question the new federal reserve chair,
Janet Yellen. I also managed to squeeze in a quick visit with the crew
at Fox & Friends. Keep reading for a wrap-up of the week that was.
412-4: House Passes Bill to Help Small Businesses Grow & Create Jobs:
We all realize that job creation, especially with a slower moving
economy, is incredibly important, and job creation at the higher levels
comes from our small businesses and our emerging growth companies. I
was very glad the House came together this week to overwhelmingly pass
my bipartisan bill,
H.R. 3448, the Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of
2013.
In a piece published by The Wall Street Journal, job growth advocates
said this bill is, "an essential step towards fostering the liquidity
and capital formation necessary to promote job growth. We thank
Congressman Duffy and his colleagues for their efforts in this
important area." I am hopeful that H.R. 3448 will next gain traction in
the Senate. Click on the image for my full statement on the bill and to
watch my Floor remarks:
Protecting Your Privacy & Reforming the CFPB: Later that same day, the
House also began debate on my bill to reform the dangerously
unaccountable and dangerously powerful Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB). My bill is comprised of a number of pieces of
legislation that would reign in the CFPB, including one particular
reform that would require the agency to ask permission before
collecting personal information on Americans. During debate, I argued
in part,
"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is collecting data and
information on almost one billion credit cards.do you think they've
asked the American people's permission to take their financial data?
Absolutely not.
"All we ask for in this reform bill is, if you want to take the
American people's financial data, and you say you are here to protect
the American citizenry, then why don't you ask them?"

Thanks! I took a detour on my way home to Wisconsin to catch-up with
the crew at Fox & Friends. We had a great conversation about this past
week's Floor action, including my CFPB bill, and I also appreciated the
opportunity to talk about the 7th District and the great people and
families I have the incredible privilege or representing. Click on the

Speaking of the great people of Wisconsin's 7th, I hope to see some of
you at one of this week's town halls. Details in the column on the
right. If not this week, I hope to catch-up with you soon.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friends,
When
it
rains,
it
pours.
Change
that
to
snow
and
that
about
sums
up
this
week&#8230;both
literally
and
metaphorically.
The
House
concluded
legislative
business
one
day
early
to
get
folks
out
of
town
ahead
of
an
impending
snow
storm,
but
not
before
it
considered
two
of
my
bills
or
before
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
new
federal
reserve
chair,
Janet
Yellen.
I
also
managed
to
squeeze
in
a
quick
visit
with
the
crew
at
Fox
&amp;
Friends.
Keep
reading
for
a
wrap-up
of
the
week
that
was&#8230;
412-4:
House
Passes
Bill
to
Help
Small
Businesses
Grow
&amp;
Create
Jobs :
We
all
realize
that
job
creation,
especially
with
a
slower
moving
economy,
is
incredibly
important,
and
job
creation
at
the
higher
levels
comes
from
our
small
businesses
and
our
emerging
growth
companies.
I
was
very
glad
the
House
came
together
this
week
to
overwhelmingly
pass
my
bipartisan
bill,
H.R.
3448,
the
Small
Cap
Liquidity
Reform
Act
of
2013.
In
a
piece
published
by
The
Wall
Street
Journal ,
job
growth
advocates
said
this
bill
is,
&#8220; an
essential
step
towards
fostering
the
liquidity
and
capital
formation
necessary
to
promote
job
growth.
We
thank
Congressman
Duffy
and
his
colleagues
for
their
efforts
in
this
important
area.&#8221;
I
am
hopeful
that
H.R.
3448
will
next
gain
traction
in
the
Senate.

Protecting
Your
Privacy
&amp;
Reforming
the
CFPB:
Later
that
same
day,
the
House
also
began
debate
on
my
bill
to
reform
the
dangerously
unaccountable
and
dangerously
powerful
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB).
My
bill
is
comprised
of
a

of
pieces

that
would

the
CFPB,
including
one
particular
reform
that
would
require
the

to

permission
before

on
Americans.
During
debate,
I
argued
in

&#8220;The
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
is
collecting
data
and
information
on
almost
one billion credit
cards&#8230;do
you
think
they&#8217;ve
asked
the
American
people&#8217;s
permission
to
take
their
financial
data?
Absolutely
not.
&#8220;All
we
ask
for
in
this
reform
bill
is,
if
you
want
to
take
the
American
people&#8217;s
financial
data,
and
you
say
you
are
here
to
protect
the
American
citizenry,
then
why
don&#8217;t
you
ask
them?&#8221;
