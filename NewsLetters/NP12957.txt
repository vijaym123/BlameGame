Friends,
Over the past year, I have led a House Armed Services Committee
investigation into the terrorist attack on an American diplomatic
compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans. Our
investigation has sought answers about whether the Department of
Defense was properly positioned prior to the attack, how it responded
to the attack, and what changes have been made to minimize the chance
of such an attack occurring again.
We have now released testimony from our classified hearings with
various military leaders, including troops on the ground that night in
Libya, commanders in the North Africa region, and the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff - our nation's highest ranking military officer.
Soon the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will release an
interim report that establishes our findings to date.
Already, the testimony transcripts are gaining the attention of the
national media. I was especially impressed by the thorough reporting of
Fox News'
Chief Washington Correspondent James
Rosen and CNN
Foreign Affairs Correspondent Elise
Labbot. You can watch those stories at the YouTube links below.
For information on our investigation, including links to transcripts
and various reports, visit Roby.House.Gov/Benghazi.
Promoting Adoption
This week marks 41 years since the landmark Supreme Court decision in
Roe vs. Wade. Since then, approximately 56 million unborn children have
been aborted in the United States. As pro-life advocates work to
increase protection for life under the law, I believe it is just as
important to promote the respect for life in our society, emphasizing
adoption as a loving alternative to abortion. During a speech on the
House
floor last week, I highlighted a great
Alabama-based organization that facilitates family adoptions called
AGAPE
.
Talk to anyone who has gone through either side of the adoption process
and they'll tell you how challenging it is. That's where AGAPE comes
in. AGAPE is there to find permanent, safe, nurturing families for
children and to make sure all involved in the adoption process have the
support they need.
It is groups like AGAPE that help a woman with an unplanned pregnancy
know about the loving, non-judgmental way adoption works. It is groups
like AGAPE that give children the hope and opportunity to grow up
healthy and happy. It's groups like AGAPE that make it possible for
families who don't think they can ever have children to experience the
unique blessing of adoption and be made whole.
Adoption is humanity's recognition of the miracle of life; an
affirmation that every life matters and that each person has value in
this world.
I am committed to protecting life under the law, but I also want to
promote life by supporting birth mothers, adoptive parents, and
organizations like AGAPE that connect them.
The Week Ahead
Next week marks the first "District Work Week" of the new year, and I
am looking forward to making stops in Pike, Montgomery, and Barbour
counties. Whether it is visiting with a small business owner or
stopping by one of our local schools, I always find time spent
traveling the district to be highly beneficial. Meeting face-to-face
with those I represent to hear their concerns firsthand makes me a
better Member of Congress.

way I can be of assistance to you. You can always log on to

Promoting

This

Since
then,
approximately

As

I
believe
it
is
just
as
important
to
promote
the

for

in
our
society,
emphasizing
adoption
as
a
loving
alternative
to
abortion.
