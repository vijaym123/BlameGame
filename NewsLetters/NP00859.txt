Week in Review
Every day when I drive to work
in Washington, I pass by the Iwo
Jima Memorial and Arlington
National Cemetery. These monuments
and grave sites serve as a
testament to the sacrifices of our
Armed Services and constantly
remind me of this country's
responsibility to care for our
heroes.
One of the greatest privileges
of serving Nevada in the US Senate
is the opportunity to sit on the
Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
With Nevada being home to over
300,000 veterans, I remain
committed to advocating on behalf
of the issues facing our
veterans.
Chief among them is the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
disability claims backlog.
Just last week, Senator Bob Casey
(D-PA) and I held a press
conference to introduce the
21st
Century Veterans Benefits Delivery
Act (S. 1203) , legislation
designed to create a system that
can withstand surges in disability
claims without generating another
veterans' disability claims
backlog.
We also released the
VA
Backlog Working Group 2015
Report
in which we identify the
progress that has been made on the
claims backlog since 2014, which
Working Group recommendations have
been implemented by the VA and
Congress, and what actions must
still be taken to fully transition
the VA toa 21st century
benefits delivery system. I am
proud to spearhead the
VA
Backlog Working Group
with
Senator Casey in an effort to
ensure a continued decline in wait
time for veterans' benefit claims.
Following the
rollout ,
Senator Casey and I went on MSNBC's
Morning Joe. You can click

to watch our joint interview. The
current red tape that veterans face
is unacceptable, and until the
backlog is eliminated, I won't back
down.
Recently, I testified at the
Senate Committee on Environment
&amp; Public Works hearing
regarding endangered species.
During my testimony, I emphasized
that the Endangered Species Act is
out of date and ineffective and
discussed a legislative effort (
S.
1036 ) to improve sage-grouse
conservation. The hearing addressed
legislation that I introduced, the
Common
Sense in Species Protection Act of
2015 (S. 112) . This legislation
is designed to force the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to
take into account the full economic
impact of proposed critical habitat
designation for endangered species
candidates like the greater
sage-grouse. No doubt, a listing of
the sage-grouse would devastate
Nevada's way of life, and this bill
forces the Department of Interior
to be forthright about a listing's
economic impact.
I also spoke on the Senate floor
regarding privacy of American
citizens. During my time on the
floor, I spoke in support of the
USA
FREEDOM Act . This legislation
ends bulk data collection practices
currently used by the government
under Section 215 of the PATRIOT
Act and carefully balances the
privacy rights of Americans and the
needs of the intelligence community
as it works to keep our country
safe. I am an original
cosponsor
of the legislation
introduced
earlier this year.
The last couple of weeks have
proven to be productive. I will
continue to voice the concerns of
my fellow Nevadans as the month
progresses.
