Looking Towards 2015
As 2014 comes to a close, Id like to take time to reflect and express my gratitude for every blessing my family and I have received this year. I am truly honored and grateful to represent Mississippis 4 th
Congressional District in Congress.
Over the course of the 113 th
Congress,
I
have fought hard to make a better America for you and your family.
Still, there is much work to be done and I am ready to take on the tremendous task that lies ahead. As
2015
draws closer, I am excited to return to Washington with conservative friends in both the House and the Senate. I look forward to working with them in the 114 th
Congress to pass legislation focused on the conservative values important to you, my constituents.
I am fortunate to serve the good people of South Mississippi, and I always appreciate hearing
f rom you . I encourage you to sign up for my regular e-newsletter or cl ick the button above to email me.
This holiday season Im reminded of what makes Mississippi, and America, greatFaith, Family, and Freedom. These values are the backbone of my representation of our great state, and I vow to continue to work for a brighter future for Mississippians and all Americans with the start of 2015.
I wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and may God continue to bless our nation for generations to come.
Sincerely,
Steven M. Palazzo
