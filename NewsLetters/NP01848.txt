Friend,
On election night 2014, we were down by 3,011 votes.
It took over two weeks for the race to be called
and we won by only 1,455 votes in what was one of the closest races in the country.
That&#39;s why we can&#39;t take anything for granted.
In the face of millions of dollars in outside spending, we only won because of the resourcefulness and commitment of our grassroots team. Now, as Ami is named a national target yet
again, we have to lay the groundwork early for a winning campaign.
And with a strong showing now, we hope to deter another self-funding opponent from jumping into our race.
Our first important deadline is this Tuesday, March 31 st
and thankfully,
two of our long time supporters will match EVERY donation dollar-for-dollar until the deadline (up to $10,000).
Can you pitch in $5 or more now, and have your gift doubled?
We need Ami in Congress so he can continue his work to break through the gridlock and move our country forward -- and while he&#39;s focusing his efforts there, we hope we can count on you to help us before our first deadline.
We are almost halfway to our goal.
Click here and help put us over the finish line.
We&rsquo;ve got just 4 days to go.
Team Bera
P.S. Early investments are critical for a race like ours-- even $3 or $5 adds up as we work to hit our goals.
Give today to double your impact with our dollar-for-dollar match.
