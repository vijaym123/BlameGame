Friend,
We just received terrible news - Karl Rove&#39;s group Crossroads placed a
$1.1 million ad buy
for the week before the election. Soon, voters won&#39;t be able to turn on their TVs without seeing Rove&#39;s deceitful ads trying to mislead folks about Ami&#39;s record.
We need your help, and we need it now. Click here and give $5, $10, or more immediately.

Fight back against Karl Rove: $250
Fight back against Karl Rove: $500
Or donate another amount.
Rove&#39;s Crossroads is one of multiple special interest groups spending millions in our race.
Make no mistake - THEY ARE TRYING TO BUY THIS ELECTION.
And with more than
$8 million dollars
total being spent against Ami, they just might succeed.
PLEASE, rush a contribution TODAY. Without it, our message will be lost among the attacks.
We won&#39;t be able to match them dollar for dollar, but we must be able to increase our own ad buy, to break through the noise.
We have a plan to win this - but we need your urgent help.
Thanks.
Team Bera
PS - Combating millions of dollars on TV won&#39;t be easy, but we have the largest field operation in the country and a plan to win.
Help us fight back so voters know the truth about Ami&#39;s record-- please rush $5 or more to our campaign right now.
