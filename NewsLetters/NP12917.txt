Tell Mark: Farm Bill Survey The House is scheduled to vote
tomorrow on a Farm Bill that reduces federal spending by $23 billion,
including reforms to close loopholes in the food stamp program that would
save $8 billion. It eliminates or consolidates more than 100 U.S.
Department of Agriculture programs and replaces outdated direct subsidies
for farmers with a strengthened crop insurance program. The bill also
reauthorizes PILT (Payment In Lieu of Taxes), which impacts every
county in the 11th District, through 2014. Do you support this
legislation? Yes No Undecided *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my
