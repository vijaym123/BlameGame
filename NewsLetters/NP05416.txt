Today, I sent a letter to President Obama and Cabinet officials
demanding answers on the United States' response to the Ebola Virus,
and urged the President to work with Congress to take further action to
stop the spread of the disease.
The United States now faces two very different but grave national
security threats - the spread of Ebola from West Africa and the growth
of ISIS in the Middle East. President Obama should present
comprehensive response plans and authorization requests to combat these
crises to Congress and the American people, and we should return to DC
promptly to debate and vote on them.
I have heard from many constituents like you who are afraid, and have
little confidence that the Administration's response has been
sufficient. What's the next step to prevent exposing Americans to the
disease? Why isn't the Administration at least restricting tourist
travel to and from Ebola-stricken countries? How do we account for
individuals that aren't stopped for screening or pass airport screening
procedures because they're not yet exhibiting symptoms?
I have asked the Administration for a justification on the approval of
B-2 tourist visas for individuals from countries hit hardest by the
Ebola outbreak. I also asked how each agency is responding to the
approximately 21-day gap between when individuals contract the virus
and when they begin to show symptoms, particularly as it pertains to
individuals entering the United States from West Africa.
No one wants to stop humanitarian and medical assistance from reaching
West Africa, but I fail to see any national security or humanitarian
reason for allowing high-risk individuals - like Mr. Duncan - to enter
our country for purely tourist reasons while the disease is
uncontained. Rather than issuing an outright refusal on further travel
restrictions to and from West Africa, the U.S. should explore every
feasible and available option to restrict all non-essential travel.
Thank you,
Tom Rooney

Representative
Thomas
Rooney
Date,

Today,
I
sent
a
letter
to
President
Obama
and
Cabinet
officials
demanding
answers
on
the
United
States&#8217;
response
to
the
Ebola
Virus,
and
urged
the
President
to
work
with
Congress
to
take
further
action
to
stop
the
spread
of
the
disease.
The
United
States
now
faces
two
very
different
but
grave
national
security
threats
&#8211;
the
spread
of
Ebola
from
West
Africa
and
the
growth
of
ISIS
in
the
Middle
East.
President
Obama
should
present
comprehensive
response
plans
and
authorization
requests
to
combat
these
crises
to
Congress
and
the
American
people,
and
we
should
return
to
DC
promptly
to
debate
and
vote
on
them.
I
have
heard
from
many
constituents
like
you
who
are
afraid,
and
have
little
confidence
that
the
Administration&#8217;s
response
has
been
sufficient.
What&#8217;s
the
next
step
to
prevent
exposing
Americans
to
the
disease?
Why
isn&#8217;t
the
Administration
at
least
restricting
tourist
travel
to
and
from
Ebola-stricken
countries?
How
do
we
account
for
individuals
that
aren&#8217;t
stopped
for
screening
or
pass
airport
screening
procedures
because
they&#8217;re
not
yet
exhibiting
symptoms?
I
have
asked
the
Administration
for
a
justification
on
the
approval
of
B-2
tourist
visas
for
individuals
from
countries
hit
hardest
by
the
Ebola
outbreak.
I
also
asked
how
each
agency
is
responding
to
the
approximately
21-day
gap
between
when
individuals
contract
the
virus
and
when
they
begin
to
show
symptoms,
particularly
as
it
pertains
to
individuals
entering
the
United
States
from
West
Africa.
No
one
wants
to
stop
humanitarian
and
medical
assistance
from
reaching
West
Africa,
but
I
fail
to
see
any
national
security
or
humanitarian
reason
for
allowing
high-risk
individuals
&#8211;
like
Mr.
Duncan
&#8211;
to
enter
our
country
for
purely
tourist
reasons
while
the
disease
is
uncontained.
Rather
than
issuing
an
outright
refusal
on
further
travel
restrictions
to
and
from
West
Africa,
the
U.S.
should
explore
every
feasible
and
available
option
to
restrict
all
non-essential
travel.
Thank
you, Tom
Rooney
