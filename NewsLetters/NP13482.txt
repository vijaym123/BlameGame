Dear Friends,
Shortly after
Thanksgiving, my office began collecting holiday cards addressed to
veterans at the Long Island State Veterans Home at Stony Brook.
This
week, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the veterans at the
home and deliver the more than 8,000 cards that were sent to my
office.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of
the individuals and schools who contributed cards to this
effort.
Knowing there were so many people who were thinking of them truly
made the season brighter for these veterans.
On behalf of
myself, my family, and my staff, happy holidays.
I hope the
season is one filled with happiness and cheer.
To view some of
the cards created by students, please visit our
Facebook gallery .
With warm wishes,
Congressman Tim Bishop
