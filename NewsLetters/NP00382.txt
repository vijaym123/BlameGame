Friends,
It was a very productive week in the DC and the district. I look forward to traveling back to Washington and discussing matters that most affect the constituents of FL-26.
TOP NEWS
Some of my colleagues struggle to support free trade agreements with our allies, yet advocate for expanded trade with one of our enemies. The Castro Regime in Cuba unjustly stole property from American citizens, and it is imperative that we do not reward them for their thievery.
HOUSE FLOOR
Last week I presided over the House Floor during debate on the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill.
COMMITTEE HEARINGS
I had the opportunity to participate in a House Committee on Small Business Hearing on the need for a long-term surface transportation bill. I discussed giving local communities flexibility in prioritizing projects and the importance of University Transportation Centers, including the Accelerated Bridge Program at Florida International University. I recently led a bipartisan letter with 68 Members of Congress advocating on behalf of UTCs. Ensuring that our nation has a sustainable infrastructure is of the utmost importance to securing the future of our transportation systems.
MEDIA APPEARANCES
While filming Enfoque with Jose Diaz-Balart, I met a production intern whos a student from FIU. Go Panthers! FL-26
THE DISTRICT
I appreciated the invitation to attend Special Operations Command Souths Military Ball and would like to thank General and Mrs. Sonntag for their hospitality. Its appropriate that SOCSOUTHs ball fell on the 71st anniversary of D-Day which utilized the best assets of all the branches of our military to plan and execute the operation, much like SOCSOUTHs mission today. Their work in Homestead exemplifies the continuation of our nations rich and courageous military history. Thank you to our protectors in uniform, past, present and future. May your deeds continue to add honor and luster to the reputations of your respective branches, and may we all continue to live in the land of the free due to their bravery.
Congrats to the graduates of Keiser University on this momentous occasion. I am confident that Keiser has provided you with the tools to make a positive impact in our community.
W.R. Thomas Middle School recently celebrated their last day of class before summer vacation. Thank you to their Civics Classes who recently asked me some great questions about politics. Enjoy your summer and remember to have some fun!
