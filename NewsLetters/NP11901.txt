Friends,
Last week, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel previewed some significant
changes coming for our nation's military. Though the details won't be
public until President Obama releases his proposed budget, we know the
size and scope of our Armed Forces will be greatly reduced. In fact,
under the President's proposal, the Army would shrink to its pre-World
War II size.
Every American should be concerned about how budget cuts are affecting
our Armed Forces and what that means for our national priorities. No
area of the budget is immune from belt tightening and that certainly
includes the military. And, with the drawdown of forces in Iraq and
Afghanistan, certain changes to the military are expected and, in many
ways, necessary.
However, any changes to our Armed Forces should reflect national
priorities, not budgetary or political circumstances. The United States
must first decide what is required to protect this country and its
interests, and then budget accordingly. I fear we are doing the
opposite, letting limited funding dictate strategic decisions.
One of the reasons I opposed the Budget Control Act of 2011 was because
of the way the bill cut a disproportional amount from defense relative
to other areas of the budget. The sequestration cuts imposed by that
law took 50 percent from the military when defense spending represents
only 20 percent of the federal budget.
Now, the drastic military cuts most thought would be a one-time
occurrence have become the new normal, and the problem is getting
worse. Why? Because out-of-control spending elsewhere in the federal
government continues to consume a greater and greater portion of our
resources, and there's only so much to go around.
A lot of politicians in Washington don't like to talk about it, but the
fact is unrestrained growth of "auto-pilot" social programs is
threatening our ability to properly fund the military. A recent report
from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office outlined how, without
changes to current law, mandatory spending on social programs and
subsidized health care will grow at an extraordinary rate over the next
25 years, while non-mandatory spending, where military funding comes
from, will shrink to dangerous levels. Mandatory spending is automatic
in nature and does not change unless the law does, which is the reason
behind its "auto-pilot" growth.
The CBO prediction would fulfill a decades-long trend. Mandatory
spending has increased dramatically over the decades, going from about
20 percent of the budget in the 1960s to about 45 percent in the 1980s
to more than 60 percent today. And, as mandatory spending has consumed
a greater share of the budget, the military's portion has decreased
just as dramatically.
To put this in perspective, in ten years the United States could spend
as much or more on our annual debt payments than we do on national
defense if we continue down this path. What kind of message does that
send to our enemies or those who seek to undermine our global influence?
Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
recognized how failure to reform mandatory spending would lead to
military cuts, stating in 2010
that "national debt is our biggest
national security threat."
The problem isn't limited to the military. Funding for other American
priorities like transportation infrastructure, education, agriculture,
or other legitimate interests is also threatened by unrestrained growth
of social welfare programs.
Unfortunately, our Commander-in-Chief has failed to show leadership on
this issue. President Obama's soon-to-be-released budget proposal
reportedly contains no reforms to rein in mandatory spending, despite
widespread agreement that reforms are desperately needed. Too often,
President Obama and his party choose to believe the falsehood that the
government can somehow tax its way out of every problem.
Congress took a small step in the right direction late last year by
passing the Bipartisan Budget Act, which restored some military funding
cut by sequestration and made modest reforms to mandatory spending. I
hope we can use that step to build momentum for more long-term reforms
that help get our fiscal house in order.
The Constitution calls on the United States Government to "promote the
general welfare" as well as to "provide for the common defense." We
cannot allow one responsibility to continue to undermine the other.
Impact on Fort Rucker
Changes to the Armed Forces will likely affect every major military
installation in the country, and our Alabama bases and posts are no
exception. A smaller Army will certainly have an impact at Fort Rucker,
one that we've expected now for some time. However, the proposed
changes also offer some good news for the post.
The Army plans to realign its aviation assets to reflect our current
footing and improve efficiency. Part of the plan would call for
modernizing the training aircraft at Fort Rucker's Army Aviation Center
of Excellence, which would enhance the training mission there.
I have been personally engaged in discussions surrounding the Army's
planned changes. As it stands, the aircraft realignment plan would have
a positive impact on Fort Rucker and would not negatively impact the
Alabama National Guard.
The Week Ahead
In the House next week we will be focusing on combatting rising energy
costs. Last year a study showed that 90 percent of U.S. households
would see higher home heating costs this year. We must pursue an
all-of-the-above energy strategy that increases domestic energy
production and removes unnecessary regulations.
One measure the House will consider would help make it easier to
transport propane, which is an issue of particular importance to
Alabama farmers.
Specifically the House will consider:
*	H.R. 4076
, the HHEAT, to make it easier to transport
propane to areas with shortages;
*	H.R. 2641
, the RAPID Act, to expedite federal
permitting for energy construction projects;
*	H.R. 2824
, the Preventing Government Waste and
Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America, to protect coal mining from
excessive and unnecessary federal regulation; and
*	H.R. 3826
, the Electricity Security and Affordability
Act, to protect electric utility plants from excessive EPA regulation.
As always, if you have questions about any of these bills or any
legislation under debate in Washington, please don't hesitate to
contact my office
. I look forward to hearing from you.

Friends,
Last
week,
Secretary
of
Defense
Chuck
Hagel
previewed
some
significant
changes
coming
for
our
nation&#8217;s
military.
Though
the
details
won&#8217;t
be
public
until
President
Obama
releases
his
proposed
budget,
we
know
the
size
and
scope
of
our
Armed
Forces
will
be
greatly
reduced.
In
fact,
under
the
President&#8217;s
proposal,
the
Army
would
shrink
to
its
pre-World
War
II
size.
Every
American
should
be
concerned
about
how
budget
cuts
are
affecting
our
Armed
Forces
and
what
that
means
for
our
national
priorities.
No
area
of
the
budget
is
immune
from
belt
tightening
and
that
certainly
includes
the
military.
And,
with
the
drawdown
of
forces
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
certain
changes
to
the
military
are
expected
and,
in
many
ways,
necessary.
However,
any
changes
to
our
Armed
Forces
should
reflect
national
priorities,
not
budgetary
or
political
circumstances.
The
United
States
must
first
decide
what
is
required
to
protect
this
country
and
its
interests,
and
then
budget
accordingly.
I
fear
we
are
doing
the
opposite,
letting
limited
funding
dictate
strategic
decisions.
One
of
the
reasons
I
opposed
the
Budget
Control
Act
of
2011
was
because
of
the
way
the
bill
cut
a
disproportional
amount
from
defense
relative
to
other
areas
of
the
budget.
The
sequestration
cuts
imposed
by
that
law
took
50
percent
from
the
military
when
defense
spending
represents
only
20
percent
of
the
federal
budget.
Now,
the
drastic
military
cuts
most
thought
would
be
a
one-time
occurrence
have
become
the
new
normal,
and
the
problem
is
getting
worse.
Why?
Because
out-of-control
spending
elsewhere
in
the
federal
government
continues
to
consume
a
greater
and
greater
portion
of
our
resources,
and
there&#8217;s
only
so
much
to
go
around.
A
lot
of
politicians
in
Washington
don&#8217;t
like
to
talk
about
it,
but
the
fact
is
unrestrained
growth
of
&#8220;auto-pilot&#8221;
social
programs
is
threatening
our
ability
to
properly
fund
the
military.
A
recent
report
from
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
outlined
how,
without
changes
to
current
law,
mandatory
spending
on
social
programs
and
subsidized
health
care
will
grow
at
an
extraordinary
rate
over
the
next
25
years,
while
non-mandatory
spending,
where
military
funding
comes
from,
will
shrink
to
dangerous
levels.
Mandatory
spending
is
automatic
in
nature
and
does
not
change
unless
the
law
does,
which
is
the
reason
behind
its
&#8220;auto-pilot&#8221;
growth.
The
CBO
prediction
would
fulfill
a
decades-long
trend.
Mandatory
spending
has
increased
dramatically
over
the
decades,
going
from
about
20
percent
of
the
budget
in
the
1960s
to
about
45
percent
in
the
1980s
to
more
than
60
percent
today.
And,
as
mandatory
spending
has
consumed
a
greater
share
of
the
budget,
the
military's
portion
has
decreased
just
as
dramatically.
To
put
this
in
perspective,
in
ten
years
the
United
States
could
spend
as
much
or
more
on
our
annual
debt
payments
than
we
do
on
national
defense
if
we
continue
down
this
path.
What
kind
of
message
does
that
send
to
our
enemies
or
those
who
seek
to
undermine
our
global
influence?
Admiral
Mike
Mullen,
former
Chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff,
recognized
how
failure
to
reform
mandatory
spending
would
lead
to
military
cuts,
stating
in
2010
that
&#8220;national
debt
is
our
biggest
national
security
threat.&#8221;
The
problem
isn&#8217;t
limited
to
the
military.
Funding
for
other
American
priorities
like
transportation
infrastructure,
education,
agriculture,
or
other
legitimate
interests
is
also
threatened
by
unrestrained
growth
of
social
welfare
programs.
Unfortunately,
our
Commander-in-Chief
has
failed
to
show
leadership
on
this
issue.
President
Obama&#8217;s
soon-to-be-released
budget
proposal
reportedly
contains
no
reforms
to
rein
in
mandatory
spending,
despite
widespread
agreement
that
reforms
are
desperately
needed.
Too
often,
President
Obama
and
his
party
choose
to
believe
the
falsehood
that
the
government
can
somehow
tax
its
way
out
of
every
problem.
Congress
took
a
small
step
in
the
right
direction
late
last
year
by
passing
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act,
which
restored
some
military
funding
cut
by
sequestration
and
made
modest
reforms
to
mandatory
spending.
I
hope
we
can
use
that
step
to
build
momentum
for
more
long-term
reforms
that
help
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order.
The
Constitution
calls
on
the
United
States
Government
to
&#8220;promote
the
general
welfare&#8221;
as
well
as
to
&#8220;provide
for
the
common
defense."
We
cannot
allow
one
responsibility
to
continue
to
undermine
the
other.
Impact
on
Fort
Rucker
Changes
to
the
Armed
Forces
will
likely
affect
every
major
military
installation
in
the
country,
and
our
Alabama
bases
and
posts
are
no
exception.
A
smaller
Army
will
certainly
have
an
impact
at
Fort
Rucker,
one
that
we've
expected
now
for
some
time.
However,
the
proposed
changes
also
offer
some
good
news
for
the
post.
The
Army
plans
to
realign
its
aviation
assets
to
reflect
our
current
footing
and
improve
efficiency.
Part
of
the
plan
would
call
for
modernizing
the
training
aircraft
at
Fort
Rucker's
Army
Aviation
Center
of
Excellence,
which
would
enhance
the
training
mission
there.
I
have
been
personally
engaged
in
discussions
surrounding
the
Army&#8217;s
planned
changes.
As
it
stands,
the
aircraft
realignment
plan
would
have
a
positive
impact
on
Fort
Rucker
and
would
not
negatively
impact
the
Alabama
National
Guard.
The
Week
Ahead
In
the
House
next
week
we
will
be
focusing
on
combatting
rising
energy
costs.
Last
year
a
study
showed
that
90
percent
of
U.S.
households
would
see
higher
home
heating
costs
this
year.
We
must
pursue
an
all-of-the-above
energy
strategy
that
increases
domestic
energy
production
and
removes
unnecessary
regulations.
One
measure
the
House
will
consider
would
help
make
it
easier
to
transport
propane,
which
is
an
issue
of
particular
importance
to
Alabama
farmers.
Specifically
the
House
will
consider: H.R.
4076 ,
the
HHEAT,
to
make
it
easier
to
transport
propane
to
areas
with
shortages;
H.R.
2641 ,
the
RAPID
Act,
to
expedite
federal
permitting
for
energy
construction
projects;
H.R.
2824 ,
the
Preventing
Government
Waste
and
Protecting
Coal
Mining
Jobs
in
America,
to
protect
coal
mining
from
excessive
and
unnecessary
federal
regulation;
and H.R.
3826 ,
the
Electricity
Security
and
Affordability
Act,
to
protect
electric
utility
plants
from
excessive
EPA
regulation.
As
always,
if
you
have
questions
about
any
of
these
bills
or
any
legislation
under
debate
in
Washington,
please
don't

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you.
