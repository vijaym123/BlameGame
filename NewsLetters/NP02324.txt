FEATURED STORY
Sen. Stabenow, Rep. Miller Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Stop Asian Carp
Senator Stabenow, Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, and
Congresswoman Candice Miller (MI-10th District) last week introduced
bipartisan legislation to stop Asian carp from entering the Great
Lakes. The Defending Our Great Lakes Act will give federal agencies
broad authority to take immediate actions to stop the spread of Asian
carp and other invasive species. This legislation will also require key
agencies to work with regional stakeholders to institute long-term
measures to stop the spread of invasive species between the Great Lakes
and Mississippi River basins. Stabenow's Stop Invasive Species Act,
signed into law in 2012, expedited the completion of the Army Corps of
Engineers' report outlining strategies to permanently prevent Asian
carp and other invasive species from entering the Great Lakes. The
newly introduced legislation directs the Army Corp and federal agencies
to implement some of the specific strategies outlined in the report and
to coordinate with regional stakeholders on other long-term solutions.
"Finding a solution to the threat from Asian carp and other invasive
species is not easy," said Stabenow. "Working alongside members of the
Michigan delegation and a wide range of stakeholders, including other
Great Lakes lawmakers, our bill is our best chance of halting these
fish as they come through the Chicago waterway," she added.

WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Grant Will Provide $7.9 Million to Restore Habitats in Great Lakes
Areas of Concern
Senator Stabenow announced that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) is awarding $7.9 million to fund habitat
restoration projects in the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The Great
Lakes Commission will lead a regional partnership in coordination with
NOAA, the Great Lakes states, and local agencies. "The Great Lakes are
a critical part of Michigan's economy and our way of life," said
Senator Stabenow, Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force. "This grant
will support regional partners as they work to protect our Great Lakes,
waterways, and wildlife habitats," she added. The U.S.-Canada Great
Lakes Water Quality Agreement designates areas of concern as sites with
the worst legacies of toxic contamination and environmental degradation
in the Great Lakes ecosystem in order to focus federal cleanup efforts.
The EPA currently lists 11 different areas of concern in Michigan.
