RECENTLY IN WASHINGTON
IS PETRAEUS BEING KEPT QUIET?
During a May 15, 2013
, Judiciary Committee hearing I asked U.S.
Attorney General Eric Holder a series of questions regarding the FBI
investigation into former CIA Director, General David Petraeus. Mr.
Holder declined to answer at the time and promised he would send a
response to my questions.
Watch the Holder exchange here
.
After receiving no answers, I sent a follow-up letter
to Mr. Holder this week restating the questions I'd like answered. For
more details on this letter, click here
.
SPEAKING TO THE UTAH STATE LEGISLATURE
In February I had an opportunity to address the Utah State Legislature
and share my perspective on issues impacting Utahns. Click here
for more details on my visit.
STATUS OF THE SAGE GROUSE IN UTAH
Studies conducted by the federal government that suggest various
species of sage grouse and prairie dogs should be put on the endangered
species list, haven't been made public to the people of Utah. During a
recent Oversight hearing, I encouraged an official from the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service to work with state officials in making the process
more open and transparent.

exchange.
IT'S A FELONY TO UNLOCK YOUR CELLPHONE?
Currently if you own a cellphone and would like to unlock that phone,
it is a felony to do so. This should not be the case. That is why I
supported legislation that passed through the House, which would give
consumers the right to unlock their devices and use another wireless
network.

HONORING FALLEN HEROS FROM EXTROTION 1-7
On August 6, 2011, Taliban insurgents killed 30 American servicemen,
including 17 Navy Seals, making it the largest single day loss of life
in naval special warfare history, and the largest single day loss of
life during in the war in Afghanistan.
The House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, of which I am
chairman, held a hearing
recently to obtain available facts about the
tragedy, dispel potential myths, and learn from the event to make sure
the proper reforms are implemented.
God bless the men who have lost their lives serving this great country.
