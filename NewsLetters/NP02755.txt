VISITING DC
February 14, 2015
Thursday in the Senate Intelligence Committee, I held the
first open hearing of 2015 as Chairman. Nicolas Rasmussen, Director of
the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), testified at an
unclassified hearing on current terror threats. When questioned by Senator
Rubio, Director Rasmussen explained that the Islamic State has newly
expanded into Algeria and Afghanistan, greatly expanding its influence
throughout North Africa and the Middle East. You can watch the hearing in
full by clicking below.

Analysis from yesterdays
hearing can be found

and

This hearing is not a one-off
as Chairman, I plan to hold
these regularly during the year to allow the American people to hear
directly from our Intelligence Community on different issues and
threats. You can read more about my plans for open hearings
here .
This past Sunday, North Carolina legend, Dean
Smith passed away. To celebrate his life and extraordinary contributions
to North Carolina, Senator Tillis and I passed a resolution for Coach
Smith in his honor.
Coach Smith was a leader on and off the
court. A fantastic coach, he will be remembered for his success at the
helm of the Tar Heels team, and his memory will continue to live on
through the hundreds of students he encouraged to succeed in the
classroom. Im happy for the opportunity to further honor his life with this
resolution.
On Thursday, I joined a group of bipartisan
Senators on the Senate education committee in releasing a report detailing
ways Congress and the Department of Education could streamline and
reduce federal regulations for Americas 6,000 colleges and universities,
while protecting students and taxpayers.
Over a year ago
when this task force began its work, I noted the tidal wave of
regulations facing institutions of higher education and the resulting higher
tuition costs to students. Not only has this report confirmed, with
specificity, the extent of these problems, it shows that every day the
situation worsens as a result of the Department of Educations
never-ending addiction to regulating colleges and universities.
My hope
is Congress can put the reports recommendations to action as soon as
possible.
I also want to thank the members of the task force, but
am especially appreciative of President Tom Ross and Chancellor
Harold Martin for accepting my invitation to advocate for North Carolinas
views on the task force.

access the report. There will be a hearing on the report on February
24 th , so be on the look out for more
information.
Tuesday, I had the honor of speaking about the
ABLE Act
at the White House
with Senator Casey, Congressman Crenshaw,
Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, and other disability advocates who fought
so hard for the ABLE Acts passage into law. The ABLE Act took 8 years
of hard work but it was well worth the labor. I am pleased that
thousands of disabled individuals and their loved ones will be able to save
for their future.

This week, the
Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act
was signed into law by the
President. Our veterans have made countless sacrifices on behalf of this
country and they deserve better. The Clay Hunt SAV Act will provide
much-needed resources to combat the epidemic of veteran suicide. I could
not be more pleased to see my legislation signed into law today and I
will continue to support efforts to provide care for our nations
heroes. You can read about the Clay Hunt SAV Act

This week, I joined both WCNC
and WGPH to discuss my legislation,

Finally, this week tragedy struck in
Chapel Hill, leaving three dead and our community in mourning. My
prayers are with their families. I have faith that law enforcement will
assemble the facts and ensure that justice is carried out on behalf of
those murdered. I have also extended an offer to assist law enforcement
so that the victims families can quickly get answers about the
deaths of their loved ones.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
