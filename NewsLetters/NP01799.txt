Conaway Chronicle: Happy Easter
__________________________________________
This Easter weekend, we honor the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter is a time for thoughtful reflection and celebration. As we spend time with our families this weekend, take time to enjoy their company and remember the sacrifices that were made for us. Easter always reminds me to honor those individuals that have laid down their lives for another.
No matter what belief system you hold, striving to live by a higher moral code will bring good into the world, strengthen our communities, and lay a solid foundation for the future of our children and grandchildren. Take time over the next several days to pray for our troops who aren't with their families this Easter, for those who are currently without work, and for those overseas who are being persecuted. Suzanne and I wish you and your families a very happy Easter.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
