Fixing Flawed Organ Transplant Rules For Kids
Last summer, Pennsylvanians watched brave, little
Sarah Murnaghan battle cystic fibrosis and a rigid rule
that prevented her from consideration for a lung transplant because of her age.
I am very pleased to report that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network has
permanently amended this rule . Young children, like Sarah Murnaghan, will no longer be blocked from potentially lifesaving transplants due to age.
Last year, I joined Sarah's family in appealing this rule to the Department of Health and Human Services. I am glad to see it has been permanently amended. Well done Sarah!
Hearing From Western PA's Women Business Leaders
Last week, I met with some local women business owners and entrepreneurs in Westmoreland County to listen to their concerns and hear their ideas for our Commonwealth's business climate. I'm grateful to
Seton Hill's E-Magnify
and the
Westmoreland County Chamber of Commerce
for taking part in our conversation.
Our discussion centered on manufacturing opportunities, excessive regulation and taxes, and access to capital. This was a terrific opportunity for me to learn how I can help. Thanks to all who attended!
Protecting The Allegheny National Forest
Our Allegheny National Forest is the gem of northwest Pennsylvania and a treasure all Americans can enjoy. Like other national forests, it must be cared for and proactively managed to improve forest health
before
the government seeks to acquire more land with taxpayer dollars.
I am joining an
effort in the Senate
to ensure that the Forest Service prioritizes limited resources to adequately manage the lands for which it is currently responsible, rather than continuing to acquire additional property.
Welcoming PA's Library of Congress Fellows
This week, I met Pennsylvania's Library of Congress junior fellows. Thanks to Frank Vitale of Fort Washington and Carley Altenburger of Oakmont for stopping by! If you or someone you know is interested in applying to be a junior fellow, I encourage you to
learn more about the program .
Introducing My Summer Interns
Nate Heeter, Joseph Marvin, Katharine Toll, Benjamin Mills, Laura Quazzo, Andrew Wardrop, Michael Eaverly, and Nina Boscia.
Every summer, my office takes on exceptional students from across Pennsylvania to assist my staff with casework, legislative issues, and research. During their internships, these students also have an opportunity to learn more about the Senate and the issues that are discussed every day. Welcome to this summer's interns!
