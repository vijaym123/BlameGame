ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
August 01, 2014
Dear Friends,
Too
many Americans feel as though the American Dream is slipping past
them.
Stagnant wages have hurt economic growth. Rising college
costs have made it harder for parents to send their kids to school,
and student loan debt has reached $1.2 trillion. Women have made
significant gains in the workplace over the past few decades, but their wages
still lag behind those of their male counterparts.
Its
time to put American families and workers first by creating an economy
that works for us all. My colleagues and I recently stood on the
Capitol steps to unveil our plan to jumpstart the middle
class.
Heres some of the ways we can do it:
Boost Job
Creation
Raise the federal minimum wage: Raising the wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an
hour would lift between 1 million to 4.5 million Americans out of
poverty.
Renew emergency unemployment insurance: More than 3 million Americans,
including 237,000 New Yorkers and 300,000 veterans, rely on
unemployment insurance to put food on the table after losing their jobs due to
no fault of their own. Cutting off UI will only make it harder for
individuals and families to survive a job
loss.
When Women Succeed, America
Succeeds
Pass
the
" Paycheck Fairness Act" :
Women earn just
77 cents for every dollar men earn. This bill gives women the tools
they need to fight for equal pay.
Pass the
"Healthy Families
Act":
Nearly 40 percent of private sector workers do not have paid sick
time. Its tough for parents to choose between taking care of a sick
child or earning a living. This will enable workers to earn paid sick time
and paid time for family care.
Support our
Students
Early education, early success:
Head Start has helped prepare over 20 million children and their
families for kindergarten. The
"Start Strong for America's Children
Act"
establishes a state-federal partnership that would
enable more children from low-income and moderate-income families to
attend a pre-K program.
Enable students to refinance their college loans: Student
loan debt has reached crisis levels. The
"Bank on Students
Emergency Loan Refinancing Act"
will enable students to take
advantage of lower interest rates. [ All statistics are from the House
Minority Leader's Office. ]
Far too many individuals and families are worried about
the economy and their financial future. Congress must address the
issues that are holding back economic growth, because strengthening the
middle class strengthens
America.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
Congressman Engel
discusses the
"21st Century Make It In America
Act, " which provides tax incentives for businesses that keep jobs at
home.
