Dear Neighbors,
The more we hear about the VA's treatment of veterans, the worse it
gets. Dozens of VA facilities nationwide are being investigated for
cooking the books, ensuring that the long wait times that sick veterans
have to endure are hidden from the public. These secret waiting lists
are fueled by the greed of those at the highest level of the VA.
Shorter wait times means bonuses for VA employees, so in order to get
these bonuses, VA employees have allegedly been ordered to hide the
truth at the expensive of our veterans.
Reports out just this week illustrate that the Phoenix VA is not the
only place where fraud has taken place. Even in Texas, it has been
reported that some VA officials purposely manipulated appointment data
to hide long wait times.
This is unacceptable. The money-hungry executives in the VA should be
treated for what they are-criminals. Meanwhile, American warriors are
dying in the United States, waiting in line for VA health care. We must
fix the problem immediately.

Scandal."
I remain committed to assisting Veterans who are having issues with the
VA or any other federal agency. That is why on Tuesday, June 3rd, I
will host a Veterans' Open House from 4:00-6:00 pm at my Harris County
West Office. This will give veterans a chance to meet with me and my
staff personally so that we can offer help and assistance with
individual matters (casework) before the VA.
See flyer below for details:
On Monday, I visited Houston National Cemetery to celebrate Memorial
Day. It was an honor to join our area veterans and community to pay
remembrance to those who served and are no longer with us.

Dear
Neighbors,
The
more
we
hear
about
the
VA&#8217;s
treatment
of
veterans,
the
worse
it
gets. Dozens
of VA
facilities
nationwide
are
being
investigated
for
cooking
the
books,
ensuring
that
the
long
wait
times
that sick
veterans
have
to
endure
are
hidden
from
the
public.
These
secret
waiting
lists
are
fueled
by
the greed
of
those
at
the
highest
level
of
the
VA.
Shorter
wait
times
means
bonuses
for
VA
employees,
so
in
order
to
get
these
bonuses,
VA
employees
have
allegedly
been
ordered
to
hide
the
truth
at
the
expensive
of
our
veterans.
Reports
out
just
this
week
illustrate
that
the
Phoenix
VA
is
not
the
only
place
where fraud
has
taken
place.
Even
in
Texas,
it
has
been
reported
that
some
VA
officials
purposely
manipulated
appointment
data
to
hide
long
wait
times.
This
is
unacceptable.
The
money-hungry
executives
in
the
VA
should
be
treated
for
what
they
are&#8212;criminals.
Meanwhile,
American
warriors
are
dying
in
the
United
States,
waiting
in
line
for
VA
health
care.
We
must
fix
the
problem
immediately.
