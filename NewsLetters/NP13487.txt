Dear
Friends,
Yesterday, the Army announced its selection of Fort Gordon in
Augusta as the location for its
Cyber Command
headquarters . This is outstanding news for Georgia, and after four years
of working with the Army to advocate for Fort Gordon, I am proud they
have chosen the best location to host the Armys operational cyber
capabilities.
As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I
have no greater priority than our national security. This command will
build on the existing intelligence and cyber capabilities on post while
providing the most cost-effective solution at a time when we need to
be cutting spending more than ever. This basing decision brings
approximately 700 new personnel to Fort Gordon, along with a three star
commander. Fort Gordon also provides for the unmatched quality of life
provided by the City of Augusta and surrounding area.
In
addition to the headquarters of U.S. Army Cyber Command at Fort Gordon, the
Army will establish headquarters for a standing cyber joint task
force and a provisional cyber center of excellence. This command and
control structure will dramatically improve the operational effectiveness
of Army cyber capabilities.
Basing this increasingly
important capability at Fort Gordon is the right thing to do for the Army and
the national security of the United States, and
Im
proud to have the U.S. Army Cyber Command in our great
state .
End of the Year Wrap-Up
As 2013 comes to an
end, the Senate quickly wrapped up the year by passing a bipartisan
budget deal to fund the government for two years. Although this bill was
far from perfect, it is a step in the right direction towards a
bipartisan compromise on the most important issue of our time. I supported
final passage of this bill, and I will work to ensure that military
retiree pay is protected.
You can watch my floor speech on the
budget
here
and my introduction of a resolution to
protect military retiree pay
here .
We also passed the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act last
night, which funds the Department of Defense for the next year.
Although the majority leader prevented us from properly debating the bill,
and stopped senators from offering amendments through the proper
process, I supported its final passage because keeping our national security
funded is more important than playing politics.
You can watch my
floor speech on the NDAA
here .
It has been an honor to serve the state of Georgia and represent you
this year, and I look forward to working for Georgians during my final
year in the Senate.
Very truly yours,
