Showing
Appreciation for Our Troops This Holiday
Season
Dear Friend,
As we gather with friends and family to
observe this holiday season and to pray for
peace on earth and good will toward men, I
thank you for the opportunity to represent
Virginias Fifth District in the
United States Congress. The blessings we
enjoy as Virginians are abundant, and I am
grateful every day for the natural beauty,
the agricultural bounty, and the
hardworking entrepreneurial spirit we see
all across our great district.
It is important that we recognize that
the blessings we enjoy as Americans would
not be possible without our men and women
in uniform, who are indeed our peacemakers.
So many of our service members will be away
from their families this holiday season, so
let us keep them in our thoughts and in our
prayers and be sure to show our
appreciation for the great sacrifices that
they make.
The House and Senate recently came
together to agree upon the Bipartisan
Budget Act, within which we exchanged
one-time cuts for long-term spending
reforms that will secure our military
readiness by giving our troops the
resources they need to defend our nation.
While not everything in the budget
agreement is as I would have drafted it, it
was imperative that Congress act to pass a
budget to alleviate the pressure that
sequestration imposed on our military.
I share the concerns of many servicemen
and women, veterans, and military families
with one provision of this budget agreement
pertaining to veterans future
retirement cost of living adjustments. I am
committed to identifying alternative budget
reforms and I will work with my colleagues
to ensure that no veterans are impacted by
these changes before they take effect in
2016.
I look forward to beginning the New Year
with a renewed sense of commitment to
serving the needs of the people of
Virginias Fifth District and to
moving our great nation forward. I hope you
and your loved ones enjoy this holiday
season, and I wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.
