Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
What a week! After spending the week traveling all over the Sixth
District and meeting with you and your neighbors, I look forward to
returning to Washington to advocate for the common sense policies the
people of central and eastern Kentucky demand!
Thank you to all those who were able to make it to one of my events. If
you couldn't make it this time, please know that your views are
important to me as I represent you in Washington and I look forward to
catching up with you soon!
Meeting and Listening to Kentuckians
This week, I was glad to hold three "Meet Your Congressman" events in
Bourbon, Powell and Estill Counties. I enjoyed sitting down in these
informal settings to listen to your concerns, many of which included
frustrations with the lack of accountability in Washington.
I was glad to share an update about the legislation I introduced to
ensure that we avoid default while holding Washington politicians who
spend beyond their means accountable.
My "Debt Limit Reform and Congressional Pay for Performance Act of 2014
" would force Congress to focus on
reducing spending and to meet specific fiscal sustainability targets
based on the size of our economy. It ties Congressional pay to how well
Congress manages our nation's finances, providing powerful incentive to
pass pro-growth policies that would grow the economy and create jobs.
It's always good to have lunch in horse country. Thanks to Lyra Miller
and her team at Lil's Coffee House in Paris for a delicious club
sandwich as well as Sherry Reams at Thyme on Broadway Caf in Irvine
for being an incredible host!
I look forward to hosting more of these Accessibility Initiative events
across the Sixth District, and encourage you to visit my staff at our
monthly office hours in each county! Click here for more information
about when a member of my staff will be in your community
!
Protecting Those Who Protect Us
Last night, I attended the Lexington Fire Department Awards Banquet and
enjoyed meeting with so many brave and selfless people who have
dedicated their lives to protecting our communities. Congratulations to
all those who were recognized for their service.
Did you know that over 90 percent of fire departments in Kentucky are
either fully or mostly volunteer? Without these dedicated volunteer
firefighters, many areas of the Sixth Congressional District would lack
adequate fire protection.
That is only one of the reasons I successfully fought to ensure that
volunteer firefighters did not become the next victim of Obamacare's
costly mandates. Last night, I was glad to share that the IRS listened
when I raised concerns that the Obamacare employer mandate could
potentially have led to the closure of firehouses and layoff of
volunteer firefighters if they had been incorrectly classified as
"large employers."
In a letter I received from the Department of the Treasury earlier this
month, they assured me that that emergency services volunteers will not
be counted as full-time employees under the Obamacare employer mandate
and thanked me for my input which "played an important role in
improving the proposed rule" they issued in December 2012.
I am grateful we have such dedicated departments keeping not only my
family, but all central and eastern Kentucky communities safe. Thank
you to all of Kentucky's firefighters and emergency medical technicians
for your service and bravery. I look forward to continuing to work on
behalf of such an amazing group of heroes.

Celebrating Black History Month and Honoring Camp Nelson's Legacy
In continuing honor of Black History Month, we also look to
historically significant places that have impacted the history of
Kentucky's Black community. One such place is Camp Nelson National
Cemetery.
Camp Nelson National Cemetery, located near Nicholasville, Kentucky, is
all that remains of Camp Nelson, the largest Civil War recruiting
center for African American troops in the state, as well as a large
Union supply depot and hospital facility.
Comprised primarily of freed slaves, over 10,000 soldiers were
recruited, trained, and contributed to Union efforts there.
In January of this year, I spoke at a ceremony where the cemetery was
dedicated as an United States National Historic Landmark, forever
enshrining the special place in American history.
Camp Nelson Civil War National Heritage Park draws over 13,000 visitors
every year. If you are interested in a trip, mark your calendars for
September 6th and 7th of this year to celebrate the 150th Anniversary
of the forming of troops at Camp Nelson.
Signature Industry Spotlight: Promoting Kentucky Agriculture
On Thursday, our traveling Agriculture Coalition met for the second
time in Versailles, where I was glad to provide an update about
legislation and policies affecting Kentucky's signature Agriculture
industry. At the meeting we discussed the recent passage of the Farm
Bill, the reinstatement of tobacco buyout payments, and immigration
issues directly impacting farming communities. The attendees raised a
number of great questions and concerns that I will take with me back to
Washington.
Special thanks to members of Woodford County High School's Future
Farmers of America (FFA) for attending and for their interest in the
success of one of our most important industries, and to FFA President
Rachel Glass for introducing me at the meeting!
Farmers in the Sixth District make important contributions to our local
economy and beyond, and I am honored to continue my work in Washington
as an advocate for these hard-working Kentuckians.
Serving Those Who Served
Wednesday evening, I was glad to host a meeting of the Sixth District
Veterans Coalition in Lexington. I was happy to provide the Coalition
with an update about many issues, and especially glad to share that I
acted on their recommendation and voted to reverse the reductions to
the percentage of the cost-of-living increases given to military
retirees. I would like to especially thank those who served on the
working group that examined legislation and provided a recommendation
that helped inform and guide my vote.
I remain humbled to represent Kentucky's brave service members and
honored to work with these dedicated veterans who continue to serve.
If you would like to become involved with the Kentucky Sixth District
Veterans Coalition, please contact Tyler White in my Lexington District
Office at (859) 219-1366.
Committee Corner: Taking Kentuckians' Concerns and Ideas to Washington
It was a pleasure to sit down with the directors from Farmers Deposit
Bank on Wednesday. With locations in Carlisle, Cynthiana and Paris,
they serve a large number of families, farmers and small business
owners in the Sixth Congressional District. We discussed the effects of
the implementation of the Dodd-Frank law, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) and ways we can help our community banks
fulfill their ultimate goal: serving their customers.
Community banks like Farmers Deposit are critical to our economy and
people as they give a young farmer access to credit to purchase their
first farm, they help small businesses invest in the future and create
jobs, and they assist families sending their children to college, among
so many other vital services. I am honored to take the concerns and
recommendations shared at my roundtables across the district to
Washington and advocate on behalf of our community banks and the
hard-working Kentuckians they serve as a member of the Financial
Services Committee.

Around the District
Thanks to Kevin Crump, Jim McCarty and members of the Paris City
Council for a tour of the historic Paris Power Plant, which has been
serving Kentuckians since the 1930's.
On Friday, I enjoyed serving lunch at Frankfort's ACCESS Soup Kitchen.
Thank you to the dedicated staff and leaders who provide such an
important service to our community.
I had a very informative visit with the people at Bottoms Engineering
and was glad to hear more about how transportation regulations are
making it burdensome and unnecessarily costly to run a small business.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website

Thank you and have a great week!

Dear

Protecting
Those
Who
Protect
Us
Last
night,
I
attended
the
Lexington
Fire
Department
Awards
Banquet
and
enjoyed
meeting
with
so
many
brave
and
selfless
people
who
have
dedicated
their
lives
to
protecting
our
communities.
Congratulations
to
all
those
who
were
recognized
for
their
service.
Did
you
know
that
over
90
percent
of
fire
departments
in
Kentucky
are
either
fully
or
mostly
volunteer?
Without
these
dedicated
volunteer
firefighters,
many
areas
of
the
Sixth
Congressional
District
would
lack
adequate
fire
protection.
That
is
only
one
of
the
reasons
I
successfully
fought
to
ensure
that
volunteer
firefighters
did
not
become
the
next
victim
of
Obamacare&#8217;s
costly
mandates.
Last
night,
I
was
glad
to
share
that
the
IRS
listened
when
I
raised
concerns
that
the
Obamacare
employer
mandate
could
potentially
have
led
to
the
closure
of
firehouses
and
layoff
of
volunteer
firefighters
if
they
had
been
incorrectly
classified
as
"large
employers."
In
a
letter
I
received
from
the
Depar tment
of
the
Treasury
earlier
this
month,
they
assured
me
that
that
emergency
services
volunteers
will
not
be
counted
as
full-time
employees
under
the
Obamacare
employer
mandate
and
thanked
me
for
my
input
which
&#8220;played
an
important
role
in
improving
the
proposed
rule&#8221;
they
issued
in
December
2012.
I
am
grateful
we
have
such
dedicated
departments
keeping
not
only
my
family,
but
all
central
and
eastern
Kentucky
communities
safe.
Thank
you
to
all
of
Kentucky&#8217;s
firefighters
and
emergency
medical
technicians
for
your
service
and
bravery.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
on
behalf
of
such
an
amazing
group
of
heroes.

Celebrating
Black
History
Month
and
Honoring
Camp
Nelson&#8217;s
Legacy
In
continuing
honor
of
Black
History
Month,
we
also
look
to
historically
significant
places
that
have
impacted
the
history
of
Kentucky&#8217;s
Black
community.
One
such
place
is
Camp
Nelson
National
Cemetery.
Camp
Nelson
National
Cemetery,
located
near
Nicholasville,
Kentucky,
is
all
that
remains
of
Camp
Nelson,
the
largest
Civil
War
recruiting
center
for
African
American
troops
in
the
state,
as
well
as
a
large
Union
supply
depot
and
hospital
facility.
Comprised
primarily
of
freed
slaves,
over
10,000
soldiers
were
recruited,
trained,
and
contributed
to
Union
efforts
there.
In
January
of
this
year,
I
spoke
at
a
ceremony
where
the
cemetery
was
dedicated
as
an
United
States
National
Historic
Landmark,
forever
enshrining
the
special
place
in
American
history.
Camp
Nelson
Civil
War
National
Heritage
Park
draws
over
13,000
visitors
every
year.
If
you
are
interested
in
a
trip,
mark
your
calendars
for
September
6th
and
7th
of
this
year
to
celebrate
the
150th
Anniversary
of
the
forming
of
troops
at
Camp
Nelson.

and

issues
directly

The

that
I
will

Special
thanks
to

and
for
their

and
to
FFA
President

for
these
hard-working
Kentuckians.
Serving
Those
Who
Served
Wednesday
evening,
I
was
glad
to
host
a
meeting
of
the
Sixth
District
Veterans
Coalition
in
Lexington.
I
was
happy
to
provide
the

with
an

about
many

and
especially
glad
to
share
that
I
acted
on

Committee
Corner:
Taking
Kentuckians'
Concerns
and
Ideas
to
Washington
It
was
a
pleasure
to
sit
down
with
the
directors
from
Farmers
Deposit
Bank
on
Wednesday.
With
locations
in
Carlisle,
Cynthiana
and
Paris,
they
serve
a
large
number
of
families,
farmers
and
small
business
owners
in
the
Sixth
Congressional
District.
We
discussed
the
effects
of
the
implementation
of
the
Dodd-Frank
law,
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB)
and
ways
we
can
help
our
community
banks
fulfill
their
ultimate
goal:
serving
their
customers.
Community
banks
like
Farmers
Deposit
are
critical
to
our
economy
and
people
as
they
give
a
young
farmer
access
to
credit
to
purchase
their
first
farm,
they
help
small
businesses
invest
in
the
future
and
create
jobs,
and
they
assist
families
sending
their
children
to
college,
among
so
many
other
vital
services.
I
am
honored
to
take
the
concerns
and
recommendations
shared
at
my
roundtables
across
the
district
to
Washington
and
advocate
on
behalf
of
our
community
banks
and
the
hard-working
Kentuckians
they
serve
as
a
member
of
the
Financial
Services
Committee.

Please
