Dear Friend,
It was a busy week in Washington.
Despite my strong, outspoken criticism, Republican leadership
capitulated to the President and Democrats by suspending the Debt Ceiling. I
think this is a dirty deal for you.
Click here to find out why.
I
also got a shocking confession from an Obama Administration Official
about your power bill. During a hearing he said new clean coal
technology could raise cost 70% to 80%.

The fight
against ObamaCare also continued this week as the Administration delayed
another major part of the law.
