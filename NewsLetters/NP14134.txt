This week, I was honored to deliver remarks at the 150th
Anniversary of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. This historic
address is one of the most sacred texts in American history. Its
message of perseverance and freedom ring as true today as it did 150
years ago.
And when our Nation was torn by bitterness and civil war,
President Lincoln reminded us that we were one Nation, sharing a bond
as Americans that could bend but would not break. Those expressions of
unity still echo true today. With all the partisanship and gridlock in
Washington, it's easy to wonder if such unity is really possible.
However, President Lincoln showed us that, even in the most trying
times, Americans truly do share a common bond that is not easily
broken. To see more about the event, please visit the Gettysburg
Foundation website

Below is a short video of my remarks from the 150th Anniversary
Ceremony of the Gettysburg Address.

Scott G. Perry

This
week,
I
was
honored
to
deliver
remarks
at
the
150th
Anniversary
of
President
Lincoln&#8217;s
Gettysburg
Address.
This
historic
address
is
one
of
the
most
sacred
texts
in
American
history.
Its
message
of
perseverance
and
freedom
ring
as
true
today
as it
did
150
years
ago.
And
when
our
Nation
was
torn
by
bitterness
and
civil
war,
President
Lincoln
reminded
us
that
we
were
one
Nation,
sharing
a
bond
as
Americans
that
could
bend
but
would
not
break.
Those
expressions
of
unity
still
echo
true
today.
With
all
the
partisanship
and
gridlock
in
Washington,
it&#8217;s
easy
to
wonder
if
such
unity
is
really
possible.
However,
President
Lincoln
showed
us
that,
even
in
the
most
trying
times,
Americans
truly
do
share
a
common
bond
that
is
not
easily
broken.
