Video
of the Week:
Republicans have a true opportunity to lead in this New
Year, and I look forward to passing conservative solutions to resolve
everyday problems that each of you are facing. I made a brief video to
discuss the opportunities and legislation we have already accomplished
our first week back, and I hope you'll take a moment to
click here
or on the picture
above to watch
it.
Happy
New Year to each of you! This past Tuesday, I had the honor of being
sworn-in to the 114th
Congress . I want to thank you for the opportunity to serve
as your elected Representative. This January has ushered in a New
American Congress, and our party will work to enact real conservative
solutions and spark a real economic recovery. It was wonderful to have my
husband, Brent, and son, Ben, up here with me during swearing
in.
During the
first week back, the House got to work right away. We unanimously voted on
the
Hire More Heroes
Act , which gives a financial break to small businesses that
provide military retirees, reservists, and disabled veterans an
advantage when it comes to hiring. Passage of this bill shows Congress
continued commitment to caring for our military and veterans. Additionally
this week, I voted on
The
Save the American Workers Act
to help repeal a portion of
Obamacare's unfair Employer Mandate, which had many unintended
consequences on low-and middle-income Americans. In passing this
legislation, Congress rightfully voted to restore the 40-hour definition of a
full-time worker so that we can get Americans back into the work force
and help them bring home a larger paycheck.
I look forward to embracing all this
New Year holds and am eager to work with my colleagues on your behalf.
Thank you for the trust you have placed in me to serve as your
Representative.
The Keystone
Pipeline:
Friday marked the 10th time House Republicans have voted and passed
the Keystone XL Pipeline. It's time for jobs, it's time for energy
independence, and I had the opportunity to speak with Stuart Varney on
Fox Business to discuss the importance of this legislation. It's time
the president put politics aside-- it's time to pass the Keystone
Pipeline.

My Family Visits Washington:
My
husband, Brent, and son, Ben, visited Washington, D.C. for the swearing-in
ceremony. I love when it when they make the trip
up.
I finally
got the boys to stop goofing off and take a serious
photo!
