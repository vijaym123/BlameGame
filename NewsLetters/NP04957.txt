Dear Friend,
If anyone wants to know the true state of the economy, just ask a young person.
The so-called Millennial generationor those between the ages of 20 and 33 have faced one of the most difficult job markets in recent history.
According to a Pew Research Center report, about one-in-three Millennials live at home with their parents.
One Associated Press story reported that nearly 54 percent of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 in 2012 were jobless or underemployed.
And the quality of jobs held by the underemployed has declined with todays recent graduates increasingly accepting low-wage jobs or working part time.
As the father of two Millenials, I believe we can do better by our children.
Our countrys continued success depends upon the next generation, aspiring young people who are eager to get out on their own and create a better life.
It is no wonder that our economy continues to stall.
Over the last six years, we have witnessed tax increases on job creators, the government takeover of our healthcare system, and massive federal regulation.
Nevertheless, I remain optimistic that we can spur economic growth to help New Jersey families achieve their dreams.
The House has sent dozens of jobs bills to the Senate, where they have withered on the vine without any consideration.
In my role as chairman of the (Financial Services) Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, I have been working across the aisle on a package of bipartisan bills that recognize the crucial role small businesses play as innovators and job creators.
One of my top priorities for 2015 is to ensure the implementation of the JOBS Act, a bill I wrote that was signed into law in 2012.
Unfortunately, government regulators are still dragging their feet on the laws implementation.
I will also be working hard to usher the JOBS Act 2.0 through Congress to address the needs of New Jerseys vital small business community.
The United States has always persevered through difficult challenges, and I know we will emerge stronger than ever from our current economic downturn.
The next generation depends upon us to protect the opportunities that have always been the foundation of the American Dream.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
