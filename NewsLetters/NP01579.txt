House to Take Up Tax
Legislation
As Tax Day approaches on Wednesday, the House is set to pass
a number of bills this week that will aim to lighten the tax burden on
Americans, rein in the Internal Revenue Service, and reform our tax
code.
Last year,
the federal government took in more money
in tax revenues than ever before
while Americans continue
to feel crunched in their take-home pay and economic opportunities.
Absent repeal, taxes will continue to go up
as a result of Obamacare implementation
in the years to come.
Add that to a
broken IRS, and it's clearly time for meaningful reform. Here are two of
the many important bills we are voting on this
week:
Taxpayer
Bill of Rights Act
Requires the IRS to
ensure that its employees are familiar with, and act in accordance
with, taxpayer rights. Those rights include the right to be informed, to
be assisted, to be heard, to pay no more than the correct amount of
tax, to an appeal, to certainty, to privacy, to confidentiality, to
representation, and to a fair and just tax system.
Prevent Targeting at the IRS
Act
Expands existing grounds for
termination of the employment of an IRS employee to include performing,
delaying, or failing to perform any official action, including an audit,
with respect to a taxpayer for purpose of extracting personal gain or
benefit or for a political purpose.
These bills are
good first steps, but we need long-term reform that makes the tax code
flatter and fairer. One possible alternative is HR 25 - The Fair Tax, of
which I am a cosponsor. I look forward to working with my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle as we work to achieve the right reforms
that will let Americans keep more of their hard earn
money.
SevenDays: Make a Ripple, Change the World
Click
here to read Mindy Corporon's opinion column in the
Kansas City
Star .
Today, we honor the memory of three
people who were victims of a horrific shooting that took place in
Overland Park one year ago. On April 13, 2014, the lives of Reat Underwood,
William Corporon, and Terri Lamanno were tragically cut
short.
Mindy Corporon lost both her father,
William, and her fourteen-year-old son, Reat, that day. Many people would
understandably fall into despair. But amazingly, Mindy has used this
tragedy to promote love, faith, kindness, and
remembrance.
Partnering with two non-profit organizations,
Mindy and other family members of the victims have organized a
weeklong series of events entitled
SevenDays: Make a Ripple, Change the World
ending with a
peace walk at the Jewish Community Center. This week of remembrance
aims to promote understanding and encourage kindness within the
community to overcome the senseless act of hate that occurred one year
ago.
I hope we can all learn from
this example of turning hate into a week of hope and
kindness.
Appropriations Subcommittee Vice Chairs Announced
Click here to visit yoder.house.gov and read
more.
Im excited for the opportunity to serve as the Vice Chairman
of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations
Subcommittee during the 114th Congress. Transportation is critical to our
local economy and I will be a strong voice for Kansans as they travel
by air, rail, or road. I also look forward to improving the federal
housing programs that serve our communities in the Third District and
throughout the state.
This new
assignment gives me the chance to closely oversee the two cabinet-level
agencies impacting these sectors, root out wasteful spending, and eliminate
fraud and abuse in these government programs. For reference,
the 2015 Omnibus spending package
contained $53.8 billion - $17.8 billion for Transportation and $35.6
billion for Housing and Urban Development - in discretionary funding for
the two departments . I remain committed to investing
these federal dollars wisely so that essential programs can remain viable
for those who need them.
I look
forward to working closely with Chairman Diaz-Balart and the other
Subcommittee Members to ensure that the Departments of Transportation and
Housing and Urban Development are operating in the most efficient and
effective manner.
Letter to USDA Inspector
General
Last week, I sent a follow-up letter to Inspector General
Phyllis Fong of the Department of Agriculture regarding the unusually high
default rate on the department's Broadband Loan Program. Last month,
during an Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing I asked USDA
officials about the 116 percent default rate listed for the program in
the White House budget, featured in
this article from
POLITICO .
The program has played a vital role in addressing the needs of rural
communities in Kansas and throughout the rest of the country, which is
why we must ensure that it remains viable. I am hopeful that Inspector
General Fong will provide my office with clarifications on how the
default rate is so high and potential steps that can be taken to ensure
the default rate is closer to the private sector average of 3
percent.
REMINDER: Congressional Art
Competition Deadline is April 24
The
Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for
members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of
their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students
have been involved with the nationwide
competition.
Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts competition
is sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The
Artistic Discovery Contest is an opportunity to recognize and
encourage the artistic talent in the nation, as well as in our Congressional
district.
The Artistic Discovery
Contest is open to all high school students in the 3rd District. The
over-all winner of our district's competition will be displayed for one
year in the U.S. Capitol. The exhibit in Washington will also include
artwork from other contest winners
nation-wide.
The competition is open to high school students only.
Exceptions may be made for schools that have 7th through 12th grades on one
campus.
