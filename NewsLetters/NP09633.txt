The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of May 12 - 16, 2014
This week is National Small Business Week, a time to celebrate the
contributions of small businesses and highlight the critical role
entrepreneurs and small business owners play in our economy. Here are
some things you may not know about small businesses:
*	Small businesses employ about half of all private sector
employees and create more than half of all nonfarm private gross
domestic product.
*	Small businesses have generated 65% of net new jobs over the
past 17 years.
*	Generally, 60 to 80% of all new jobs come from small
businesses.
One of my top priorities in Congress is to ensure that we get
Washington out of the way so that our nation's small businesses can
expand and hire more workers.
Under the president's policies, small
businesses are continually burdened by threats of tax increases,
unstable energy costs, and unnecessarily burdensome federal
regulations.
That is why I have proudly supported legislation like the
Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act (HR. 1105) to
assist job creators. H.R. 1105 exempts private equity funds, which have
a long history of providing capital to millions of Americans so that
they can operate their small businesses and create new jobs, from being
forced to comply with unnecessary and costly requirements under the
burdensome Dodd-Frank Act.
National Small Business week serves as a reminder that our economy
relies on the success of local and small business.
I will continue to
fight for common-sense policies that give small businesses the
certainty that they need to thrive and create more opportunities for
the American people.
VA Facility Letter
On Tuesday I was proud to join 23 members of the Texas delegation in
calling for an Inspector General investigation into allegations
regarding employees manipulating medical appointment data at the North
Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs
Outpatient Clinic, and the Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. An
employee who has worked at all three of these facilities confirmed that
he was directed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans
were as close to zero days as possible. This required employees to
falsely log patient information to achieve the desired wait time goal.
The VA facilities in question serve thousands of Texas veterans. These
brave men and women proudly served their country and it is imperative
that they receive the highest standard of medical care and family
support services available. The alleged deception and dishonest
practices of these facilities will not be tolerated and I am committed
to ensuring that those responsible for this misconduct are held
responsible. To read the full letter, click here

ObamaCare Amicus Brief
This week I joined Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, as well as
several of our colleagues in the House and Senate, in signing an amicus
curiae brief in support of a federal lawsuit against ObamaCare titled
Hotze v. Sebelius.
An amicus curiae brief is a way for a person who is
not a party to a case to submit their perspective on the legal
arguments of the case or to present a different perspective on the case
than those argued by the parties.
As a Member of Congress, I have a
compelling interest in protecting the Constitution, guarding our Bill
of Rights, and in guaranteeing that the House and the Senate follow the
requirements of the Constitution.
In the brief, we argue that the court should overturn ObamaCare on the
grounds that it violates two different parts of the Constitution - the
Origination Clause, Article 1, Section 7, and the Taking Clause of the
5th Amendment.
Of the nearly 100 lawsuits that have been filed against
ObamaCare, Hotze v. Sebelius has been ranked as one of the six court
cases with the greatest likelihood to overturn ObamaCare.
After being
heard in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas
earlier this year, the case has moved to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals where oral arguments should take place sometime this summer.
Global Down Syndrome Foundation Gala
Each year I'm delighted to have the opportunity to attend the Global
Down Syndrome Foundation's "Be Beautiful Be Yourself" Gala with my
family, Congressional colleagues, and several advocates from across the
country.
This year's event was truly inspiring and it was great to
hear about the accomplishments of all of the individuals with Down
syndrome in attendance. As the father of a young man with Down
syndrome, I believe that it is important to give special needs children
the opportunity to grow their skills and be the best that they can be.
This event served as a reminder that we must continue to work to give
our loved ones opportunities to develop to the best of their abilities.
Congressman Pete Sessions walking the runway with two Global Down
Syndrome
Foundation models and advocates
As a strong advocate for people with disabilities in Congress, I will
continue to support legislative initiatives that promote awareness and
support for all of the special needs community. Last month, I joined
Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairman John Kline, and Chairman
Todd Rokita in submitting a formal request
for an increase in IDEA Part B funding in the Fiscal Year 2015
Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. This funding will ensure that special needs
children are prepared for success after high school and allow these
individuals to reach their full potential.
I sincerely hope the
Administration will honor our request and renew our commitment to these
students, their families, and their educators.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week

&#8211;

2014
This

is
National
Small
Business
Week,
a
time
to
celebrate
the
contributions
of
small
businesses
and
highlight
the
critical
role
entrepreneurs
and
small

owners
play
in
our

Here
are
some
things
you

small

employ
about

of

and

VA
Facility
Letter
On
Tuesday
I
was
proud
to
join
23
members
of
the
Texas
delegation
in
calling
for
an
Inspector
General
investigation
into
allegations
regarding
employees
manipulating
medical
appointment
data
at
the
North
Central
Federal
Clinic
in
San
Antonio,
the
Austin
Veterans
Affairs
Outpatient
Clinic,
and
the
Waco
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center.
An
employee
who
has
worked
at
all
three
of
these
facilities
confirmed
that
he
was
directed
by
supervisors
to
ensure
that
wait
times
for
veterans
were
as
close
to
zero
days
as
possible.
This
required
employees
to
falsely
log
patient
information
to
achieve
the
desired
wait
time
goal.
The
VA
facilities
in
question
serve
thousands
of
Texas
veterans.
These
brave
men
and
women
proudly
served
their
country
and
it
is
imperative
that
they
receive
the
highest
standard
of
medical
care
and
family
support
services
available.
The
alleged
deception
and
dishonest
practices
of
these
facilities
will
not
be
tolerated
and
I
am
committed
to
ensuring
that
those
responsible
for
this
misconduct
are
held
responsible.

ObamaCare
Amicus
Brief
This
week
I
joined
Senators
John
Cornyn
and
Ted
Cruz,
as
well
as
several
of
our
colleagues
in
the
House
and
Senate,
in
signing
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
support
of
a
federal
lawsuit
against
ObamaCare
titled
Hotze
v.
Sebelius.
An
amicus
curiae
brief
is
a
way
for
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
to
a
case
to
submit
their
perspective
on
the
legal
arguments
of
the
case
or
to
present
a
different
perspective
on
the
case
than
those
argued
by
the
parties.
As
a
Member
of
Congress,
I
have
a
compelling
interest
in
protecting
the
Constitution,
guarding
our
Bill
of
Rights,
and
in
guaranteeing
that
the
House
and
the
Senate
follow
the
requirements
of
the
Constitution.
In
the
brief,
we
argue
that
the
court
should
overturn
ObamaCare
on
the
grounds
that
it
violates
two
different
parts
of
the
Constitution
&#8211;
the
Origination
Clause,
Article
1,
Section
7,
and
the
Taking
Clause
of
the
5th
Amendment.
Of
the
nearly
100
lawsuits
that
have
been
filed
against
ObamaCare,
Hotze
v.
Sebelius
has
been
ranked
as
one
of
the
six
court
cases
with
the
greatest
likelihood
to
overturn
ObamaCare.
After
being
heard
in
the
U.S.
District
Court
of
the
Southern
District
of
Texas
earlier
this
year,
the
case
has
moved
to
the
U.S.
Fifth
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
where
oral
arguments
should
take
place
sometime
this
summer.
Global
Down
Syndrome
Foundation
Gala
Each
year
I&#8217;m
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
Global
Down
Syndrome
Foundation&#8217;s
&#8220;Be
Beautiful
Be
Yourself&#8221;
Gala
with
my
family,
Congressional
colleagues,
and
several
advocates
from
across
the
country.
This
year&#8217;s
event
was
truly
inspiring
and
it
was
great
to
hear
about
the
accomplishments
of
all
of
the
individuals
with
Down
syndrome
in
attendance.
As
the
father
of
a
young
man
with
Down
syndrome,
I
believe
that it
is
important
to
give
special
needs
children
the
opportunity
to
grow
their
skills
and
be
the
best
that
they
can
be.
This
event
served
as
a
reminder
that
we
must
continue
to
work
to
give
our
loved
ones
opportunities
to
develop
to
the
best
of
their
abilities.
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
walking
the
runway
with
two
Global
Down
Syndrome
Foundation
models
and
advocates
As
a
strong
advocate
for
people
with
disabilities
in
Congress,
I
will
continue
to
support
legislative
initiatives
that
promote
awareness
and
support
for
all
of
the
special
needs
community.
Last
month,
I
joined
Chairwoman
Cathy
McMorris
Rodgers,
Chairman
John
Kline,
and
Chairman
Todd
Rokita
in
submitting
a
formal
request
for
an
increase
in
IDEA
Part
B
funding
in
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
Labor,
Health
and
Human
Services,
Education,
and
Related
Agencies
Appropriations
Act .
This
funding
will
ensure
that
special
needs
children
are
prepared
for
success
after
high
school
and
allow
these
individuals
to
reach
their
full
potential.
I
sincerely
hope
the
Administration
will
honor
our
request
and
renew
our
commitment
to
these
students,
their
families,
and
their
educators.
Have
a
good
weekend.

Pete
