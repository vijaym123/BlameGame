Dear friend, The
Hobby Lobby
decision is the latest ruling from a Supreme Court that has consistently sided with corporations over citizens.
Corporations are not people, period. And today, I&rsquo;m joining with several of my colleagues to stand up and declare that your boss&rsquo; religious beliefs have no place in your doctor&rsquo;s office. Sign our petition opposing the
Hobby Lobby
decision, and show your support for women&rsquo;s rights.
This Court has done more in one week to set back the cause of women&rsquo;s access to health care than at any time since before the passage of Roe v. Wade four decades ago.
And
Hobby Lobby
could serve as the proverbial camel&rsquo;s nose under the tent -- there is nothing in the majority&rsquo;s ruling that limits the reach to only closely held corporations or to only certain forms of contraception. That&rsquo;s why we need to roll back this awful decision right now -- add your name to our petition and help us protect a woman&rsquo;s right to make her own health care decisions.
Thank you.
