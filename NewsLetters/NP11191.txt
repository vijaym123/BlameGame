The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of March 24- 28, 2014
This week, the Obama Administration once again unilaterally delayed
ObamaCare.
This last minute delay was announced late Tuesday night and
stated that the March 31st deadline to enroll in ObamaCare would be
extended.
Two weeks ago an official from HHS stated that the
administration did not have the "statutory authority" to extend the
enrollment period, yet the administration chose to ignore the rule of
law and move forward.
This recent delay joins the long list of unilateral actions taken by
the Administration to attempt to help Democrats politically, and
highlights that ObamaCare is unworkable.
Giving Americans more time to
enroll in this train wreck does nothing to address the real problems
with the law.
That is why I will continue fighting to fully repeal
ObamaCare and replace it with common sense, patient-centered reforms.
House Vote to Stop Presidential Overreach
On Wednesday the House approved H.R. 1459, the Ensuring Public
Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act. Under a
century-old law called the Antiquities Act, presidents have the sole
authority to designate large tracts of land as national monuments
without any input from the American people. Unfortunately, the law has
been misused at times for political purposes and has prohibited the
viable use of land for recreation, job creation, and economic growth.
In order to prevent an abuse of power and provide transparency, the
House approved H.R. 1459 to prevent any president from unilaterally
locking up federal lands without the support of local communities. To

Hobby Lobby Case Update
This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Sebelius v.
Hobby Lobby case. The case addresses whether the ObamaCare
"contraceptive mandate" infringes on Americans' rights under the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Currently, ObamaCare requires that
employers provide health insurance for their employees that includes
coverage for contraception and abortifacients. Companies that do not
comply with the mandate will be forced to pay crippling fines that
could force them to lay off employees or close their businesses
entirely.
However, this mandate violates the deeply held religious
beliefs of many companies, including Hobby Lobby.
These companies
rightfully argue that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act exempts
them from mandates like the contraception mandate that violate their
religious beliefs.
Our laws should not force individuals to violate their conscience and
their religious beliefs, which is why I believe that the Supreme Court
should rule in favor of Hobby Lobby.
In the fight to protect religious
freedom and the sanctity of life, I will continue working with my
colleagues to support policies that protect life and our freedom of
conscience and religion.
Baylor Medical Center at Garland
On Thursday, my Deputy District Director attended the 50th Anniversary
celebration for Baylor Medical Center at Garland to present a
Congressional Record on my behalf. Since Baylor Medical Center's
founding as Memorial Hospital of Garland in 1964 it has provided
personalized and excellent healthcare. I am deeply grateful for the
positive impact they have had on the community and their continuing
dedication to providing superior healthcare to the people of North
Texas.
General Aviation Manufacturers Association Rally
Today I was honored to join several of my Texas congressional
colleagues at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association's Jobs
Rally in Dallas. At the rally, I spoke about the importance of the
general aviation industry's contributions to economic growth and job
creation in North Texas.

general aviation industry to our nation, state, and local community

as well as Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz in hosting the North Texas
U.S. Service Academy Forum. The forum is for North Texas middle and
high school students who are interested in learning more about Academy
opportunities.
This year the forum will be held on Saturday, April 5th from 8am -

The

A
Weekly
Newsletter
from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week

This

the

once

unilaterally

ObamaCare.
This

was
announced
late
Tuesday
night
and
stated
that

that
the

did
not
have
the
&#8220;statutory

to
extend
the
enrollment
period,
yet
the
administration
chose
to
ignore
the
rule
of
law
and
move
forward.
This
recent
delay
joins
the
long
list
of
unilateral
actions
taken
by
the
Administration
to
attempt
to
help
Democrats
politically,
and
highlights
that
ObamaCare
is
unworkable.
Giving
Americans
more
time
to
enroll
in
this
train
wreck
does
nothing
to
address
the
real
problems
with
the
law.
That
is
why
I

and

Hobby
Lobby
Case
Update
This
week,
the
Supreme
Court
heard
oral
arguments
in
the
Sebelius
v.
Hobby
Lobby
case.
The
case
addresses
whether
the
ObamaCare
&#8220;contraceptive
mandate&#8221;
infringes
on
Americans&#8217;
rights
under
the
Religious
Freedom
Restoration
Act.
Currently,
ObamaCare
requires
that
employers
provide
health
insurance
for
their
employees
that
includes
coverage
for
contraception
and
abortifacients.
Companies
that
do
not
comply
with
the
mandate
will
be
forced
to
pay
crippling
fines
that
could
force
them
to
lay
off
employees
or
close
their
businesses
entirely.
However,
this
mandate
violates
the
deeply
held
religious
beliefs
of
many
companies,
including
Hobby
Lobby.
These
companies
rightfully
argue
that
the
Religious
Freedom
Restoration
Act
exempts
them
from
mandates
like
the
contraception
mandate
that
violate
their
religious
beliefs.
Our
laws
should
not
force
individuals
to
violate
their
conscience
and
their
religious
beliefs,
which
is
why
I
believe
that
the
Supreme
Court
should
rule
in
favor
of
Hobby
Lobby.
In
the
fight
to
protect
religious
freedom
and
the
sanctity
of
life,
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
to
support
policies
that
protect
life
and
our
freedom
of
conscience
and
religion.
