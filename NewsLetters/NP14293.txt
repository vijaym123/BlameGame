Minnesotans Echo Frustrations With
ObamaCare
Dear Friends,
I periodically share with you the devastating consequences ObamaCare is
having for Minnesotans. Tonight, I wanted you to hear the stories from
members of our communities. The e-mails I have received so far are clear
- Minnesotans are fed up with ObamaCare. If you would like to share your
story, please e-mail here
Samplings of stories from families, like yours, include:
*
Apple Valley resident: "I now pay 50 percent more for less
coverage."
*
Plainview resident: "Our health care is going up more than $200
a month and our deductible is going up by almost $1,300. Since Obama was
elected and all the talk started about ObamaCare, our insurance premiums
have tripled!!!"
*
Lakeville resident: "Our family coverage will SKYROCKET due to
the new coverage of children under age 26, even though they are NOT a
student, have a job and are NOT dependent on their parents.ObamaCare is
forcing us into very difficult positions."
*
Rosemount resident: "We are not in control of our own life any
more. It infuriates me that the government can tell us what health care
we have to go with. ObamaCare is wasteful and restrictive and overpriced
as many government programs turn out to be."
*
Burnsville resident: "My premiums [will be] rising $200 a month
because of the federal health care law. I understand that I am getting
more coverage, but it is coverage that I don't need or want. I don't
appreciate my federal government making those decisions for me."
Examining ObamaCare's Impact on Our Schools
As Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I
look forward to leading a hearing tomorrow morning to examine the impact
the President's health care law is having on schools and colleges
throughout America. Reports continue to highlight how the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is affecting schools,
universities, and colleges across the country. For example, the law's
punitive mandates are leading K-12 schools to reduce the work hours of
substitute teachers, teacher aides, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and
other part-time employees. Higher education institutions must also make
difficult decisions, such as restricting work hours and reducing the
number of adjunct professors. Students, families, and taxpayers will
ultimately experience the consequences of these changes through higher
costs and reduced access to important educational opportunities. To
watch the hearing live online tomorrow morning, please click here

Minnesota Veterans get Expanded Access to Health Care
On the eve of Veterans Day weekend, I was pleased Friday to announce
Shakopee was chosen as the site for the South West Metro Region VA
Outpatient Clinic. The new clinic, which will provide primary care,
mental health counseling, and telemedicine services, will be located at
1100 Shakopee Town Center in Shakopee. Earlier this year, I sent a
letter to the VA recommending Scott County be home to the new veterans
clinic. As a retired Marine, husband of a career Army nurse, and father
of a son who has served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am
pleased suburban and rural veterans in Minnesota's 2nd district will
benefit from this new, expanded access to medical care.
Have a great week!
Sincerely,
John Kline
Member of Congress

Dear
Friends,
I
periodically
share
with
you
the
devastating
consequences
ObamaCare
is
having
for
Minnesotans.
Tonight,
I
wanted
you
to
hear
the
stories
from
members
of
our
communities .
The
e-mails
I
have
received
so
far
are
clear
&#8211;
Minnesotans
are
fed
up
with
ObamaCare.
If
you

please

resident:
&#8220;We
are
not

of

any
more&#8230;
It
infuriates
me
that
the
government
can
tell
us
what
health
care
we
have
to
go
with.
ObamaCare
is
wasteful
and
restrictive
and
overpriced
as
many
government
programs
turn
out
to
be.&#8221; Burnsville
resident:
&#8220;My
premiums
[will
be]
rising
$200
a
month
because
of
the
federal
health
care
law.
I
understand
that
I
am
getting
more
coverage,
but
it
is
coverage
that
I
don&#8217;t
need
or
want.
I
don&#8217;t
appreciate
my
federal
government
making
those
decisions
for
me.&#8221;
Examining
ObamaCare&#8217;s
Impact
on
Our
Schools
As
Chairman
of
the
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce,
I
look
forward
to
leading
a
hearing
tomorrow
morning
to
examine
the
impact
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law
is
having
on
schools
and
colleges
throughout
America.
Reports
continue
to
highlight
how
the
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act
(PPACA)
is
affecting
schools,
universities,
and
colleges
across
the
country .
For
example,
the
law&#8217;s
punitive
mandates
are
leading
K-12
schools
to
reduce
the
work
hours
of
substitute
teachers,
teacher
aides,
cafeteria
workers,
bus
drivers,
and
other
part-time
employees.
Higher
education
institutions
must
also
make
difficult
decisions,
such
as
restricting
work
hours
and
reducing
the
number
of
adjunct
professors.
Students,
families,
and
taxpayers
will
ultimately
experience
the
consequences
of
these
changes
through
higher
costs
and
reduced
access
to
important
educational
