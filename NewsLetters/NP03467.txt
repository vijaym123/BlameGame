Advancing
Solutions for a Stronger America
Dear Friend,
This week, the 114th Congress commenced,
and the House of Representatives wasted no
time in passing bipartisan legislation to
confront the serious challenges our great
nation faces. We in the House passed three
major bills to provide real solutions for
the American people by mitigating the
harmful impacts of the Presidents
healthcare law, reducing the burdensome
impact of regulations that hamper small
business job growth, and implementing a
sensible and robust domestic energy
policy.
On the first day of the new Congress,
the House unanimously passed
the
Hire More Heroes Act , which would
provide small businesses relief from the
senseless employer mandate in the
Presidents healthcare law and create
new opportunities for veterans looking to
find work. We also passed
the
Save American Workers Act
to restore
the traditional 40-hour definition of
full-time employment to help
protect hardworking Americans from having
their hours and wages cut. As I travel
throughout the Fifth District, I continue
to hear from Virginians who have had their
hours cut as a result of the30-hour
rule and the negative impacts it has
had on their families, and I welcomed the
opportunity to pass legislation to address
this harmful provision.
On Friday, the House also approved
legislation to advance the construction of
the Keystone XL Pipeline, a crucial piece
of our energy strategy aimed at increasing
North American energy production and giving
Americans more affordable energy choices. I
was proud to support each of these
measures, and I was pleased that so many of
our Democrat colleagues joined us in the
effort to advance these proposals that will
make life easier on our working
families.
While we in the House spent the first
week of the new year working together, the
President took actions that call into
question his willingness to work with us to
provide more opportunity to all Americans.
Just two days into the 114th Congress, the
President had already issued
three
veto threats against bipartisan bills.
If that were not enough, the Obama
administration issued
300
new rules in the federal register
in
the first week of 2015. It is my hope that
the President will change his go-it-alone
approach and meet us at the negotiating
table as he pledged to do after the
election.
The peoples House will continue
to fight for real solutions to the
challenges our great nation faces. We will
continue to advance bipartisan policies
like those we passed this week, and it is
my hope that our colleagues in the Senate
will now take up these good bills and join
us in advancing policies to build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
