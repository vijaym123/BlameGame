Friends,
This week, I joined the U.S. House in establishing a select committee to
investigate the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The Obama Administrations response to the tragic loss of four Americans, including the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in office since 1979, has left Americans in search of the truth and justice.
Instead of the sober and clear eyed leadership we expect in response to a coordinated terrorist attack on the United States, the Administration repeatedly used a false storyline about a spontaneous riot.
Ever since, it has taken hearings and dogged inquireseven a Freedom of Information Act requestto pry information from the White House. After nearly 20 months, its long past time for the answers and accountability that this bipartisan select committee will provide.
We also took action this week on the IRS targeting scandal
by requesting a special counsel to take over the investigation and voting to hold Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of the scandal, in contempt of Congress.
Abusing government power to target people for their beliefs is an extraordinary violation of the public trust. Yet, the Justice Department responded to the IRS scandal by picking a Democratic donor to be the lead investigatoranother outrage that further undermined confidence in the government.
Without truth there is no justice, and I believe the appointment of an independent special counsel is necessary to uncover the full truth.
I will continue to keep you updated as we hold the Obama Administration accountable for Benghazi and IRS targeting.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
Rep. Graves Supports Charter Schools
This week, the House passed H.R. 10, a bill to support the growth of high quality charter schools across the United States.
Over 900,000 students are estimated to be on waiting lists for charter schools today. The demand for charter schools has skyrocketed, with student enrollment increasing 225% over the last 10 years.
House Republicans have been working to uncover the truth for over a year.
