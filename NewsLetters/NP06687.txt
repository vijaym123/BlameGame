I wanted to share with you
an article
I read recently, published on
Forbes.com , laying out three principal ways Obamacare is hampering the job market: 1) by increasing taxes; 2) by increasing the cost of labor; and 3) by encouraging some workers to drop out of the workforce.
Are you a 4 th
District business owner or employee? Im interested to hear your thoughts. Read it and weigh in,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Every day, I hear from business owners around the 4 th
District and across the country, and they all say the same thing: the federal government needs to get out of our way so we can do our job and create growth. I agree: government should be an enabler of economic growth, not a barrier. Thats why Im continuing to work to defund, repeal, and replace Obamacare, as well as fight unnecessary and unreasonable regulations that harm economic growth. Read more about my work,
