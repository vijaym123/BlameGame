Dear Friend,
Over three years ago, the House
Committee on Ways &amp; Means started
asking the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
if it was targeting political groups for
extra scrutiny. The IRS repeatedly denied
to the American people and Congress that
any such political targeting occurred,
until last May when former IRS Official
Lois Lerner admitted that the federal
agency did in fact target conservative
groups.
Days later, the Ways &amp; Means
Committee launched an investigation into
the abuses at the IRS. We have held
multiple hearings and heard testimony from
numerous individuals, and what we learned
is disturbing. Not only is it possible that
top IRS officials lied under oath, they
also may have violated the American
peoples constitutional rights.
When the public initially learned of the
scandal, President Obama promised that he
would work with Congress to fix it. Just a
few months ago, IRS Commissioner Koskinen
pledged that he would provide much-needed
transparency to the broken agency and work
quickly to address its problems. He also
promised to produce all of former IRS
Official Lois Lerners documents. In
light of recent events, it could not be any
clearer that the IRS has reached new levels
of corruption as it continues to abuse its
power and mislead the American public.
In its standard Friday afternoon news
dump, the IRS announced the week before
last that the agency has lost
an unknown number of Ms. Lerners
emails during a two-year period due to a
computer crash. While the
Committee has some of Ms. Lerners
emails during that time period, we only
have the emails written to or from other
IRS employees. Any emails written to or
from Ms. Lerner from people outside of the
IRS apparently are lost. Conveniently for
Ms. Lerner, the emails that were lost were
sent and received during the height of the
IRS' political targeting. The Committee
later learned that not only were Ms.
Lerners emails lost, but so were the
emails of six other IRS officials. Just
last week, it was discovered that the White
House has known for months that these
emails were lost, yet kept it a secret from
Congress.
This is the same government agency that
expects hardworking taxpayers to keep seven
years worth of records just in case
you are selected for an audit. Going
forward, will the IRS accept the response
I threw away my hard drive
when auditing an individual who cant
produce adequate documentation? Of course
it wont, and this excuse wont
hold up in Congress either. I dont
buy it.
How is the IRS technology so poor
that it can deem emails
unrecoverable? If the agency
knew that these emails could not be
recovered back in April, then why
didnt someone notify Congress
immediately? The IRS has stonewalled our
investigation every step of the way, and
its time that Attorney General
Holder take this seriously. He owes it to
the American people to uphold the rule of
law.
The IRS latest stunt is further
evidence that it engaged in the illegal
targeting of political groups, which goes
against the very principles this country
was founded upon. This is completely
unacceptable. The IRS has now lost all
credibility and certainly the
publics trust. I am committed to
getting the answers that Ohioans expect and
deserve from the IRS and holding
accountable those who have arrogantly
defied the law.
