Examining the VA Backlog
7/14/14
Tonight, at
5:30pm MT/ 7:30pm ET, Congressman Doug Lamborn will be taking part in
a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing reviewing the VA claims
backlog
process.
Information from the House
Veterans Affairs Committee
The hearing will look at the strategies VA has used to meet the
2015 goal as well as opportunities that may exist for abuse and
deviation from the mission of the Veterans Benefits Administration, which is
to provide benefits and services to veterans and their families in a
responsive, timely and compassionate
manner.
As has been shown with the VAs delays in care scandal,
widespread data manipulation and whistleblower retaliation at VA
medical centers has had deadly consequences for many veterans. This
hearing will explore similar instances of cooking the books and
whistleblower reprisals that have occurred within VBA and seek to determine the
extent to which these tactics are employed throughout VAs claims
processing operations.
The following event is open to the
press:
