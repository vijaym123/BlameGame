I emailed this morning. I&rsquo;m emailing again this afternoon. It&rsquo;s because today is the most important day of the entire election. The FINAL FEC deadline hits at midnight. I&rsquo;m pleading with you:
Friend -- I emailed this morning.
I&rsquo;m emailing again this afternoon.
It&rsquo;s because today is the most important day of the entire election.
The FINAL FEC deadline hits at midnight. I&rsquo;m pleading with you: If you read a single email today, make it this one!
I don&rsquo;t want to alarm you, but:
Six races will decide control of the Senate -- and they&rsquo;re a
dead heat.
Republicans need to win just THREE to take control.
That&rsquo;s 50-50 odds --
much too close
with only 20 days left!
Friend, I know we can win this election. But today&rsquo;s deadline is critical.
We desperately need to raise another $125,000 by midnight in order to implement our massive
Get Out The Vote Campaign.
Please don&rsquo;t miss this LAST chance to make our GOTV Campaign the strongest it can be! Donate now. TRIPLE-MATCH: Your gift will have 4x the effect!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If we don&rsquo;t raise another $125,000 by midnight, we&rsquo;re going to fall short, which means fewer GOTV staff, fewer reminder calls&hellip; and fewer voters at the polls. It would be an Election Day tragedy.
But if you contribute NOW, we&rsquo;ll be able to fund the
biggest midterm turnout operation in history!
We&rsquo;d be able to deal the GOP a BRUTAL defeat. (Seriously:
Roll Call
reported it would be &ldquo;a punch to the party&rsquo;s solar plexus.&rdquo;)
You have 6 hours left to make it happen. Your gift will be triple-matched. Will you pitch in right now?
I appreciate it,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
