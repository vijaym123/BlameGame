Dear Friend,
Happy Independence Day. On this day, 238 years ago,
our founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence. Since
then, generations of Americans have sacrificed to defend and preserve the
principles of our nation's founding document: Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness.
As we
gather with friends and family today, let us give thanks to our men and
women in uniform, especially those serving overseas. Let us also
remember the millions of American veterans who gave so much to defend our
freedom over the past 238 years. Without their sacrifices, Independence
Day would not be the joyous celebration it is
today.
The Fourth of July is also a
reminder of all that unites us as Americans. In a Congress that has been
plagued by partisanship for too long, we have something to learn from
this coming together to celebrate the birth of our nation. This
holiday is a reminder to us all that it is time to find the common ground
we know exists so we can work together to find commonsense solutions to
the issues we face today. After all, we are a country that is
stronger united than divided.
Have a safe and happy Independence
Day.
