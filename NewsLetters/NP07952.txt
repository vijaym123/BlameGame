VISITING DC
July 11, 2014
This
week the Senate spent most of the work period on S. 2363, the Bipartisan
Sportsmens Act of 2014.
I introduced two amendments to the bill
an amendment that would help stop federal restrictions on access to
North Carolinas beaches and an amendment to protect the Corolla wild
horses.
You can read about each of these amendments
here:

Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) once again blocked
my amendments
which are very important to North Carolina
from
getting an up or down vote in the United States Senate.
Instead of
allowing Senators of both parties to debate and shape legislation
through an open amendment process, Reid attempted to jam the Sportsmens
bill through the Senate without a single amendment being considered.
All Senate Republicans and 11 Senate Democrats
many of them,
including myself, supporters of the underlying bill -- voted against
Reids procedural maneuver.
Because he failed in his
attempt to jam the bill, Reid then opted to pull the bill from the
Senate floor rather than simply allow votes on amendments.
As a
result, the voices of North Carolinians were shortchanged on yet another
piece of legislation.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
