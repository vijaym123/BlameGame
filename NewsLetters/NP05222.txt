Dear
Friend,
This year's open enrollment period for Medicare is October
15th through December 7th.
This is the time of year when you can
change your health and prescription drug plans. Below are details
about the open enrollment period as well as other resources that may be
helpful if you have questions about Medicare.
The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also report a dramatic increase in
fraudulent activities during the Medicare Open Enrollment period.
If you are a Medicare recipient or know someone who is, please read
the information on ways to identify and help prevent Medicare
fraud.
As always, please contact my office at
209-579-5458 if we can be of assistance to you with this or any other
issue.
2014 MEDICARE OPEN ENROLLMENT DATES: October 15
December 7
Medicare can assist you in choosing the plan that
best meets your needs and can provide you with information, counseling
and assistance in regards to plans and benefits. Seniors, family members
and caregivers can ask questions and learn more about Medicare by
calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or by visiting Medicare's website
at
www.medicare.gov .
Here are four
things you can do during Medicare open
enrollment:
Switch from Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) to a Medicare
Advantage Plan.
Change from a Medicare Advantage Plan back
to Original Medicare.
Switch from one Medicare Advantage
Plan to another Medicare Advantage Plan.
Join, switch,
or drop your Medicare Prescription Drug Plan to your existing
Medicare Advantage Plan.
PROTECTING AGAINST
MEDICARE FRAUD AND ABUSE
Here are some tips to help
ensure that you and your benefits are
protected:
When you see the doctor or have a test or procedure, keep some simple
notes on your calendar about what you had done. Then, when you get your
claims information in the mail from Medicare, check the claims against
your notes.
Have a friend or loved one help you if
needed.
If you find an error, report it as soon as possible.
You can report it to Medicare at (800) HHS-TIPS (1-800-447-8477), or
online at
www.stopmedicarefraud.gov .
Protect your personal information by guarding your Medicare and
Social Security Numbers. If your Medicare card is lost or stolen, report it
right away. Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY
1-800-325-0778) for a replacement.
Be suspicious of free offers,
especially if they ask for your Medicare number.
If it's free, they
do not need your number.
Report any suspicious
activity to the Office of the Inspector General at (800) HHS-TIPS
(1-800-447-8477), or online at
www.stopmedicarefraud.gov .
