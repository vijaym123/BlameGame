HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01CF34AD.7CFB3C20]
Northern Mariana Islands Governor Eloy S. Inos and Speaker of the House Joseph P. Deleon Guerrero, and Members of Congress Donna Christensen (D-Virgin Islands), Madeleine Bordallo (D-Guam), and I were among the representatives of the insular areas and federal agencies gathered for this year's meeting of the Interagency Group on Insular Affairs. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and the Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs David Agnew co-chaired the meeting. For Interior's report on the event, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEiDkwiMaJk&feature;=youtu.be.
Democrats get second hearing on fisheries management law - Invoking House Rule XI , which guarantees minority members of a committee the right to call witnesses, 11 of my Democratic colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee and I were able to get a second hearing this week on reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. We were concerned that issues such as the fight against pirate fishing in the EEZ, how climate change is upsetting ocean ecosystems, the need for more electronic monitoring of fishing vessels, and the continuing lack of sufficient scientific data on fish stocks had not been fully reviewed in a December hearing. Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Washington) called that hearing to consider his draft of a reauthorization of Magnuson. The law, which has regulated fishing in U.S. waters since 1976, has not been reauthorized since 2006 and is overdue for an update. Fishing is central to our island cultures and an important source of food. We need to manage the fishery well for ourselves and for the generations that follow.

Governor Eloy S. Inos and Speaker of the House Joseph P. Deleon Guerrero visited their congressional office this week. We discussed the Governor's work with the National Governors Association, which was holding its Washington Winter meeting; and we reviewed the Speaker's full agenda. He was focused on the military build-up in the Northern Marianas and had the opportunity to be briefed from many angles. The Department of Defense provided the operational perspective at the Pentagon and at artillery training ranges at Quantico Marine Base. House Armed Services Committee staff explained the congressional actions that control the build-up. And White House National Security analysts laid out the larger U.S. strategic interests in the Pacific and East Asia. The Speaker also met with the Chief of Strategic Resources at the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to get the latest scientific information on offshore resources in the Marianas.
Changes to WIC program finalized - Women, Infant, and Children program recipients in the Northern Marianas and nationwide are expected to see improvements in their diets as a result of changes announced this week. There will be a 30 percent increase in the dollar amount allowed for children's fruits and vegetable purchases, reflecting the renewed emphasis on nutrition in the WIC program; and parents of older infants will also be allowed to substitute fresh fruits and vegetable for jarred infant food. Importantly, the new standards also recognize the need to provide local WIC agencies with flexibility to meet the cultural needs of WIC clients within a sound, scientific nutritional framework. Assuring that everyone - especially growing youngsters - has access to the food they need to be healthy is a primary part of my work. I applaud the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its WIC program for taking these steps, which will help reduce childhood obesity and enhance every child's opportunity to do better in school. More information about the changes and the WIC program can be found at http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/final-rule-revisions-wic-food-packages.
