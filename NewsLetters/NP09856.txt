Dear Friend:
The recent kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian school girls underscores the horrific violence that too many women and girls face every day.
That's why this week I joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), legislation that makes clear that ending discrimination and violence against women is a top priority for the United States.
The bill will ensure that the U.S. government has a comprehensive strategy in place to prevent violence against women and girls around the world.

Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
