Dear Friend,
Happy Spring! Here's my report on what I've been working on recently.
Pushing for Campaign Finance Reform
Last week, the Supreme Court ignored decades of precedent by removing
the aggregate limit that wealthy individuals can donate to candidates,
political parties, and political action committees. This was a terrible
decision. Sadly, millions of average Americans' voices will be drowned
out by special interests.
Watch
my interview with Alex Witt to hear how the Supreme
Court's McCutcheon decision will increase the role of money in politics.
Supporting Equal Pay
Tuesday was Equal Pay Day.
Working women are America's mothers, daughters, sisters, and wives.
We're America's factory and office workers, health care professionals
and scientists, business executives and teachers. Women are working
everywhere, but women in America still make only 77 cents for every
dollar a man earns.
Equal pay for equal work is a fairness issue and
an economic issue.
In the eight years since I was elected as the first woman from New
Hampshire to serve in federal office, we have seen great changes. New
Hampshire proudly became the first state in the nation to be
represented by an all-female delegation. Congress passed the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. And thanks to the leadership of State Senator
Sylvia Larsen, the New Hampshire State Senate unanimously passed the
Paycheck Fairness Act of 2014.
If Paycheck Fairness is acceptable to Republicans and Democrats in New
Hampshire, it should be good enough to get a vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck
Fairness Act in Congress, and I call on Speaker Boehner to bring this
bill up for a vote immediately.
Roundtable on the Affordable Care Act
I hosted a roundtable on the Affordable Care Act in order to hear how
the law is benefiting and improving the lives of families,
entrepreneurs, and small business owners throughout our district.
While we still need to improve the health care law, I am proud to see
all the great work that this law is doing for our state already.
Celebrating New Jobs in New Hampshire
Last week, I participated with my colleagues in a ribbon cutting for
Albany Engineered Composites and SAFRAN.
This is a great occasion for New Hampshire and my home town of
Rochester. Four hundred to five hundred high-quality manufacturing jobs
will be created in this facility, which is exactly the kind of
development we need here in Rochester and around our state and country.
The Safran Albany plant has partnered with Great Bay Community College's
Advanced Technology and Academic Center, so Granite Staters can be
educated and employed right here in New Hampshire. This will help our
economy continue to grow.
I spoke directly with Safran's CEO Jean-Paul Herteman about why
Rochester and our state is such a great place for advanced
manufacturing.
Championing Animal Rights
I was honored to receive the Humane Champion Award from the Humane
Society for my 100% support for animals! I'm happy to advocate for all
God's creatures.
Honoring Veterans
I attended a very moving Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day event in
Whitefield. Thank you and God bless you and your loved ones. Welcome
home!
Tammy Krueger, a true friend to all vets and an advocate for veterans'
families, officially became Director of the Manchester VA Medical
Center last week. I was pleased to speak at her Assumption of Duty
Ceremony, and to talk with New Hampshire veterans.
Supporting Investments in Transportation
I was proud to lead 67 bipartisan Members of Congress on a letter to
the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development expressing support for transit funding that will
create jobs and is essential to the future of the Capitol Corridor
Project.
I look forward to supporting the Capitol Corridor project as it
completes its preliminary study and moves into the next phase of
development. Read more here: http://1.usa.gov/1hG1BEA
Meeting with Granite Staters
The best part of my job is meeting with constituents and hearing their
stories.
Here are a few highlights:
I had a great time with the New Hampshire Occupational Therapy
Association, who are always advocating for their patients.
I had a wonderful meeting with Rosie, her dad, and Reid's dad. Kids
with cystic fibrosis are living better lives than ever before, but it's
still very tough. They and their families are powerful advocates for
research investment and finding a cure, and I am a strong advocate for
medical research.
Congratulations to New Hampshire Assistant Principal of the Year, Bill
Lonergan!
Thanks to the Alzheimer's Association for your continued push for a
cure.
It was inspiring to meet CloseUp students interested in public service.
I had a very informative conversation with the American Academy of
Family Physicians about expanding primary care access to Granite
Staters and supporting more residency training programs.
Red Sox Nation!
With baseball season underway, I was very happy to celebrate the Red
Sox World Series Championship at the White House. GO SOX!
Best Wishes,
Carol

Dear
Friend,
Happy
Spring!
Here&#8217;s
my
report
on
what
I&#8217;ve
been
working
on
recently.
Pushing
for
Campaign
Finance
Reform
Last
week,
the
Supreme
Court
ignored
decades
of
precedent
by
removing
the
aggregate
limit
that
wealthy
individuals
can
donate
to
candidates,
political
parties,
and
political
action
committees.
This
was
a
terrible
decision.
Sadly,
millions
of
average
Americans&#8217;
voices
will
be
drowned
out
by
special
interests.
Watch
my
interview
with
Alex
Witt
to
hear
how
the Supreme
Court&#8217;s
McCutcheon
decision
will
increase
the
role
of
money
in
politics.
Supporting
Equal
Pay
Tuesday
was
Equal
Pay
Day.
Working
women
are
America's
mothers,
daughters,
sisters,
and
wives.
We're
America's
factory
and
office
workers,
health
care
professionals
and
scientists,
business
executives
and
teachers.
Women
are
working
everywhere,
but
women
in
America
still
make
only
77
cents
for
every
dollar
a
man
earns.
Equal
pay
for
equal
work
is
a
fairness
issue
and
an
economic
issue.
In
the
eight
years
since
I
was
elected
as
the
first
woman
from
New
Hampshire
to
serve
in
federal
office,
we
have
seen
great
changes.
New
Hampshire
proudly
became
the
first
state
in
the
nation
to
be
represented
by
an
all-female
delegation.
Congress
passed
the
Lilly
Ledbetter
Fair
Pay
Act.
And
thanks
to
the
leadership
of
State
Senator
Sylvia
Larsen,
the
New
Hampshire
State
Senate
unanimously
passed
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
of
2014.
If
Paycheck
Fairness
is
acceptable
to
Republicans
and
Democrats
in
New
Hampshire,
it
should
be
good
enough
to
get
a
vote
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives.
I'm
proud
to
be
an
original
cosponsor
of
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
in
Congress,
and
I
call
on
Speaker
Boehner
to
bring
this
bill
up
for
a
vote
immediately.
Roundtable
on
the
Affordable
Care
Act
I
hosted
a
roundtable
on
the
Affordable
Care
Act
in
order
to
hear
how
the
law
is
benefiting
and
improving
the
lives
of
families,
entrepreneurs,
and
small
business
owners
throughout
our
district.
While
we
still
need
to
improve
the
health
care
law,
I
am
proud
to
see
all
the
great
work
that
this
law
is
doing
for
our
state
already.
Celebrating
New
Jobs
in
New
Hampshire
Last

I
participated
with
my
colleagues
in
a
ribbon

for
Albany
Engineered

and
SAFRAN.
This
is
a
great

for
New

and
my
home
town
of
Rochester.
Four
hundred
to
five
hundred
high-quality
manufacturing
jobs
will
be
created
in
this
facility,
which
is
exactly
the
kind
of
development
we
need
here
in
Rochester
and
around
our
state
and
country.
The
Safran
Albany
plant
has
partnered
with
Great
Bay
Community
College&#8217;s
Advanced
Technology
and
Academic
Center,
so
Granite
Staters
can
be
educated
and
employed
right
here
in
New
Hampshire.
This
will
help
our
economy
continue
to
grow.
I
spoke
directly
with
Safran&#8217;s
CEO
Jean-Paul
Herteman
about
why
Rochester
and
our
state
is
such
a
great
place
for
advanced
manufacturing.
Championing
Animal
Rights
I
was
honored
to
receive
the
Humane
Champion
Award
from
the
Humane
Society
for
my
100%
support
for
animals!
I&#8217;m
happy
to
advocate
for
all
God&#8217;s
creatures.
Honoring
Veterans
I
attended
a
very
moving
Welcome
Home
Vietnam
Veterans
Day
event
in
Whitefield.
Thank
you
and
God
bless
you
and
your
loved
ones.
Welcome
home!
Tammy
Krueger,
a
true
friend
to
all

an
