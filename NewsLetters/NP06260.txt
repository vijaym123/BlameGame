David, I really need to talk with you.
This morning, Senator Durbin -- an old friend and mentor -- asked you to support my campaign.
Since then, 295 of you have responded to his call-to-action! Thank you! But as of 9:30pm, we&rsquo;re still coming up $267 short ahead of tonight&rsquo;s critical fundraising deadline.
David, in a race as close as ours, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss even a single goal -- not if we&rsquo;re going to keep Illinois blue. So I&rsquo;m asking:
Will you chip in $5 or more to our campaign by midnight? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for your continued support,
Cheri
P.S. Sorry for all these emails. I know it can be a lot, but your grassroots support will carry us across the finish line.
