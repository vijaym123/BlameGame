Dear Friend,
Well be addressing some
important issues in the Small Business and Science, Space, and
Technology committees tomorrow.
Here is a brief summary of the issues
and links so you can get more information or watch the hearings as they
happen.
SEC's Crowdfunding Proposal: Will it Work for Small
Businesses?
Listen to my
thoughts on the hearing, here.
I am chairing the House
Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations
hearing,
SECs Crowdfunding Proposal: Will It Work
for Small Businesses?
tomorrow, and taking a deeper
look into how this proposed rule might affect growing businesses. The
U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) will be closing the
comment period on this proposed rule that implements the crowdfunding
provisions of the 2012 Jump Start Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act early
next month.
The JOBS Act allows for more robust opportunities
for small businesses and startups to raise capital, but feedback were
investigating on the proposed rule suggests the SECs fine print may
create too much government regulation and bureaucratic red tape.
Listen in to the hearing yourself on Thursday, January 16th at 8AM MST/
10AM EST through this live stream
here .
Healthcare.gov: Consequences of Stolen
Identity
Also on Thursday, the Science,
Space, and Technology committee is hosting a hearing titled,
'Healthcare.gov: Consequences of Stolen Identity.' We will be questioning
witnesses from cybersecurity firms and companies on the consequences of
stolen identity and security breeches of the site. You can watch the
hearing live,
here , on Thursday, January 16th, 2014 at
7am MST/9AM EST.
And as I've mentioned on social media
and in last week's newsletter, the risk of a cybersecurity breech in
Healthcare.gov is very high and reason enough to repeal and replace
Obamacare. Last week I cosponsered the
American
Healthcare Reform Act
(H.R. 3121)
and voted in
strong favor for the
Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 3811) .
The Reform act would repeal and replace Obamacare
with secure, patient-centric care options. The Health Exchange Security
and Transparency Act would require transparency and follow up if a
person's identityor personal information is stolen from Healthcare.gov.
Watch the video above
to listen to my thoughts on
the benefits of the American Health Care Reform
Act.
Sincerely,
Back in
Arizona...
Mobile Office Hours
&amp;
Tax ID Theft

My Arizona team will be hosting a Mobile Office Hours
session on Saturday January 18, 2014 from 9:00AM-11:00AM at ABCO Shredding
&amp; Recycling in North Phoenix.
Each Mobile Office Hour Session
will include information for prevention tips and assistance regarding
tax identity theft risks.
If you
need more information on examples of or assistance with tax related
identity theft, please go to the Federal Trade Commission's website
here .
P.S.
Last week,
I attended a interesting hearing on
programs in the private sector that promote STEM educationscience,
technology, engineering and math.
Weve been hearing a lot about STEM
lately, partly because those areas are where the new jobs are being
created and partly because U.S. students are falling behind in these
subjects compared with their globally peers.
We heard about some
amazing and effective programs that are available for schools to leverage.
Several participating students
provided testimony showing just how beneficial these types of programs
are in preparing students for careers in technology.
Educators
and parents can learn more about the programs and the
hearing
here .
During 2014, Ill be looking at ways
Congress can help promote and facilitate STEM
education.
