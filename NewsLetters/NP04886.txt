&ldquo;Republicans hold a narrow, but steady, lead in the contest for control of the Senate&rdquo;

Dear Friend, We&rsquo;re running out of time in this election.
Every national pollster gives the GOP better-than-even odds of taking over the Senate on Tuesday. It&rsquo;s up to us to prove them wrong. This year&rsquo;s elections are going to come down to turnout, and GOTV operations cost money. Please help us get out the vote -- contribute $5 before it&rsquo;s too late.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
I know we can do this. I know that Democrats from coast to coast can prove all the pundits wrong.
But we can only do that if we give our field teams the resources they need.
You can help by pitching in five bucks.
Thank you for your help.
