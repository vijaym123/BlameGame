Dear Friends,
For three months now, the
Maduro regime in Venezuela has committed grave human rights violations
as it seeks to muzzle students who are peaceful and the Venezuelan
people who are calling for the respect of human rights and democracy to
take hold in this country.
There have been over 40 people
killed; nearly 60 reported cases of torture; more than 2,000 people
unjustly detained; and hundreds more injured.
Lets look at what
has happened recently: 250 teenage protesters, ones who had camped out
in public squares to protest, were rounded up at 3 in the morning
yesterday; the Venezuelan Intelligence agency, SEBIN, picked up and has
put in detention Rodrigo Diamanti, the leader of a NGO called Un Mundo
Sin Mordaza; censorship continues as yet another prominent independent
radio program was pulled off the airwaves; newspapers like El
Universal are saying they have about two weeks left of newsprint because the
government has put many challenges in their way to provide information
to the people of Venezuela. And lastly, opposition leader Leopoldo
Lopez was supposed to have his day in court and all of a sudden, his
hearing was simply postponed without reason, without discussion, no
explanation, simply canceled.
Even with all this repression,
we must recognize the students and student unions on several of the
campuses in Venezuela for continuing to show bravery and courage to
fight for democracy and freedom of expression.
The House Foreign
Affairs Committee showed their support for the people of Venezuela, in
one bipartisan voice they condemned the human rights violations
occurring in Venezuela. Passage of my bill, H.R. 4587
the Venezuela Human
Rights and Democracy Protection Act
from the committee sends a
strong message to Maduro that the United States Congress is well aware of
the ongoing abuses perpetuated by his regime, and that they will not
go unpunished. I thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting
the legislation and I will continue my unwavering support of the people
of Venezuela in their quest for freedom, democracy, and respect for
human rights.
This is a step in the right direction and now we
need to work to pass my legislation in the House of Representatives.
Maduro and his officials must be held responsible for human rights
violations in Venezuela.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
