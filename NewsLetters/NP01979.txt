David -- If we had to pick the number one enemy of the Affordable Care Act, it would definitely be Ted Cruz. Let&rsquo;s take a quick walk down memory lane:
He led a government shutdown in 2013 to try to repeal the ACA, at a cost of $24 billion.
He continues to characterize Obamacare as &ldquo;lawlessness on a breathtaking scale,&rdquo; despite the law&rsquo;s continued success and 16.4 million newly insured Americans!
Just this Monday, he pledged again to &ldquo;repeal every word&rdquo; of the law.
But get this: After all the trash talking, Ted Cruz just announced that
now he&rsquo;s signing up for Obamacare himself!
Let&rsquo;s give him a warm welcome! Add your name to congratulate Ted Cruz on his new healthcare plan.

Having access to healthcare is incredibly important for all Americans. We&rsquo;re just so glad that Obamacare will be there for Ted Cruz and his family when they need it.
Join us in giving Ted Cruz a warm welcome to Obamacare!
