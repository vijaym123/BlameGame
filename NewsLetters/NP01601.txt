Dear Friend,
I told you about Chaplain Joseph Lawhorn. When the Army
chaplain offered his personal story of depression and recovery through faith
to fellow soldiers, an atheist group complained. Though he followed
Army regulations, offering the troops secular materials as well,
Lawhorn's commanders at Camp Merrill in Georgia's Ninth District
filed a Letter of Concern against
him.
Now, Navy Chaplain Wes Modder is facing the same religious
discrimination,
it appears from my investigation .
The former Marine with an exemplary 19-year record provided spiritual
guidance to troops in private sessions. He provided it, according to his
sincerely held religious beliefs, only to those who sought his help.
But his new assistant, after just a month on the job, filed an Equal
Opportunity complaint against Modder, whose beliefs about traditional
marriage his superiors suddenly deemed inappropriate, and they
dismissed him from duty.
As an Air Force
Reserve chaplain, who served in Iraq, I'm shocked that our military
leaders would censure these chaplains, enforcing warped notions of political
correctness, when morale is so low and suicide rates so high among
rank and file. Not only do chaplains like Lawhorn and Modder provide
spiritual guidance no average therapist could, their freedom of religion
is a Constitutional right. Congress ensured their First Amendment
rights in its 2014 Defense Authorization, which I
supported.
Also, during the 2013 budget crisis, I made sure
chaplains would be available to our armed forces and am fighting -- with
the support of more House Republicans
-- to make sure that their
role, one George Washington created, continues. Our troops, often
confronting life-or-death situations, deserve all the help they can get.

Doug
