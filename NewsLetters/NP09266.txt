Dear Friend,
On this and every Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who
paid the ultimate price defending our freedom. We owe each of them and
their families a great debt that can never be truly repaid. But we
strive to be worthy of their sacrifice by honoring and thanking those
who have defended and those who still defend our freedom, by comforting
and providing for their families, and by supporting and caring for all
the veterans who have returned home.
Rep. Elizabeth Esty talking with veterans
at the Simsbury Memorial Day Parade
I am deeply concerned about recent reports of falsified wait lists and
widespread delays for care at VA medical facilities, including
allegations that up to 40 veterans may have died while waiting for
treatment in Phoenix, Arizona. This is very disturbing and needs to be
effectively addressed. Our veterans have sacrificed so much serving our
country, and they deserve the best care promptly delivered.
Any VA managers who are contributing to a climate of neglect must be
held accountable. That's why I voted for the VA Management
Accountability Act, which would allow the VA to more easily punish or
fire senior executive employees for inadequate job performance.
And that's also why when Secretary Shinseki recently announced the VA
will be conducting "face-to-face" reviews of all VA medical facilities,
I joined our senators and the other members of the Connecticut
congressional delegation in demanding full transparency
with the audits in our state. Our state's
VA facilities
include
campuses in West Haven and Newington, and six Community Based
Outpatient Clinics in Danbury, New London, Stamford, Waterbury,
Willimantic, and Winsted.
I urge any veteran who has experienced unacceptable delays or
inadequate care at a VA facility to reach out to my office. Please call
my office with your thoughts on this or any other issue. As always,
please don't hesitate to reach out by email
or at 860-223-8412. To find out more about my
work in Congress, check out my Facebook page
or follow me on Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Esty

Dear
Friend,
On
this
and
every
Memorial
Day,
we
honor
the
brave
men
and
women
who
paid
the
ultimate
price
defending
our
freedom.
We
owe
each
of
them
and
their
families
a
great
debt
that
can
never
be
truly repaid.
But
we
strive
to
be
worthy
of
their
sacrifice
by
honoring
and
thanking
those
who
have
defended
and
those
who
still
defend
our
freedom, by
comforting
and

for
their
families,
and
by
supporting
and caring

Rep.
Elizabeth
Esty
talking
with
veterans at
the
Simsbury
Memorial
Day
Parade
I
am deeply concerned
about
recent
reports
of
falsified
wait
lists
and
widespread
delays
for
care
at
VA
medical
facilities,
including
allegations
that
up

40
veterans
may
have
died
while

in
Phoenix,
Arizona.
This
is
very
disturbing
and
needs
to
be
effectively
addressed.
Our
veterans
have
sacrificed
so
much
serving
our
country,
and
they
deserve
the
best
care
promptly
delivered.
Any
VA
managers
who
are
contributing
to
a
climate
of
neglect
must
be
held
accountable.
That's
why I
voted
for
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
which
would
allow
the
VA
to
more
easily
punish
or
fire
senior
executive
employees
for
inadequate
job
performance.
And
that&#8217;s
also
why
when
Secretary
Shinseki
recently
announced
the
VA
will
be
conducting
&#8220;face-to-face&#8221;
reviews
of
all
VA
