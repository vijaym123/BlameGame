Friend
I believe access to the Internet should never be taxed. And yet, many states and localities are looking to do just this. Pull out your most recent phone bill -- look closely, and you'll notice a list of access taxes tacked onto your bill each month. If you look at the bill from your Internet service provider, those same taxes are not there.
In case you missed it,
a bipartisan bill that I have been championing to permanently ensure that citizens cannot be taxed for Internet access passed the House of Representatives last night with my suppor t. Take a look at
H.R.235 . Let's keep access to the Internet tax-free.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I will keep you posted on this bills progress as it moves to the Senate.
