Folks, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, so we won&rsquo;t waste any:
Tonight is our FINAL WEEK ad-buy deadline.
That means whatever we can raise by midnight will go towards getting out Ami&rsquo;s message in the last days of our campaign.
But listen, we just ran the numbers, and we still need 42 donations by midnight to hit our goal.
If we fall short now -- with just one week to go -- we won&rsquo;t have time to catch up.
So please, if you were waiting to chip in for Ami -- or make one last donation -- do it now, while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
