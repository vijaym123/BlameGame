Decline in GDP Growth Raises
Red Flag
About Health of U.S. Economy
Economic Report
for First Quarter of
2014 Was the Worst in Five
Years
High
hopes that the economy would see a major rebound this year were dashed
with the latest data from the Commerce Department.
The agency
reported that economic output contracted by a staggering 2.9 percent
during the first quarter of 2014
a much more alarming figure than
preliminary estimates.
In fact, it was the worst quarter since the
beginning of 2009, when the country was still in the midst of the last
recession.
Indeed, it is one of the 12 worst quarters the American
economy has experienced since
1947.
Obamacare's Harmful
Impact
Several
factors have been linked to the drop-off in gross domestic product (GDP),
which measures the value of the goods and services a country produces.
Some analysts have blamed harsh winter weather for reduced
consumer spending, private investment, and exports.
Others point to
the President's health-care law.
Given that health care makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy, it
should come as no surprise that the move to government management of
America's health-care system would negatively affect GDP.
Millions of Americans have been forced to deal with policy cancellations, as
well as unfamiliar and more expensive health insurance plans, since
the disastrous rollout of Obamacare at the beginning of the year.
According to an editorial in the
Wall Street Journal , even
optimists "shouldn't overlook ObamaCare's role in nearly sending the
economy back into recession."
Worst Recovery Since World War
II
Anemic economic growth
has become the new normal under the Obama Administration.
With
onerous regulations and stifling tax increases, the President has
prioritized a costly political agenda over policies to boost growth.
A look at past economic recoveries sheds light on just how dismal the
recent economic numbers have been.
GDP grew by an average 4.9 percent under President Reagan's
leadership
more than double the average growth since President Obama
took office.
Based on the persistently sluggish job gains
witnessed since the recession technically ended in June 2009, this has been
the worst recovery following any recession since World War II.
According to the
Joint Economic Committee, on which I serve, GDP must increase by 6.5
percent for the rest of President Obama's second term in order to catch
up to the average set by all previous economic expansions since 1960.
It is now highly unlikely that annual GDP growth could reach 2.0
percent, unless the economy skyrockets for the rest of
2014.
Pro-Growth Policies With Real
Results
In a sustained recovery, Americans would see the impact
of economic growth and job creation in their daily lives.
Household incomes would be up, there would be fewer people living in
poverty, and workers would be entering the labor force rather than leaving
it.
As the latest jobs
report shows, the labor force participation rate
reflecting the number
of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one
is at
its lowest level since 1978.
What kind of recovery is it when
the driving force behind the slowly falling unemployment rate is the
number of American adults leaving the job market in
frustration?
Boosting confidence
and ultimately
economic growth
will require policies different from those put forward
by the President and Senate Democrats.
We need a new tack that
encourages job creators to expand and hire.
We need an approach to
governing that reduces the burden of inefficient regulations on
middle-class families.
We need a free-market outlook that results in
quick approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and other private
infrastructure projects like it.
These policies and others like them
promise to revitalize the American economy, rather than miring it in
negative growth and diminished opportunity.
