A Good Day For Pennsylvania And For Those Who Believe In Justice
Senate Democrats Join Me To Block Controversial DOJ Nominee
Watch video
In a bipartisan effort this week, the Senate blocked confirmation of an unacceptable nominee to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. As head of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, Debo Adegbile helped fan racial tensions by joining the offensive public crusade to lionize Mumia Abu-Jamal, the unrepentant killer of Philadelphia police officer Danny Faulkner.
It was a good day for Pennsylvania, America, and those who believe in justice. I appreciate the bipartisan support of my colleagues - including Senators Casey, Coons, and Manchin, and Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams - in opposing the confirmation of Mr. Adegbile.
The Senate has affirmed that our criminal justice system must never be abused to propagate a dishonest, radical agenda.
I hope you'll take a moment to watch a
personal message
from me on this critical vote.
Commissioning The USS Somerset In Philly
I was honored to attend the commissioning of the USS Somerset last weekend in Philadelphia. The ship is named for the heroes of Flight 93, whose brave actions saved many lives on September 11, 2001. ( Photo by Delaware River Waterfront )
With this commissioning, we celebrate not an attack on America, but the day that America began to fight back. ( Photo by Bill Shull )
My Johnstown regional manager, John Frick, gave his time and talent to craft furniture for the
9/11 museum on board the USS Somerset . Using lumber from the Somerset County area, John and fellow-woodworker Keith Martin spent 200 hours on this remarkable, touching memorial to the heroes of Flight 93.
Fair winds and following seas to the ship and her crew!
With Congressman Bill Shuster, Marine Commandant General James Amos, and Somerset County Commissioner John Vatavuk.
Saluting Our Veterans: Honor Flight
Sen. Toomey with Lehigh Valley WWII veteran Bertram Winzer.
This week, I shared
some reflections on the work of Honor Flight , a terrific organization that honors America's World War II veterans. Their mission is simple:
Transport America's veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit those memorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices .
I hope you'll read my column about the organization's dedicated work for veterans from our Greatest Generation.
