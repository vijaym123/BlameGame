David --
Special interests must love this:
With their latest ruling in
McCutcheon v. FEC , the Supreme Court dealt another huge blow to our nation&rsquo;s campaign finance laws. Now, big money donors can pour EVEN MORE of their cash into elections here in Illinois, and across the country.
That&rsquo;s outrageous. We should be working to reduce shadowy special interests&rsquo; role in our elections, not making it easier for them to buy our democracy.
Right-wing billionaires and their shady outside groups spent over $4 million trying to win Cheri&rsquo;s seat in 2012. And under the Supreme Court&rsquo;s new rules, you can bet the tidal wave of cash will be even higher. David, we can&rsquo;t let special interests buy our democracy, here in Illinois or in any race around the country.
That&rsquo;s why Cheri is demanding Congress reverse the effects of these disastrous Supreme Court rulings by passing meaningful campaign finance reform. Will you stand with Cheri and citizens across the country to urge Congress take immediate steps to fix our campaign finance system?
The protections we had in place were designed to lessen the influence of special interest cash in our politics -- but now, it&rsquo;s easier than ever for big money donors to drown out the voice of the people of Illinois.
