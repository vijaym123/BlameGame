Dear Friend, Six straight national polls say that Republicans have a good chance of taking over the Senate this year.
The latest poll, a generic ballot from Pew Research, shows Republicans beating Democrats 47-44.
Republicans only need to pick up six seats to win the majority, and we can&rsquo;t let one of those six seats be from Massachusetts. With the Senate hanging in the balance, we need to raise $145,000 before the FEC deadline on the 30th. Can you help us out by kicking in $5?

We know what happens when Democrats sit out a midterm election -- Republicans win, the Tea Party rises, and nothing gets done. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re building a field organization that will turn out our voters on Election Day.
Building our infrastructure will give us an advantage on Election Day, but if we wait until then, it will be too late. We need to organize now, and to do that, we need to hit our fundraising goals. We have ten days left to hit our $145,000 goal before the FEC deadline. Make a $5 contribution and help us hit our target.
Thank you,
Ed
