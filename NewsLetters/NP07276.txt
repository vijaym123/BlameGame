&ldquo;House Votes to Sue President for the First Time in History&rdquo; --
Talking Points Memo , 7/30/2014
Dear Friend,
The House of Representatives has decided to go forward with John Boehner&rsquo;s frivolous lawsuit to sue the President, but the real story is the five Republicans who didn&rsquo;t vote in favor of the lawsuit
because they don&rsquo;t think it goes far enough. This is how the Tea Party House operates -- and if they pick up six seats this November, we&rsquo;ll have a Tea Party Senate, too.
The priorities of the Tea Party House are clear. Just look at their votes -- they want to turn Medicare into a voucher program, deny the reality of climate change, and cut funding for the National Institutes of Health. Instead of making any progress on behalf of the American people, they focus on a frivolous lawsuit against the President. A full-blown Tea Party Congress is what&rsquo;s at stake this November, and we can&rsquo;t let Massachusetts be one of the six victories they need to take over the Senate. Can you pitch in $5 to help me keep fighting?

We know that we can unleash a clean energy revolution and create good-paying jobs. We know that we can take action to reduce the senseless gun violence that costs too many American lives. We know that we can lift millions of people out of poverty by raising the minimum wage. But that&rsquo;s not what the Tea Party is focused on.
They&rsquo;re concerned with suing the President, blocking action on climate change, and stopping any common sense gun safety legislation. I&rsquo;m fighting against the Tea Party&rsquo;s agenda because I believe every American should have the opportunity to maximize his or her God-given abilities. I need your help to keep fighting, and to prevent this seat from falling into Tea Party hands -- please give $5, $10, or whatever you can to keep our campaign running strong.
Thank you for your help.
