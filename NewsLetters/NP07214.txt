ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
August 04, 2014
D e ar Friends,
I was absolutely appalled by
allegations that nearly 40 veterans died in Phoenix while waiting for care at a
VA medical center, and that staffers tried to cover up those treatment
delays.
We have since learned that the problem
wasnt limited to one facility, and that thousands of our heroes had been
denied timely care.
"The Veterans Access, Choice
&amp; Accountability Act of 2014"
directly addresses the need
to cut down on delays, and passed the House with overwhelmingly
bipartisan support. This bill is expected to be approved by the full Senate
and signed into law by President Obama.
Here are some of
the bills key provisions:
Enables veterans who have waited at least 30 days for an
appointment or those who live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility
obtain care elsewhere.
Allocates additional funding for the VA to hire more
specialists, primary care physicians, and other medical personnel to meet
the growing needs of our
veterans.
Creates incentives to attract more
doctors and nurses to the VA.
Provides additional authority for the VA to counsel
and care for veterans who are victims of sexual
assault.
Increases
accountability and oversight by authorizing VA officials to fire or demote senior
employees for poor performance or
misconduct.
Requires an independent
assessment of VA medical facilities, and establishes a Congressional
Commission on Care to evaluate access to treatment throughout the VA health
care system.
Additionally, the bill improves education benefits for veterans and
dependents by requiring public colleges receiving G.I. Bill payments
to provide in-state tuition to veterans and eligible dependents, and by
providing full benefits to spouses of service members who died in the
line of duty after September 11, 2001.
We must do
everything that we can to honor the men and women who served our nation. They
should not be denied the very liberties they fought to
protect.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
