Dear
David,
As you may have
read, I recently signed an open letter explaining the U.S. Constitution
to the Iranian government.
The letter - which was
led by Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas and co-signed by 45 of our
colleagues - has garnered a lot of attention from the White House and my
Democrat colleagues in the Senate.
Whether President
Obama likes it or not, Congress has a role to play in preventing a
nuclear Iran.
Our message wasn't communicated in
secret, and no one seems to debate the accuracy of our message. The
Constitution matters, and any deal that President Obama negotiates
unilaterally with the Iranian government is not a long-term deal. (Even
Secretary of State John Kerry
agrees .)
I
can't think of anything more destabilizing in the Middle East than a
nuclear Iran. Unfortunately, it's clear that President Obama would like to
continue trying to ignore or circumvent Congress in this
debate.
A bad deal is worse
than no deal with Iran. Right now, the president is on the verge of a
very bad deal.
The Senate has an important
role to play in this discussion. I'm standing up against a
nuclear-capable Iran, and I'll continue to stand up for the U.S.
Constitution.
As always, I invite you to join the conversation
online by sharing your thoughts on
Facebook ,
