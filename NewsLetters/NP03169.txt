Forbes Receives Association of the United States Navys
Award for Legislative Advocacy
Washington, D.C. -
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, was honored with the Association of the United States Navy (AUSN) Legislative Advocacy Award, for his forceful advocacy and tireless work on behalf of a strong Navy.
For the past six years, the U.S. military has faced devastating cuts, leaving us with a Navy among the smallest since World War I, said Congressman Forbes. This shrinking fleet and decreased capabilities comes at a time when threats around the world are increasing every day. Its time to begin truly rebuilding the greatest military the world has ever known. I am honored to receive this award today, and I will continue to be unwavering in my commitment to this vision, and my dedication to ensuring our sailors are equipped to meet tomorrows challenges.
Bestowed annually, this award is presented to Members of Congress who have been leading advocates for the men and women who wear this nations uniform, as well as for rebuilding the strength of the United States Navy.
Founded in 1854, the Association of the United States Navy (AUSN) serves as a voice for Americas sailors and a premier advocate for a strong Navy. With over 22,000 members, AUSN works to educate members of Congress and their staffs on issues of importance to the Navy, as well as to care and support service members, veterans, and their families.
