Dear Friend,
Well, it has happened again. President Obama is threatening to use his self&#45;imposed executive authority to take sweeping action the majority of Americans oppose. This time he is talking about granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.
Congress is back in Washington for the end of this session and hard at work, but instead of working with the House and Senate to find solutions on immigration, President Obama has been telling the media he is considering acting solo. In an exit poll from the November 4th election, The Polling Company, Inc. found that 74 percent of voters want President Obama to work with Congress to fix immigration rather than take action on his own. He must not have gotten the memo.
In addition to the idea being deeply unpopular, President Obama does not have the legal authority to take this action. The President said himself that amnesty by executive order would not be appropriate. On March 28, 2011, President Obama said he would not use an executive order for amnesty explaining that the &#147;temporary protective status historically has been used for special circumstances.&#148; Now that Republicans will have majorities in both the House and Senate come January, it seems the President is singing a different tune.
How many people would this executive amnesty affect&#63; In short, we do not know. Estimates of the illegal aliens in United States vary wildly from 10 to 20 million, with more coming across the border each day. After the influx of unaccompanied children across the southern border this summer, this offer of amnesty will serve as even more incentive for others to bypass the official immigration process and trek to America.
If President Obama acts on his own, it will poison the well and make it nearly impossible for Congress to pass meaningful immigration reform. He should not use executive amnesty as an opportunity to stay relevant after November&#146;s drubbing.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
This week on Veterans Day I had the pleasure of honoring some our very own heroes at the Kennett Middle School Veterans Day assembly. To all the veterans who have served with dignity and courage&#150; may you be celebrated and honored every day for your dedication to our country and selfless actions.
In celebration of Veterans Day I shared a story about a local hero named Ralph &#147;Kid&#148; Hofer from Dent County. He made us proud during WWII as a hot&#45;shot fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Force. His famous fighter planes were nicknamed &#147;The Missouri Kid &#150; Show Me&#148; and &#147;Salem Representative.&#148; He logged fifteen aerial kills, destroyed fifteen enemy aircraft on the ground, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross along with six oak leaf clusters for his service.
In 1944, Kidd Hofer made the ultimate sacrifice when he was shot down over Hungary in a massive air battle. He left behind a legacy of the grit and resolve southeast and southern Missourians hold, and he inspired generations.
This week I sent a letter with my colleagues to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging the immediate opening of the Mississippi River. On the House Floor I explained how farmers rely on the Mississippi River to get products to the market.

On Friday, I had the pleasure of sitting down with a high school group from St. Pius in Festus, Missouri. This smart group of students stopped by my office during their visit in Washington. I am proud to see students wanting to learn more about our government, civic responsibility, and public service.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
