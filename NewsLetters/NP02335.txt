Blaine's Bulletin
This is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing. Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand. But I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
That quote was just one of several that had me and my colleagues on our feet in a thunderous applause when Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed a Joint Session of Congress recently.
There was a lot of controversy surrounding the speech but it was not meant to be political nor partisan. The intent was simply to unite Congress and the administration around the issue of Israeli security
something that was never an issue before the last few weeks.
The timing of Prime Minister Netanyahus speech is particularly relevant given the deadline for a political agreement in the Iran nuclear negotiations which is only a few weeks away. The Prime Minister spoke openly and honestly about the importance of toughening sanctions on Iran, and the possibility for grave consequences if America stands idly by and allows the radical regime in Tehran to move forward with its nuclear ambitions.
I support a diplomatic approach in negotiations with Iran; however, I believe we must be more vigilant in ensuring that the Iranian government takes legitimate steps toward nuclear disarmament. In addition, I do not believe that sanctions against Iran should be lifted until the Iranian government provides an overwhelming amount of evidence confirming nuclear disarmament.
Recently, I signed a letter sent to President Obama regarding the unresolved issues in the Iranian negotiations. In short, this letter calls for any comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran to ensure that countrys nuclear infrastructure will be such that Iran has no pathway to a nuclear bomb before any permanent sanctions relief is given. In addition, it outlines the many ways in which Tehran has refused to divulge the information of their nuclear program thus far.
Sitting in the House of Representatives, listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu address Congress, I couldnt help but contrast it to our own foreign policy in the United States, which, I believe, would benefit from the strength, clarity, resolve, and sense of purpose that Prime Minister Netanyahu projected in his speech
a leader that will lead. I will continue to stay engaged with the Iran nuclear negotiations and I will always, proudly, stand with Israel.
