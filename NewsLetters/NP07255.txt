Week of August 4 - 9,

A
Vote to Waste the Houses Time and Taxpayers
Dollars
Last week in the House of
Representatives was a little strange.
On a near party-line vote of
225 to 201, the Republican Majority voted to authorize House Speaker
Boehner to initiate an unlimited number of lawsuits against President
Obama and other members of his Administration.
The reason may
surprise you:
They want to sue the President for not implementing
the Affordable Care Act
a law they have tried to undermine or repeal
over 50 times
fast enough .
House Republicans claim
that the President is not faithfully executing the
law.
Most legal scholars believe the
lawsuits will fail to go anywhere in the courts, although they will no doubt
waste a lot of taxpayers dollars in the
attempt.
Meanwhile, House Democrats have offered a
plan that focuses on the priorities of the American people.
They
call this the Middle Class Jumpstart action plan.
Instead of
wasting time and money on political stunts, the Jumpstart action plan
will create good-paying jobs, strengthen the economy, and create
opportunities for everyone.
Specifically, under the Jumpstart
plan:
We want to
create jobs here at home by raising the minimum wage and investing in
Americas infrastructure by building roads, bridges, broadband technology,
and clean energy.
These initiatives will be paid for by closing
corporate tax loopholes.
We want to invest in education, increasing access to effective
early childhood learning, expand Pell Grants to make higher education
more affordable, and address the crushing burden of student loan
debt.
We want to pass
the Paycheck Fairness Act to make sure women and men get equal pay for
equal work, and increase affordable access to affordable child
care.
We also want to strengthen the Violence Against Women
Act.
We hope that
the Republican Majority returns to Washington in September ready to
get to work on these priorities for the American
people.
