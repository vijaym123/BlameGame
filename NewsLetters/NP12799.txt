Dear Friend,
On Tuesday night, President Obama delivered his 5th State of the Union
address to the American people, and there was a lot in it to make
Memphians feel good. Keep reading to learn more about what he said.

Expanding Opportunity for All
While the recovery from the Great Recession has not included all that
it should have, the President in his State of the Union address
outlined his vision for building ladders of opportunity so that every
American who works hard and plays by the rules has a fair shot to
succeed. Whether through job training programs, improving college
affordability, expanding access to high-quality affordable health
coverage, providing housing and retirement security, or extending a
lifeline to the unemployed, that's what we need in Memphis.
Helping Memphians Earn a Living Wage
I agree with the President that the minimum wage must be raised so
families can earn a living wage and make ends meet. As the President
said on Tuesday, he is able to raise the minimum wage for federal
contractors with the stroke of a pen, but Congress must act to increase
it for everyone across the nation. I will continue working with my
colleagues in the House of Representatives until the minimum wage is
raised for all hardworking Americans.
Creating Jobs and Improving Our Infrastructure
As President Obama explained on Tuesday, we must all work together to
provide economic opportunity and create jobs by passing a
transportation bill that strengthens our nation's infrastructure.
Improved infrastructure means better access to Memphis, more jobs for
our city, and a competitive edge for the Mid-South. I look forward to
fighting for a strong transportation bill that grows our economy,
bolsters the middle class, and gives every American a fair chance to
get ahead.
Finding Cures for Illnesses
The President on Tuesday also joined me in calling on Congress to
reverse sequestration's drastic cuts to basic research projects, like
those at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As the nation's true
"Department of Defense" against threats to health, the NIH deserves to
be protected from all of sequestration's cuts and its funding should be
significantly increased. I will continue doing all that I can to
adequately fund the NIH so that it can find cures for diseases like
cancer, stroke, heart disease, diabetes and AIDS.
Protecting the Right to Vote
The right to vote is one of the most sacred constitutional rights we
have, and discrimination based on race has no place in our electoral
process. I'm glad that the President highlighted in his State of the
Union address the need to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and also
mentioned that the recommendations made by a bipartisan commission
could do just that. I hope that Congress works with President Obama to
ensure that these reforms are made and the right to vote is adequately
protected.
Joining the President in Tennessee
I was pleased to join President Obama yesterday in Nashville when he
spoke at McGavock High School, where I ran into legendary journalist
John Seigenthaler as well as my friend Ashley Judd just before the
President's speech. In his speech, he highlighted the importance of
giving our young people the opportunity to attend college by making it
more affordable. I'm glad that today, after twenty years of leading the
fight for it in the Tennessee State Senate, we have the Tennessee
Education Lottery Scholarship program which has provided more than $2.9
billion to our students seeking to better themselves through higher
education. While the President was in Tennessee, I also made sure that
he knew just how important it is that he designates Memphis as a
"Promise Zone" so that we can do more to eliminate concentrated poverty
in our city.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I was at the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that just opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near you to help ensure you get every penny
you are owed.
Taking Advantage of the Affordable Care Act
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A
recent New York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer." A primary
reason for the high mortality rate is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. If you are at
risk, please take a moment in the coming weeks to take advantage of
provisions of the Affordable Care Act and get screened for breast
cancer-it can help save your life. And don't forget that the open
season deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at
HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Helping Bring Justice to Non-Violent Offenders
Yesterday, two good things happened in the fight to bring justice to
non-violent drug offenders who are locked up under outdated and unfair
sentences that would not apply if they were sentenced today. First, the
U.S. Department of Justice announced that it is trying to locate
non-violent prisoners whose sentences are unnecessarily lengthy and is
seeking recommendations for candidates for executive clemency
from the President. Second, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
voted to advance the Smarter Sentencing Act. If enacted, the
legislation would reduce the racially-biased sentencing disparity for
non-violent drug offenses and help those unjustly still incarcerated
under the old sentences achieve justice and freedom. I hope the full
Senate passes this legislation and look forward to fighting to help it
pass in the House.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not
had access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to
afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in
Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901)
528-8341. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage
option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need
health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

Expanding
Opportunity
for
All
While
the
recovery
from
the
Great
Recession
has
not
included
all
that
it
should
have,
the
President
in
his
State
of
the
Union
address
outlined
his
vision
for
building
ladders
of
opportunity
so
that
every
American
who
works
hard
and
plays
by
the
rules
has
a
fair
shot
to
succeed.
Whether
through
job
training
programs,
improving
college
affordability,
expanding
access
to
high-quality
affordable
health
coverage,
providing
housing
and
retirement
security,
or
extending
a
lifeline
to
the
unemployed,
that&#8217;s
what
we
need
in
Memphis.
Helping
Memphians
Earn
a
Living
Wage
I
agree
with
the
President
that
the
minimum
wage
must
be
raised
so
families
can
earn
a
living
wage
and
make
ends
meet.
As the
President said
on
Tuesday,
he
is
able
to
raise the
minimum
wage for
federal
contractors
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen,
but
Congress
must
act
to
increase
it
for
everyone
across
the
nation.
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
of
Representatives
until
the
minimum
wage
is
raised
for
all
hardworking
Americans.
Creating
Jobs
and
Improving
Our
Infrastructure
As
President
Obama
explained
on
Tuesday,
we
must
all
work
together
to
provide
economic
opportunity
and
create
jobs
by
passing
a
transportation
bill
that
strengthens
our
nation&#8217;s
infrastructure.
Improved
infrastructure
means
better
access
to
Memphis,
more
jobs
for
our
city,
and
a
competitive
edge
for
the
Mid-South.
I
look
forward
to
fighting
for
a
strong
transportation
bill
that
grows
our
economy,
bolsters
the
middle
class,
and
gives
every
American
a
fair
chance
to
get
ahead.
Finding
Cures
for
Illnesses
The
President
on
Tuesday
also
joined
me
in
calling
on
Congress
to
reverse
sequestration&#8217;s
drastic
cuts
to
basic
research
projects,
like
those
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH).
As
the
nation&#8217;s
true
&#8220;Department
of
Defense&#8221;
against
threats
to
health,
the
NIH
deserves
to
be
protected
from
all
of
sequestration&#8217;s
cuts
and
its
funding
should
be
significantly
increased.
I
will
continue
doing
all
that
I
can
to
adequately
fund
the
NIH
so
that
it
can
find
cures
for
diseases
like
cancer,
stroke,
heart
disease,
diabetes
and
AIDS.
Protecting
the
Right
to
Vote
The
right
to
vote
is
one
of
the
most
sacred
constitutional
rights
we
have,
and
discrimination
based
on
race
has
no
place
in
our
electoral
process.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
the
President
highlighted
in
his
State
of
the
Union
address the
need
to
strengthen
the
Voting
Rights
Act
and
also
mentioned
that
the
recommendations
made
by
a
bipartisan
commission
could
do
just
that.
I
hope
that
Congress
works
with
President
Obama
to
ensure
that
these
reforms
are
made
and
the
right
to
vote
is
adequately
protected.
Joining
the
President
in
Tennessee
I
was
pleased
to
join
President
Obama
yesterday
in
Nashville
when
he
spoke
at
McGavock
High
School,
where
I
ran
into
legendary
journalist
John
Seigenthaler
as
well
as
my
friend
Ashley
Judd
just
before
the
President&#8217;s
speech.
In
his
speech,
he
highlighted
the
importance
of
giving
our
young
people
the
opportunity
to
attend
college
by
making
it
more
affordable.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
today,
after
twenty
years
of
leading
the
fight
for
it
in
the
Tennessee
State
Senate,
we
have
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery
Scholarship
program
which
has
provided
more
than
$2.9
billion
to
our
students
seeking
to
better
themselves
through
higher
education.
While
the
President
was
in
Tennessee,
I
also
made
sure
that
he
knew
just
how
important
it
is
that
he
designates
Memphis
as
a
&#8220;Promise
Zone&#8221;
so
that
we
can
do
more
to
eliminate
concentrated
poverty
in
our
city.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
at
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
just
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
Click
here
to
find
a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Taking
Advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
recent
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
If
you
are
at
risk,
please
take
a
moment
in
the
coming
weeks
to
take
advantage
of
provisions
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
get
screened
for
breast
cancer&#8212;it
can
help
save
your
life.
And
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
Helping
Bring
Justice
to
Non-Violent
Offenders
Yesterday,
two
good
things
happened
in
the
fight
to
bring
justice
to
non-violent
drug
offenders
who
are
locked
up
under
outdated
and
unfair
sentences
that
would
not
apply
if
they
were
sentenced
today.
First,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
announced
that
it
is
trying
to
locate
non-violent
prisoners
whose
sentences
are
unnecessarily
lengthy
and
is
seeking
recommendations
for
candidates
for
executive
clemency
from
the
President.
Second,
the
U.S.
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
voted
to
advance
the
Smarter
Sentencing
Act.
If
enacted, the
legislation would
reduce
the
racially-biased
sentencing
disparity
for
non-violent
drug
offenses
and
help
those
unjustly
still
incarcerated
under
the
old
sentences
achieve
justice
and
freedom.
I
hope
the
full
Senate
passes
this
legislation
and
look
forward
to
fighting
to
help
it
pass
in
the
House.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at

(800)
318-2596,
visit
www.HealthCare.gov,
or

You
can
also
call
my

or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.
Visit

today
to

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
Many
of
the
Marketplace
website
issues
that
have
been
in
the
news
have
been
resolved. However,
the
Marketplace
website
is
only
one
tool
that
you
can
use
to
sign
up
for
coverage.
If
you
are
having
trouble

please
do
not

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
