The 6th
District
Give Employers the Same Break that Employers
Get
Dear
Friends:
On Monday, the Obama Administration
announced that it is delaying the employer mandate under Obamacare
which requires businesses to offer a federally-approved healthcare plan
to all of their full-time employees, or face stiff fines.
This
most recent delay affects businesses with less than 100 full-time
employees, and is in effect until January of 2016.
This most recent
delay also applies to larger employers with over 100 employees if they
can document that coverage was offered to at least 70% of their
workforce.
This is now the second time the Obama
Administration has delayed the employer mandate, and the rationale is clear. With
so many Americans receiving notices in the mail last Fall that their
healthcare policies were about to be cancelled, the President wanted
to avoid a similar political fiasco before the mid-term
elections.
The fear is that these businesses will opt to pay the penalties in
lieu of paying for the more expensive federally-approved plans required
under Obamacare.
By delaying the
employer mandate and not the individual mandate, the President has once
again decided to give employers a break but not the individuals who are
now required to buy these policies or face IRS penalties.
If it is
fair to delay the mandate on employers then it is only fair to delay
the mandate on the individuals who often work for employers that don't
offer one of these federally-approved plans.
So basically, why should these employees be subject to pay IRS
penalties if they don't come up with the required policies that their
employers have just been told they can delay
providing?
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S.
Representative

A solid plan to cure what ails VA hospital projects
By: The Denver
Post Editorial Board
DenverPost.com
Published February 8,
2014
Unraveling the stumbles that led to
extreme cost overruns at four Veterans Affairs hospital projects
including one in Aurora
has been a frustrating lesson in Bureaucracy
101.
It remains difficult
to understand how these projects got so out of control that they went
hundreds of millions over initial cost
estimates.
We were glad to see last week that U.S.
Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo.,
renewed
a legislative push
to restructure management of these complex
projects to lessen the potential for ballooning price
tags.
His proposal, which has bipartisan
support, is a good-faith effort to tame the contradictory and
ineffective management practices that were identified by the Government
Accountability Office as being responsible for the
mess.
The legislation borrows liberally from the
GAO's recommendations and adds a twist with its requirement that
management of these complex projects be overseen by U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers special project managers.
The GAO reported last spring that four VA medical center
projects had huge cost overruns and were delayed an average of 35
months.
The report found the
VA had not clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of its
construction managers. The agency's change-order approval process was
lengthy and cumbersome.
And the agency was failing to fully take advantage of planners who
specialize in designing medical facilities to match the equipment they'll
house, an omission that can lead to design and construction changes and
increased costs.
Coffman, chair of a House Veterans Affairs oversight subcommittee, and a
Democratic colleague, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, are backing
reform legislation. It would assign medical equipment planners to major VA
construction projects and would streamline the change-order
process.
The Aurora project,
enmeshed in litigation, has gone from an initial price tag of roughly
$600 million to potentially more than $1
billion.
Coffman told us the only practical way to
ask Congress for more money to complete the project would be to offer
significant management changes as well.
The Corps, said Coffman, has a track record of success
in managing similarly complicated projects for other agencies and
would be willing to take on the responsibility.
It sounds to us like a pragmatic approach to a
messy problem with difficult solutions.

Coffman and Gutierrez respond to letter from
the U.S. Armed Services regarding possible Exclusionary Enlistment
Policy
Coffman.House.gov
Released
February 12,
2014
(Washington, D.C.)
Today, U.S Representatives
Mike Coffman
(R-CO) and Luis Gutirrez (D-IL), sent a
letter
to the Secretary of the Army,
the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force
responding to a status update on the policy review of possible U.S. Armed
Services policies that prohibits U.S. citizens from enlisting in the
military if that enlistee has an undocumented
dependent.
Service in the U.S. military is the
highest duty one can perform for the country, so I am very concerned about
the possible exclusionary enlistment policies currently being
implemented by our armed service branches, said Coffman, a Marine Corps
combat veteran.
"We
simply want to make clear that Members of Congress in both parties think
this enlistment issue is important and we are getting impatient for a
thorough response, said Luis V. Gutierrez (D-IL), who is Chairman of
the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and
sits on the Judiciary Committee.
Qualified citizens who want to
serve in their country should be allowed to do so.
Period.
