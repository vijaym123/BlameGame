Dear Friend,
ObamaCare Must Be Repealed and Replaced
On Friday, I hosted the House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform's field hearing in Apache Junction, where we listened to
constituents tell us their ObamaCare nightmares. As a member of this
Committee, I was honored that they chose to have this hearing in
District 4. Rep. Darrell Issa (CA-49), Chairman of the Oversight
Committee, and Reps. Trent Franks (AZ-08) and David Schweikert (AZ-06)
also participated in the hearing.
(From left to right: Reps. Franks, Issa, Gosar and Schweikert, December
6, 2013)
This hearing offered me an opportunity to hear testimony directly from
my constituents about how ObamaCare is affecting them. I knew before
the hearing that ObamaCare was a terrible law, and the witnesses who
testified proved that. For example, Juli Dalton from Prescott told us
about how she will face a monthly premium increase of $800. As a
result, her family might have to sell their home and cars and may not
be able to afford the travel to visit her elderly father. Dr.
Montgomery, a veterinarian, told us that ObamaCare is restricting his
access to healthcare and increasing his costs, forcing him to change
retirement plans he has worked his entire career for.
This law is a trainwreck full of broken promises that is increasing
health care costs and interfering with the doctor-patient relationship.
ObamaCare must be repealed and most importantly...REPLACED.
(Witnesses testify about how ObamaCare has hurt them, December 6, 2013)
I wish that every one of my constituents could have testified at this
hearing, but the distance and the time commitments required in our
everyday lives makes that impossible.
I urge any Arizonan to submit
their ObamaCare nightmare.
It is important your story is heard as we
continue our push to repeal and replace the Unaffordable Care Act.

Set Our Small Businesses Free
On Wednesday, I voted in favor of the Small Business Capital Access and
Job Preservation Act, H.R.1105. Arizonans can never afford to have the
federal government strangle businesses with red tape, but that is
especially true now, when so many families are out of work. This bill
will eliminate excessive regulations, making it easier for small
businesses to gain access to capital so they can grow and create new
jobs. We must set our small businesses free so they can do what they do
best: put Americans back to work. Click HERE
to read my official statement on this bill.
Local Economies Are Not Political Pawns
On Thursday, I introduced the Public Access to Public Land Guarantee
Act of 2013 (H.R.3661), bipartisan legislation that would require the
federal government to enter into an agreement with any state or
municipality that offers non-federal funds to reopen and temporarily
operate public lands (including national parks, national monuments and
national recreation areas) during a government shutdown. If Congress
retroactively appropriates funds, the Act would also require the
federal government to refund the state or municipality. Click HERE
to read more about the bill.
The communities in Arizona and across the country that rely on our
national parks, forests and other federal lands as drivers of their
local economies are not political pawns. My bill requires the federal
government to work with willing municipalities and state governments to
keep national parks open during shutdowns and to repay states and local
governments if Congress retroactively allocates the funds.
One Step Closer to Getting Paid
My new bill applies to any future federal government shutdowns, but the
federal government still owes Arizona money for keeping Grand Canyon
National Park open during the October 2013 shutdown. The federal
government moved one step closer to paying that debt this week. On
Wednesday, the Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a member,
passed the Protecting States, Opening National Parks Act (H.R.3286),
which would reimburse states that used their own funds to operate
National Parks during the federal government shutdown. The bill is now
waiting to be considered by the full House of Representatives. To read

ObamaCare Malady of the Week
47 percent: that's how much individual health insurance premiums will
rise because of ObamaCare, according to eHealthinsurance.com. This rise
in premiums is due to ObamaCare's requirement that all health insurance
policies pay for certain categories of care, such as birth control.

Did you Know?
When Theodore Roosevelt Dam, which creates Roosevelt Lake, was finished
in 1911, it was the largest masonry dam in the world at a height of 280
feet. It took just 4 years for the lake to fill, with the first
spill-over occurring in 1915. A renovation and expansion project that
fully encased the original dam in concrete and raised the height to 357
feet was completed in 1996, making the dam look much different today.

Dear
Friend,
ObamaCare
Must
Be
Repealed
and
Replaced
On
Friday,
I hosted the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform's
field
hearing in
Apache
Junction,
where
we
listened
to
constituents
tell
us their
ObamaCare
nightmares.
As
a
member
of
this
Committee,
I
was
honored
that
they
chose
to
have
this
hearing
in
District
4.
Rep.
Darrell
Issa
(CA-49),
Chairman
of
the
Oversight
Committee,
and Reps.
Trent
Franks
(AZ-08) and
David
Schweikert
(AZ-06) also
participated
in
the
hearing.
(From

This
hearing
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
hear testimony
directly
from
my
constituents
about
how
ObamaCare
is
affecting
them.
I
knew
before
the
hearing
that
ObamaCare
was
a
terrible
law,
and
the
witnesses
who
testified proved
that.
For
example,
Juli
Dalton
from
Prescott told
us
about
how
she
will face
a
monthly
premium
increase
of
$800. As
a
result, her
family might
have
to
sell
their
home
and
cars
and
may
not
be
able
to
afford
the
travel
to
visit
her
elderly
father.
Dr.
Montgomery,
a
veterinarian,
told
us
that
ObamaCare
is
restricting
his
access to
healthcare
and
increasing
his
costs, forcing
him
to change retirement
plans
he
has
worked
his
entire
career
for.
This
law is
a
trainwreck
full
of
broken
promises
that
is
increasing
health
care
costs
and
interfering
with
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
ObamaCare
must
be
repealed
and
most
importantly...REPLACED.
(Witnesses

about
how
ObamaCare
has
hurt
them,

2013)
I
wish that
every
one
of
my
constituents
could
have
testified
at
this
hearing,
but
the
distance
and
the
time
commitments
required
in
our
everyday
lives
makes
that
impossible.
I
urge
any
Arizonan
to
submit
their
ObamaCare
nightmare.
It
is
important
your
story
is
heard
as
we
continue
our
push
to
repeal
and
replace
the
Unaffordable
Care
Act.

On
Wednesday,
I
voted
in
favor
of
the
Small
Business
Capital
Access

Job

Act,
H.R.1105.
Arizonans
can
never

with
red

but
that
is
especially
true
now,
when

This

will
eliminate
excessive

making
it
easier
for
small
businesses
to
gain
access
to
capital
so
they
can
grow
and
create
new
jobs.
We
must
set
our

so
they
can

what
they
do
best:
put
Americans
back
to

Local

Not
Political
Pawns
On
Thursday,
I
introduced
the
Public
Access
to
Public
Land
Guarantee
Act
of
2013
(H.R.3661),
bipartisan
legislation
that
would
require
the
federal

to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
any
state
or
municipality
that
offers
non-federal

to
reopen
and
temporarily
operate
public
lands
(including
national
parks,
national
monuments
and
national
recreation
areas)
during
a
government
shutdown.
If
Congress
retroactively
appropriates
funds,
the
Act
would
also
require
the
federal
government
to
refund
the
state
or

the
bill.
The
communities
in
Arizona
and

that
rely
on
our
national

My

to
keep
national

the
funds.
One
Step
Closer
to
Getting

My
new
bill
applies
to
any
future
federal
government
shutdowns,
but
the
federal
government
still
owes
Arizona
money
for
keeping
Grand
Canyon
National
Park
open
during
the
October
2013
shutdown.
The
federal
government
moved
one
step
closer
to
paying
that
debt
this
week.
On
Wednesday,
the
Natural
Resources
Committee,
of
which
I
am
a
member,
passed
the
Protecting
States,
Opening
National
Parks
Act
(H.R.3286),
which
would
reimburse
states
that
used
their
own
funds
to
operate
National
Parks
during
the
federal
government
shutdown.
The
bill
is
now
waiting
to
be
considered
by
the
full
House
of
Representatives.

47

will

This
