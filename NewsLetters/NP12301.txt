Rep. Cuellar Announces Internships with National Migrant &amp; Seasonal Head Start Association
Dear Friends,
I want to make sure you aware of
this opportunity for current college students to intern in our nation's capitol.
This is a unique program geared specifically for students who participated in the Migrant &amp; Seasonal Head Start Program to intern at a non-profit organization, federal agency, or on Capitol Hill.
Last year, I had the opportunity to meet an outstanding student who participated in the program in Washington.
Congressman Cuellar meets with Erika Rios, a student at Michigan State University, resident of Mission, Texas, and participant in the summer 2013 National Migrant &amp; Seasonal Head Start Association.
They discussed her plans for the future and her internship experience.
The National Migrant &amp; Seasonal Head Start Association (NMSHSA) seeks applicants for its upcoming internship program open to current college students who participated in a Migrant &amp; Seasonal Head Start Program. The seven-week internship program includes:
Stipend
Housing
Work placement
Domestic round-trip transportation to D.C.
$400 arrival allowance
To receive a copy of the internship application, email

or monitor the NMSHSA website at

For more information about NMSHSA, contact Executive Director Cleo Rodriguez, Jr. at

Deadline to apply is Friday, March 21. Selected interns will arrive June 12.
Internship runs from June 16 to July 31. Students depart Washington, D.C. on Aug. 2.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
