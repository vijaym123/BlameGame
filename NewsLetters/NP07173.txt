Iraq, Caring For Our Veterans, Upcoming Events
Dear Friend,
On Friday, Congressman Rigell released the following statement regarding the Presidents authorization of military force in Iraq:
President Obama recently ordered U.S. forces to conduct targeted airstrikes in Iraq to defend Americans serving at our consulate in Erbil and to provide humanitarian assistance as well as a means of escape for the religious minorities stranded atop Mount Sinjar. I believe these actions are consistent with the Presidents authority as defined by the Constitution and the War Powers Act.
It could be argued that this use of U.S. military force to provide a means of escape for those trapped atop the mountain has no direct connection to our national security, and thus requires prior authorization from Congress. However, the need to move quickly to prevent further loss of life of men, women and children is not in dispute, and the action authorized by the President
at this point at least
is purely defensive in nature. Importantly, providing a means of escape reflects our American character and core values, which includes a willingness to do what we can to defend the defenseless and to safeguard the most basic human right, which is life itself.
Though I agree with and support these recent decisions by President Obama, my strong objection to his past willingness to disregard the War Powers Act, and concern that he may disregard it again, specifically in Iraq, remains. Accordingly, I urge the President to present to the American people his vision and plan to elevate peace and stability in Iraq. Should that ever include the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities, the President must first seek and receive authorization from Congress. It is not the kings army.
My thoughts and prayers remain with U.S. forces currently in the region serving at American facilities.

An Update on Veterans Care
Recently there have been changes within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the House passed legislation to ensure our nations veterans receive the timely and thorough care they deserve:
The Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 3230)
was signed into law last week.
It requires the VA to offer non-VA care at the Departments expense to any enrolled veteran who cannot get an appointment within VA wait time goals or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility.
Additionally, H.R. 3230 provides $5 billion to increase access to care through the hiring of physicians and other medical staff and to improve the VAs physical infrastructure.
The Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2014 (H.R. 2072) amends federal law to increase the Department of Veterans Affairs accountability to the VA Inspector General (IG). Specifically, if the IG determines that the VA has not appropriately responded to an IG report, the IG must notify Congress and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of the failure to respond. Furthermore, H.R. 2072 prohibits the Secretary from paying any bonus or award if the issues identified by the IG are not resolved.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H. R. 4031) passed in the House of Representatives earlier this year. It gives the Secretary of Veterans Affairs authority to remove employees of the Senior Executive Service completely from government service or transfer to a General Schedule position within the current civil service system due to poor performance.
Additionally, the Senate confirmed Robert A. McDonald as the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Congress stands ready to assist Secretary McDonald as he leads the VA and works to correct the systemic managerial and reporting failures that have led to serious dysfunction at the VA.
The systemic problems that exist in the VA are not going to be solved by changing leadership alone, but by changing the culture of the Department and the mindset of the employees that serve our veterans.
