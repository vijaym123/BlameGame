News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Short week in Washington this week.
The House passed legislation
reaffirming no taxpayer funding for abortion and finished up
consideration (after months and months of delay) on the Farm Bill.
Since both of those issues are pretty well known to people, I wanted to
draw your attention this week to a piece of legislation I just
introduced going after the NSA's targeting of Americans.
At this point, most Americans are aware that the federal government has
been collecting bulk phone records on millions of private citizens -
the vast majority are outraged.
Despite that, the program and its
underlying legal justification continue.
So what is Congress doing
about it?
In my opinion, not nearly enough.
In fact, almost nothing. The normal
means of addressing this problem would be to amend the regular
authorization bill for the intelligence community.
But that bill won't
come back around again for quite some time.
As an interim measure, a
number of my colleagues and I sought to strip funding for any such
domestic surveillance last year, but for technical bureaucratic
reasons, the amendment we supported would have necessarily blocked the
NSA from collecting data abroad as well as here at home.
That is not
my goal.
The whole point of our Constitution is to protect American citizens
from a federal government that will always seek more power - no matter
the circumstances.
Our Founders created a system to stop that power
grab.
Principles and rights were enshrined in a document that would
supersede all other laws which violated the tenants of that document.
In my opinion, the courts have been far too lax in enforcing that
discipline here.
According to the courts, what the NSA has been doing
is legal.
If that is the case, then the law clearly needs changing.
I have introduced legislation that will change that.
The American
Privacy Protection Act would amend law to remove the provision that the
NSA and its lawyers cite as the legal justification for their trolling
activities.
If the FBI wants the NSA to pull records for a certain
person, then they would need to obtain a warrant just like every other
law enforcement activity.
And having spent almost forty years of my
life in law enforcement, I can tell you unequivocally that the laws we
have to protect the innocent are not an insurmountable obstacle to
catching the guilty.
As a practical matter, would having all Americans' phone records,
emails, and web history make it easier for law enforcement or
intelligence officials to catch bad guys?
Sure it would.
I probably
could have caught a lot of criminals without ever having to leave my
desk.
But America is not a police state and citizens of this country
deserve every bit as much protection from their government as they
deserve protection from the bad guys. As our Founders knew well, the
scariest thing a free man or woman faces is when the government is the
bad guy.
That's where I stand on the NSA surveillance program - protect the
rights of American citizens while providing the intelligence community
with the tools they need overseas to fight against threats to this
great nation.
It is possible to do both. As always, please let me know
where you stand on this or any other issues that are important to you.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Richard

Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Short
week
in
Washington
this
week.
The
House
passed
legislation
reaffirming
no
taxpayer
funding
for
abortion
and
finished
up
consideration
(after
months
and
months
of
delay)
on
the
Farm
Bill.
Since
both
of
those
issues
are
pretty
well
known
to
people,
I
wanted
to
draw
your
attention
this
week
to
a
piece
of
legislation
I
just
introduced
going
after
the
NSA&#8217;s
targeting
of
Americans.
At
this
point,
most
Americans
are
aware
that
the
federal
government
has
been
collecting
bulk
phone
records
on
millions
of
private
citizens
-
the
vast
majority
are
outraged.
Despite
that,
the
program
and
its
underlying
legal
justification
continue.
So
what
is
Congress
doing
about
it?
In
my
opinion,
not
nearly
enough.
In
fact,
almost
nothing.
The
normal
means
of
addressing
this
problem
would
be
to
amend
the
regular
authorization
bill
for
the
intelligence
community.
But
that
bill
won&#8217;t
come
back
around
again
for
quite
some
time.
As
an
interim
measure,
a
number
of
my
colleagues
and
I
sought
to
strip
funding
for
any
such
domestic
surveillance
last
year,
but
for
technical
bureaucratic
reasons,
the
amendment
we
supported
would
have
necessarily
blocked
the
NSA
from
collecting
data
abroad
as
well
as
here
at
home.
That
is
not
my
goal.
The
whole
point
of
our
Constitution
is
to
protect
American
citizens
from
a
federal
government
that
will
always
seek
more
power
&#8211;
no
matter
the
circumstances.
Our
Founders
created
a
system
to
stop
that
power
grab.
Principles
and
rights
were
enshrined
in
a
document
that
would
supersede
all
other
laws
which
violated
the
tenants
of
that
document.
In
my
opinion,
the
courts
have
been
far
too
lax
in
enforcing
that
discipline
here.
According
to
the
courts,
what
the
NSA
has
been
doing
is
legal.
If
that
is
the
case,
then
the
law
clearly
needs
changing.
I
have
introduced
legislation
that
will
change
that.
The
American
Privacy
Protection
Act
would
amend
law
to
remove
the
provision
that
the
NSA
and
its
lawyers
cite
as
the
legal
justification
for
their
trolling
activities.
If
the
FBI
wants
the
NSA
to
pull
records
for
a
certain
person,
then
they
would
need
to
obtain
a
warrant
just
like
every
other
law
enforcement
activity.
And
having
spent
almost
forty
years
of
my
life
in
law
enforcement,
I
can
tell
you
unequivocally
that
the
laws
we
have
to
protect
the
innocent
are
not
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
catching
the
guilty.
As
a
practical
matter,
would
having
all
Americans&#8217;
phone
records,
emails,
and
web
history
make
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
or
intelligence
officials
to
catch
bad
guys?
Sure
it
would.
I
probably
could
have
caught
a
lot
of
criminals
without
ever
having
to
leave
my
desk.
But
America
is
not
a
police
state
and
citizens
of
this
country
deserve
every
bit
as
much
protection
from
their
government
as
they
deserve
protection
from
the
bad
guys.
As
our
Founders
knew
well,
the
scariest
thing
a
free
man
or
woman
faces
is
when
the
government
is
the
bad
guy.
That&#8217;s
where
I
stand
on
the
NSA
surveillance
program
&#8211;
protect
the
rights
of
American
citizens
while
providing
the
intelligence
community
with
the
tools
they
need
overseas
to
fight
against
threats
to
this
great
nation.
It
is
possible
to
do
both.
As
always,
please
let
me
know
where
you
stand
on
this
or
any
other
issues
that
are
important
to
you.
Thanks
again.

Nugent Member
