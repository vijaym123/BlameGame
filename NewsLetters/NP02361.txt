Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Standing with Israel
The United States and Israel
share a strong bond. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress. While controversy encircled Prime
Minister Netanyahu&rsquo;s invitation to address Congress, it was an important message that all Members of Congress needed to hear.
From the dais of the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Netanyahu issued a stern
warning regarding the potential consequences of ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. These negotiations, led by the United States, have raised many
questions about how effective the result would be in preventing Iran&rsquo;s access to nuclear weapons. The threat presented by a nuclear Iran is
serious for Israel, the Middle East as a whole, and the United States. I have many questions about the Administration&rsquo;s Iran policy, and,
unfortunately, these negotiations with Iran provide little confidence that a workable resolution will be reached.
Iran&rsquo;s aggressive actions continue to prove that it cannot be trusted. Allowing Iran access to nuclear
weapons is completely unacceptable. The President, Congress, and the American people should be highly critical of any &ldquo;deal&rdquo; that does not
truly and transparently cut-off Iran&rsquo;s access to a bomb. I agree with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the result of these negotiations is likely
to be a &ldquo;bad deal.&rdquo;
On the heels of Prime Minister&rsquo;s
address, there is a question we must answer as a nation. Do we stand with Israel or do we not? As much of the Middle East remains unstable, the United
States continues to face a flurry of threats and dangers from those who do not support the principles of freedom and liberty that define this nation.
However, one nation has firmly stood as our ally and an advocate of democracy in the region. Israel has proven to be one of our greatest allies and
friends in a part of the globe where those who wish to destroy our very way of life are plentiful. There is no question that the U.S. must stand with
Israel.

DHS Bill Update:
Defending the Constitution
This week, the House passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the
remainder of Fiscal Year 2015. However, since the bill did not stop President Obama&rsquo;s lawless executive actions on immigration, I voted against
it. Senate Democrats defied the will of the American people by repeatedly obstructing debate on a House-passed bill that would provide critical
funding for homeland security and defund the President&rsquo;s unilateral actions on immigration. President Obama&rsquo;s unilateral rewriting of our
immigration laws poses a clear and present danger to the Constitution and we must stand firm to defend it.
We must continue
to use all tools at Congress&rsquo; disposal to stop the President&rsquo;s egregious abuse of authority, such as taking legal action and passing
legislation. This week, the House Judiciary Committee approved two immigration bills, the
Legal Workforce Act
and the
Protection of Children Act , that strengthen the enforcement of
our immigration laws. Stay tuned as the Judiciary Committee considers two additional bills in the coming weeks.
WATCH:
I
joined &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;
to discuss these
immigration bills as well as the ATF's planned backdoor ammo ban.
Tax Season is Coming: Do You Know About the Free File
Program?
This week, I had the opportunity to participate in a briefing on the Free File program at the Massanutten Regional Library in
Harrisonburg. Virginia is one of 20 states plus the District of Columbia that participate in a state Free File program, allowing those eligible to
file both their federal and state tax returns for free.
The
Free File program is an excellent example of how the private sector,
community organizations, and the government can work together.
