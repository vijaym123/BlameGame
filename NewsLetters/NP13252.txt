News from Representative John Delaney
January 3, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write to you today with a news update regarding the status of Warren
Weinstein, a Montgomery County man who was kidnapped by al-Qaeda in
2011. Last week, a video of Weinstein, was released last week to the
media
.
Since the release of the video, I have spoken with the Weinstein family
to lend my support and to make sure that their voice can be heard in
Washington. Our office has been in regular communication with the
family and is gathering information from them regarding the agencies
and non-governmental organizations they would like us to contact on
their behalf. We are currently drafting formal inquiries to the White
House and State Department.
Weinstein is 72-year-old development expert from Rockville, MD, who was
working as a country director for J.E. Austin Associates when he was
kidnapped. A former Peace Corps and USAID official, Weinstein is
recognized as a scholar and humanitarian who spent his career working
to improve the lives of men, women and children around the world.
My perspective on this is straightforward: Warren Weinstein is an
American being held captive by our enemies and this singular fact
cannot be forgotten, overlooked or marginalized. We must be relentless
in our efforts to bring him home and we must maintain a sense of
outrage and determination.
I will keep you apprised of further developments and additional
information that we receive.
Sincerely,
John
