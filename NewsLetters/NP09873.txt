Dear
Friend,
As summer nears, I wanted to close
the loop on some of our Spring activites here in the District and
update you on what's ahead.
Congressional Art Competition
This year's art competition brought out the some of the
most original pieces I've seen yet! It's always a great joy of mine
to be able to see the level of talent our students posess. I look
forward to seeing the top three pieces displayed in the Capitol and my two
offices.
