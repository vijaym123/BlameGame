January 5, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
New Beginnings on Capitol Hill
Tomorrow, the 114th Congress will convene and the new Senators will be
sworn into office. For the first time in eight years, the Senate will
have a Republican Majority. You can expect to see the Senate return to
a state of "regular order" in which committees function, amendments are
considered, and votes are cast in support or opposition of legislation.
This has not been the norm in Washington for some time and the
political process has suffered as a result. I look forward to this
better functioning Senate and the opportunity to provide every Kansan a
strong and clear voice in our nation's capital.
Kansas Listening Tour Continues
This week, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with six stops in
Pawnee, Hodgeman, Ness, Brown, Scott and Lane Counties. The issues I
focus on and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the
conversations I have with Kansans so making certain I make it back home
to visit with folks is my top priority. You can visit my website
for upcoming
Kansas Listening Tour stops in your community.
On Monday morning, about 40 Pawnee County residents came by Burdett
Senior Center to share their thoughts and concerns with me on topics
including agriculture, rural healthcare, education, and the importance
of a functioning U.S. Senate. Thanks again to Mitch Rucker, a former
intern in my Washington, D.C. office, for the kind introduction. It was
good to see so many familiar faces in Burdett, a community I've
represented since I was first elected to the Kansas State Senate. I ran
into Anne Graner of Larned, Stan Finger of the The Wichita Eagle - who
was home for Christmas and in attendance with his mom - and Craig
Schartz. As always, the potluck lunch at the Burdett Senior Center was
delicious. Thanks again to everyone who came out to visit with me.
>From Burdett, I headed to Hodgeman County where about 25 residents came
the King Center in Jetmore for my town hall meeting. Topics included
hopes that the new Congress will tackle tax reform, the lesser prairie
chicken, overreach by the EPA, executive orders and rural health care.
It was good to see everyone who took the time to visit with me,
including State Representative John Ewy, Hodgeman County Commissioner
Marsha Ewy, and Kansas State Fair Board Member Harmon Bliss. Thanks
again to former State Senator Larry Salmans for the kind introduction,
and to City Clerk Deb McKivergan for helping organize the town hall.
I ended the day Monday in Ness City at my Ness County Courthouse.
Attendees shared concerns about the postal service and the ability for
veterans to access the care and services they deserve. It was good to
see Ness County Commissioner Fred Flax and Gary Foos of the Kansas
American Legion. Also in attendance was Steve Phelps, past VFW state
commander.
On Friday, I kicked off my first Kansas Listening Tour stop of the year
in Scott City. I was asked a number of questions and given feedback
about trade with Cuba, rural health care and Farm Bill implementation.
Thanks to Scott County Hospital CEO Mark Burnett for hosting the event,
as well as State Senator Mitch Holmes, State Representative Don
Hineman, Scott County Commissioner Jim Minnix and Kansas Wheat
Commissioner Richard Randall for attending.
On Wednesday, I closed the year in Fairview with my final town hall
meeting of 2014 at the Community Building - my 74th this year. Thanks
to the 35 residents of Brown County who attended to visit and offer
their ideas and suggestions as I prepare to return to Washington this
January for a new session of Congress. Topics of discussion ranged from
hopes for a fully functioning Senate, the importance of passing a
budget to our nation's fiscal health, veterans' issues and the Farm
Bill. Thanks again to Joann Keim for helping to organize my visit.
>From Scott City, I headed to Lane County. In Dighton, area residents
shared feedback and concerns about a number of issues including the
omnibus vote and the future water needs of our state. Thanks to State
Senator Mitch Holmes, former State Representative Max Moomaw and Lane
County Commissioner Jon Risley for attending.
I appreciate these opportunities to hear from Kansans. I have an
upcoming Listening Tour stop on Tuesday in Lenexa at Fire Station #3.
You can find out more about these town hall meetings in the sidebar of
this newsletter. As I continue to schedule Listening Tour stops, I look
forward to hearing from folks across the state.
Meeting with Kansas Conservation Experts
On Saturday, representatives from Kansas Wildlife Federation, Ranchland
Trust of Kansas, Pheasants Forever/Quail Forever, Playa Lakes Joint
Venture, Ducks Unlimited, The Nature Conservancy, the Kansas Land Trust
and I met to discuss a number of issues that impact Kansans. Our
discussion centered around the Farm Bill conservation title funding,
conservation easement donation tax incentives, federal agency
conservation budgets, Land and Water Conservation Fund Reauthorization,
North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Lesser Prairie Chicken
Recovery.
It is critical for me to hear directly from Kansans about the impact
and implementation of these policies. Hopefully, we can work together
to make certain farmers and ranchers may continue farming and ranching
practices while conserving Kansas' natural resources for the next
generation. Thanks to Rob Manes with The Nature Conservancy for helping
to organize this productive discussion.
Rooting on the Shockers
It was great to cheer the Wichita State Men's Basketball Team on to
victory on Sunday! Here, Robba and I are pictured with Wichita State
University President John Bardo, National Institute for Aviation
Research Director John Tomblin and Wichita State University Executive
Director of Government Relations Andy Schlapp.
Kansas Leads the Nation in Teenage Volunteerism
The special way of life we live in Kansas would not be possible without
Kansans committed to giving back to improve their own communities. A
great example of this service is the tremendous effort of Kansas
teenagers volunteering at home. According to the most recent
"Volunteering and Civic Life in America" study by the Corporation for
National and Community Service and the National Conference on
Citizenship, more Kansas teenagers volunteer actively in their
communities than in any other state. This study notes that nearly 41
percent of Kansas teens volunteered between 2011 and 2013, the highest
rate in the country. Furthermore, two-thirds of Kansans of all ages
engaged in "informal volunteering," such as assisting a neighbor, and
more than 36 percent of Kansans formally volunteered through an
organization. It is inspiring to highlight acts of kindness and
selflessness, especially during the holiday season, and I commend all
the Kansans that volunteer in our communities and the parents,
teachers, friends, and family members that set shining examples of
service to others in our state. This commitment to service enriches our
own homes and strengthens our nation.
Visiting Healy
On Friday between listening tour stops in Western Kansas, I stopped in
Healy to visit with local residents. I received updates from folks at
the Healy Oil Company, Sharp Brothers Seed, the post office, First
State Bank of Healy and Sharp's Shooting Supply.
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by
email by clicking here
. You can also click here
to contact me through one of
my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.
Very truly yours,

I
continued
my

in
Pawnee,
Hodgeman,
Ness,
Brown,
Scott
and
Lane
Counties.
The
issues

Congress
will
tackle
tax
reform,
the
lesser
prairie
chicken,

Kansas
Leads
the
Nation
in
Teenage
Volunteerism The
special
way
of
life
we
live
in
Kansas
would
not
be
possible
without
Kansans
committed
to
giving
back
to
improve
their
own
communities.
A
great
example
of
this
service
is
the
tremendous
effort
of
Kansas
teenagers
volunteering
at
home.
According
to
the
most
recent
&#8220;Volunteering
and
Civic
Life
in
America&#8221;
study
by
the
Corporation
for
National
and
Community
Service
and
the
National
Conference
on
Citizenship,
more
Kansas
teenagers
volunteer
actively
in
their
communities
than
in
any
other
state.
This
study
notes
that
nearly
41
percent
of
Kansas
teens
volunteered
between
2011
and
2013,
the
highest
rate
in
the
country.
Furthermore,
two-thirds
of
Kansans
of
all
ages
engaged
in
&#8220;informal
volunteering,&#8221;
such
as
assisting
a
neighbor,
and
more
than
36
percent
of
Kansans
formally
volunteered
through
an
organization.
It
is
inspiring
to
highlight
acts
of
kindness
and
selflessness,
especially
during
the
holiday
season,
and
I
commend
all
the
Kansans
that
volunteer
in
our
communities
and
the
parents,
teachers,
friends,
and
family
members
that
set
shining
examples
of
service
to
others
in
our
state.
This
commitment
to
service
enriches
our
own
homes
and
strengthens
our
nation.
