President Requests 1,500 Troops for Iraq
President Obama today asked Congress for funds to send 1,500 military personnel to Iraq to train friendly forces to fight ISIL. With extremists just outside Baghdad, its no surprise that the President wants to send more help. However, the fact that is comes just a few days after the election seems to be a rather cynical maneuver. We shouldnt let politics dictate what is best for our national security. Troops will not be in combat, but it is clear that Iraq is a dangerous place right now. If we send U.S. personnel, we have to make sure they have the ability to protect themselves.
More Funding for Ebola Requested
Earlier in the week, President Obama also asked Congress for over $6 billion more to fight Ebola. This money would go to the Centers for Disease Control to combat the disease, the National Institutes of Health to work on vaccines, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to fight Ebola in Africa. Well be considering the request in detail as early as next week.
Jobs Report Shows More Slow Growth
The jobs report issued today showed unemployment decreasing again to 5.8 percent with over 200,000 jobs created. Thats positive progress, but still not the booming economy we need to help job seekers. Wage growth continues to be a real problem. For most Americans, their wages are only just keeping up with inflation. I hope that early next year we can pass solid jobs bills that can help increase jobs and wages in a way that gets many more Americans working and providing for their families.
Lots to Do in Lame Duck
Next week, Congress will return to Washington with a lot on the plate. In addition to the Presidents two special requests, we still need to fund the government for next year. We also need to consider extending certain important tax provisions such as the research and development tax credit. The 113th Congress isnt and we cant wait until next year to do some important things. Read more in this weeks op-ed below.
Op-ed of the Week: Lots of Work Before the New Year
The year 2015 will bring with it a new Congress. One with Republicans firmly in control of both the Senate and the House. There will be a lot of say about our plans for the next Congress, but that would be getting ahead of ourselves. Congress cannot be idle in the remainder of 2014. There is work to do.
