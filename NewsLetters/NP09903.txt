News from Representative John Delaney
May 5, 2014
Dear Friend,
Unless Congress Acts, the Highway Trust Fund will become insolvent this
summer, halting critical repairs to our nation's roads, bridges and
transit systems. With an infrastructure backlog costing American
businesses billions in lost productivity every year, stalling on
infrastructure development is simply unaffordable. On Sunday, I wrote
an op-ed for the Washington Post
, calling on Congress to take action using a
bipartisan approach.
While the Highway Trust Fund's financial challenges are bad news for
drivers, transit users and the American economy, the past year has seen
one important, positive development: Congress has started talking
seriously about using reforms to the international tax code to help
fund infrastructure repair in the United States. Today, U.S.
corporations hold an estimated $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes.
In this weekend's article, I proposed changes to the tax code that
allow for needed investments in our transportation, energy and
education infrastructure.
To learn more about my ideas reforming the federal tax code and funding
infrastructure development, read my op-ed in this Sunday's Washington
Post
.
In addition to the long-term fixes recommended in Sunday's article, I've
introduced legislation this Congress to help bring corporate earnings
back to the United States and start work repairing our infrastructure
now. Currently the largest bipartisan jobs bill before the House, the
Partnership to Build America Act would invest $750 billion in our
infrastructure by providing companies an opportunity to repatriate
corporate funds in exchange for investments in a national
infrastructure fund. Today, my bill has over 60 cosponsors with equal
support from both parties.
As Congress considers strategies for repairing our nation's
infrastructure and restoring U.S. competitiveness, I'll be sure to keep
you up to date with my work in the House. I welcome your feedback
on these important issues.
Sincerely,
John
