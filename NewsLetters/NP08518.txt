Today marks West Virginias 151 st
birthday
a day in which truly embodies a brave and daring declaration of statehood that is unprecedented in American history.
Born out of the fiery battles of the Civil War, West Virginia was founded by patriots who were willing to risk their lives in a united pursuit of justice and freedom for all.
And since that day 151 years ago, on June 20, 1863
when our state officially became the 35 th
state admitted into the Union
West Virginias rich culture and strong traditions grew.
That year, the Great Seal of the state of West Virginia was adopteddepicting who we are as a people and as a culture. With our birth dates inscription forever engraved in its center, the seal features a boulder with two crossed rifles and a liberty cap to express our states importance of fighting for liberty and justice.
On either side of the boulder stand two men: on the left, a farmer stands with an ax and a plow to represent agriculture, and on the right, a miner stands with a pickax and a sledge hammer to represent industry.
Finally, along the outer ring carves the text State of West Virginia and Montani Semper Liberi, translating to Mountaineers are Always Free.
That Great Seal of West Virginia, designed in 1863 during Americas bloody civil war, leaves a lasting imprint of who we are as the people of West Virginia.
As Ive often said, the best steel comes from the hottest fire, and the fires of the Civil War transformed us. We forever branded ourselves to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution
and as the Mountaineers who will always be free.
We are tough, independent, inventive and honest. Our character has been shaped by the wilderness of our state
its welcoming mountains, countless hollers, rushing streams, boundless blue skies, and dense green forests.
West Virginia is a place of coal mines and soaring eagles, Boy Scouts and community leaders, sparkling lakes and captivating mountains, winding backcountry and smoky barbecue joints, battlefields and hidden trails, college towns and small towns.
West Virginia is a place of power, pulse and passion
a special place we call home.
And yes
weve had our ups and downs, our setbacks and triumphs. Famous family feuds, neighborly fights, timely trials, and unexpected challenges have been thrown our way. But the spirit of West Virginia has never been broken.
And it never will. When things get tough, we get tougher.
So today, as we celebrate West Virginias 151 st
birthday, a day that we now also call West Virginia Day, I encourage all West Virginians to remember who we are as a people. I encourage us all to remember our history and the first mountaineers. Remember the brave leaders and strong laborers who paved the way for us and for future generations.
Every West Virginian contributes to our states amazing story, and on West Virginia day, I encourage all West Virginians to seize this opportunity to imagine the future of this great state
and this nation
and be proud of how far weve come and how far we will go.
And like the brave, loyal patriots who made West Virginia the 35 th
star on Old Glory, West Virginians love of God and country and family and state remain unshakeable. And that is well worth celebrating every year.
