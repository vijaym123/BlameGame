CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
April 27, 2015
Last week, after much debate and a lengthy amendment
process, the Senate passed the bipartisan Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act, 99-0. During the amendment process,
I
successfully championed legislation
through the Senate that will close a
loophole that has allowed sex offenders convicted under military
courts to game the system and again victimize others.
The
Military Sex Offender Reporting amendment
passed the Senate
unanimously, 98-0.
In our own state of North Carolina, weve seen
the devastating effects of this loophole. Closing this gap standardizes
reporting for all sex offenders, regardless of whether they are
military or civilian, so that no convicted offender can evade law
enforcement and target new victims.

the loophole previously, did a follow-up after the passage of my
amendment. You can watch by clicking below.

Amendment
On Thursday, Senators Bennet and Hatch joined me in introducing a
bipartisan bill,
the Advancing Breakthrough Devices for
Patients Act , to help bring breakthrough devices to patients in as
timely a manner as possible.
America is the worlds most
innovative nation, especially in our medical research and development and
America's patients deserve access to the most cutting-edge life-saving
therapies and devices. We need to advance these innovative medical
products, including breakthrough devices, and FDA can be a key partner
in this important endeavor. This legislation ensures that Americas
patients are receiving the most innovative technologies in as timely a
manner as possible by improving regulatory certainty and applying an
all-hands-on-deck approach to the development and review of these
devices. Read more about the Advancing Breakthrough Devices for Patients
Act

In Congress last week,
Senator Heitkamp and I introduced a resolution designating April
23 rd
as
Take our Daughters and Sons to Work
day . Opportunities to show our children what they are working toward
while at school is important so they know the value and sense of purpose
that comes with an education and career goals. Did you take your
daughters or sons to work on Thursday? If so, share your story
on my Facebook page .
Last week, the Senate Finance
Committee worked on legislation to give the President Trade Promotion
Authority. I was unable to support this legislation because I have
concerns about whether this Administration is negotiating a trade deal
thatwill benefit North Carolina, and unfortunately, we were unable to
amend the bill.
You can catch a portion of my concerns about
currency manipulation below.

manipulation
Did you catch McClatchys piece on my cybersecurity bill? From
McClatchy: I think anyone in business today would tell you that the
status quo is a disaster. . . . I havent found a company yet in America
that is not supportive of what were doing. You can read the full
story
here .
While I was in North
Carolina for the state work period two weeks ago, I was able to sit down
with my alma maters newspaper, Old Gold &amp; Black. You can read the
two part story covering my thoughts on everything from the Presidential
election, ISIL, and overseeing the Intelligence Committee
here
and
here .
Finally, on Thursday we learned that two innocent hostages were killed in a
drone attack in Pakistan.
My prayers are with the families of
Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto.
In our grief, though, we
should remember that al-Qaida is merciless in their capture and
continued detainment of hostages who have selflessly sought to serve others,
and they bear the ultimate responsibility for these deaths.
Congress will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of our nations
counterterrorism operations.
I firmly believe the dedicated
Americans engaged in those efforts take very seriously the need to prevent
collateral damage and limit the risk to innocent people, and they, too,
share in the grief being felt by the Weinstein and Lo Porto
families.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
