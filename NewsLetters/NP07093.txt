7th DISTRICT
August 17, 2014
Dear Friends:
This week, VJ Day went
almost unnoticed. While it was very much celebrated in the past to
mark the WWII victory over Japan, most people have forgotten that
milestone.
Today, the modern media
delivers daily the turmoil engulfing the world in vivid detail. While all
of us would like to put war and armed conflict behind us, the
unfortunate reality is that some extreme terrorist groups want to destroy our
nation and our way of life.
To
someday celebrate a VT (Victory over Terrorism) Day, the United States
cannot afford today to lead from behind. We cannot allow our
intelligence to miss the threat of an ISIS. We cannot abandon our military
strength or our veterans.
Pearl Harbor
and September 11th should always remind us that we can never let down
our guard. These are just some thoughts from your Representative in
Congress as I reflect upon and remember VJ Day
2014.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
Member of
Congress
