Dear David,
I am a member of the Education and the
Workforce Committee and an advocate for all people to have equal
access to a valuable education.
Part of my goal is to expose
students to college entry requirements and the financial options available to
them.
Earlier this month, I hosted a college fair and invited
higher education institutions from around the country to participate.
Details about the event and other education-related stories are
below, including a consumer advisory about student loans.
Military Academy
Appointments
Each year, I nominate talented high school students to a military
academy of their choice after an extensive application and
interviewing process. Thus far, five students have been offered an appointment by
an academy. If they accept, the students will receive an exceptional
education and dedicate five years of active duty service to our great
nation. Please join me in congratulating:
Do You Have A Co-Signer For Your Student
Loans?
Many college
students must borrow money to pay for their higher education. The
federal government offers several low interest rate loans, but too often
students do not exhaust this option.
Instead, they obtain high
interest rate loans from private lenders that bury clauses in the fine
print.
The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently released a consumer alert for borrowers
with private student loans, warning that they can be subject to
default even if they have kept up with their payments.
These
borrowers were in compliance with the loan requirements but had a co-signer on
their loan who either passed away or went into bankruptcy.
Through no fault of their own, they were automatically forced into default
or required to pay off the loan immediately.
To learn more
about the report, please visit the
CFPB website .
It is
imperative to ask a private lender what co-signer rules are in the contract
before borrowing money.
I encourage students to first seek loans
from the federal government rather than private institutions since
these loans provide flexible repayment plans and generally do not
require a co-signer.
Students must complete a
Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) to receive a federal loan.
The deadline for Ohio is June
30, 2015.
However, some schools may have an earlier
deadline, so students should check with the institution they are interested
in attending.
As always, contact my office if you need
assistance.
