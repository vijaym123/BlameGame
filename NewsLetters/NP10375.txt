Dear Friends,
Over the last two weeks, I have had the privilege and joy of traveling throughout the Third District and meeting countless constituents from all walks of life. These constituent work periods are crucial because they allow me to hear the honest opinions and concerns of Western Pennsylvanians and then bring them to Washington -- and never the other way around.
I hope you had a very happy Easter last weekend, and hope those of you who observed Passover had a very blessed holiday as well.
Also this past week was Tax Freedom Day -- the day when our nation as a whole has earned enough money to pay our total tax bill for the year. In light of that occasion, here are some tax facts to keep in mind:
#1. According to the Tax Foundation, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than on food, clothing, and housing combined.
#2. America's tax code is currently more than 70,000 pages long and has
actually grown from 1.4 million words in just 2011 to almost 4 million
words to day. By comparison, the Bible is
roughly 774,000 words. There is something deeply wrong when the code by
which we live is dwarfed by the code by which we are taxed.
#3. Americans currently spend more than 6 billion hours filing their
taxes every year, and annually pay up to $431 billion just to comply
with needlessly confusing tax rules. According to figures from the
Taxpayer Advocate Service, if complying with the tax code were an
industry, it would be one of the largest in the U.S.
#4. The
last major revision to our tax code was almost 30 years ago. Obviously a
heck of a lot has changed since then, and even more has changed since
1913 when the federal income tax system was created with the
ratification of the 16th Amendment giving Congress the "power to lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived."
All
of this is unacceptable. America needs a modern tax system to reflect
today's realities, not the antiquated, inefficient tax code of the last
century. One distraught constituent even wrote to me recently calling
our current system "criminal," saying she sees it as "meant to destroy
the middle class."
The time for change is NOW. A fairer and
simpler tax code will allow taxpayers to save money, our economy to
thrive, and new jobs to flourish.
As a member of the House
Ways & Means Committee, I consider achieving tax reform one of my
very highest priorities. I invite you to keep up to date with our
progress at the following sites:

Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Promotes New Jobs Bill
at Erie Restaurant
Visits The Brewerie at Union Station in Erie to tout
the Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act
Rep. Kelly with Brewerie owner Chris Sirianni and Dan Roehl of the National Restaurant Association
Rep. Kelly visited The Brewerie at Union Station in Erie, PA on Thursday, April 24th, to discuss the benefits of H.R. 4212,
the Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act , a bipartisan bill which
he introduced
in the House of Representatives last month with Reps. Richard Neal (D-MA), Jim Gerlach (R-PA), and Ron Kind (D-WI). The legislation would make permanent a 15-year tax depreciation schedule for restaurant improvements and new construction, as well as leasehold and retail improvements. At a press conference following the visit, Rep. Kelly was introduced by Chris Sirianni, owner of The Brewerie and Northwest Chapter President of the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association (PRLA).
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"I had a wonderful time visiting The Brewerie today and thank Chris Sirianni and his entire staff for their exceptional hospitality. The Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that addresses the number one issue on the minds of Western Pennsylvanians, and indeed all Americans, right now: job creation. America's foodservice industry provides jobs for 10 percent of our nation's workforce. In Pennsylvania alone, restaurants account for more than 535,000 jobs - 9 percent of all jobs in our state. In the Third District, restaurants like The Brewerie employ more than 20,000 hardworking men and women - our family members, our friends, our neighbors. As the nation struggles through this historically underwhelming recovery, it is important that these restaurants and other retailers have the certainty they need to expand their businesses and put more Americans back to work."
Praise for H.R. 4212 by Dave Koenig, Vice President, Tax & Profitability, National Restaurant Association:
"The National Restaurant Association thanks Rep. Kelly for taking the lead in supporting restaurant innovation and job creation through the Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act. Restaurants experience heavy wear and tear serving 130 million guests a day at nearly one million establishments nationwide. Making the 15-year depreciation provisions permanent provides restaurateurs with the predictability and additional cash flow needed to plan for future investments, and we appreciate the leadership shown by these members in introducing this important legislation."
Praise for H.R. 4212 by John Longstreet, President & CEO, Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association:
"The Pennsylvania Restaurant & Lodging Association is pleased to support this positive, bipartisan piece of legislation spearheaded by Pennsylvania Reps. Kelly and Gerlach because it not only helps the restaurant industry but also the economy. The tax certainty that comes along with a permanent depreciation schedule will allow restaurant owners to reinvest in their businesses and workforce."
