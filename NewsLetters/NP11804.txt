Dear Friend,
U.S. Rep. Gregory W. Meeks Applauds the Passage of
the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability
Act
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Yesterday, the House of Representatives agreed on H.R.
3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (HFIA), a
bi-partisan measure to provide relief to flood insurance policy holders
across the country.
The bill, approved by more than two thirds
support, includes provisions insisted on by U.S. Rep. Gregory W. Meeks to
retroactively provide refunds for policy holders whose rates have
severely increased over the last year.
In a statement given on
the floor preceding todays vote, Congressman Meeks stated, Let me
first thank Ranking Member Waters and my good friend Michael Grimm for
working collectively to make this thing happen.
You see, it was
just 17 months ago that residents in my congressional district, the 5th
Congressional District of New York, and others throughout America
were devastated by Super Storm Sandy.
But little did they know then
that they would be hit by another storm.
And then came FEMA
with astronomical rate increases to their flood insurance program.
Two strikes in the midst of a severe recession and many of them are
out.
It [HFIA] will finally give relief to individuals who were
wondering what they were going to do.
Below are excerpts
from the House floor statement and a link to the video:
In addition to providing this critical relief to
homeowners across the country, the Flood Insurance Affordability Act
also amends the National Flood Insurance Program to permanently remove
the home sale rate increase trigger for primary residences and
reinstates grandfathers policy rates by decoupling rate increases from FEMA
remapping.
With this bill, we add certainty to homeowners
who are struggling to recover from the economic crisis.
This
bill provides solutions for homeowners who have seen excessive rate
increases.
It provides retroactive refunds to many victims of high
rate increases.
It also includes affordability measures such as a
rate increase cap, optional monthly installment plans, and flood
proofed basement exemptions.
The Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act is a positive sign that the House of Representatives can work
in a bipartisan fashion to solve the problems facing American
families.
