Dear Friends,
Imagine having to decide between food, shelter or paying your bills. That is the difficult choice that 1.3 million Americans are having to make after they lost their federal unemployment insurance benefits on December 28th.
More than 213,000 Californians and 53,000 Los Angeles County residents who lost their benefits are waiting for Congress take action.
The long-term unemployed are not lazy and do not lack motivation. They are people who have fallen on hard times after one of the largest economic recessions in our nation&rsquo;s history. Unemployment insurance benefits are the lifeline that help them provide for their families and put food on the table while they work to find long term employment.
Expanding these benefits is also good for our economic recovery. When you put money in people&rsquo;s pockets, they spend more. When people spend more, our economy grows and businesses hire. This is another reason why renewing unemployment insurance is so important.
Today, the Senate took an important step in the process to extend these crucial benefits. It is now the House&rsquo;s turn to show some leadership and allow a vote to extend unemployment insurance benefits. Rest assured, I will continue fighting to make sure the House passes a three-month extension of federal unemployment insurance benefits.
Sincerely,
Linda T. S&aacute;nchez
Member of Congress
