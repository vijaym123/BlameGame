Dear Friends,
As you probably know, Veterans Day and Kansas have a long and storied history.
It was a Kansas Congressman from Emporia, Ed Rees, who sponsored the legislation to establish the holiday; and it was a President from Abilene, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed it into law.
But the Kansas way of recognizing the accomplishments, the sacrifice, and the courage of our nations military veterans transcends a single day.
Kansans show their appreciation on a daily basis.
I always enjoy spending time with the Airmen of McConnell Air Force Base
I see it every day Im traveling from one end of the 4 th
Congressional District to the other. Its the small business owner who actively recruits veterans.
Its the random stranger who stops a McConnell AFB airman on the street to just say, Thank you.
Its the ceremony held at the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport to welcome home our World War II veterans who, thanks to the Honor Flights of Kansas, are returning from a visit to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.

So while you are thanking veterans today, I know you will continue that thank you throughout the year.
Our nations future is limitless, and so should our thanks to those who made that future possible.
God bless you, God bless our military, and God bless the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
