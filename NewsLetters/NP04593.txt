Aloha David,
I hope you and your &lsquo;ohana have been doing well. This week, we celebrated a day of reflection and expressions of gratitude for the selfless veterans in Hawai&lsquo;i and across our nation. It is the sacrifices that they and their family make, in the service of our nation, that makes it all the more important that our nation honors its commitment to them.
Last week, I received some good news for Hawai&lsquo;i veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that ALL eligible Hawai&lsquo;i veterans will be receiving a Veterans Choice Card to access non-VA care in their communities, regardless of how long they&rsquo;ve been sitting on a wait list.
I fought hard for this option after news broke of the VA scandal in Phoenix and again when I learned Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s veterans were facing the longest wait times in the nation to get their first appointment with a primary care provider. I also called on President Barack Obama to provide this access, and introduced my own bipartisan legislation to accomplish this. The foundation of that proposal was included in the bipartisan VA healthcare reform bill that was passed this summer. This next step will allow our selfless veterans to access a benefit they have sacrificed greatly for and have earned.
If you have any questions about your eligibility for a Veterans Choice Card, please contact: 866-606-8198. For more information about the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, please visit:
