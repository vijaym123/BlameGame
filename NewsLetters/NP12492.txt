Dear Friend,
It has
been a busy time in Washington. This week I took part in two important
roundtable discussions. The first,
Conversations with Conservatives , was hosted by the Heritage
Foundation and focused on immigration reform and the upcoming debt ceiling
debate. Then I had a chance to debate energy policy with some of my
Democratic colleagues at an event sponsored by
Politico .
I also just signed on to the STOP
Resolution, which would bring legal action against President Obama for
overstepping his authority in executive orders.
The President
recently delivered his State of the Union address and I thought it
was a Coke Zero type of speech
no calories.
You can WATCH my response
HERE.

I also want to get

right.
