This week, the House continued its laser focus on legislation to help create an environment that gets the American economy moving again. Unfortunately, we received some bad news this week about the state of the American economy when we learned that the U.S. GDP actually shrank by 2.9% in the first quarter of the year - the steepest decline in 5 years.
To help get the economy moving again we passed the H.R. 6, the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act, which will boost American natural gas production and will help us towards the goal of becoming a net energy exporter. The bill would reduce from 90 days to 30 days the amount of time for the Energy Department to decide on pending LNG export applications. Locally, it could mean an additional 59,289 jobs for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
In addition to natural gas production, the House also passed a bill this week to ease the squeeze many Americans are feeling at the gas pump. The Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act, H.R. 4899, would expand access for American oil production. Given the current situation in the Middle East, we need to limit our dependency on foreign oil as much as possible. With an increased supply of American oil, we'd also feel the added benefit of lower prices for consumers.
Finally, on a lighter note, congratulations to the U.S. Mens National Soccer Team (USMNT) on advancing to the Round of 16 of the World Cup. It's been fantastic watching Americans come together as a country to cheer on our team. I had a quick opportunity the other day to show my support for the USMNT; heres how it turned out (and yes, I really should've been wearing soccer socks!).
