September 14, 2014
Friends,
It was an eventful week, both in Washington and in Northeast
Ohio. Our nation observed the 13th anniversary of 9/11. Chardon once
again demonstrated its resiliency in the face of great
difficulty.
Through it all, I am reminded how proud I am to represent the
people of the 14th District. Thank you for the honor of serving
you.
Here's an overview of the past few
days:
Supporting our troops
Earlier this week, I had
the opportunity to help the USO assemble Warrior Care Packages for our
wounded and ill troops. We must do all we can to stand with our
military men and women who put it all on the line to protect our
nation.
Helping Ohio families keep their health
care
On Thursday, I voted for H.R. 3522, the Employee
Health Care Protection Act, to prevent Ohio families from losing their
health care plans. Millions of Americans have had their plans cancelled
under the Affordable Care Act despite President Obamas repeated promise
that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it. Many of you
have told me about your frustrations with lost coverage and rising
premiums.
H.R. 3522 counteracts these broken promises and
protects individuals and families with employer-sponsored coverage from
losing their insurance this fall. Ohioans should be able to keep the
plans that are right for them, rather than having their health care
options dictated by Washington.
Investing in
infrastructure
I was glad to announce this week that the
Mentor Harbor channel project has been advanced to the next step in
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 107 Program. The completion of
this project will improve access to Lake Erie and allow for safer
navigation of the waters near Mentor Harbor. Infrastructure investments
like this one are smart ways to boost our economy while rebuilding our
nation.

Remembering
9/11
It has been 13 years since September 11, 2001, but the memory of
that day is permanently imprinted in our minds and hearts. I remember
watching in horror as the events unfolded that Tuesday morning, as
many of us do. We extend our utmost gratitude to the brave men and women
in uniform who have fought to preserve our nation in the years
following these attacks, as well as the first responders who put it all on
the line that day to answer the call of duty.
Many things
have changed in our country over the past 13 years, but the resolve to
come back stronger than we were before remains the same. The attack on
our soil brought communities and the nation together in a way rarely
seen. Now, as the threat of terrorism continues in our world, may we
draw on the strength we've shown before and stand united as
Americans.
#ChardonStrong
Thursday
night was a difficult one for Northeast Ohio. Old wounds were revisited
as residents wrestled with questions and fears. But, as Chardon always
does, the community came together in strength to help each other
through. Thank you to the Lima Police Department, the Geauga County
Sheriff's Office, the Chardon and Russell Township Police Departments,
Chardon school officials and all collaborating agencies who jumped into
action and handled the situation with excellence.
On
Tuesday, Chardon High School Principal Andy Fetchik stopped by my DC
office to discuss challenges and great opportunities in education. Fetchik
was named Ohios 2015 High School Principal of the Year and continues
to make Northeast Ohio proud.
