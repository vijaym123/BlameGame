Dear Friend,
Two Supreme Court decisions --
Citizens United
and
McCutcheon
-- have &ldquo;eviscerated&rdquo; our campaign finance laws. Those aren&rsquo;t my words, they&rsquo;re the words of a Supreme Court justice. And they&rsquo;re sadly true.
Taken together, these two decisions make it all-but-impossible to achieve meaningful campaign finance reform under our current system.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m joining with my colleagues to support a constitutional amendment that would clearly and permanently declare that
money is not speech. We need to show our strength and our resolve. Add your name to our petition.
These decisions have impoverished our democracy while enriching special interests who spend millions on anonymous attack ads. And it is far past time we put an end to
Citizens United
once and for all.
American elections are about people and ideas, not insider clout and undisclosed money.
And we need to make that perfectly, inescapably clear by building up our grassroots efforts. Stand with my colleagues and me against unregulated campaign spending -- sign our petition.
Thank you for your support, and please forward this email to your friends and family.
Sincerely,
Ed
