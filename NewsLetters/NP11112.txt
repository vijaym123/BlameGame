Heller Welcomes Presidents Call
to End NSA Bulk Data Collection
(Washington, D.C.)
Yesterday, President Barack Obama announced
a legislative proposal to overhaul the
National Security Agencys (NSA)
telephone metadata collection program. U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV), who has
partnered with lawmakers on a bipartisan
basis to end the metadata collection
program and increase transparency at the
NSA, welcomed the Presidents
proposal.
The NSAs massive data
collection practices have violated
Nevadans constitutional rights while
only solving a few FBI overseas terrorism
investigations. I have said for some time
that this program is simply not reasonable
and should cease. I am pleased to see
President Obama propose an end to this
program, and look forward to reviewing the
details of this legislation as my
colleagues and I work together to protect
the Fourth Amendment rights of all
Americans, said Senator Dean
Heller.
Senator Heller joined Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) as a lead Republican cosponsor
of the USA Freedom Act, which was
introduced in October 2012. The USA
Freedom Act was designed to stop the NSA
from obtaining telephone records of
millions of Americans by ending the bulk
collection program permitted under Section
215 of the PATRIOT Act. For more

the bill, please click

Senator Heller also introduced the
Surveillance
Transparency Act of 2013
with Senator
Al Franken (D-MN). This legislation would
expand and improve ongoing government
reporting about programs under the PATRIOT
Act and the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act that have recently been
the subject of controversy.

Hellers perspective on the
NSAs surveillance programs in
this
op-ed
that he penned for the Las Vegas
Review-Journal.
