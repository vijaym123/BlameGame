Dear Friend,
This week, the House passed two FY 2015 appropriations bills this week -
the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill and
the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill.
The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill
fulfills our moral and legal obligation to our veterans, ensuring they
have quality medical care, job and training programs, and other
benefits they have earned. This bill increases discretionary spending
for veterans programs by $1.58 billion above last year, providing $64.7
billion for our country's veterans.
Additionally, this legislation protects active-duty service members by
providing $6.6 billion for construction of military family housing,
military facilities, DOD education facilities, and Guard and Reserve
facilities. It is imperative that the federal government provide
adequate resources for our men and women in uniform and that it stand
by our veterans by fully embracing the belief that promises made must
be promises that are kept. I was pleased the bill invests $45 million
to address a number of important veterans issues, especially the
backlog in claims and allow the VA to continue serving 6.7 million
patients. It is unacceptable for veterans to have to wait months or
years to receive a determination on their status. We must conquer this
tragedy.
Finally, the bill requires both DOD and the VA to implement a system to
share medical data in a timely and accurate manner. The VA will be held
accountable by restricting funding until they ensure that its system
will be compatible with DOD's records. Additionally, funds are included
for the modernization of the VA electronic health record system, which
will help with the process of getting veterans the designation they
need.
The Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill funds Congress and the
agencies that support Congress. The bill maintains the FY 2014 funding
levels for the House - holding the line on spending. Members of
Congress are asked to tighten their belts, by continuing their pay
freeze that has been in place since 2010. In fact, overall funding for
the House has been reduced by 14 percent since Republicans gained
control in 2011. It is my belief that because hardworking American
families must live within their means, Congress must do the same.
On another matter this week, my House Budget Committee colleagues and I
discussed the fight against poverty and efforts to expand economic
opportunity for all Americans. Clearly, there is plenty of room for
improvement over the failed policies of the past. The status quo is NOT
working and more of the same will NOT solve any problems. It is
imperative that we learn what helps enable Americans to find solutions
that will benefit them and future generations. I was pleased to take
part in the beginning of an important conversation that must be
extended beyond Washington to communities across the country.
This past weekend, I had the pleasure of announcing the winners of the
Congressional Art Competition that featured artwork from high school
students in Missouri's Fourth Congressional District. The first prize
winner is Taylor Ellebracht of Boonville, who attends Boonville High
School, for her work titled, "Misty." The second place ribbon was
awarded to Megan Carpenter of Elkland for her art titled "Draped
American Flag." Third place honors went to Megan Schmeling of
Martinsburg for her artwork titled "Grampa's Farmall."
Congresswoman Hartzler joins Taylor Ellebracht in front of her first
prize entry, "Misty."
44 entries were submitted by some of our district's very talented young
artists. I'm sure it was no easy task for our judge to decide on the
three finalists and eventually choose the first place prize winner. I
congratulate Taylor Ellebracht who captured the first place ribbon
using colored pencil to provide the viewer with a beautiful close-up of
her family dog.
The winning entry will hang in the Capitol in Washington for one year
and will join artwork from other Congressional districts across the
country. Winners of the second and third place ribbons will have the
opportunity to display their artwork in the Fourth District offices in
Harrisonville and Columbia for visitors to enjoy over the next year.
Come by and see the great work!
I look forward to welcoming Taylor to Washington for the ceremony
unveiling winning entries from throughout the country. There were so
many superb contributions. I congratulate all of our district's
talented students who entered this contest.
Finally, young people from Girls Inc. visited Capitol Hill this week to
"shadow" Members of Congress and to learn a little more about what the
representatives of the people do when they are in Washington. My
"shadow" was Kyaria Glover of Brooklyn, New York.
Congresswoman Hartzler with her "shadow" Kyaria
I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Kyaria and wish her the best in
school and in life.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
House
passed
two
FY
2015
appropriations
bills
this
week
&#8211;
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Bill
and
the
Legislative
Branch
Appropriations
Bill.
The
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Bill
fulfills
our
moral
and
legal
obligation
to
our
veterans,
ensuring
they
have
quality
medical
care,
job
and
training
programs,
and
other
benefits
they
have
earned.
This
bill
increases
discretionary
spending
for
veterans
programs
by
$1.58
billion
above
last
year,
providing
$64.7
billion
for
our
country&#8217;s
veterans.
Additionally,
this
legislation
protects
active-duty
service
members
by
providing
$6.6
billion
for
construction
of
military
family
housing,
military
facilities,
DOD
education
facilities,
and
Guard
and
Reserve
facilities.
It
is
imperative
that
the
federal
government
provide
adequate
resources
for
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
that
it
stand
by
our
veterans
by
fully
embracing
the
belief
that
promises
made
must
be
promises
that
are
kept.
I
was
pleased
the
bill
invests
$45
million
to
address
a
number
of
important
veterans
issues,
especially
the
backlog
in
claims
and
allow
the
VA
to
continue
serving
6.7
million
patients.
It
is
unacceptable
for
veterans
to
have
to
wait
months
or
years
to
receive
a
determination
on
their
status.
We
must
conquer
this
tragedy.
Finally,
the
bill
requires
both
DOD
and
the
VA
to
implement
a
system
to
share
medical
data
in
a
timely
and
accurate
manner.
The
VA
will
be
held
accountable
by
restricting
funding
until
they
ensure
that
its
system
will
be
compatible
with
DOD&#8217;s
records.
Additionally,
funds
are
included
for
the
modernization
of
the
VA
electronic
health
record
system,
which
will
help
with
the
process
of
getting
veterans
the
designation
they
need.
The
Legislative
Branch
Appropriations
Bill
funds
Congress
and
the
agencies
that
support
Congress.
The
bill
maintains
the
FY
2014
funding
levels
for
the
House
&#8211;
holding
the
line
on
spending.
Members
of
Congress
are
asked
to
tighten
their
belts,
by
continuing
their
pay
freeze
that
has
been
in
place
since
2010.
In
fact,
overall
funding
for
the
House
has
been
reduced
by
14
percent
since
Republicans
gained
control
in
2011.
It
is
my
belief
that
because
hardworking
American
families
must
live
within
their
means,
Congress
must
do
the
same.
On
another
matter
this
week,
my
House
Budget
Committee
colleagues
and
I
discussed
the
fight
against
poverty
and
efforts
to
expand
economic
opportunity
for
all
Americans.
Clearly,
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
over
the
failed
policies
of
the
past.
The
status
quo
is
NOT
working
and
more
of
the
same
will
NOT
solve
any
problems.
It
is
imperative
that
we
learn
what
helps
enable
Americans
to
find
solutions
that
will
benefit
them
and
future
generations.
I
was
pleased
to
take
part
in
the
beginning
of
an
important
conversation
that
must
be
extended
beyond
Washington
to
communities
across
the
country.
This
past
weekend,
I
had
the
pleasure of
announcing
the
winners
of
the
Congressional
Art
Competition
that
featured
artwork
from
high
school
students
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District.
The
first
prize
winner
is
Taylor
Ellebracht
of
Boonville,
who
attends
Boonville
High
School,
for
her
work
titled,
&#8220;Misty.&#8221;
The
second
place
ribbon
was
awarded
to
Megan
Carpenter
of
Elkland
for
her
art
titled
&#8220;Draped
American
Flag.&#8221;
Third
place
honors
went
to
Megan
Schmeling
of
Martinsburg
for
her
artwork
titled
&#8220;Grampa&#8217;s
Farmall.&#8221;
Congresswoman
Hartzler
joins
Taylor
Ellebracht
in
front
of
her
first
prize
entry,
&#8220;Misty.&#8221;
44
entries
were
submitted
by
some
of
our
district&#8217;s
very
talented
young
artists.
I&#8217;m
sure
it
was
no
easy
task
for
our
judge
to
decide
on
the
three
finalists
and
eventually
choose
the
first
place
prize
winner.
I
congratulate
Taylor
Ellebracht
who
captured
the
first
place
ribbon
using
colored
pencil
to
provide
the
viewer
with
a
beautiful
close-up
of
her
family
dog.
The
winning
entry
will
hang
in
the
Capitol
in
Washington
for
one
year
and
will
join
artwork
from
other
Congressional
districts
across
the
country.
Winners
of
the
second
and
third
place
ribbons
will
have
the
opportunity
to
display
their
artwork
in
the
Fourth
District
offices
in
Harrisonville
and
Columbia
for
visitors
to
enjoy
over
the
next
year.
Come
by
and
see
the
great
work!
I
look
forward
to
welcoming
Taylor
to
Washington
for
the
ceremony
unveiling
winning
entries
from
throughout
the
country.
There
were
so
many
superb
contributions.
I
congratulate
all
of
our
district&#8217;s
talented
students
who
entered
this
contest.
Finally,
young
people
from
Girls
Inc.
visited
Capitol
Hill
this
week
to
&#8220;shadow&#8221;
Members
of
Congress
and
to
learn
a
little
more
about
what
the
representatives
of
the
people
do
when
they
are
in
Washington.
My
&#8220;shadow&#8221;
was
Kyaria
Glover
of
Brooklyn,
New
York.
Congresswoman
Hartzler
with
her
&#8220;shadow&#8221;
Kyaria
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
my

with
Kyaria
and
wish
her
the
best
in
school
and
in
life.
Have
a
great
week.
