More importantly, I look forward to hearing and discussing your ideas and suggestions.
Tonight - Tuesday, April 7
6:00 - 7:00 pm
Maurice L. Wolfe Elementary School
502 Addicks-Howell Rd.
Houston, TX 77079
The meeting will be held in the school's gymnasium; a map and directions to the school are available
online here .
Should you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to call my Houston office at (713) 682-8828.
I look forward to talking with you.
Sincerely,
John Culberson
