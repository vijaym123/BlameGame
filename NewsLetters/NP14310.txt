DISTRICT
Dear
Friend,
On Veterans Day we recognized with gratitude all
Americans who wear, and who have worn, the uniform of the United States
of America.
In particular, we honor the 3 rd
districts proud tradition of service to our country. We are home to
generations of veterans who have, without hesitation, answered our
countrys call and have returned, forever changed from their experience of
war, deeply committed to our countrys well-being.
I am
proud to carry with me the legacy of these brave men and women as I
serve in Congress; particularly in my service on the Armed Services
Committee, where I have dedicated my efforts to ensuring our troops have the
necessary resources to remain safe, efficient and
elite.
As co-chair of Massachusetts Military Asset and Security Strategy
Task Force, I am working alongside Governor Deval Patrick and former
Senator Mo Cowen
to support
Massachusetts military installations
and the men and women who make them so
vital to our armed services. This regions deep military tradition
coupled with the regions unique hub of technological excellence has
positioned us to play an important role in Americas military future
a
role that is garnering national attention.
In recent weeks
I have visited Natick Soldier Systems Center to see the cutting-edge
technologies they are developing to help protect our servicemembers.
Last week, on my invitation,
Air Force
Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh visited Hanscom Air Force Base and
MITs Lincoln Labs with me
to see their innovative work firsthand.
And this week Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno will visit
Massachusetts to learn more about the essential research and development
happening here to support the Army at places like Natick and Ft.
Devens.

visit
Here in Massachusetts were
utilizing our world-class academic institutions, advanced industry
partners, and two of the nations leading federally funded research and
development centers to explore and create the resources necessary for our
soldiers to return home safe and successful.
When they do
return home, America has made great strides to support the 22 million
veterans nationwide and the more than 370,000 right here in
Massachusetts.
But there is much
more to be done , especially when it comes to clearing avenues to
jobs and other vital resources that our veterans need to transition to
civilian life.
As our nation continues to draw down our
military involvement abroad and more American heroes return home, it is
more important than ever for there to be a strong support system for
military families. And, we thank the families of those who serve. Their
support, bravery, and patriotism make possible the personal sacrifice
that is at the heart of military service in a time of
war.
Please be sure to scroll down to read more information on some of
the other topics on which I have been working.
As always, I
hope that you continue to provide me with your thoughts, feedback,
and opinions on these or any other subjects via my
website
or on
Facebook
and

Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
AFGHAN WOMEN
On Tuesday,
October 29, 2013, the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations held a hearing regarding the protection of Afghan
womens rights in a post-U.S. withdrawal environment. I am the top
Democrat on the O&amp;I Subcommittee and requested this hearing to discuss
the militarys plan regarding Afghan womens rights. At the hearing, I
emphasized the need for recruitment and retention of women in some of
the most important avenues of Afghan society, and also questioned the
witnesses about spending and overseeing the reconstruction funding
that had been set aside for women and girls programming.

IBM TOUR
On November 1, I visited
IBMs Littleton campus to tour the facility and meet with company
officials. While there, I was updated on progress that has been made on
various projects since I last visited the facility in 2010. The
Littleton campus
best known for developing Watson, the computer featured on
Jeopardy!
has created career and technical education
program for its employees, and is a proponent of high-skilled immigration
reform.
VISIT TO
3 RD
GENERATION FITCHBURG BUSINESS
Last week I
visited Rocheleau Tool and Die Company in Fitchburg, a local company
founded in 1938 and is now owned and operated by the 3 rd
generation of Rocheleaus. The company has 38 employees in two locations,
both in Fitchburg. They manufacture blow molding machines that are used
to create a multitude of plastic bottles used in various
industries.
I have been a strong advocate for a Make it in America
agenda to help grow the domestic manufacturing base and promote policies
that keep jobs in the United States rather than having them sent
overseas.
