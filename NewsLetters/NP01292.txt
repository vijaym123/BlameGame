Forbes Receives Guardian of Seniors Rights Award
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) was awarded the Guardian of Seniors Rights Award by the 60 Plus Association for his dedicated efforts in support of seniors.
Seniors are the people who not only shaped us, they shaped our nation, said Congressman Forbes. They committed their lives to this country through years of working towards achieving the American Dream. I will continue to do all that I can to protect their peace-of-mind by working to preserve Social Security and Medicare, ensure they have continued access to the doctor theyve seen for years, and help make sure theyre not worried about leaving their children a tax bill instead of an inheritance.
Congressman Forbes recent work includes introducing legislation to preserve Social Security and Medicare, cosponsoring a bill to repeal the death tax, and championing tax reform as a critical link in the chain for seniors financial stability.
The 60 Plus Association is a 23-year old nonpartisan organization working for death tax repeal, saving Social Security and Medicare, affordable prescription drugs, lowering energy costs, and other issues featuring a limited government, fewer taxes approach, while adhering to the Constitution.
