Dear Friends,
This Thursday is Thanksgiving. By custom, many people around the country will be celebrating with their families, usually with a big meal.
But for millions and millions of Americans, there wont be enough to eat. During a holiday signified by abundance, they wont have enough food to put on the table.
In this country
the richest in the world
50 million people remain hungry. Close to 17 million of them are kids.
That is inexcusable to me.
There has already been a cut in SNAP this year, as a result of the ending of Recovery Act assistance. On average, families will receive an average of $1.40 per person per meal in 2014---and current Farm Bill proposals include massive deeper cuts. I believe such cuts are mean-spirited, and as a Farm Bill Conferee, I am fighting for a bill that ends hunger in America, rather than makes it worse. Ive given nearly 30 floor speeches this year on the need to End Hunger Now in America. You can see my latest, on the need to protect veterans at

There is another side to the Farm Bill that is just as concerning to me. Earlier this month, I held farmers roundtables in Massachusetts, talking to those who own and operate many of Massachusetts greatest agricultural assets. From meat to produce to seafood to grains, and everything in between, we have incredible resources in Massachusetts that are replicated throughout the nation. Our family farmers are the backbone of our countrys food security, and they need to be protected.
Simply put, we need a farm bill that allows family farmers to grow and helps the hungry.
This Thanksgiving, people will be thinking of those who may not have enough to eat, and about the family farmers who are working day in and out to provide good, healthy, nutritious food to our families.
Best wishes.
Sincerely,
Congressman Jim McGovern
