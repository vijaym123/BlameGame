Friend,
Have you heard the latest?
We just found out that the National Republicans named all three of our opponents to their Young Guns program.
That means that they&#39;ve officially committed to throwing everything they have at our race.
Even more, they&#39;re hedging their bets, promising big resources for whichever challenger makes it out of the primary. They don&#39;t care who wins the primary-- just that they have the opportunity to distort our record and send attacks our way.
This is trouble and we need your help. Thankfully, a generous supporter has agreed to match contributions to our Rapid Response Fund in order to help us push back.
Can you pitch in $5 now to have your contribution matched dollar for dollar?
It&#39;s early, but this is an aggressive move.
You can bet our opponents are going to leverage this decision by the Republican establishment in Washington. But as we know from last year, a strong, grassroots campaign can overcome big national money and outside players.
That&#39;s why one of our supporters has agreed to match contributions to our Rapid Response Fund through Monday.
The more folks we get involved now, the stronger we&#39;ll be next year, and this week is a real opportunity to raise the funds we&#39;ll need to fend off their attacks.
Help us build our Rapid Response Fund today and double your impact with our dollar for dollar match. Can you pitch in $5 or more right now?
Let&#39;s make sure that no matter which opponent they throw resources at, we have what we need to respond.
Thank you for coming through.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
It&#39;s not every day that we have a supporter agree to a dollar for dollar match.
Make an even greater impact-- please pitch in what you can today.
