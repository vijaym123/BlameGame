This is NOT the email we wanted to send you today.
Yesterday was our final ad buy deadline of the election. And we fell short.
As a result, we are making an emergency extension of the triple-match TODAY ONLY.
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying: we received over 4,5OO online donations for Cheri just in the past few days. That would&rsquo;ve smashed our original goal. But then, we received the news that Karl Rove was spending even MORE against us. There just wasn&rsquo;t enough time to make up the gap.
We need at least 1 donor from 60659 zip code to make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in this election. We're pleading. Can you step up right now? 1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: All Donations Today Triple-Matched!
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Team Bustos
