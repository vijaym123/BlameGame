Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you several updates during my work week in Washington, D.C.
USDA Funds for Roma and Rio Grande City
Congressman Henry Cuellar and USDA Rural Development Director Paco Valentin present a certificate to Riverview Supermarket in Roma, Texas, congratulating the owners for their successful renovation with the use of USDA Funds.
On Monday, I announced the completion of two projects funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with USDA Rural Development Director, Paco Valentin in Rio Grande City and Roma.
In Roma, I attended the unveiling of new equipment purchased for Riverview Supermarket through the USDA Rural Energy for America Loan and in Rio Grande City, I spoke at a ribbon cutting ceremony for the Casa de Adobe Restaurant, constructed through the USDA Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan.
Congressman Henry Cuellar and USDA Rural Development Director Paco Valentin participate in the ribbon cutting of Casa de Adobe restaurant in Rio Grande City, purchased and constructed with funds from USDA.
Starr County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop
Outreach Coordinators Nichole Hernandez and Pete Arguello helped facilitate the Starr County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop to provide residents with information about the new Health Insurance Marketplace.
Thank you to everyone who came out to the Starr County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop that my office hosted this past Saturday! Over 120 people attended and received free information about how to enroll in the new Health Insurance Marketplace, with assistance provided by local, certified organizations.
Thank You Laredo Custom Brokers' Association
Congressman Cuellar was
recently honored for his efforts to ensure trade and commerce move quickly and efficiently across the bridges in Laredo, Texas.
Thank you to the Laredo Custom Brokers Association for honoring me this week. Ensuring that trade and commerce move quickly across the bridges in Laredo is one of my top priorities. Laredo is the number one inland port along the U.S. - Mexico border and goods shipped through the city travel to more than 60 countries. It is vital that we continue to support the economic growth that efficient trade can provide.
Universal City Tree Lighting Ceremony
Outreach Coordinator Pete Arguello participated in the festivities of the 1st annual Universal City Tree Lighting Ceremony and helped spread some holiday cheer.
Last week, my Outreach Coordinator Pete Arguello participated in the 1st annual Universal City Tree Lighting Ceremony. The festivities included hot chocolate, story time, songs of the season from the Rose Garden Elementary Choir, and a visit from Santa for the children. The event was a great start to a yearly tradition that we hope to see every holiday season. Happy holidays!
Neighborhood Office Hours with Gilbert Lafuente
Outreach Coordinator Gilbert Lafuente met with Atascosa County Veterans Service Office Mike Lambraria and his staff (top), the owner of Art on Main in Pleasanton, Texas, and Pleasanton Fire Chief Chuck Garris to discuss constituent services that our office makes available for them.
Atascosa County Outreach Coordinator, Gilbert Lafuente, met with business owners and city officials during his neighborhood office hours this past week. As always, should you have any question or need help with a federal agency, my office welcomes your inquiry. Catch Mr. Lafuente the next time he is in Atascosa County!
U.S. Businesses Add 203,000 New Jobs in November
The U.S. Labor Department recently announced that job growth for the month of November exceeded experts' forecasts. In November,
American employers added 203,000 jobs and the rate of unemployment fell from 7.3% to 7.0%.
The economy has gained more than 2 million jobs so far this year, the most since January-November of 2005. Additionally, the average workweek (34.5 hours) and average hourly earnings ($24.15) slightly increased.
I invite you to read more about the economic growth last month here:
