Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you an outstanding opportunity for college students across the nation. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute is currently accepting applications for its 2014 Internship Program.
My personal experiences in the nation's Capitol as a young college student shaped my entire life and career.
The fully-paid internship program provides college students an outstanding work experience in our nations capitol, leadership development programs, and the opportunity to network with other young professionals.
Application Deadlines :

Interns may also be eligible to receive academic credit at their college or university for participating in the program. I strongly encourage interested students to apply and enhance their education outside of the classroom.

Sincerely,
Congressman Henry Cuellar
