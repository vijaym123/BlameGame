Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Going Back In Time
Last weekend, I was privileged to take part in a pair of historical
commemorations. I spoke (top photo) at the 150th anniversary of the
Charleston Riot between Union soldiers home on leave and those opposed
to the Civil War known as Copperheads. Joining me at Coles County
Fairgrounds were Abraham Lincoln impersonator Joe Woodard and
Charleston Mayor Larry Rennels, as well as Civil War reenactors and
Eastern Illinois University ROTC students.
I also attended the Mattoon Civil War Camp Grant Illinois State
Historical Society Commemorative Marker Dedication Ceremony with
Mattoon Mayor Tim Gover (far left in bottom photo), Illinois Army
National Guard Assistant Adjutant General Brig. Gen. Richard Hayes Jr.,
and (far right) Master of Ceremonies Steve Thompson.
Concealed Carry Permits Should Be Recognized Across State Lines
As other states recognize your right to drive with your Illinois
driver's license, an Illinois concealed carry permit should be treated
likewise. That is why I am cosponsoring the National Right-to-Carry
Reciprocity Act, H.R. 2959
. It is
pretty simple. If you can legally carry in Illinois - now that we have
finally started issuing concealed carry permits - you should be allowed
to carry in other states.
The other state's rules regarding when and where you can carry would
obviously have to be followed, but you wouldn't have to worry about
driving into Indiana or Kentucky or Missouri and instantly not being in
compliance with that state's law.
The bill does not establish a federal permit or registry or anything
similar. It simply says that one state's permit is good in another
state - just like your driver's license.
H.R. 2959, which is strongly supported by the National Rifle
Association, currently has 131 bipartisan cosponsors.
Legislation Would Strengthen Caller ID Spoofing Prohibition
I am also cosponsoring a bill that would expand the prohibition on
inaccurate caller identification. This practice is called "spoofing"
and attempts to trick call recipients.
Current law bans the practice of spoofing from calls originating in the
United States. The legislation that I am cosponsoring, H.R. 3670
, would
expand the ban on spoofing to calls originating outside the U.S. if the
recipient is within the U.S.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would regulate this through
spoofing service providers that permit caller identification to be
altered. Anti-spoofing definitions would also be expanded to include
text messages and IP voice services.
You should be able to rely on caller ID information to be accurate.
When it's not, you may inadvertently provide personal information to
identity thieves or other criminals pretending to represent someone
they are not.
Federal Government Should Stay Out Of School Curriculum Standards
President Obama's Administration has coerced states into Common Core
education standards by throwing money at them. Federal funds should not
be awarded based on the implementation of any national education
standard. The states - and especially local school districts - should
be determining the curriculum for students.
That is why I am supporting a resolution (H. Res. 476
) that
seeks the restoration and protection of state authority in establishing
student academic standards and assessments. The resolution, which is
not a legislative bill but does express the sense of the House, is
pending in the House Education and the Workforce Committee. It is
sponsored by Congressman Jeff Duncan (R, South Carolina-3), and I am
one of 67 cosponsors.
Subcommittees Seek Answers From EPA Administrator McCarthy
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy appeared
before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittees on Environment and
the Economy and Energy and Power on Wednesday to review the EPA's
Fiscal Year 2015 budget request.
I took the opportunity to question McCarthy about the agency's
implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and its
ability to review and regulate chemicals. I asked whether the ability
to prioritize chemicals would allow the agency to evaluate chemicals
more effectively.
Gina McCarthy
"I think it is important," said McCarthy. "TSCA provides us some
authority, certainty not to address the issue as robustly as we would
like . There has to be a better way for us to target our resources most
effectively to protect public health."
As chairman of the Environment and the Economy Subcommittee, I have
authored draft legislation, the Chemicals in Commerce Act
, which would reform the law to create a commonsense
prioritization and evaluation program for all existing chemicals in
commerce. I urged McCarthy to work with the committee on the
legislation, telling her, "We hope you share our ambition and sincere
desire to make this a collaborative process."
Energy and Power Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R, Kentucky-1)
pressed McCarthy on the potentially devastating cost and reliability
consequences of the agency's proposed greenhouse gas standards for new
power plants, which would require the use of carbon capture and storage
(CCS) technologies that are not yet commercially viable.
"Those people involved in the utility business tell us explicitly that
they can't build a new coal-fired power plant to meet these emissions
standards. And I think America is being jeopardized by this kind of
action," said Whitfield.

Going
Back
In
Time Last
weekend,
I
was
privileged
to
take
part
in
a
pair
of
historical
commemorations.
I
spoke (top

at
the
150th
anniversary
of
the
Charleston
Riot
between
Union
soldiers
home
on
leave
and
those
opposed

known
as
Copperheads.
Joining
me
at

County

were Abraham
Lincoln
impersonator
Joe
Woodard
and
Charleston
Mayor
Larry
Rennels,
as
well
as
Civil

and
Eastern

I
also

Tim
Gover

Concealed
Carry
Permits
Should
Be
Recognized
Across
State
Lines
As
other
states
recognize
your
right
to
drive
with
your
Illinois
driver's
license,
an
Illinois concealed
carry
permit
should
be
treated
likewise. That
is
why
I
am cosponsoring the
National
Right-to-Carry
Reciprocity
Act,
H.R.
2959 .
It is
pretty
simple.
If
you
can
legally
carry
in
Illinois
&#8211;
now
that
we
have
finally
started
issuing
concealed
carry
permits
&#8211;
you
should
be
allowed
to
carry
in
other
states.
The
other
state&#8217;s
rules
regarding
when
and
where
you
can
carry
would
obviously
have
to
be
followed,
but
you
wouldn&#8217;t
have
to
worry
about
driving
into
Indiana
or
Kentucky
or
Missouri
and
instantly
not
being
in
compliance
with
that
state&#8217;s
law.
The
bill
does
not
establish
a
federal
permit
or
registry
or
anything
similar.
It
simply
says
that
one
state&#8217;s
permit
is
good
in
another
state
&#8211; just
like your
driver&#8217;s
license.
H.R.
2959,
which
is
strongly
supported
by
the
National
Rifle
Association,
currently
has
131
bipartisan
cosponsors.
Legislation
Would
Strengthen
Caller
ID
Spoofing
Prohibition
I
am also
cosponsoring
a
bill that
would
expand
the
prohibition
on
inaccurate
caller
identification. This
practice
is
called
&#8220;spoofing&#8221;
and
attempts
to
trick
call
recipients.
Current
law
bans
the
practice
of
spoofing
from
calls
originating
in
the
United
States. The
legislation that
I
am
cosponsoring,
H.R.
3670 ,
would
expand
the
ban
on
spoofing
to
calls
originating
outside
the
U.S.
if
the
recipient
is
within
the
U.S.
The
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
would
regulate
this
through
spoofing
service
providers
that
permit
caller
identification
to
be
altered.
Anti-spoofing
definitions
would
also
be
expanded
to
include
text
messages
and
IP
voice
services.
You
should
be
able
to
rely
on
caller
ID
information
to
be
accurate. When
it&#8217;s
not,
you
may
inadvertently
provide
personal
information
to
identity
thieves
or
other
criminals
pretending
to
represent
someone
they
are
not.
Federal
Government
Should
Stay
Out
Of
School
Curriculum
Standards
President
Obama's Administration
has
coerced
states
into
Common
Core
education
standards by
throwing
money
at
them.
Federal
funds
should
not
be
awarded
based
on
the
implementation
of any national
education
standard.
The
states
&#8211; and
especially
local
school
districts
&#8211; should
be
determining
the
curriculum
for
students.
That
is
why
I
am supporting
a
resolution
( H.
Res.
476 )
that
seeks
the
restoration
and

of
state
authority
in

which
is

but
does
express
the
sense
of
the
House,
is
pending
in
the
House
Education
and
the
Workforce
Committee. It
is
sponsored
by
Congressman
Jeff
Duncan
(R, South
Carolina-3),
and
I
am

I
took
the

to
question
McCarthy
about
the

implementation
of
the
Toxic
Substances
Control

(TSCA)
and
its
ability

I
asked
whether
the
ability
to
prioritize
chemicals
would
allow
the
agency
to
evaluate
chemicals
more
effectively.
Gina
McCarthy &#8220;I
think
it
is
important,&#8221;
said
McCarthy.
&#8220;TSCA
provides
us
some

&#8230;

As

I
have authored

which
would

I urged

to
work
with
the

on
the

telling
her,
&#8220;We
hope
you

ambition
and

which
would

&#8220;Those

business
tell
us
explicitly
that
they
can&#8217;t
build
a

And
