MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now before the critical FEC deadline at midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
This literally just happened: A new Rasmussen poll shows that Democrats are LEADING the race for Congress, 40%-39%.
That means we can defeat the Government Shutdown Republicans!
You can bet Boehner is in all-out panic mode now. His aides just authorized a
$6 million advertising blitz
to smear our Democratic candidates.
But we&rsquo;re not going to let the Republicans spin their way out of this now. Since President Obama called on Democrats everywhere to fight back against Republican obstructionism, more than 85,OOO have stepped up!
David Johnson Answered President Obama's Call-to-Action? NO DONATION
If we can hit 1OO,OOO strong before tonight's big fundraising deadline, it would be another shocking setback for Boehner. Can you chip in today?
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
The evidence is clear: voters are fed up with Tea Party extremists. They&rsquo;re fed up with Republicans blocking everything President Obama proposes. And they&rsquo;re fed up with right-wing billionaires trying to buy our elections.
Now, we need to fight the attacks coming from the other side, get-out-the-vote, and pull off a big Democratic victory!
We need to get moving quickly -- can you chip in $5 or whatever you can before tomorrow&rsquo;s big fundraising deadline? http://action.dccc.org/Democratic-House
