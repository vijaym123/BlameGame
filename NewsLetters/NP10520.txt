Broun with WWII veteran Paul Izant
Earlier this month, Congressman Broun had the pleasure of aiding Athens veteran, Paul Izant, in obtaining medals earned for his service during WWII. Having never received any medals after discharge, Mr. Izant contacted Congressman Broun seeking assistance in receiving the WWII Victory Medal, but upon researching his record, it was found he was due more than the Victory Medal. For his honorable and faithful service to the U.S. Navy Reserves, Broun presented Mr. Izant with the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal (WWIIVM). Mr. Izant also received his Honorable Service Lapel Pin and Discharge Button.
