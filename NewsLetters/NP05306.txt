Greetings from the East Bay -
It has been a busy few weeks here in the East Bay. From welcoming Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer for a Make It In America event at THE GATE in San Leandro to welcoming Ambassador Deborah L. Birx, M.D. to see what our community is doing to fight HIV/AIDS.
Also, we are introducing a new section highlighting federal grants
recently received by East Bay communities and new grant opportunities.
Take a few minutes to see all that I have been working on.
