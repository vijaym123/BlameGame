Rep. Kinzinger hosts
manufacturing roundtables as part of skills-training
tour
Congressman Adam Kinzinger met in Rockford and Sycamore this week with
local business owners, manufacturers, and educators to discuss
improving workforce training in Illinois and around the country. The forums,
which are the first stops in a district-wide series on the issue, gave
Rep. Kinzinger the opportunity to hear directly from local
manufacturers on obstacles they face to growing their
businesses.

In
addition to hearing from local manufacturers, Rep. Kinzinger provided
updates on his efforts in Congress to improve federal skills-training
legislation. In April, Rep. Kinzinger introduced the Perkins
Modernization Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to tie skills being trained for
to job needs in the community. To read more about this legislation,

Kinzinger calls for VA Secretary's
resignation
On a Meet the Press roundtable Sunday, Rep. Kinzinger called for
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki to resign amid reports of VA
negligence and cover-ups. Whistleblowers this week revealed that
staffers at VA hospitals have been concealing and, in some cases, deleting
records of veterans having to wait long periods of time to receive
care. The wait times have already led to the deaths of 40 veterans
nationwide.

Kinzinger said:
"This has gone from an incompetence
and a backlog to something criminal, something where people are hiding
veterans' names, people are dying."
"I think it's time for
Shinseki to resign because we need to get... somebody there who knows
how to fix the problem."
Kinzinger, Rush send
bipartisan letter on improving drug addiction
treatment
This week, U.S. Representatives Adam Kinzinger (IL-16) and Bobby L. Rush
(IL-01) requested assistance from the Department of Justice
(DOJ) to address the alarming increase in opioid addictions
in Illinois and offer rehabilitation strategies. In a letter sent
to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which was signed by the entire
Illinois Congressional delegation, the lawmakers requested a
meeting to further discuss treatment methods that have been successful in
rehabilitating drug-related offenders in Illinois.
From
the letter: We are writing to you because the devastation of opioid
addiction in many of our communities throughout Illinois is rapidly
worsening with the recent spread of heroin use, and heroin-related
overdose deaths."
