WEEK IN
REVIEW
It was great to be
home in Arkansas this week to work in the
district.
On Monday, my day began with a tour of DaVita
Dialysis in Fayetteville, where I spent time with the clinics
patients and staff and joined them in celebrating National Kidney
Month.
I am grateful for your dedication to providing top-line renal care
to Arkansans.
Thank you for all you do!
Afterwards, I
headed to the Home Depot to meet Kevin Schiller, store manager, who
introduced me to his hard-working staff and walked me through the stores
daily operations.
Thanks to Kevin and the entire Home Depot team
for having me and for presenting me with my very own personalized apron.
I ended the day with a stop by the University of Arkansas to
visit with Chancellor Gearhart and my fellow Razorbacks
Woo Pig
Sooie!
On Wednesday, I had an eventful day in Fort
Smith.
Thanks to all who took the time to meet with me.
I
started the day off meeting with Arkansas Wing Civil Air Patrol Wing
Commander Colonel Doug Alexander and Vice Wing Commander Lieutenant
Colonel Harrell Clendenin.
Then I headed over to Rheems
manufacturing plant.
Rheem, an industry leader and global producer of
heating, cooling, and water products, has had a home in Arkansas since
1970 and employs over 1,000 in the River Valley.
Thank you for the
opportunity to learn about your companys quality products and
innovative services.
Afterwards, I stopped by
Trilennium and then headed over to Woods Elementary School.
Last year, four of Woods Elementarys teachers received awards for
statewide or national excellence in economic teaching.
Congratulations
to Woods Elementary, and especially Jenny Holland, Jennifer Howland,
Sheila Humphrey, and Kimberly Been for your achievements, and thank
you for having me.
I had a blast meeting your outstanding
students.
Dont miss the Times Records recap of my
visit!
My day in Fort Smith concluded with a stop by the Davis
Iron and Metal, a full service metal recycling company that focuses on
keeping the Natural State beautiful.
This morning, I hosted Coffee with the Congressman at Mercy Clinic in
Bella Vista.
Thank you to all those who attended; I enjoyed the
coffee and the company!
After the coffee, I made my way to Mary Mae Jones Elementary in
Bentonville, where I shared lunch with the students and learned about Mary Maes
mission of fostering the growth of their students in not only
literacy, mathematics, technology, and wellness, but also leadership and
greatness.
I was extremely impressed by your school and your
students, and I look forward to visiting again soon!
Today concluded
with a trip to see facility upgrades at Decision Point, which provides
high quality drug and alcohol treatment, intervention, education, and
prevention services in Northwest Arkansas.
Our community is
fortunate to have your facility and dedicated staff as a
resource.
Its a privilege to represent such a thriving
district and an honor to serve you.
Next week its back to
Washington, D.C., as Congress reconvenes.
I look forward to seeing all of
the families that will be visiting D.C. next
week.
