Celebrating Thanksgiving
November 28, 2012
Dear Friends,
I would like to wish you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving! During this holiday season we are able to spend time with family and friends that we cherish and love. As we sit down and give thanks for all our many blessings may we remember the service and sacrifice of our men and women in the military who may not be able to be with their family this holiday season.
As President John F. Kennedy once said, &ldquo;As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words. But to live by them.&rdquo;
During this season of Thanksgiving may we use our time, talents, and our treasure to serve our neighbors in need, show our appreciation for our troops, and to thank God for this great country. I hope that you have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday and upcoming Christmas season
and that you and your family and friends will have a blessed time together.
Sincerely,
U.S. Congressman Mike McIntyre
Representing the 7th District of North Carolina
