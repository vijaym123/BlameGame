Dear Friend:
Today I joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and 20 of our colleagues to introduce the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which would allow those with outstanding student loan debt to refinance at the lower interest rates currently offered to new borrowers.
It is outrageous that students can&rsquo;t refinance at these historically low interest rates.
This legislation gives students the same fair shot that other borrowers have to refinance and save money when interest rates decline.

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
