Wishing You a Happy Holiday Season
I want to wish everyone in North Carolina a joyful holiday season and a Happy New Year. For me, there is no better gift than the opportunity to be surrounded by my loved ones during these winter holidays. And this year is particularly special in the Hagan household, as it is our first holiday with a new addition &ndash; our first grandchild.
This season, I hope that each of you finds joy &ndash; whether it is gathering close to your family and friends, or by embracing the spirit of the season, as so many North Carolinians do, and giving back to our communities and neighbors in need.

This time of year is about gratitude. About taking a step back to reflect on our many blessings. And as North Carolinians, we have so much to be grateful for:
Our brave men and women in uniform who selflessly serve this great nation and protect the freedoms we hold dear.
Our world-renowned public universities and community colleges.
And our hardworking teachers and small business owners.
To those servicemembers who will spend the holidays away from your families, deployed overseas, know that the thoughts of the entire state, and the entire country, are with you, not just during the holidays, but every day you serve to protect us here at home.
Heading into 2014, I want you to know that I will continue to fight every single day for the people of North Carolina. I will continue working to promote job growth in our state and I will continue to do everything I can to support our brave men and women in uniform, our veterans and their families.
It is an honor to serve you, the people of North Carolina, and I extend my warmest wishes of the holiday season to you and your families.
Sincerely,
