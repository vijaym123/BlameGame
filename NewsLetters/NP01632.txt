Dear Friend,
Happy Easter! To
me, the holiday has always symbolized the start of spring, and
Northeast Georgia, after a cold winter, is looking forward to a warm one. I
hope this weekend has provided you and your family an opportunity to
experience the beautiful outdoors of our Ninth
District.
I'll soon be returning to Congress, after spending
valuable time with constituents. If I didn't see you during my trips to
local schools, businesses and community groups, please select from the
list below any issues that matter to you. I'll be sure to address one
in an upcoming newsletter, social media post or interview with your
favorite reporter.
Please select which issues matter most
to you: What Issues
Matter Most to You? Agriculture Budget &amp; Taxes Economy &amp; Jobs Energy Environment Gun
Rights Health
Care Immigration Medicare &amp; Social
Security National Security Pro-Life Veterans Other
