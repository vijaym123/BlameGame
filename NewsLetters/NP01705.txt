David,
This morning, Alex told me we could hit $100,000 online for the quarter. (I think she emailed you the same thing).
I won&rsquo;t lie, that REALLY got my hopes up. But to get there, we needed to raise $6,000 today and then $6,000 tomorrow too.
So far today, we only have $3,600 in the door. That&rsquo;s not
bad ... it&rsquo;s just not where we needed to be. Not to hit $100k at least. David, we can still do it, but we&rsquo;ve got to pick up the pace.
Will you chip in $5 (or more if you can) to help us close the gap before the filing period closes? It would mean so much to me! http://action.cheribustos.com/donate-here
Warmest personal regards,
