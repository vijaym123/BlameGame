Friend,
I want to wish everyone a Happy St. Patrick's Day and a Happy St.
Joseph's Day.
I'm looking forward to celebrating these two great
holidays by marching in the 58thAnnual Newport St. Patrick's Day Parade
and enjoying a zeppole.
It has been a busy week in Washington and I
want to share a few updates about the work I've been doing.
Join My Neighborhood Conversation
I would like to invite you to my upcoming "Neighborhood Conversation"
on Monday, March 17 at Hope High School in Providence from 5:30 p.m. to
7:00 p.m.
I hope you will be able to join me and be part of the
conversation.

Increasing Accountability of How Taxpayer Dollars are Spent
This week the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation called
the ENFORCE act to allow Congress to sue the Executive Branch whenever
they claim the Executive Branch has failed to enforce the law.
As part
of this bill, the House unanimously approved my amendment to the
ENFORCE Act to help ensure transparent accounting of taxpayer money
spent under this Republican sponsored legislation.
The ENFORCE Act, as
originally written, would have allowed a Congressional majority to sue
the Executive Branch, and even worse than that, provided no oversight,
safeguards, or accountability provisions to prevent abuse.
I offered
my amendment to make sure taxpayers at least know how their hard-earned
dollars are spent under this proposal.
I am pleased this safeguard was
included in this seriously misguided bill.
Continuing the Fight to Renew Unemployment Insurance
House Republicans continue to refuse to allow a vote on extending
unemployment insurance for the 2 million Americans, including over
8,300 Rhode Islanders, who have lost this vital safety net and we are
now trying to force them to bring a bill to the floor through a
"Discharge Petition." A "Discharge Petition" is a legislative procedure
to bring a bill to the House Floor for a vote, even over the objection
of the Speaker of the House, so long as a majority of members sign the
petition. Every week that goes by approximately 72,000 Americans lose
their unemployment benefits. Enough is enough! The time is now for
Congress to act to renew this critical support and I will keep fighting
until we do.
Standing with the People of Ukraine
On Tuesday night I joined my colleagues in sending a strong bipartisan
message condemning Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
Russia's military intrusion into the Crimean
Peninsula is a serious violation of international law and existing
obligations, and Russia should immediately withdraw its military
forces.
Last week, President Obama ordered sanctions on individuals
responsible for the military intervention in Ukraine, including travel
bans and freezing of their U.S. assets.
This was an important step and
we must continue to pursue all available economic and diplomatic
options to make clear to Russia that it must withdraw from the Crimean
Peninsula and respect the territorial borders of Ukraine.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov

Increasing
Accountability
of
How
Taxpayer

This
week
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
passed
legislation
called
the
ENFORCE
act
to
allow
Congress
to
sue
the
Executive
Branch
whenever
they
claim
the
Executive
Branch
has
failed
to
enforce
the
law.
As
part
of
this
bill,
the
House
unanimously
approved
my
amendment
to
the
ENFORCE
Act
to
help
ensure
transparent
accounting
of
taxpayer
money
spent
under
this
Republican
sponsored
legislation.
The
ENFORCE
Act,
as
originally
written,
would
have
allowed
a
Congressional
majority
to
sue
the
Executive
Branch,
and
even
worse
than
that,
provided
no
oversight,
safeguards,
or
accountability
provisions
to
prevent

I
offered
my
amendment
to
make
sure
taxpayers
at
least
know
how
their
hard-earned
dollars
are
spent
under
this
proposal.
I
am
pleased
this
safeguard
was
included
in
this
seriously
misguided
bill.
Continuing
the
Fight
to
Renew
Unemployment
Insurance
House
Republicans
continue
to
refuse
to
allow
a
vote
on
extending
unemployment
insurance
for
the
2
million
Americans,
including
over
8,300
Rhode
Islanders,
who
have
lost
this
vital
safety
net
and
we
are
now
trying
to
force
them
to
bring
a
bill
to
the
floor
through
a
&#8220;Discharge
Petition.&#8221;
A
&#8220;Discharge
Petition&#8221;
is
a
legislative
procedure
to
bring
a
bill
to
the
House
Floor
for
a
vote,
even
over
the
objection
of
the
Speaker
of
the
House,
so
long
as
a
majority
of
members
sign
the
petition.
Every
week
that
goes
by
approximately
72,000
Americans
lose
their
unemployment
benefits.
Enough
is
enough!
The
time
is
now
for
Congress
to
act
to
renew
this
critical
support
and
I
will
keep
fighting
until
we
do.

Russia&#8217;s

week,
President

the
military

in
Ukraine,

that
