Dear Friend,
We all know federal regulations are a part of daily life, and many
regulations have an important role to play in our society, especially
when it comes to safety. However, the amount of red tape coming out of
Washington is truly astonishing.
For example, in just the first 3 days of 2014, the federal government
had already listed 141 new regulations that were posted by federal
agencies. So it's no surprise to learn that in 2013 alone 80,224 pages
of regulations were added to the Federal Register.
Last year, the federal government imposed an additional $112 billion in
new regulatory costs and 157.9 million paperwork hours on Americans and
businesses. This not only hurts taxpayers and small business owners, it
directly contributes to slow economic growth.
This week, the House voted to fix a federal regulation that has caused
a tremendous amount of unnecessary harm. Currently, there is a federal
regulation to protect a 3-inch fish - the Delta smelt - which has led
to the diversion of hundreds of billions of gallons of water away from
farmers, cost thousands of farm workers their jobs, and led to
skyrocketing unemployment in several communities. This regulation has
led to a domino effect of unintended consequences and it's an example
of how Washington doesn't always know what is best for local
communities.
When we talk about creating an environment for economic growth,
reducing the amount of burdensome regulations is a good place to start.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
We
all
know
federal
regulations
are
a
part
of
daily
life,
and
many
regulations
have
an
important
role
to
play
in
our
society,
especially
when
it
comes
to
safety.
However,
the
amount
of
red
tape
coming
out
of
Washington
is
truly
astonishing.
For
example,
in
just
the
first
3
days
of
2014,
the
federal
government
had
already
listed
141
new
regulations
that
were
posted
by
federal
agencies.
So
it&#8217;s
no
surprise
to
learn
that
in
2013
alone
80,224
pages
of
regulations
were
added
to
the
Federal
Register.
Last
year,
the
federal
government
imposed
an
additional
$112
billion
in
new
regulatory
costs
and
157.9
million
paperwork
hours
on
Americans
and
businesses.
This
not
only
hurts
taxpayers
and
small
business
owners,
it
directly
contributes
to
slow
economic
growth.
This
week,
the
House
voted
to
fix
a
federal
regulation
that
has
caused
a
tremendous
amount
of
unnecessary
harm.
Currently,
there
is
a
federal
regulation
to
protect
a
3-inch
fish
-
the
Delta
smelt
-
which
has
led
to
the
diversion
of
hundreds
of
billions
of
gallons
of
water
away
from
farmers,
cost
thousands
of
farm
workers
their
jobs,
and
led
to
skyrocketing
unemployment
in
several
communities.
This
regulation
has
led
to
a
domino
effect
of
unintended
consequences
and
it&#8217;s
an
example
of
how
Washington
doesn&#8217;t
always
know
what
is
best
for
local
communities.
When
we
talk
about
creating
an
environment
for
economic
growth,
reducing
the
amount
of
burdensome
regulations
is
a
good
place
to
start.
