WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week was an
extremely busy one in our nations capital. Before Congress could
officially gavel out of the 113th Congress, we had to pass legislation to
provide funding for the federal government for the remainder of fiscal
year 2015.
As a proud
retiree of the Arkansas Army National Guard, I was honored to give
the keynote address at the 17th Annual National Guard Association of the
United States Industry Day on Tuesday!
It was great to see
General Grass and General Conaway there, as well as Lieutenant General Sid
Clarke, who was in Arkansas just last weekend to posthumously award
Master Sergeant "Bud" Wassom II the Airman's
Medal.
On Tuesday afternoon,
the
House passed
H.R. 5781 , the California Emergency
Drought Relief Act of 2014, by a vote of 230-182. H.R. 5781 is a temporary
bill aimed at addressing severe water shortages in California that
expires on September 30, 2016, allowing for limited storage of storm water
and provides regulatory flexibility to facilitate increased water
supply.
Notably, H.R. 5781 protects state water rights, does not
allow for redirected adverse impacts to third parties, and does not
preempt or modify any existing obligation of the U.S. under federal
reclamation law, including the Central Valley Project Improvement
Act.
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to record a holiday message
for our troops serving overseas. My heart breaks at the thought of even
one child or spouse having to spend the holidays without them. But I
am extremely grateful for their sacrifice and service, which makes it
possible for their loved ones
and for all Americans back home
to
celebrate the holidays in safety. Thank you!
That afternoon, the House passed
S. 2244 , the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Program Reauthorization Act of 2014, by a vote of 417-7. The bill
extends the authorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) of
2002 for six years until December 31, 2020, and phases in a new
program trigger for all certified acts of terrorism from $100 million to
$200 million by 2020.
The bill also requires the GAO to complete
a study on the feasibility and effects of the federal government
assessing and collecting premiums on participants in TRIA and of
establishing a capital reserve fund under TRIA that would require participants
to dedicate capital specifically for terrorism losses.
On Thursday, the House passed the
House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R.
83 , the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015,
by a vote of 219-206. The bill provides $1.013 trillion in
funding for 11 of 12 full Appropriations bills for fiscal year 2015 and a
continuing resolution (CR) that funds the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) through February 27, 2015. Notably, H.R. 83 abides by all
terms set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Ryan-Murray Agreement),
provides no new funding for Obamacare, protects life by maintaining a
ban on the use of federal funds for abortion, provides for the
nations security, protects jobs and reins in regulatory overreach, slashes
funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), advances our
energy priorities, upholds First Amendment rights by prohibiting the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from targeting groups based on ideology,
and increases oversight to ensure the responsible use of taxpayer
dollars.
The passage of
H.R. 83 shows the American people that we take seriously the
responsibility of governing
the responsibility just given to House and Senate
Republicans in November.
But its passage goes beyond simply
fulfilling our Constitutional duty to fund the federal government at the
lowest spending level in nearly a decade while strongly reflecting our
conservative values, slashing funding for the EPA and the IRS, and
reining in regulatory overreach.
Is it perfect?
No.
But
it does eliminate the threat of a government shutdown and sets us up
to directly challenge the Presidents unilateral actions on immigration
before they go into effect, when we have new majorities in both
chambers of Congress and the ability to fight
smarter.
Finally, on
Thursday evening the House took its last vote of
the
113th
Congress and
passed H.R. 5699, the John Muir National Historic Site Expansion Act.
This vote marked my 1,205th consecutive roll-call vote during the 113th
Congress and 2,813th consecutive roll-call votes during my tenure in
Congress, maintaining my perfect voting record as a Member of Congress
and the longest continuous voting streak among my colleagues in the
House. Third District Arkansans entrusted me with the responsibility to
represent them in the U.S. House of Representatives
that means
showing up to vote. I take this job very seriously and am not only humbled
by my constituents trust, but also by the good fortunes of health and
circumstance with which Ive been blessed that have allowed me to
maintain a perfect attendance record.
As we wrap up this first week of a new Congress and a
new year, I am reminded of how truly grateful I am to continue to work
on behalf of the Third District as a member of the United States House
of Representatives. America faces many challenges today, and, during
the 114th Congress, I will remain committed to passing real reforms to
reduce the size, scope, and spending of our government and to bringing
the spirit of our Districts rich history of entrepreneurialism and
private-sector economic growth to
Washington.
From the
Front...
