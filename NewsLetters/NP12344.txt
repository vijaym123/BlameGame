Dear
Friend--
I have good news on our efforts to fix flood insurance! As of today,
our bill has the support of a majority of the House of
Representatives. Thats's right, more than 228 Members of Congress have signed up as
a cosponsor of H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability
Act. With only 218 votes needed to pass a bill in the House of
Representatives, this level of support means that if we can get a vote on our
bill, we could pass a real fix for flood
insurance.
We need your help to make sure the House of Representatives acts
before flood insurance premiums cause more damage to our communities. I
invite you to sign on today as a citizen cosponsor of this legislation so
that your voice is heard.

Insurance Affordability Act
Flood
insurance premium increases have sent shockwaves throughout Louisiana.
I
hope you continue to lend your voice as we seek a sustainable,
long-term solution that will allow people to buy and sell homes without
premium spikes.
This effort transcends party affiliation
and reaches down to the core of our purpose in Congress, which is to
pass legislation that protects our constituents.
Please join us in
this fight for a commonsense solution.
Feel free to share with your friends and family so
that they can stay up to date on my efforts regarding flood
insurance.
