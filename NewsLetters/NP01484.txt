reverberate
across the state. A lot of the media coverage blames farmers for the crisis without even mentioning the environmental regulations that have been decimating the Central Valley water supply for decades. I offer a corrective to the medias reporting
in a new article
here , and I argue my points in a Fox News report
here . And in case you missed it, you can see my comments on the House floor last year on the water crisis by clicking on the picture below:
