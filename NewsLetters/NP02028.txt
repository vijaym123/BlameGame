Congressman
Bruce Poliquin
Representing
the 2nd District
March 20, 2015
Repealing
ObamaCares Independent Payment Advisory Board : Recently,
Congressman Bruce Poliquin proudly became an original cosponsor
of H.R. 1190, Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015. This bill
will repeal ObamaCares Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).
The power to adjust Medicare spending, which will affect our seniors
health care, should go through the appropriate channels in Congress, not
from fifteen unelected bureaucrats. Mainers need and deserve a
government that works for them, not against them.

Maines Second District at the
Table : On Tuesday, Congressman Poliquin spoke at the Republican
leadership press conference in regards to balancing the federal budget
and the balanced budget constitutional amendment. More jobs, more
opportunities, more freedoms and better lives. Thats what Republicans
are all about and thats our vision.
Congressman Poliquin Gets the SEC on the
Record : On Tuesday, the House Financial Services
Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises held a
hearing entitled, Oversight of the SECs Division of Enforcement with
Director Andrew Ceresney.
Congressman Poliquin on WVOM :
The President has
never had a private sector job. He has never run a company before. We need
to get our spending and debt under control. We need to lower our
taxes. We need to take care of our energy costs. Then we are going to
start putting in place the pieces we need for job creators to have the
confidence to expand their business, create new businesses to hire more
people and that gets us in the path that we
need.
This Weekend :
This weekend, Congressman Poliquin will be in Maine attending meetings
throughout the district in Penobscot, Oxford, and Androscoggin
Counties. He is especially looking forward to the Maine Marine Trouble
Shooting Competition and the Maine Maple Sugar Sunday event in Turner.
Enjoy the weekend!
