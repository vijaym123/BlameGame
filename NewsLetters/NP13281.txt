Friends,
Happy New Year! I hope that you had a great holiday season and that you
were able to spend time with family. The New Year provides a great time
to reflect on the blessings of the past year and look forward to the
opportunities of the next year with renewed vigor.
As we begin the new year, I wanted to share with you five major items
that you will want to follow in 2014.
1. ObamaCare Oversight
There is no doubt that the rollout of ObamaCare has been an utter
failure. You knew it was bad when PolitiFact, a leading fact-checking
blog, named President Obama's "If you like your health plan, you can
keep your health plan" as the 2013 "Lie of the Year."
Don't forget that President Obama
originally sold this law as a way to help middle class Americans get
more affordable health insurance. But the exact opposite is happening,
as many middle class families are being forced out of plans they liked
into new ones with higher costs and fewer choices.
With more mandates and taxes coming down the pike, 2014 will be a
crucial time to expose what a flawed and damaging law ObamaCare truly
is. I am particularly concerned about the effect on small businesses
and their employees, as provisions affecting them go into effect. In
the House of Representatives, oversight of the Executive Branch's
actions in regard to ObamaCare will be a top priority.
Perhaps most importantly, 2014 will provide an opportunity to present
alternatives to ObamaCare that can actually lower costs and improve
access to quality healthcare. I look forward to working with my
colleagues to develop and advance proposals that offer Americans a
patient-centered healthcare system that isn't run by the government.
2. How Washington Operates with a Budget
With a budget agreement in place, Congress will return to operating
under set spending levels. This is really important, and let me tell
you why: For the first time
in three years, Congress will reclaim the
true "power of the purse" and the check on the Executive Branch that
comes with it. Because the government had been operating on temporary
spending bills based on previous years allocations, Congress had
surrendered its Constitutional authority to oversee executive agency
spending. Now, by returning to regular order, we regain the authority
to appropriate funds based on smart budgeting principles and exercise
oversight of the whole range of federal spending.
In 2014, it will be important for the House majority to utilize this
authority to bring unprecedented accountability to the Obama
Administration. In my new role on the House Committee on
Appropriations, I will be closely examining budget requests, past
spending decisions, and agency activities to ensure the taxpayers'
money is spent wisely. I firmly believe we must reduce overall federal
spending levels to finally get our debt under control. Getting domestic
spending back down to Bush-era levels in this budget agreement is
certainly a good start. But, it's not enough just to reduce spending. I
also believe we need to make sure government activities and expenses
are truly justifiable.
3. Farm Bill
For three years we've been working on a new Farm Bill that would meet
this country's agricultural and economic needs, while enacting
important reforms to farm and food stamp policy. I'm pleased that the
process may finally come to a conclusion in 2014. This Farm Bill has
been a top legislative priority for me because it is important to the
people of Alabama's Second Congressional District and the state of
Alabama, where agriculture is the number one industry.
Alabamians also recognize that any new Farm Bill must to contain the
kind of reforms that show Congress is serious about changing the
culture of spending and government dependence. We need regional equity
that allows the same opportunity and protections for all types of
commodities, not just those in certain states. And it is time to
consolidate duplicative programs administered by the USDA. As you know,
I have long-advocated smart reforms to the food stamp program that help
lift up those who have hit bottom, not keep them there. 2014 will be a
make or break year for passing a new Farm Bill, and I hope that we can
do right by our nation's farmers and get it done.
4. Future of our Military
2014 will be a challenging year for our military. Abroad, our troops
and commanders will face heightened threats as conflicts in Afghanistan
and Iraq come to an end. At home, budget cuts are still having an
effect on military readiness. We were able to restore some but not all
the sequestration budget cuts to the military, more than $30 billion in
total.
Going forward in 2014, I expect some important discussions to take
place about the future of Army aviation, which will certainly affect
Fort Rucker. My staff and I will also be closely monitoring the
Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission as they
evaluate possible changes to military compensation and benefits.
Despite my move to the Appropriations Committee, I will remain highly
engaged on military issues and continue looking out for Maxwell-Gunter
Air Force Base and Fort Rucker.
5. Dealing with our Nation's Debt
It is expected that we will run up against the debt limit in early
March, but that date may change. As I said back in October, the debt
debate is the appropriate place to advocate for reforms to mandatory
spending programs. Washington's addiction to spending is a serious
problem, and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is
exactly the wrong approach. I have pointed out for years the threat
mandatory spending poses to our military and other national funding
priorities like education, agriculture and transportation. I am
optimistic that this year's debt debate will offer a real chance to
begin making reforms to mandatory spending programs and return fiscal
sanity to Washington.

you

Happy
New
Year!
I
hope
that
you
had
a
great
holiday
season
and
that
you
were
able
to
spend
time
with
family.
The
New
Year
provides
a
great
time
to
reflect
on
the
blessings
of
the
past
year
and
look
forward
to
the
opportunities
of
the
next
year
with
renewed
vigor.
As
we
begin
the
new
year,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
five
major
items
that
you
will
want
to
follow
in
2014.
1.
ObamaCare
Oversight
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
rollout
of
ObamaCare
has
been
an
utter
failure.
You
knew
it
was
bad
when
PolitiFact,
a
leading
fact-checking
blog,
named
President
Obama's
"If
you
like
your
health
plan,
you
can
keep
your
health
plan"
as
the
2013
"Lie
of
the
Year."
Don't
forget
that
President
Obama
originally
sold
this
law
as
a
way
to
help
middle
class
Americans
get
more
affordable
health
insurance.
But
the
exact
opposite
is
happening,
as
many
middle
class
families
are
being
forced
out
of
plans
they
liked
into
new
ones
with
higher
costs
and
fewer
choices.
With
more
mandates
and
taxes
coming
down
the
pike,
2014
will
be
a
crucial
time
to
expose
what
a
flawed
and
damaging
law
ObamaCare
truly
is.
I
am
particularly
concerned
about
the
effect
on
small
businesses
and
their
employees,
as
provisions
affecting
them
go
into
effect.
In
the
House
of
Representatives,
oversight
of
the
Executive
Branch's
actions
in
regard
to
ObamaCare
will
be
a
top
priority.
Perhaps
most
importantly,
2014
will
provide
an
opportunity
to
present
alternatives
to
ObamaCare
that
can
actually
lower
costs
and
improve
access
to
quality
healthcare.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
develop
and
advance
proposals
that
offer
Americans
a
patient-centered
healthcare
system
that
isn't
run
by
the
government.
2.
How
Washington
Operates
with
a
Budget
With
a
budget
agreement
in
place,
Congress
will
return
to
operating
under
set
spending
levels.
This
is
really
important,
and
let
me
tell
you
why:
For
the
first
time
in
three
years,
Congress
will
reclaim
the
true
"power
of
the
purse"
and
the
check
on
the
Executive
Branch
that
comes
with
it.
Because
the
government
had
been
operating
on
temporary
spending
bills
based
on
previous
years
allocations,
Congress
had
surrendered
its
Constitutional
authority
to
oversee
executive
agency
spending.
Now,
by
returning
to
regular
order,
we
regain
the
authority
to
appropriate
funds
based
on
smart
budgeting
principles
and
exercise
oversight
of
the
whole
range
of
federal
spending.
In
2014,
it
will
be
important
for
the
House
majority
to
utilize
this
authority
to
bring
unprecedented
accountability
to
the
Obama
Administration.
In
my
new
role
on
the
House
Committee
on
Appropriations,
I
will
be
closely
examining
budget
requests,
past
spending
decisions,
and
agency
activities
to
ensure
the
taxpayers'
money
is
spent
wisely.
I
firmly
believe
we
must
reduce
overall
federal
spending
levels
to
finally
get
our
debt
under
control.
Getting
domestic
spending
back
down
to
Bush-era
levels
in
this
budget
agreement
is
certainly
a
good
start.
But,
it's
not
enough
just
to
reduce
spending.
I
also
believe
we
need
to
make
sure
government
activities
and
expenses
are
truly
justifiable.
3.
Farm
Bill
For
three
years
we&#8217;ve
been
working
on
a
new
Farm
Bill
that
would
meet
this
country&#8217;s
agricultural
and
economic
needs,
while
enacting
important
reforms
to
farm
and
food
stamp
policy.
I&#8217;m
pleased
that
the
process
may
finally
come
to
a
conclusion
in
2014.
This
Farm
Bill
has
been
a
top
legislative
priority
for
me
because
it
is
important
to
the
people
of
Alabama&#8217;s
Second
Congressional
District
and
the
state
of
Alabama,
where
agriculture
is
the
number
one
industry.
Alabamians
also
recognize
that
any
new
Farm
Bill
must
to
contain
the
kind
of
reforms
that
show
Congress
is
serious
about
changing
the
culture
of
spending
and
government
dependence.
We
need
regional
equity
that
allows
the
same
opportunity
and
protections
for
all
types
of
commodities,
not
just
those
in
certain
states. And
it
is
time
to
consolidate
duplicative
programs
administered
by
the
USDA.
As
you
know,
I
have
long-advocated
smart
reforms
to
the
food
stamp
program
that
help
lift
up
those
who
have
hit
bottom,
not
keep
them
there.
2014
will
be
a
make
or
break
year
for
passing
a
new
Farm
Bill,
and
I
hope
that
we
can
do
right
by
our
nation&#8217;s
farmers
and
get
it
done.
4.
Future
of
our
Military
2014
will
be
a
challenging
year
for
our
military.
Abroad,
our
troops
and
commanders
will
face
heightened
threats
as
conflicts
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
come
to
an
end.
At
home,
budget
cuts
are
still
having
an
effect
on
military
readiness.
We
were
able
to
restore
some
but
not
all
the
sequestration
budget
cuts
to
the
military,
more
than
$30
billion
in
total.
Going
forward
in
2014,
I
expect
some
important
discussions
to
take
place
about
the
future
of
Army
aviation,
which
will
certainly
affect
Fort
Rucker.
My
staff
and
I
will
also
be
closely
monitoring
the
Military
Compensation
and
Retirement
Modernization
Commission
as
they
evaluate
possible
changes
to
military
compensation
and
benefits.
Despite
my
move
to
the
Appropriations
Committee,
I
will
remain
highly
engaged
on
military
issues
and
continue
looking
out
for
Maxwell-Gunter
Air
Force
Base
and
Fort
Rucker.
5.
Dealing
with
our
Nation&#8217;s
Debt
It
is
expected
that
we
will
run
up
against
the
debt
limit
in
early
March,
but
that
date
may
change.
As
I
said
back
in
October,
the
debt
debate
is
the
appropriate
place
to
advocate
for
reforms
to
mandatory
spending
programs.
Washington&#8217;s
addiction
to
spending
is
a
serious
problem,
and
piling
on
more
debt
while
ignoring
the
spending
problem
is
exactly
the
wrong
approach.
I
have
pointed
out
for
years
the
threat
mandatory
spending
poses
to
our
military
and
other
national
funding
priorities
like
education,
agriculture
and
transportation. I
am
optimistic
that
this
year&#8217;s
debt
debate
will
offer
a
real
chance
to
begin
making
reforms
to
mandatory
spending
programs
and
return
fiscal
sanity
to
Washington.
Stay

As
we
begin
the
new
year,
I
hope
that
you
will
continue
to
reach
out
to
my

views
on
important
federal
issues
and
let
