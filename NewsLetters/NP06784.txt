Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s the end of August, and that means two things:
1. There are
only 66 days
until the election.
2.
We need your help to reach our $55,000 goal for August. Can you get us $5 closer?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Republicans have opened offices here in Massachusetts. They&rsquo;re going to run hard every single day from now until November. We can&rsquo;t take anything for granted.
I&rsquo;m going to fight them tooth-and-nail in the Senate, because their policies are terrible for the middle class. But I need your help to hit this goal so our campaign team can do what it needs to do. Please, if you can, consider pitching in $5, $10, or whatever makes sense to you. It&rsquo;s crucial that we hit our $55,000 goal, and every little bit helps.
Thank you.
