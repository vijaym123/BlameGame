Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
Today, I would like to provide you with some updates from my work week in Washington, D.C.
SA to DC Delegates in Washington
Congressman Cuellar speaks in front of the SA to DC delegation about important issues such as comprehensive immigration reform and appropriations.
On February 4th, I had the pleasure to address the annual SA to DC Chamber of Commerce Delegation on the need for immigration reform. It is important for us to keep the lines of communication open between business and government and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak directly with San Antonio business leaders again this year.
My Visit with San Antonio Students at Georgetown University
Congressman Cuellar and two Georgetown students, Carmen Hernandez and Silvia Hernandez from San Antonio, talk about the young ladies' future plans and how they want to make an impact in their community.
On Friday, I spent the morning with two bright young Georgetown students from San Antonio. I'm always delighted to see the great talent the young people from our district have. These ladies are preparing themselves through education for the bright future they have ahead.
Chili Cook-off celebrates Starr County's thriving local industry
Starr County outreach coordinator, Nichole Hernandez, had the opportunity to be a judge for the delicious cook-off and discuss services with constituents.
This weekend, my outreach coordinator for Starr County, Nichole Hernandez, served as a judge in the 6th Annual Chili Cook Off. Not only did she sample delicious chili, but it was a great opportunity to support local business and industry in Starr County. It was tough to select the winners for each category but, the 14 judges worked diligently to make the right choices. At the end, the winners were presented with a belt buckle and earned bragging rights.
Congratulations to all who participated and we look forward to next year!
Commissioner Roy Pea is Recognized
Congressman Cuellar's staff recognizes
Commissioner Raul "Roy" Pea with a
Congressional Certificate.
This weekend, my office presented a Congressional Certificate of Recognition to Starr County Precinct 2 Commissioner Raul Roy Pea for his commitment to community of Starr County.
Commissioner Pea worked to acquire 29.5 acres of land to use as a county cemetery that will benefit locals in Roma, Escobares and the surrounding areas.
Thank you for your service, Commissioner Pea!
A Step Closer to Immigration Reform
Immigration reform is about jobs and the economy, national security, and fostering entrepreneurship. Study after study has shown that commonsense comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen the economy, spur innovation, reduce the deficit, and increase U.S. trade and exports.
Last week, the House Republican Leadership announced its support for pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and for legalization for the 11-12 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the shadows of illegal status.
I am glad to see the House GOP Leadership finally heed the calls that Democrats have been making for years
fix our broken system for the sake of our economy.
Meeting with CBP and GSA Officers
Congressman Cuellar's staff meets with CBP and GSA officers to discuss improvements that will be made to the international bridges in Laredo.

On February 5th, my outreach coordinator from the Laredo office, Jorge Garcia, met with officials from the General Services Administration (GSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials to discuss improvements that will be made to the bridges in Laredo.
As part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, Laredo received $62 million to update and modernize our international bridges.
The funds will ensure that CBP has the personnel and tools to protect our border, keep lines short, and move goods and people efficiently.
