District
On Thursday, the House
passed legislation, H.R. 2954, that includes a bill and an amendment
that I introduced to aid Idahos agriculture
community.
The bill that I introduced, the
Grazing
Improvement Act ,
would provide relief to Idahos ranchers
and ranchers throughout the country.
Specifically, it would extend
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service livestock grazing
permits from 10 years to 20 years to give producers adequate longevity
and production stability.
This is a very important
issue because the financial security of ranchers depends upon their
responsible stewardship of the land.
Unfortunately, the permit
review process - which allows them to produce food - has become severely
backlogged.
Thats where my bill comes in.
It will allow
our ranchers to cut through red tape faster and make our economy
stronger.
The amendment that I introduced
which passed as part
of H.R. 2954
undertakes another common-sense reform that will benefit
Idaho.
It requires groups that are not substantially justified
or directly affected by final federal grazing decisions to pay for the
legal expenses of the other party when they lose in court.
This
loser pays system is a much-needed reform to discourage frivolous
lawsuits by environmental groups.
These groups have grown
increasingly effective at abusing the appeals process - not to promote
environmental health, which is what they claim to do, but to remove
livestock from federal lands.
Each year, hundreds of appeals
are filed on grazing decisions by environmental groups.
While the
cost to ranchers can hardly be measured, in a recent case in Wyoming,
for example, appealing the decision cost a small group of ranchers
over $125,000 in administrative appeal and attorney fees alone.
What my amendment did is tackle this problem by clarifying the intent of
Congress on who may appeal and litigate a final agency
decision.
It will ease the burden environmentalists have placed on our
ranchers, and not a moment too soon.

Idaho produces some of the worlds finest lamb and beef. And
livestock grazing is an important part of the rich ranching tradition
in America.
I am proud to fight for Idahos ag community,
especially when those traditions are under attack.
I will keep
fighting so that we can
preserve our heritage for generations to
come.
