Dear
Friends:
Thank you for taking the time to read my December
e-newsletter.
AEROSPACE JOBS FOR ALABAMA
A big effort
is underway to attract more aerospace jobs to Alabama and to preserve
existing jobs.
Technology-related jobs are good-paying and
provide a strong foundation for our regional and state economy.
With
the full Alabama congressional delegation, I have endorsed an
initiative to bring a new Boeing line to our state.
At the same time,
there are opportunities for growth at our existing companies.
Birmingham has a hidden gem in the Kaiser Aircraft complex and
I joined a group of company executives and local leaders in
a meeting there this week
to discuss ways to
preserve
existing jobs
and bring more aerospace and defense work to
our area.

MORE PROBLEMS
WITH OBAMACARE
Thanks to all of you who wrote to me
in response to last month's e-newsletter and shared your frustrations
with Obamacare.
Your stories will help me further advance the
case that Obamacare is fundamentally flawed, as evidenced by the
Administration's continued policy shifts, and should be replaced.
We are now learning that even volunteer fire
departments could face expensive mandates under the law.
The
potential cutbacks in emergency response that might result are
unacceptable to me and I have cosponsored legislation to remove the
threat.
THE BUDGET AGREEMENT
While the
recent budget agreement does not contain the major entitlement reforms
that I believe are necessary to put us on a fiscally sustainable path, it
will help Congress to get away from "legislating by crisis."
When Congress rushes or passes midnight legislation in response to a
perceived deadline, it often makes its biggest mistakes.
Now there
needs to be a shared commitment to working through the regular
legislative process to set priorities and achieve the structural spending and
entitlement reforms required to bring the budget into
balance.
HOUSE PASSES BILL TO PROMOTE INNOVATION AND
JOBS
Abusive patent litigation is a costly and growing issue
for businesses in Alabama and throughout the country.
By a strong bipartisan majority, the House has passed a bill
to address this problem and, in the process, enable entrepreneurs and
small businesses to more fully focus attention on developing new
products and services and creating jobs.
As one of the eleven
lead sponsors of the
The Innovation Act , I was pleased to
support this legislation to curb frivolous and abusive lawsuits. The
bill included an amendment I offered to discourage threatening and
evasive litigation practices used by so-called "patent trolls" against
legitimate inventors and entrepreneurs.
Companion legislation will be
taken up by the Senate.
RELEASE PASTOR
ABEDINI
The Iranian government is continuing to imprison
Pastor Saeed Abedini, an Iranian-American minister, for his Christian
beliefs.
Pastor Abedini has been treated brutally without the
slightest pretense of due process.
In a letter with many colleagues, I
have called on the Administration to make the release of Pastor
Abedini not just an urgent U.S. cause but an international priority as
well.
WARM GREETINGS TO OUR
TROOPS
It was an honor, on behalf of the people of the Sixth District, to
record a holiday message for our troops that will be aired worldwide on
the Armed Forces Network.
In my message, I noted that - during
this time of year especially - our thoughts and prayers are with our men
and women in uniform and we wish for comfort and peace for their
supportive families.
Greetings to our troops from the
Capitol
A HOLIDAY GIFT FROM TALENTED STUDENTS
My wife Linda and I have again been privileged to honor a
talented and inspirational group of young people who bring a special
joy to the holidays.
Since 1993, the artwork for our
annual Christmas card has been created by local students with visual
impairments.
Students who participated in this year's Holiday Card
Call for Art, including cover artist Christopher Thorn of Hueytown High
School, were recognized at the Hoover Public Library this past
Monday.
You can view pictures from the reception by going to the
Facebook page in
my media center.
