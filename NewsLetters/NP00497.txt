Dear Friends,
This week I had the opportunity to
listen to Naghmeh Abedini testify in front of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee about her husband, Pastor Saeed Abedini, who is being
detained in Iran.
Though not a member of the committee myself, I was
invited to say a few words at the hearing and show my support for the
Abedini family.
As I listened to Naghmeh address the members
of the committee
the third time she has testified before Congress
I was touched by her strength, love and concern for her husband.
The last several years have been trying for this family.
In
2012, her husband was arrested and charged with intentionally undermining
the national security of Iran by gathering with other Christians in
private homes.
In 2013 he was sentenced to eight years in
prison.
In addition to hearing testimony about the Americans being
detained in Iran, the committee also unanimously passed a resolution
that I am co-sponsoring, H. Res. 233.
The resolution expresses
the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran should release all
detained United States citizens immediately and provide any
information it possesses regarding any United States citizens that have
disappeared within its borders.
I have urged President Obama
and continue to do so
to advocate for the release of Pastor Saeed as
he negotiates with the Iranian government.
I believe the
president should take all necessary and appropriate steps to secure his
release, even going as far as ceasing any and all negotiations with Iran
until our citizens are released.
If the Iranian government desires
to engage in constructive interaction with the world, it should
release Pastor Saeed.
In the meantime, I will continue to
pray for the release of Pastor Saeed and the other Americans being held
prisoner in Iran.
