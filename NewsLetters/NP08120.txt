Friends,
This coming week, I'm inviting all area veterans and their loved ones to join me for a series of Veterans Forums &amp; Resource Fairs. I look forward to hosting this event with local partners such as Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and the American Red Cross.
As a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a member of the Mississippi National Guard, one of my top priorities is ensuring South Mississippi veterans receive the best service possible. Yet we continue to learn how our veterans have been subjected to careless and shameful treatment at the hands of the very government they fought to protect.
During these Veterans Forums, I'll provide updates on my efforts to address these issues and provide local veterans with a venue to report their concerns and questions. Attendees will also have an opportunity to plug in with valuable community partners who provide a range of services to local veterans.
