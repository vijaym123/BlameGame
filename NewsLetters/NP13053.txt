2014 Federal Issues
Survey
Thanks in advance for taking the
time to participate in our 2014 New Year Survey.
I look forward to
hearing your views and getting a glimpse of resident sentiment in
Macomb and Oakland counties.
Individual letters, emails, phone
calls, Facebook posts, as well as more general responses to these survey
questions, help me do my job representing you in
Congress.
The first order of business for
Congress in 2014 is the federal emergency unemployment insurance program
which expired on December 28th. This cut-off left 1.3 million
job-seeking Americans without unemployment insurance while they look for work.
As each week goes by an additional 72,000 unemployed workers are not
able to access the program.
Do you support re-starting the federal
emergency unemployment insurance program? Yes No For you and your family, is the economic picture the same as a year
ago, better, or worse? About the same Better Worse None of the
