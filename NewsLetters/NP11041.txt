Dear Friends,
Last April, the nation saw terror strike on Boylston Street, and since
then we have all witnessed the resilience and strength of the Boston
community.
Over the past year, the Homeland Security Committee has
investigated how this could have happened, and what can be done to
prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.
This bipartisan
report, which can be found here
, focuses on how evidence of the alleged bombers' intent to
carry out a terrorist act were shared between local, state, and federal
agencies, and how in certain tragic instances, critical opportunities
were overlooked.
Following through on the report's recommendations is
critical to fixing serious gaps in our counterterrorism efforts. I
spoke about the report on Fox News with Bill Hemmer, you can watch the
clip below.

On Friday I was in Los Angeles to chair a field hearing of the Homeland
Security Committee focused on the tragic shooting that occurred at Los
Angeles International Airport (LAX) last November that resulted in the
death of a TSA agent and injured several other people.
Although the airport police are to be commended for
their response, apprehending the shooter within minutes, there are
lessons to be learned from this tragedy.
On that day, there was no
backup for a malfunctioning emergency phone located at the checkpoint
and emergency communications need to be improved between airport
police, local, state, and federal law enforcement.
I am encouraged
that TSA Administrator John Pistole has conducted a full review of
airports across the country and has implemented changes to security so
further tragedies can be avoided.
This week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed, and I
supported, H.R. 4278, the Ukraine Support Act
. This act provides
assistance to the Ukranian government and mandates sanctions against
Russian officials and oligarchs complicit in the violation of Ukraine's
sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Putin's violation of
international law in Ukraine cannot go unchecked and I hope the Senate
will approve the measure and send it to the president for his
signature.
