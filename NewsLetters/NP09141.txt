Highlights in the Legislative Program
Transitional worker program extended for five years
U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez has extended the Commonwealth-only (CW) transitional worker program in the Northern Mariana Islands for another five years. The CW worker program will now end in 2019 rather than this year. Both Governor Inos and I had urged the Secretary to make this decision. In letters to us this week Perez said the extension would enable CNMIs legitimate businesses to meet their current and near-term future workforce needs. It also gives more time to convert our workforce to U.S. workers. The Commonwealth has already reduced dependence on foreign employees from 22,417, when federal immigration began, to 10,017 in fiscal 2013. At the same time we have increased the minimum wage to $5.55 per hour. It goes up again in September to $6.05 and will hit the U.S. minimum of $7.25 in 2018. Our economy is also growing again . But we have more to do. The law still requires the number of CW workers to go down each year and reach zero by 2019. That means training and hiring more U.S. workers. In his letter Secretary Perez asked for yearly progress reports on this from the Commonwealth. His request mirrors language in my legislation, H.R. 2200,
and its Senate counterpart, S. 1237 . Both bills require the Commonwealth to be more accountable for the $150 fee paid by employers for each CW worker they hire. In 2013 the Commonwealth received $1.4 million in fees, which it distributed to local schools; but we need to make sure that money translates directly into skilled local workers who get jobs in our economy.

Resources committee okays extension of three immigration policies
Thursday, the House Natural Resources Committee
agreed to keep three policies in place that are designed to minimize economic harm to the Northern Marianas during the transition to federal immigration. By unanimous consent the Committee approved my bill, H.R. 4296 , extending the policies through 2019. All three were part of the original Consolidated Natural Resources Act, Public Law 110-229 , which mandated the transition. One, the Commonwealth-only (E-2C) foreign investor program, grants status to 261 individuals who obtained investor status under Commonwealth immigration law with a minimum investment of $50,000. The second, a bar on claims of political asylum from within the Northern Marianas, helps make possible the entry of tourists from China and Russia, who now account for 28 percent of all visitors to the NMI. The third, exemption of the Northern Marianas and Guam from the nationwide cap on the number of H visas, was originally meant to meet the demand for temporary construction workers during the build up of U.S. military forces in the Marianas. The delay in the buildup requires an extension of the exemption. The three programs would all end on December 31, 2014 without congressional action. I very much appreciate Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings and Dr. John Fleming, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs, who moved my bill from introduction to approval in just nine weeks. The House Judiciary Committee must now act on H.R. 4296 before it can be taken before the House of Representatives for a vote. Then the Senate must approve the bill.

FY15 appropriations progressing slowly
The fiscal 2015 appropriations process continued to inch forward this week. We highlight the legislative action and various funding decisions important to the Northern Mariana Islands:
*
The House of Representatives passed the fiscal 2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, H.R. 4660 . The majority approved a floor amendment, barring funding for the National Ocean Policy, which, I believe, will harm our efforts to sustain the health of our oceans. An amendment to cut all funds for the Legal Services Corporation was, fortunately, defeated, though funding was still cut $15 million below last year. In the Northern Marianas, Micronesian Legal Services Corporation provides free legal assistance in civil matters for those who could not otherwise afford to pursue justice.
*
At the Committee level House Appropriations approved the 2015 Agriculture spending bill. It includes $12.148 million for the Northern Marianas nutrition assistance program. The bill also directs the Department of Agriculture to complete its study of adding the Northern Marianas to the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as required under the recently enacted Agricultural Act of 2014. The study is budgeted at $1 million for 2014 and 2015 with an additional $30.5 million to increase food stamp benefits beginning as early as October 2015.
*
The Appropriations Committee also approved the FY15 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development bill with transit formula grants funded at $8.6 billion, the same as the FY14 level at which the Commonwealth received $812,806 in formula grant aid.

Natural Resources votes to reauthorize Magnuson-Stevens Act
In a 24-17 vote, the House Natural Resources approved H.R.4742 , amending and reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act through 2018. I support the reauthorization of this landmark law, which has done much to restore sustainable and profitable fisheries throughout our nation. And I welcomed amendments to existing law that would improve data collection and make the regional fishery management councils more accountable by requiring them to broadcast meetings and make documents available to the public on their websites. But in the end I voted against H.R. 4742. It included too many amendments that would reverse years of progress. One amendment, for instance, provided additional flexibility in setting the time for rebuilding overfished stocks. Flexibility in this case is just a code word for delay; and delay only harms commercial and subsistence fishers, who rely on having healthy stocks today for their livelihood.

NMI eligible for low-interest loans to improve healthcare facilities
The USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Program is now accepting applications for low-interest loans to help improve health clinics and other healthcare facilities in rural areas and towns of up to 20,000 in population. The Northern Marianas is an eligible area. Loans may be used to construct, expand, or improve health care facilities, as well as purchase equipment. The program was authorized in the recently enacted Agricultural Act of 2014. For more information contact Bernadette J.U. Balajadia, Community Programs Specialist at (671) 300-8561 or email: bernadette.balajadia@pb.usda.gov

$1 million awarded for solar power in the Northern Marianas
The Office of Insular Affairs in the Department of the Interior has awarded two Empowering Insular Communities grants to the Northern Mariana Islands for installation of solar electricity systems. One grant of $560,000 goes to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation for a photovoltaic system at the hospital. The other, for $440,000, goes to the CNMI Public School System, which plans to install a solar array on the roof of Marianas High School. Congress appropriates funding for the Empowering Insular Communities program in order to lower the cost of electricity in the Northern Marianas and other insular areas. At the same time, the conversion to renewable solar power lowers greenhouse gas emissions, helping address climate change, a growing threat to island communities worldwide. Congratulations to CHCC and PSS.
