Dear Friend:

Attacking and abducting young women simply for going to school is despicable and must never be tolerated. The international community must make clear that all children deserve the chance to pursue an education without fear and that those responsible for these heinous crimes will be held accountable.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
