Dear Friend,
70 years ago today, thousands of American troops alongside our allies
courageously stormed the beaches of Normandy in the face of
extraordinary danger to establish the first foothold in Europe that
would pave the way to a world free of Nazi oppression.
Today we honor
those that did not return home and laid down their lives in defense of
liberty and freedom, and I was honored to take part in the 70th
Anniversary ceremonies in Normandy alongside President Obama, French
President Francois Hollande, and other foreign heads of state to pay
tribute to these American heroes and all the allied forces who gave
their lives to restore democracy and freedom throughout Europe and the
world.
On this solemn and important occasion we also reaffirm our obligations
to our brave men and women in uniform who are today safeguarding our
national interests all over the world.
While they have never asked for
anything in return for their service, they deserve to know that we will
uphold our promise and responsibility to them to meet their needs when
they return home.
These men and women who wear the uniform and protect the freedoms we
enjoy today also deserve to know that our alliances with England and
France are stronger than ever and that we will stand in solidarity with
our allies as we did in World War II to overcome any effort to
undermine our freedoms.
My best always,
David Cicilline

Dear
Friend,
70
years
ago
today,
thousands
of
American
troops
alongside
our
allies
courageously
stormed
the
beaches
of
Normandy
in
the
face
of
extraordinary
danger
to
establish
the
first
foothold
in
Europe
that
would
pave
the
way
to
a
world
free
of
Nazi
oppression.
Today
we
honor
those
that
did
not
return
home
and
laid
down
their
lives
in
defense
of
liberty
and
freedom,
and
I was
honored
to
take
part
in
the
70 th
Anniversary
ceremonies
in
Normandy
alongside
President
Obama,
French
President
Francois
Hollande,
and
other
foreign
heads
of
state
to
pay
tribute
to
these
American
heroes
and
all
the
allied
forces
who
gave
their
lives
to
restore
democracy
and
freedom
throughout
Europe
and
the
world.
On
this
solemn
and
important
occasion
we
also
reaffirm
our
obligations
to
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
are
today
safeguarding
our
national
interests
all
over
the
world.
While
they
have
never
asked
for
anything
in
return
for
their
service,
they
deserve
to
know
that
we
will
uphold
our
promise
and
responsibility
to
them
to
meet
their
needs
when
they
return
home.
These
men
and
women
who
wear
the
uniform
and
protect
the
freedoms
we
enjoy
today
also
deserve
to
know
that
our
alliances
with
England
and
France
are
stronger
than
ever
and
that
we
will
stand
in
solidarity
with
our
allies
as
we
did
in
World
War
II
to
overcome
any
effort
to
undermine
our
freedoms.

best
always,
David
