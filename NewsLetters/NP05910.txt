&ldquo;And yet control of the Senate still very much matters, just not for the most obvious reasons. It matters for climate policy and the Affordable Care Act, among other big issues.&rdquo;

Dear Friend,
I&rsquo;ve been writing to you for a while about the Republicans&rsquo; quest to take over the Senate this fall.
A recent piece in the
New York Times
explains why the Senate still matters, even in an age of ideological gridlock.
We&rsquo;re facing serious challenges, including a changing climate. The Republicans are the party of climate change denial, and if they take over the Senate, we&rsquo;ll have a Congress whose official policy on climate change is that it doesn&rsquo;t exist. We simply can&rsquo;t afford that kind of inaction. Republicans only need to pick up six seats to flip the Senate, and we can&rsquo;t let Massachusetts be one of them -- give $5 before the FEC deadline and help us keep fighting.

The
Times
article brings up a host of other issues that would remain unaddressed if the Republicans take the Senate -- Supreme Court nominees, the Affordable Care Act, and so on. But the piece also looks to &ldquo;the future,&rdquo; a world in which President Obama&rsquo;s terms are over and a new President is in the White House.
If Republicans pick up the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016, it could spell disaster for progressive priorities -- for generations to come. That&rsquo;s why this year&rsquo;s Senate elections matter -- and that&rsquo;s why projections like the
Times &rsquo; 57% chance of a Republican takeover are so alarming. If the Republicans want to win in Massachusetts, they&rsquo;d better be ready for a fight. Give our campaign the resources we need to win -- chip in $5 and help us reach our goal.
Thanks,
Ed
