Dear Friend,
This past November, President Obama
announced sweeping executive action on
immigration. Under his plan, five million
unauthorized immigrants would be granted
work permits and temporary reprieve from
deportation. Any unilateral action on
immigration will not lead to the
comprehensive reform that our broken
immigration system needs. President Obama
himself has stated more than 20 times that
he lacks the authority to change our
nations immigration laws. Many
living in Ohios 16
th
District couldnt agree
more.
That is why this past week, the House of
Representatives voted to block President
Obamas executive action by offering
five amendments to the FY 2015 Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations
bill, a bill that provides funding for DHS,
which has jurisdiction over our
nations immigration laws. These
amendments will completely defund the
presidents executive overreach.
The first provision prevents any funds
from being used to implement the
presidents executive order that he
announced this past November. Further, it
prevents the use of funds to carry out the
implementation of the Morton
Memos that were issued by former
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
director John Morton in 2011 and 2012,
which effectively prevent certain classes
of unlawful immigrants from removal from
the country. It also prevents funds from
being used to enforce similar policies and
prevents undocumented immigrants from
receiving any taxpayer-funded benefits. The
second amendment states that no funds may
be used to consider new, renewal, or
previously denied Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) applications. The
third amendment prioritizes the deportation
of sex offenders and those convicted of
domestic violence. The fourth amendment
ensures that the interests of unlawful
immigrants are not put ahead of those who
have gone through the system lawfully. The
final amendment protects the jobs of
hardworking Americans. Lastly, this bill
includes funding for the E-Verify program,
which is used to verify legal status of
newly hired employees and utilized by more
than 500,000 businesses on a voluntary
basis.
Our Founders outlined a
separation of powers for a reason. It is
Congress responsibility to make the
laws, not the presidents. Our action
this past week upholds our Constitution by
blocking the presidents overreaching
executive action. By passing legislation
before DHS deadline, we make sure
that DHS is responsibly funded and
operational to continue protecting
Americans at home and abroad.
This past August, the House acted to
address the crisis at our southern border
by providing President Obama with the
necessary resources to enforce our current
laws and strengthen border security. Over
the past few years, the House Judiciary
Committee has held several hearings on
immigration and has already passed several
bills that are key to reforming immigration
policy.However, we have much work
ahead of us. I strongly urge President
Obama to make good on his word and work
with the new Congress to reform our
immigration system.
