Honoring our
veterans
Though our nation's veterans deserve our
deepest gratitude every day, we have the opportunity to publicly honor
them tomorrow. On Veterans Day, we recognize that the sacrifices our
veterans and their families have made to defend our nation cannot be
overstated. I deeply thank each of our veterans in the 11th District and
across the country who have put service before self in protecting the
freedoms we hold dear.
If you like your health care plan, you
should
keep
it
Click here to watch a video about the promise President Obama could not
keep .
As Obamacares implementation barrels
forward, families across North Carolina are forced to shoulder its
destructive consequences. According to the North Carolina Department of
Insurance, 183,821 policies across the state have already been terminated,
impacting 473,724 hardworking North
Carolinians.
President Obamas promise that "if you like
your health care plan, youll be able to keep your health care plan" is
ringing hollow to the hundreds of thousands of Americans receiving
insurance cancellation notices in the
mail.
Numbers like these reflect why I am proud to be a co-sponsor of
H.R. 3350, the
Keep Your Health Plan Act , which the House of
Representatives plans to consider next week. To remedy President
Obama's broken promise, this bill grandfathers health care policies issued
as of January 1, 2013. If you like your health care plan, you
should
keep it. I will continue working with my House colleagues to
protect Western North Carolinians from the harmful impacts of
Obamacare.
Finding
solutions to President Obama's broken
promises
President Obama told Congress he would be willing to negotiate on
aspects of Obamacare once the debt ceiling was off the table. Will that be
another broken promise?

about President Obama's top five broken promises and five areas where his
health care law should be amended to ease the burden on the American
people.
Share
your Obamacare story
Our office receives
calls, letters, and emails on a daily basis from constituents who are
losing the health care coverage they were told they could keep and
suffering unafforadble increases in their premiums.
