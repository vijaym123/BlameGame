The Scalise Capitol Report
TUNE IN TO FOX NEWS SUNDAY TOMORROW
Ill be joining Chris Wallace on the Fox News Channel tomorrow to discuss our battle to block President Obama's illegal executive actions on amnesty while also funding the Department of Homeland Security. I'll also discuss Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's address before a joint session of Congress next week. Tune in to Fox 8 Live at 9 a.m. CST or Fox News Channel at 1 p.m. CST to watch.
Not Giving Up On The Keystone XL Pipeline
President Obama turned his back on millions of Americans who wanted the Keystone Pipeline to be built, along with the more than 40,000 jobs and energy security that goes with it, when he vetoed this bipartisan bill. The American people deserve better than this from the president, who bowed to the demands of a small group of environmental extremists rather than standing with hard-working taxpayers. Even though more than 2,350 days have passed since Keystone's application was first submitted to the State Department, the House will not give up. We will continue to fight to get the Keystone Pipeline built, as well as so many other priorities of the American people.
Leading the Opposition Against a Government Takeover of the Internet
The same federal government that tried to "fix" health care with Obamacare is now trying to "fix" the Internet with heavy-handed rules which are based on 1930s-era utility style regulations. This vote by three unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is a gross overreach of the federal governments power. The Internet has been such a great success for innovation and job creation. We dont need the federal government to "fix" what is not broken with outdated regulations that will slow the growth of the Internet and interject heavy-handed federal government control. Im extremely disappointed that the FCC bowed to political pressure from the White House and came to a decision that will produce years of lawsuits and uncertainty, and jeopardize the free and open Internet that has revolutionized our every day lives and the American economy. I stand ready to lead the opposition against the FCCs partisan decision and to work with my colleagues to defeat it.
Reforming the FCC
With the FCC taking actions to regulate the Internet, Congress must reign in and reform this power hungry agency. That is why I am proud the House voted 411-0 to pass H.R. 734, my bill to reform the FCCs outdated reporting mandates and make the agency more efficient for hard-working taxpayers. This legislation will bring the processes of the FCC into the 21st century and help it operate in a manner consistent with the innovative era in which we live. This long overdue reform is a crucial step in streamlining the way the FCC does business, including the elimination of the long-outdated telegraph report.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
