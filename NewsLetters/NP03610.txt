Greetings,
Like me, it's probably not too
often that you find yourself agreeing
with President Obama. So it's
understandable that some conservatives
met last week's announcement that the
United States would begin the process of
normalizing relations with Cuba with a
healthy dose of skepticism.
However, if like me, you are a
conservative who believes that U.S.
foreign policy ought to embody American
ideals such as freedom, democracy, and
free enterprise; you may be surprised to
learn that there is actually much to like
about the proposal. With that in mind,
I'd like to share my recent
Daily Caller
op-ed making the
conservative case for a new Cuba
policy.
The Conservative Case for a New Cuba
Policy
By U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake
Daily Caller
Dec. 22, 2014
Since the U.S. first implemented
a policy of isolation against Cuba over
50 years ago, its been enforced
and defended by Republican and Democratic
presidents alike. Its not an issue
that breaks neatly along party lines. In
fact, when President Obama announced
plans last week to ease trade and travel
restrictions with Cuba, Senator Robert
Menendez (D-NJ), usually a fervent
supporter of the president, was among the
harshest critics of the move. Senator
Rand Paul (R-KY), hardly a fan of this
administration, said he agreed with the
policy change.
I too dont find myself agreeing
with President Obama often, particularly
on foreign policy, but he was right to
begin the process of normalizing
relations with Cuba. For conservatives,
there is much to recommend about this new
way to address Cuba.
First and foremost, for over 50
years the policy of isolating Cuba has
failed to achieve any democratic reforms.
It has, however, succeeded in giving the
Castros a convenient excuse for the
failures of socialism. While there may
have been a compelling case for the
embargo during the height of the Cold
War, those arguments clearly no longer
apply.
Easing trade and travel should
not be viewed as a concession or reward
to the Castro regime. I believe that
its actually a true get
tough policy. Its been no
accident that in the past a warming in
U.S. posture has been met with Cuban
provocation. The Castros know that while
increased contact with the U.S. may have
a positive impact on their economy, it
comes at a cost. The islands
fledgling private sector strengthened by
these changes will pose a greater
challenge to any future tightening the
regime may seek to pursue. Far from
rewarding the Cuban government, we are
saddling them with entrepreneurs who will
soon wield real economic power.
And when I joke that a get
tough policy with the Castros
would be forcing them deal with Spring
Break, Im only half joking. Sure,
some Americans will simply travel to Cuba
for sunshine and mojitos, but many will
have more lasting intentions
and
they will bring with them flash drives,
cell phones, books, and other items that
we may take for granted but the Castros
know will erode the control that they
currently maintain over the
island.
This is, fundamentally, an issue
of freedom. U.S. trade and travel
restrictions with Cuba arent
restrictions on Cubans
they are
restrictions on Americans. Ive
long said if a government is going to
tell its citizens where they can and
cant travel, it ought to be a
communist country, not the greatest
country in the world.
Theres an added benefit
for conservatives when we allow Americans
to travel freely. We have a veritable
museum of the failures of socialism just
90 miles from our shores. Every American
ought to see what happens when government
controls not just the commanding heights
of the economy, but all aspects of
society. It isnt pretty, and it
makes on better appreciate the freedoms
we often take for granted.
U.S. foreign policy ought to
embody American ideals
freedom,
democracy, and free enterprise. By
isolating Cuba weve ignored the
power of those ideals. After 50 years,
its time for a change.
