Listen, there&rsquo;s no good way to say this.
This morning, we found out ex-Congressman Doug Ose outraised us over the past three months.
Now, if it just came down to grassroots support, we&rsquo;d win hands down.
But Ose loaned himself over $7OO,OOO, proving once again he&rsquo;ll spend anything to buy a seat in Congress.
Luckily, we don&rsquo;t have to match Ose dollar-for-dollar -- we just have to keep it close, and have enough resources to get the facts out to voters.
If you can, pitch in a few dollars to help us set the record straight.
