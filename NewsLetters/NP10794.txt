Dear friend,
This week has been a busy one in Central New York and in Washington.
Today I joined New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and
local and state officials to hold a press conference regarding
smartphone theft prevention. Smartphone thefts are on the rise in
Central New York and in communities across the country, endangering
people and costing consumers more than $30 billion a year. According to
the FCC, more than one in three thefts today involves cell phones, and
some of these crimes involve serious physical injury to victims.
H.R. 4065, the Smartphone Theft Prevention Act, would deter smartphone
thefts by creating an emergency 'kill switch' that ensures stolen
devices won't have value on the black market. I'm proud to be a
cosponsor of this common sense legislation, and I was honored to stand
with Attorney General Schneiderman and bring attention to this issue.

I also joined U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today at Filtertech in
Manlius for a roundtable with local economic development leaders and
Fred Hochberg, the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. Filtertech
employs 60 people to produce industrial coolant filtration systems and
process water filtration systems. The Export-Import Bank can be an
effective partner in assisting Central New York businesses like
Filtertech in their efforts to increase exports to markets across the
world. In 2008, the Bank helped Filtertech expand their exports by
providing $2 million in financing for a project in Italy that generated
more than $5 million in revenue. Our roundtable focused on ways other
businesses in Central New York can work with the Export-Import Bank to
improve their exporting potential and grow.

When the House was in session earlier this week, I voted against the
Fiscal Year 2015 House Republican Budget, also known as the Ryan
Budget. I also delivered a speech on the House floor in opposition to
the Ryan Budget. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle need to
get serious about balancing the budget and reducing the national debt
and deficit, but not on the backs of our seniors and middle class
families. Unfortunately, this year's Ryan Budget is more of the same
recklessness and extreme partisanship we have seen year after year from
House Republican leadership. This plan ends the Medicare guarantee as
we know it, cuts critical investments in infrastructure and education,
and forces middle class families in Central New York to pay an average
of $2,000 more each year in taxes. This is not the balanced and
responsible solution we need to get our fiscal house in order and grow
the economy. To see a video of my floor speech, click here

As always, it is an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of
Representatives. I will continue to keep you updated on our progress,
and encourage you to contact my office to share your thoughts and
concerns.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
friend,
This
week
has
been
a
busy
one
in
Central
New
York
and
in
Washington.
Today
I
joined
New
York
State
Attorney
General
Eric
Schneiderman
and
local
and
state
officials
to
hold
a
press
conference
regarding
smartphone
theft
prevention.
Smartphone
thefts
are
on
the

in
Central
New

and
in
communities
across
the
country,
endangering
people
and
costing
consumers
more

$30

a
year.
According
to

more
than
one
in
three
thefts
today
involves
cell
phones,
and
some
of
these
crimes
involve
serious
physical
injury
to

H.R.

When
the
House
was
in
session
earlier
this
week,
I
voted
against
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
House
Republican
Budget,
also
known
as
the
Ryan
Budget.
I
also
delivered
a

on
the

opposition
to
the

Members
of

on
both

to
get

about
balancing
the
budget
and
reducing
the
national
debt

deficit,
but
not
on
the
backs
of
our
seniors
and
middle
class
families.
Unfortunately,
this
year&#8217;s
Ryan
Budget
is
more
of
the
same
recklessness
and
extreme
partisanship
we
have
seen
year
after
year
from
House
Republican
leadership.
This
plan
ends
the
Medicare
guarantee
as
we
know
it,
cuts
critical
investments
in
infrastructure
and
education,
and
forces
middle
class
families
in
Central
New
York
to
pay
an
average
of
$2,000
more
each
year
in
taxes.
This
is
not
the
balanced
and
responsible
solution
we
need
to
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
and
grow
the
economy.
