It&rsquo;s been a
rough
few days:
-- first, Karl Rove launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting Cheri.
-- then, Boehner piled on with a $1 MILLION assault against Illinois Democrats.
But today, things got even worse:
--
we learned the Kochs donated the
maximum legal amount
to Bobby Schilling.
David, there&rsquo;s no time to lose.
We can get back on track -- and hand the Republicans an excruciating defeat -- but only if we hit our ad buy goal before midnight tomorrow.
Will you chip in $5 or $10 to help close the gap? Every dollar matters.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for not backing down,
