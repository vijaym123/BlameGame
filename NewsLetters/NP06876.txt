I need you to bear with me, David. This will only take a second: We&rsquo;re getting badly outspent by Karl Rove and his corporate allies right now.
Without a surge of grassroots support before the fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;ll be in deep trouble.
I know the last thing you want to read is another email asking for money. But this is a make-or-break moment for us.
The only way to stand up to Rove's cash is for thousands of us to stand together and fight back. I don't need you to hand over your life's savings -- but I do need you to chip in $5 (or more if you can).
Right now, we still need 25 supporters to step up from the 60659 zip code.
ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
We need to keep our noses to the grindstone and not give one inch from now until November 4th. And we count on supporters like you to help make that happen.
Thank you,
Nancy
