A Wake-Up Call for the Department of
Veterans Affairs
Last week, I questioned Department of
Veterans Affairs Sec. Shinseki on recent
allegations that patients died while
waiting for treatment at VA hospitals, and
asked him what immediate changes will be
made to finally restore long-overdue
accountability, transparency, and
confidence in the VA system. VA has
struggled with wait times for health care
for many years, and its extremely
disappointing that the Department has
repeatedly failed to address the
problem. Clearly this problem has
gone on for far too long. It is
unfortunate that these leadership failures
have dramatically shaken many
veterans confidence in the
system. We have come to the point
where we need more than good
intentions--what we need from leadership at
the Department of Veterans Affairs now is
decisive action to restore veterans
confidence in VA, and to change these
system-wide, years long problems. I
will continue to monitor progress on this
issue to ensure that our nations
heroes are getting the care and services
they deserve.

Extreme, Unconstitutional Abortion Ban
Bill is Going Nowhere
I was sad to have to once again take to
the Senate floor to remind my Republican
colleagues that extreme attacks on
womens health are going
nowhere. Last week, Senator Lindsey
Graham from South Carolina attempted to
pass a bill that not only undermines
womens access to their doctors, but
restricts their rights to access
reproductive health services.
Id like to think that 41 years after
Roe v. Wade was decided, weve moved
on from debating this issue. It is
settled law. We are simply not going
to take away a womans ability to
make her own decisions about her own health
care and her own body. I hope that my
Republican colleagues will recognize that
the American people want us focused
squarely on jobs and the economy, as
families across the country continue to
struggle to make ends meet, instead of
focusing on these politically motivated
bills that are going nowhere.

Expanding Economic Opportunity for
Women and Families
As we think about ways to support growth
in the 21st century, its absolutely
clear that our countrys economic
success, and that of middle class families,
goes hand in hand with womens
economic success. This means we have a lot
more work to do. Because despite all the
progress that has been madeall the
glass ceilings that have been
brokenwomen still face barriers that
are holding them, their families, and the
economy back. That is why I was proud
to join my colleague Senator Elizabeth
Warren on the Senate floor last week to
talk about some of the important ways we
can expand economic opportunity for women
and families.
As Chair of the Senate Budget Committee,
I also
held
a hearing last week on expanding economic
opportunity for women and
families . At the hearing, we
discussed the challenges women and their
families face in todays economy and
highlighted policies that would encourage
broad-based growth by leveling the playing
field for women and helping families gain
economic security. Over the coming
weeks and months, youll continue to
see Democrats in the Senate working to
ensure every American gets a fair shot by
fighting for goals like achieving pay
equity, providing access to affordable
child care, and raising the minimum
wage.

Equality for Same-Sex Spouses
I was proud to introduce the Social
Security and Marriage Equality (SAME) Act
of 2014, to ensure all same-sex spouses
receive equal treatment under the Social
Security Act when applying for Social
Security benefits, regardless of where they
live. Currently, eligibility for
spousal benefits provided under the Social
Security Act are determined by a place of
residence standard. This standard has
resulted in applications for Social
Security benefits for legally married
same-sex spouses living in states that do
not recognize same-sex marriage being
placed on hold. A more appropriate
standard for a federal agency like the
Social Security Administration would be
so-called place of
celebration, which recognizes any
legal marriage that takes place in a state
that recognizes same-sex marriage.
The current delay of survivor benefits
claims by the Social Security
Administration not only places an unfair
economic burden on legally married same-sex
couples, but an extremely emotional one as
well. Your zip code should not
determine whether or not your family will
have the means to survive after the death
of a spouse. While I believe the Social
Security Administration can, and should,
resolve this inconsistency through
administrative action, the SAME Act would
provide a roadmap to ensure equality under
our federal laws do not end at state
lines.

Providing a Strong Start for
Americas Children
Last week, the Senate took an important
step forward to expand preschool programs
by passing my Strong Start for
Americas Children Act out of the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
(HELP) Committee. As a former preschool
teacher, I know firsthand that early
learning is critical to childhood
development and can pay off well into
adulthood. Expanding educational
opportunities to more children
shouldnt be a partisan issue, so
while I was encouraged to see Democrats on
the committee vote overwhelmingly to expand
preschool programs, I hope more Republicans
will come to recognize the benefits of
preschool programs and will work with us to
pass this bill and give our kids a stronger
start for their future. Investing in early
learning would not only help our youngest
children and pay dividends in future
economic growth, it would also empower
millions of women who would be able to go
to work knowing their kids are learning and
thriving.
