Defense isnt just another line in the budget
it is a constitutional duty. The consequences of getting our national defense wrong are far-reaching and, despite what the Administration will
say , far more devastating than getting funding for the EPA wrong, or the IRS. The bottom line is if we get national defense wrong, nothing else matters.
Below is the speech I delivered on the House floor yesterday during the budget debates. Click

Yours in service,
