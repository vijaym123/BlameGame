Reform the
Tax Code to Stimulate Growth, Create
Jobs, and Raise Wages
Dear Friend,
As I travel across Virginia's Fifth
District, I often hear from my constituents
about how unnecessary bureaucratic red tape
is hindering job growth and making life
more difficult for working Virginians. Our
nations outdated and complicated tax
code is a perfect example of the federal
government standing in the way of
strengthening our economy for our
nations families and small
businesses.
A
report released last week
found that
the economy of China has now surpassed the
economy of the United States and now stands
as the world's largest economy. This is the
first time since President Ulysses Grant
was in office that the United States has
not led the world in the size of its
economy. Our anti-competitive tax policy is
one major factor holding us back from more
growth and output.
The complex and unfair U.S. tax code
creates tremendous economic uncertainty for
our farmers, our small businesses, and our
working families. Laden with special
interest loopholes and characterized by
high rates, our broken tax code limits
investment, hinders economic growth, and
grows the federal government.
The current tax code is especially
harmful to small businesses - the backbone
of our economy. These businesses are
essential to providing the jobs and growth
the Fifth District needs. In recent years,
small businesses have generated almost
two-thirds of new jobs. Small businesses
now account for nearly half of all private
sector employment, but Washingtons
complex and outdated tax code continues to
stifle small businesses ability to
grow and create much-needed jobs. We must
do better.
Since I have been elected, the House of
Representatives has voted in favor of
reforming elements of our tax code several
times, but Washington has yet to embrace a
comprehensive overhaul. Last week, the
House voted to temporarily extend for one
year a number of expiring tax relief
provisions that encourage small businesses
to grow. By voting for temporary tax
extensions, instead of permanent tax
reform, we are only delaying solutions that
the American people deserve.
Last week,
President
Obama said
he believed overhauling the
tax code in the next Congress was possible.
It is my hope that he is sincere about
working with Congress and that we will be
able to work together to overhaul our
broken tax code and implement a simpler,
fairer, and flatter tax code that will
ensure that individuals and businesses have
the certainty they need and that all
Americans are keeping more of their
hard-earned tax dollars. I look forward to
continuing to work with my colleagues to
encourage success for our farmers, our
small businesses, and working Virginia
families so that they can realize the
American dream for themselves and future
generations.
