Dear David,
I'm back in Washington, D.C. after a busy and productive two-week
district work period talking with Oregonians about issues of concern
and how we can work together to develop solutions that support our
working families. While in Oregon, I spoke at the annual Child Hunger
Prevention Roadshow in Yamhill County, discussed my new bill that
cracks down on irresponsible tax preparers, met with equal pay activist
Lilly Ledbetter, visited important facilities supported by the
Community Development Block Grant, and participated in the
groundbreaking ceremony for a veteran's new home in Hillsboro. Here's a
rundown of April.
Addressing Child Hunger
I spoke at the annual roadshow sponsored by Partners for a Hunger-Free
Oregon to highlight the ongoing problem of food insecurity. Too many
children in Oregon don't have enough to eat and that impacts their
academic performance. I visited Dayton Grade School, where more than 70
percent of students rely on the school nutrition plan, and discussed
what can be done to improve access to healthy food. Read more here
.
New Legislation: Tax Refund Protection Act
Just ahead of tax day I met with consumer protection advocates at CASH
Oregon to talk about my new legislation that cracks down on
unscrupulous for-profit tax preparers. My bill ensures consumers aren't
misled when they seek assistance filing their taxes. In many cases,
low-income consumers are targeted by tax preparers who skim off their
refund. This legislation improves transparency and ensures filers are
aware of the additional costs. Watch more here
.
Working With Seniors to Improve the OAA
I held multiple events with seniors across the region to discuss my
bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. During a roundtable with
LGBTQ seniors I learned about some of the challenges they face as they
age. I also met with low-income seniors who found employment thanks to
a training program authorized by the OAA that helps match Older
Americans with jobs that meet their needs. Read more here
.
Supporting Women in the Workforce
Portland State University held its annual Abigail Scott Duniway series
celebrating women leaders. This year Lilly Ledbetter delivered the
keynote address, sharing her inspiring story about wage discrimination
and discussing her continued push for equal pay. We must do more to
bridge the wage gap. I was at the White House when President Obama
signed two new executive actions in support of equal pay. Read more

.
Community Development Block Grant Tour
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Community Development Block
Grants and to celebrate I rode along on a bus tour of some of the local
sites that receive grants. CDBG provide the funding to improve local
infrastructure, which leads to better public services and greater
economic development. I recently signed a letter requesting more
funding next year for the CDBG program. Read more about the bus tour
here
.
Incorporating STEAM in Business
I toured the design firm Terrazign in Portland and got a look at the
unique products it has made for companies like NASA and Nike. The firm
prides itself on finding unconventional solutions to problems.
Terrazign's founder showed me one of their inventions: a harness that
holds astronauts' bodies down in zero gravity, which allows them to
maintain healthy bone density. This is an example of the innovative
thinking that is produced when traditional STEM subjects are integrated
with art and design. STEM + Arts = STEAM.
New Home for Wounded Veteran
It was an honor to attend the groundbreaking ceremony in Hillsboro for
the new home of veteran Sgt. Josh Sweeney, who lost both legs while
serving in Afghanistan. Thanks to the non-profit Homes for Our Troops,
Sgt. Sweeney will soon be living in a house that is specially adapted
for his needs. He plans to begin school and start a family with his
wife Amber, and this home will help him do that. Read more here
