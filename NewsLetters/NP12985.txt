Economic
Freedom Generates Growth and
Prosperity
My colleagues in the House and I remain
focused on invigorating our stagnant
economy, as we have passed numerous
measures that seek to improve the
environment for private sector job
creation. Unfortunately, the President's
policies are having the opposite effect as
economist Terry Miller outlines in a recent
Wall Street Journal piece entitled,
Americas
Dwindling Economic Freedom
(Jan.
13, 2014).
Mr. Miller explains the correlation
between a country's economic freedom, which
gauges a country's fiscal soundness, size
and scope of government, and regulatory
structure, and that country's economic
growth and the wellbeing if its people.
While the United States has historically
been among the world's most economically
free countries, its ranking has fallen in
recent years to the point that we are now
outside the top ten nations. The
consequences of these policy changes are
real and problematic, as they lead to fewer
jobs, less income mobility, and less
growth.
In the article, Mr. Miller analyzes this
trend, stating, Its not hard
to see why the U.S. is losing
groundThe Obama Administration
continues to shackle entire sectors of the
economy with regulation, including health
care, finance and energy. This intervention
impedes both personal freedom and national
prosperity. Miller goes on to
discuss how other countries have adopted
policies to expand economic freedom and
therefore jobs and prosperity.
In today's global economy, it is
critical that we adopt policies to enhance,
not degrade, our country's competitiveness
so we can continue to be the leading
economic force in the world. This requires
removing government impediments to job
creation, getting our fiscal house in
order, and promoting appropriate,
commonsense regulatory policies. These
principles are exactly what my colleagues
in the House and I have been fighting for
since day one
policies that
encourage our free market system to
flourish so that our job creators are not
stifled by a heavy-handed government.
As a member of the Financial Services
Committee, I have supported policies that
enable robust private capital formation so
those investments can generate good jobs.
This includes a bill that I introduced, the
Small Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act (H.R. 1105), which has
passed the House with bipartisan support.
Overregulation and government red tape will
not move our country toward economic
freedom.
I look forward to continuing to work to
restore the economic freedom that made the
United States the world's most powerful
economy so that we may ensure a brighter
future for our children and
grandchildren.
