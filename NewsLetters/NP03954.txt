Friend,
Sixty-four years ago today, the United Nations first recognized December 10 as Human Rights Day.
This years slogan is Human Rights 365.
Human Rights 365 reminds us that everyone, everywhere, at all times is entitled to the full range of human rights.
Unfortunately, too many people throughout the world live under oppressive regimes where they are unable to exercise fundamental freedoms such as the right to vote, the right to be free of racial discrimination, and the right to freely practice their religion.
Furthermore, an alarming number of individuals have been the victims of human trafficking.
The U.S. Department of State estimates that more than 20 million victims remain unidentified.
These injustices are unacceptable.
I firmly believe that no one should face persecution simply because of their political views, religious beliefs, or ethnic background.
No one should face death, violence, jail time, or intimidation simply because of their political views.
Moreover, I support the right of people of all nations to have a voice in their countrys government and future.
As your congressman, I will always work to promote human rights at home and abroad and support diplomatic efforts to strengthen our relationships with foreign nations.
Sincerely,
