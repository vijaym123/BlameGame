A Quality Education For All Missouri Students
I spent this past week doing what I enjoy most:
traveling around North Missouri speaking with the people of the Sixth
Congressional District.
This area of land is truly an impressive
place, consisting of 36 counties stretching from the Missouri River to the
Mississippi River, from Nebraska to Illinois across North
Missouri.
In fact, this congressional district is larger than seven U.S.
states.
Last week, my
Education and Opportunity Town Hall Series
stopped in Hannibal, Blue
Springs, and Liberty to foster a two-way dialogue on ways to achieve a
quality education for all of Missouris students.
Parents,
teachers, and administrators expressed many interests and concerns,
including Common Core Standards, the federal budget, IDEA, and ways in
which we can avert the Obama Administrations current education
policy.
With such diverse rural and
suburban communities over a vast portion of Americas heartland, the
people of the Sixth District are presented with many varying needs and
interests.
That is why the Obama Administrations top-down,
one-size fits all approach to our childrens education isnt going to
work.
Our system works best when influence flows uphill from the local
level, not the other way around.
Though initially promoted as state-based education standards,
Common Core is nothing of the sort.
The standards take away local
control and put some private and home schoolers at a disadvantage.
The truth is that there is little Congress can do to provide relief
because states opted-in to the standards.
As a parent of a daughter who is still in school, Im
worried about these standards and what they are going to teach our
kids.
Although the ability to opt-out lies with the state, I will be
working with the state legislature to provide relief to Missouri
schools.
Sincerely,
Sam
