Dear
Friend,
If there's anything that can be taken away from
President Obama's address to the nation on how we're going to fight
ISIL, it's that this effort will require leadership from
Congress.
I'm working around the clock to make sure we're meeting that
need.
A few hours before the president spoke, I introduced a
bill I believe we need to crack down on jihadists who are likely trying
to enter the United States.
H.R. 5434, The Visa Waiver Program Suspension
Act ,
pushes for an emergency short-term suspension
of our visa waiver program, which expedites entry into the USA from
38 typically friendly countries.
Since Islamic State fighters are
looking to use Western citizenship and passports to take their fight
around the world, it's a sensible step to restore a level of scrutiny
to travelers from everywhere.
Terrorists will not stop the
free flow of people and commerce, but they won't exploit it either.
My bill is aimed at protecting Americans everywhere.
I hope
you'll be hearing more on this soon, and as always,
I want to hear from
you .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
Signing
HR 5434, the Visa Waiver Program Suspension Act, before delivering it
to the House floor Wednesday
night.
