Giving Thanks
W hile we have much to be thankful for this year, our country is also at a critical turning point in our history. We face challenging times, but the challenges we face are never as great as the blessings bestowed upon us.
As your Representative in Congress, I am committed to helping make the United States a better place and a beacon of opportunity in the 21 st
Century. Like most parents, I ask myself, will my child be better off than I am? In the history of our great nation, each generation has strived to improve and move our country forward so that the next generation will be better off.
This week, families will gather to celebrate and give thanks for the blessings bestowed upon them.
Like many, I will pray that our families have a happy, healthy, and safe Thanksgiving. This year, I have many things to be grateful for, but I am most thankful to spend time with family and friends, and my wife and newborn son.

Making a Difference:
Howard Berry is on a Mission to Make a Difference
"Now, Howard Berry, a 57-year-old resident of Rossmoyne in Sycamore Township, is on his own mission: pressing Congress to pass legislation declaring the massacre at Fort Hood a terrorist attack. The bill would provide the same benefits and honors, including the Purple Heart, to the Fort Hood victims and their families that are provided to military personnel wounded or killed in combat zones overseas.
Berry, who spent last week lobbying Cincinnati-area lawmakers in Washington on the issue, said the recognition would have given his son some peace and helped to ease the mistreatment he felt after the incident. His son felt slighted, he said, by the Armys decision to deny victims of the shooting medals and other combat-related benefits, such as mental health treatment."

Visiting Mt. Healthy Food Bank
This week, I stopped by a local food pantry, part of the
Mt. Healthy Alliance , and had the opportunity to meet with the mostly volunteer staff, learn what they are doing to help their community this holiday season, and drop off some food.
They walked me through the process for a family of three to have access to the groceries at the pantry. The staff also updated me on the largest issues facing their organization and the major problems faced by those who use the services provided by the pantry.
As the holiday season approaches, we should remember those in need and support our local charitable organizations.
Touring Next Generation Technology at GE Aviation
This Monday, I hosted Dayton Congressman Mike Turner,
Chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee, for a tour of GE Aviation in Evendale. We got a sneak peak of GE's next generation ADVENT engine, a technological leap that has the potential to reduce the fuel use in the air by 25%! GE's commitment to Ohio and our national security is clear, and it's exciting for Ohio's engineers to be building the engines that are maintaining our nation's air superiority.
