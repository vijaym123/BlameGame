The State of President Obamas
Union

The State of
President Obamas Union
This week, the President
outlined his plans for the year with his State of the Union address
a
speech more reminiscent of partisan campaign rhetoric rather than a
call for bipartisan cooperation!
Unfortunately, the Presidents
agenda can be summed up in one phrase: higher taxes to fuel still more
government spending.
He missed a chance to tell the American
people how he will work with Republicans to advance solutions that
actually increase opportunities for all
jobs, better wages, and lower
health care and energy costs.
He confidently proclaimed that
"the shadows of crisis have passed." Well, if the economic crisis is
indeed over, all credit goes to the resiliency of the American
people.
They have struggled and persevered in spite of the anti-growth
regulations, taxes and other burdens placed on them by
Washington.
And, I hope the President recognizes that we have much work
to do.
Ten years ago, America had a booming economy
with low unemployment. Today, the number of Americans working is the
same as it was in 1978. Labor force participation is at an all-time low.
Many Americans cannot find full-time, employment. Much of this is due
to the Obamacare restrictions that make it more advantageous for
employers to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers.
Yes, too many Americans are still out of work, and New Jersey families
are struggling with fewer hours and smaller paychecks.
And I
note that Barrons reports "U.S. manufacturing suffered a net loss of two
million jobs between 2007 and 2013, hardly a sign of renewal."
Yes, we have much work to do.
Beyond jobs and the economy,
I was deeply disappointed that the nation did not hear more about
concrete steps the President will propose to address the three greatest
threats to America today: radical Islamic terrorism, cyber-sabotage and
runaway debt.
The President said he wants to work
with Congress. But to make real progress, we have to focus on finding
common ground.
The American people deserve real solutions. House
Republicans are going to do all we can to build a healthy economy for
working families.
Be assured that as the new Congress gets
underway, I am focused on jobs and the economy and keeping our country
safe!

A New Tax Season Headache
This week marked the
official start of tax season, the annual
and frustrating
American
tradition of sorting through a long and complicated tax code
to figure out what you owe to Uncle
Sam.
And this year will be even worse
thanks to
Obamacare.
This is the power that the Affordable Care Act gave to the IRS as
its gatekeeper and enforcer!
As
Bloomberg News
reports, not
only will every taxpayer need to determine whether they satisfy
the individual-mandate requirements, but also [m]illions
who received insurance through Obamacares exchanges will have a more
complicated set of calculations to
complete.
Many families are in for a rude awakening
They may
actually
owe
money back to the government to repay their Obamacare
subsidies if they earned more than originally estimated. And many
others will have to pay an
Obamacare individual-mandate tax.
One leading accountant tells
Bloomberg , People are going to absolutely be blindsided. . .
. It can take someone from getting a refund to owing
money.
But even figuring out what you owe is going to be
a
much
bigger chore than taxpayers are used
to.
If you receive Obamacare subsidies, say goodbye to that short 1040-EZ
form and say hello to your new stack of IRS forms and worksheets.
Its so bad that one tax-preparation service had to create a
new section on its website just to explain all of Obamacare's
new rules.

The
Keystone Pipeline Illusion
Its always been clear
that construction of the Keystone Pipeline will not be a panacea for
Americas energy challenges, nor will it destroy our
environment.

Salute:
A heartfelt "goodbye" and "thank you" to
Carmela
Lunt . As Founder and Board President of Community Hope,
Carmela Lunt helped hundreds of young people and their families, grappling
with chronic mental illness, poverty and substance abuse through the
incredibly valuable programs she started.
I first worked with
Carmela over thirty years ago, helping to fund their first group home up
in Dover, and later encouraged Community Hopes expansion of new
services to veterans, especially their remarkable programs at Lyons VA
Medical Center. There is no doubt that our community is a better place
for her visionary and selfless
service.

Salute:
Farewell to
William
Primus , a former Madison councilman and an influential community
leader, advocate for civil rights, and equal employment.
As
President of the Urban League of Morris County, Bill established a valuable
youth program that allowed me to host dozens of bright young men and
women as summer interns in my Washington office, giving them new
insights into the public policy process and, I hope, piquing their interest
in a life of public service.
He will be
missed!
