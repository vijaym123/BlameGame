This week I joined colleagues on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee at a field hearing in Altoona, Pennsylvania to review a proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that could dramatically extend the federal governments authority to regulate ponds, ditches, and other wet areas.
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee field hearing in Altoona
Enacted in 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) claimed jurisdiction over the nations "navigable waters," which are defined as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." This proposed rule seeks to "clarify" which bodies of water are subject to federal jurisdiction under the CWA. Constituents have raised strong concerns with me about this proposed rules potential for adverse impacts to residents and businesses in the 4th District.
During the hearing, I questioned the potential scope of this new regulation, noting that all ephemeral and intermittent streams, and the wetlands that are connected or next to them, will be subject to federal oversight under the proposed rule. I also expressed concern that everyday business or private activity that create temporary ditches and other small wet areas could now fall under federal jurisdiction.
Met with local officials in York about ramifications of proposed EPA water regulations.
We can find common sense ways to protect our environment and waterways without unnecessarily expanding the reach of the federal government. Government regulations cost the average American family more than $15,000 each year and Im concerned this proposal will just add to those costs.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
