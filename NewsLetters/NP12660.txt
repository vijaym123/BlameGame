Dear Friend,
This was a busy week here in Washington. The President shared his
vision for the nation over the next year in his State of the Union
address, and the House was hard at work, fighting for you. The House
passed the Farm Bill, giving farmers more certainty over the next five
years. Additionally, the House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding
for Abortion Act, ending taxpayer-funded abortions once and for all.
This past Tuesday, the President laid out his vision for the next year
in his State of the Union Address. His speech reflected a clear
difference of perspective. He believes government is the solution to
our problems; I believe government is too often the problem. While the
President did touch on many issues of concern to many Americans, he
refuses to allow the American spirit to be unleashed, preferring
instead to call for government-imposed solutions that have failed in
the past and will undoubtedly fail in the future.
I believe America needs action that involves unleashing the American
spirit and getting government out of the way of job growth; not one of
taking power away from the people. I remain focused on growing the
economy, empowering the American people, and removing the uncertainty
that is stifling job growth. It is imperative to get excess government
out of the way of our economy, not further entangle it in our private
lives. Our Founding Fathers intended that governing be a partnership
between the branches of government, and it is my hope that the
President will work with Congress to promote these common-sense ideas
to help all Americans.
Constituents from Missouri's Fourth District have shared stories about
the negative impact of the Administration's actions, and House
Republicans are working on solutions to get government out of the way:
-
A substitute teacher will have her hours cut due to the
President's health care law, lowering her take home pay and making it
difficult to provide for her family. I support the American Health Care
Reform Act, which replaces Obamacare with market-driven solutions that
increase access and lower the cost of health care;
-
Community banks are being buried under a flood of regulations
due to the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. I introduced the Small
Business Credit Availability Act, which would help roll back this
harmful legislation by freeing up equity small banks use to provide
their customers with loans and working capital.
-
Rural electric cooperatives have been negatively impacted by
the President's war on coal, which will shut down Missouri power plants
and drive up the electricity bills of citizens across Missouri and the
country. I continue to fight against overregulation by the EPA, and
ensure America has a true 'all of the above' energy policy to secure
energy independence and lower energy costs.
I assure you that I am committed to a year of positive action for the
people. I, along with my colleagues, will continue to work to get
Washington out of the way, lower healthcare costs, cut government
waste, eliminate job-stifling red tape, and help Americans take home
more of their paycheck each month.
On another matter, the House was successful in passing a five-year Farm
Bill this week. This bill reforms farm policy, cuts waste and abuse
from the food stamp program, and replaces direct payments to farmers
with a safety net to protect them when they suffer significant losses.
The farm bill makes significant reforms to farm and food programs,
saving taxpayers $23 billion in mandatory federal spending. We have
made major reforms to farm subsidies, streamlined conservation
programs, and eliminated nutrition loopholes to make these programs
more accountable to taxpayers.
Taxpayers will also benefit from reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, by eliminating waste and
abuse inherent in the system. We were able to do this without taking a
morsel of food out of the mouth of somebody who truly needs this
program. This is the first reform to the food stamp program since the
welfare reforms that were signed in to law by President Clinton in
1996. The Farm Bill also saves taxpayer dollars by consolidating 23
duplicative and overlapping conservation programs into 13. The bill
also includes a panel to review Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
actions, ensuring that government red tape and overregulation doesn't
negatively impact agriculture.
While I am overall pleased with the Farm Bill and the assurances it
gives farmers and families, I am disappointed it does not contain all
the savings I sought for Missouri's Fourth District. For instance, the
provision I championed to repeal a duplicative and wasteful catfish
inspection scheme was not included in the final bill. However, I will
continue to pursue this bipartisan, common-sense effort to rein in
wasteful government spending. Overall, the Farm Bill serves the
interests of both consumers and producers, guaranteeing the United
States an affordable, plentiful, and safe food supply now and well into
the future.
Finally, the House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Act. I am proud to call myself a cosponsor of this bill. H.R. 7 puts
into permanent law a ban on taxpayer-funded abortion. While abortion is
a hotly-contested issue, people on both sides can agree that taxpayers
should not foot the bill to provide abortion services. This week, I had
the opportunity to join my colleagues in speaking out on the House
floor in favor of this legislation.
It was heartening to see bipartisan support for this important
legislation. The legislation passed by the House this week is another
step in the right direction to fight for the people of Missouri's
Fourth District.
Have a good week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear

This

ending

This

his
vision
for
the
next

His
speech
reflected
a
clear
difference
of
perspective.
He
believes
government
is
the
solution
to
our

I
believe
government
is
too
often
the
problem.
While
the
President
did

of

many

he
refuses
to

preferring
instead
to

and
will
undoubtedly

I

that
involves
unleashing
the

and
getting

not

I
remain
focused
on
growing
the
economy,
empowering
the
American
people,
and
removing
the
uncertainty
that
is
stifling
job
growth.
It
is
imperative
to
get
excess
government
out
of
the
way
of
our
economy,
not
further
entangle
it
in
our
private

Our
Founding
Fathers
intended
that
governing
be
a

the

and
it
is
my
hope
that
the
President
will
work
with
Congress
to
promote
these
common-sense
ideas
to
help
all
Americans.
Constituents
from
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth

have
shared
stories
about
the
negative
impact
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
actions,
and
House
Republicans
are
working
on
solutions
to
get
government
out
of
the
way:
-
A
substitute
teacher
will
have
her
hours
cut
due
to
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law,
lowering
her
take
home
pay
and
making
it
difficult
to
provide
for
her
family.
I
support
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act,
which
replaces
Obamacare
with
market-driven
solutions
that
increase
access
and
lower
the
cost
of
health
care;
-
Community
banks
are
being
buried
under
a
flood
of
regulations
due
to
the
Dodd-Frank
financial
reforms.
I
introduced
the
Small
Business
Credit
Availability
Act,
which
would
help
roll
back
this
harmful
legislation
by
freeing
up
equity
small
banks
use
to
provide
their
customers
with
loans
and
working
capital.
-
Rural
electric
cooperatives
have
been
negatively
impacted
by
the
President&#8217;s
war
on
coal,
which
will
shut
down
Missouri
power
plants
and
drive
up
the
electricity
bills
of
citizens
across
Missouri
and
the
country.
I
continue
to
fight
against
overregulation
by
the
EPA,
and
ensure
America
has
a
true
&#8216;all
of
the
above&#8217;
energy
policy
to
secure
energy
independence
and
lower
energy
costs.
I
assure
you
that
I
am
committed
to
a
year
of
positive
action
for
the
people.
I,
along
with
my
colleagues,
will
continue
to
work
to
get
Washington
out
of
the
way,
lower
healthcare
costs,
cut
government
waste,
eliminate
job-stifling
red
tape,
and
help
Americans
take
home
more
of
their
paycheck
each

On
another
matter,
the
House
was
successful
in
passing
a
five-year
Farm

this
week.
This
bill
reforms
farm
policy,
cuts
waste
and
abuse
from
the
food
stamp
program,
and
replaces
direct
payments
to
farmers
with
a
safety

to
protect
them
when
they
suffer
significant
losses.
The
farm
bill
makes
significant
reforms
to
farm
and
food
programs,
saving
taxpayers
$23
billion
in
mandatory
federal
spending.
We
have
made
major
reforms
to
farm
subsidies,
streamlined
conservation

and
eliminated
nutrition
loopholes
to
make
these

Taxpayers
will
also
benefit
from
reforms
to
the
Supplemental
Nutrition

Program
(SNAP),
or
food

by
eliminating
waste
and

inherent
in
the
system.
We
were
able
to
do
this
without
taking
a
morsel
of
food
out
of
the
mouth
of
somebody
who
truly
needs
this
program.
This
is
the
first
reform
to
the
food
stamp
program
since
the
welfare
reforms
that
were
signed
in
to
law
by
President
Clinton
in
1996.
The
Farm
Bill
also
saves
taxpayer
dollars
by
consolidating
23
duplicative

The
bill
also

a

review
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
actions,
ensuring
that
government
red
tape
and
overregulation
doesn&#8217;t
negatively
impact
agriculture.
While
I
am
overall
pleased
with
the
Farm
Bill
and
the
assurances
it
gives
farmers
and
families,
I
am
disappointed
it
does
not
contain
all
the
savings
I
sought
for
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District.
For
instance,
the
provision
I
championed
to
repeal
a
duplicative
and
wasteful
catfish
inspection
scheme
was
not
included
in
the
final
bill.
However,
I
will
continue
to
pursue
this
bipartisan,
common-sense
effort
to
rein
in
wasteful
government
spending.
Overall,
the
Farm
Bill
serves
the
interests
of
both
consumers
and
producers,
guaranteeing
the
United
States
an
affordable,
plentiful,
and
safe
food
supply
now
and
well
into
the
future.
Finally,
the
House
passed
H.R.
7,
the
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act.
I
am
proud
to
call
myself
a
cosponsor
of
this
bill.
H.R.
7
puts
into
permanent
law
a
ban
on
taxpayer-funded
abortion.
While
abortion
is
a
hotly-contested
issue,
people
on
both
sides
can
agree
that
taxpayers
should
not
foot
the
bill
to
provide
abortion
services.
This
week,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
join
my
colleagues
in

the
House
floor
in
favor
of
this
legislation.
It
was
heartening
to

The
legislation
passed
by
the
House
this
week
is
another
step
in
the
right
direction
to
fight
for
the
people
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth

Have
a
good
