Dear Friend,
On Monday, the House passed the Digital Accountability and Transparency
(DATA) Act, S. 994, with strong bipartisan support. The DATA Act is a
commonsense bill that would allow the public to track every dollar
spent by federal agencies and help Congress find ways to eliminate
waste and fraud by making the reporting requirements more transparent
and readily available for scrutiny.
The legislation would amend the Federal Funding Accountability and
Transparency Act to require full disclosure of federal agency
expenditures. It would also require the development of government wide
data standards to simplify and streamline financial reports. The bottom
line is that it should not be difficult for anyone to review how a
federal bureaucracy is spending taxpayer dollars.
This bill, for the first time, would allow for unprecedented
transparency for taxpayers to review accounting records and it has been
long overdue. Take for example all the headlines created the last
couple of years by the Internal Revenue Service regarding their
extravagant conferences around the country and the costly videos that
were created. While those egregious expenses were ultimately uncovered,
I believe it would have been less likely that the IRS would have spent
money the way they did if they had to be more transparent about their
spending habits to begin with.
The good news is that the DATA Act has already passed the Senate, so
this bill will be heading to the President for his signature to be
signed into law.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
On
Monday,
the
House
passed
the
Digital
Accountability
and
Transparency
(DATA)
Act,
S.
994,
with
strong
bipartisan
support.
The
DATA
Act
is
a
commonsense
bill
that
would
allow
the
public
to
track
every
dollar
spent
by
federal
agencies
and
help
Congress
find
ways
to
eliminate
waste
and
fraud
by
making
the
reporting
requirements
more
transparent
and
readily
available
for
scrutiny.
The
legislation
would
amend
the
Federal
Funding
Accountability
and
Transparency
Act
to
require
full
disclosure
of
federal
agency
expenditures.
It
would
also
require
the
development
of
government
wide
data
standards
to
simplify
and
streamline
financial
reports.
The
bottom
line
is
that
it
should
not
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
review
how
a
federal
bureaucracy
is
spending
taxpayer
dollars.
This
bill,
for
the
first
time,
would
allow
for
unprecedented
transparency
for
taxpayers
to
review
accounting
records
and
it
has
been
long
overdue.
Take
for
example
all
the
headlines
created
the
last
couple
of
years
by
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
regarding
their
extravagant
conferences
around
the
country
and
the
costly
videos
that
were
created.
While
those
egregious
expenses
were
ultimately
uncovered,
I
believe
it
would
have
been
less
likely
that
the
IRS
would
have
spent
money
the
way
they
did
if
they
had
to
be
more
transparent
about
their
spending
habits
to
begin
with.
The
good
news
is
that
the
DATA
Act
has
already
passed
the
Senate,
so
this
bill
will
be
heading
to
the
President
for
his
signature
to
be
signed
into
law.
