I CANNOT keep up!!
Yesterday, we told you we&rsquo;re in striking distance of a grassroots milestone: $2OO,OOO raised online for Cheri. Just this year!!!
How did you respond?! With an OUTPOURING of grassroots support. ActBlue&rsquo;s been working
nonstop
to process all of the secure donations.
Now we&rsquo;ve got a real chance at hitting our goal before the June 30th public fundraising deadline.
Boehner didn&rsquo;t bargain for that!!!
David, we can&rsquo;t do it without you.
Will you chip in $5 to help us hit the mark?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Let's do this.
