Putting Jobs &amp; the Economy First
I am working hard to ensure the voices of Ohio's Second District are heard in the halls of Congress. In the latest
weekly Republican address , I spoke about the House's solutions to help Ohioans and all Americans get back to work, to lower energy costs, and make government more accountable.
Excerpts from my address-
In the days since the election, Republicans have begun to make good on our vow to honor your trust by focusing first on jobs and the economy.
On Friday, the House voted to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will help lower energy costs and get people back to work.
We ask Washington Democrats to finally give this project the green light that the American people have been waiting for.
Well also work to pass the Hire More Heroes Act, which will encourage businesses large and small to hire our veterans - the very Americans to which we owe our security and freedom.
Well take on ObamaCare and well propose that Congress
not the bureaucrats
has the final say on all new major regulations.
This is just a start on getting some important things done in the months ahead.
You deserve a government that doesnt just hear you, but actually listens to you and puts your priorities first
that focuses on securing more jobs and a better future for our children.
This is what you can expect from the new Republican majority.
