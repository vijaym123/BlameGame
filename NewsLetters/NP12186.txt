The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of February 17- 21, 2014
This week, I enjoyed spending time with constituents during the
President's Day District Work Week.
As always, I greatly value the
opportunity to hear the concerns and opinions of the people of North
Texas. I was also particularly pleased to recognize three public
servants, who are mentioned below, for their unwavering commitment to
keeping our community safe.
Wylie Firemen Honored by American Legion
On Tuesday, I was honored to visit Fire Station 2 in Wylie to
congratulate two outstanding firemen. Earlier this year, Brian Moriarty
and Andrew Johnson received top awards from the American Legion
Department of Texas for exceeding the requirements expected of their
positions and showing a distinct pattern of community service and
professional achievement.

Brian Moriarty was selected as the Texas Firefighter of the Year and
Andrew Johnson was chosen as the Texas Emergency Medical Technician of
the Year - marking the first time that two Fire-Rescue members from
Wylie have been awarded by the American Legion in the same year. I was
delighted to visit with them and present them with a congressional
certificate to show my gratitude for their dedicated service to the
City of Wylie.
Success North Dallas Event
On Wednesday, I was the keynote speaker at the Success North Dallas
breakfast. In addition to speaking to the group, I had the pleasure of
congratulating Sergeant Melissa Gregg for being honored as the 2013
Police Officer of the Year. Sergeant Gregg's dedication to keeping our
community safe is inspiring and she is truly deserving of this award.

Success North Dallas is integral to the development of
business leaders in the North Texas community, and I'm appreciative
that they invited me to participate in their event.
