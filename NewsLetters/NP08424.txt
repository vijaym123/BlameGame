Legislation

June 22, 2014
Dear Friends,
Thank you to everyone who participated in our Seventh
District Telephone Town Hall Meeting last Tuesday.
We had a great
event and covered many important legislative issues.
I received
several requests for an update on how Congress is tackling veterans
health care.
I am glad to also share this update with
you.
I am pleased to let you know that the House and Senate
have both passed legislation to address the deadly wait times plaguing
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities across our country. Each
bill allows veterans to receive non-VA care if they cannot get an
appointment within the VAs wait time goal, if they live more than 40
miles from a VA facility, or if they have experienced a lengthy wait
time. Should qualifying veterans choose to receive care from a private
health care facility; the VA will cover their costs.

Next Steps For VA
Fix
The next step in the legislative process to fix the
VA is for the House and Senate to hold a conference meeting to
negotiate the differences in each chambers respective bill.
On
Wednesday, the House approved a conference meeting with the Senate and
appointed its conference
appointees.
After the conference meeting concludes, the House and Senate will
vote on the agreed upon bill, and then it will head to the
Presidents desk to be signed into law.
This is expected to occur very
soon; possibly before the Fourth of July. While this legislation is a
promising step in the right direction, we still have plenty of work to do
to ensure that we honor our promises to
veterans.
USC Gamecock Receives Medal of
Honor
Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter was awarded our militarys highest honor
last week.
While serving in Afghanistan, Kyle and a fellow Marine
were patrolling a rooftop when an insurgent threw a hand grenade at
them.
In a heroic attempt to save his comrade, Kyle jumped on top
of the grenade.
It exploded, shattering Kyles arm, blowing off
part of his jaw, knocking out his teeth, and blinding him in one eye.
Kyles recovery is nothing short of a medical miracle and his
positive attitude is testament to his outstanding and courageous
character.
As the president put the medal around my
neck, I felt the history and the weight of a nation, Kyle said,
recalling Marines who fought everywhere from the trenches of World War I, to
the icy battlefields of Korea, to cities in Iraq like Baghdad, Ramadi
and Fallujah.
I think about the Marines who were with me in
Marjah, he continued. If I close my eyes today, I can still hear
their desperate medevacs being called out over the radio as they bled
out in the fields of Afghanistan. Today, I accept the medal for them. I
will wear it for every person who makes up our great
nation.
I admire Kyles courage and dedication to our nation.
Brave
patriots like him make me proud to be an American.
God Bless Kyle
for his service and selfless sacrifice.
Have
a good week,
