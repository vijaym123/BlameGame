Dear Friend,
I was glad to be back in business this week after undergoing
hip-replacement surgery last month. I was able to travel around
District 4 and attend several events. My doctor hasn't cleared me to
fly to Washington yet, but I hope to be well enough to fly soon.
On Sunday morning, I gave an interview to FOX and Friends Weekend
regarding my new bill, the No Welfare for Weed Act. This bill is a
no-brainer to me: people shouldn't be able to get high using
hard-earned taxpayer money. Click HERE
to watch the interview.
(Rep. Gosar preparing for the FOX and Friends Weekend interview, March
9, 2014)
On Monday, I met with the mayors of Prescott Valley, Dewey and Chino
Valley. This was a great opportunity for me to hear directly from local
leaders about how the federal government is hampering their
communities. We discussed several issues, including the No Welfare for
Weed Act and federal intrusion into local matters through job-killing
overregulation and Common Core education standards.
(Rep. Gosar meeting with the mayors of Prescott Valley, Dewey and Chino
Valley, March 10, 2014)
I also thoroughly enjoyed meeting the teams of two District 4 health
care facilities:
the Prescott DaVita Dialysis Center and the Payson
Care Center. These state-of-the-art facilities provide comfort and care
for people going through some tough physical challenges and the number
of patients smiling during their treatment was extremely encouraging.
As a member of the GOP Doctors Caucus and a health care provider for 25
years, I understand that our health care system needs reform and I will
work with my colleagues to pass health care legislation that encourages
competition and patient choice. I am confident that Congress can lower
health care costs and improve overall care if we pursue sound,
common-sense policies.
(Rep. Gosar and Jason Norman, administrator of the Payson Care Center,
March 10, 2014)
Expand Energy Production, Create Jobs
On Friday, I led the effort to send a letter, which was signed by 30 of
my colleagues, to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy
and Mineral Resources urging the subcommittee to hold a hearing on my
energy and jobs bill, the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act.
Our nation's public lands will play a critical role in our country's
energy future. The Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act will
facilitate the expansion of renewable energy development, create jobs
and preserve our nation's natural treasures. Western states like
Arizona contain millions of acres of public lands that are primed for
economic development but bureaucracy stands in the way.
This legislation removes the bureaucratic barriers that prevent
renewable energy, such as wind and solar, from being developed on
public lands. By developing these energy resources we not only move
toward energy independence but we also create jobs in some of the
nation's most rural areas. I strongly support an all-of-the-above
energy strategy and I urge the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
Resources to schedule a hearing on this bill as soon as possible.
Demanding Action
I, along with several of my colleagues, sent a letter on Tuesday to
Attorney General Eric Holder demanding that the Department of Justice
take action against Backpage.com for its egregious role in promoting
human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors. The website's
mostly unchecked advertising is the leading online source for
prostitution in the United States.
It's disgusting that Backpage.com has been allowed to serve as a hub
for human trafficking and sexual exploitation. I call on the Justice
Department to crack down on this heinous abuse and prosecute those
responsible for these deplorable acts. The United States of America
should be a place of freedom and hope, not one of oppression and
despair propagated by human trafficking. Click HERE

Restore the Balance of Power
It's time to rein in executive overreach and restore the balance of
power established by the Constitution. Just this past Thursday,
President Obama signed another executive order that would affect
thousands of businesses across the country, adding to his many
unilateral changes to ObamaCare and end-runs around Congress. The
Framers intended to prevent arbitrary rule, but the Obama
Administration is pushing the limits of that fundamental constitutional
principle.
Honoring a Small Business
Congratulations to Don and Lois Moore, proprietors of the Quartzsite
General Store, on 41 years of success. The store's Western-themed
storefront has been a mainstay of Quartzsite's Main Street for more
than four decades, adding to the town's character and economy. The
store could not have been successful without Don's and Lois's hard work
and dedication. I recognized Mr. and Mrs. Moore with an entry into the
Congressional Record, the official record of Congress. Click HERE

Times.

I

urging
the
subcommittee
to
hold
a

on
my
energy

bill, the
Public
Lands
Renewable

Development
Act.
Our
nation&#8217;s
public
lands
will
play
a
critical
role
in
our
country&#8217;s
energy
future.
The
Public
Lands

Development
Act
will
facilitate
the
expansion
of
renewable
energy
development,
create
jobs
and
preserve
our
nation&#8217;s

Western
states
like
Arizona
contain
millions
of
acres
of
public
lands
that
are
primed
for
economic
development
but
bureaucracy
stands
in
the
way.
This
legislation
removes
the
bureaucratic
barriers
that
prevent
renewable
energy,
such
as
wind
and
solar,
from
being
developed
on
public
lands.
By
developing
these
energy
resources
we
not
only
move
toward
energy
independence
but
we
also
create
jobs
in
some
of
the
nation's
most
rural
areas.
I
strongly
support
an
all-of-the-above
energy
strategy
and
I
urge
the
Subcommittee
on

to
schedule
a
