This week, the
House Appropriations Committee approved the Military
Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill
for fiscal
year 2015. Our bipartisan VA Appropriations Bill keeps the promises weve
made to our veterans and ensures they continue to receive the
benefits they have earned.
As a member of the Military
Construction and VA Subcommittee, the founder of the House Invisible Wounds
Caucus, and current Co-Chairman of the Congressional Brain Injury Task
Force, I fought to ensure this bill will improve mental health services
available to our veterans. I am particularly pleased that rhis bill
includes critical and significant funding for post-traumatic stress
disorder and other mental health services, suicide prevention activities,
and traumatic brain injury treatment.
Our bill also provides
the VA with more tools and resources to end the disability claims
backlog, while including key reporting requirements and oversight to hold
each regional office and the VA as a whole accountable for delivering
better results. We have nearly one million veterans waiting for an
answer from the VA on their disability claims, and that is simply
unacceptable.
We also save taxpayers $1.8 billion below the fiscal
year 2014 level without cutting services for troops and veterans.
Rather, the bill reduces spending on military construction projects while
increasing funding for veterans programs by $1.5
billion.
