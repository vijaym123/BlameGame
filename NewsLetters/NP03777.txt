LEGISLATIVE CORNER
PHILADELPHIA VA HOSPITAL
TO BE RENAMED FOR MEDAL OF HONOR
RECIPIENT
Earlier this month, I joined
with the entire Pennsylvania Congressional delegation, the Crescenz
family, and veterans groups around the Commonwealth in celebrating the
House passage of the bill to rename Philadelphias VA Medical Center
after a true American hero. Corporal Michael J. Crescenz served his
country in Vietnam with bravery and gallantry, selflessly sacrificing his
own life for the safety and security of his fellow soldiers. He was
post-humuously recognized for his heroic efforts in 1970 with the Medal
of Honor.
This
honor is long overdue, and I am extremely proud to have
led the renaming effort
that
not only recognizes Michaels ultimate sacrifice to his nation, but
the extraordinary sacrifice and service of all the Commonwealths
veterans.
This is a fitting tribute for a revered son of Philadelphia
and a declaration that his legacy and story will continue to live
on.
IMMIGRATION REFORM
UPDATE
Several
weeks ago the President announced new Executive Action on Immigration.
His action will help
1)
crackdown on illegal
immigration at the border
2)
deport felons, not families
3)
increase accountability so that more than 4 million
undocumented immigrants will have the opportunity to play by the rules,
and
4)
streamline legal immigration to boost our
economy and promote naturalization. To learn more about the President's
immigration plans, click
here .
I believe the President has laid out a clear set of actions that
will make great strides towards fixing our nation's broken immigration
system.

Representatives to pass immigration reform legislation

WHITE HOUSE
ConnectEd CONFERENCE
It was an honor to join President
Obama, superintendents, and educators from around the United States at
November's ConnectED summit. Bringing technology into more classrooms
and ensuring our students have access to high-speed internet must
continue to be one of our highest priorities in education.
As
Secretary Duncan articulated in his remarks, the goal to improve classroom
access to broadband and technology is not just about offering more
digital tools and resources, it is about leveling the playing field for
all students in this country. I firmly believe that to remain globally
competitive as a nation, high-speed internet in every school and
computers for every student must be the rulenot the exception. Read more

COMMUNITY NEWS
