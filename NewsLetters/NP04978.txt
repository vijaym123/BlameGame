Earlier this month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte sent a
letter
to both Secretary of State Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Johnson, asking if the Administration was planning to allow individuals from foreign countries who have contracted Ebola to come to the United States for treatment.
Reports indicate that an internal State Department
document
has been released, outlining a proposal to transport non-U.S. citizens who have contracted the Ebola virus to the United States; however, State Department officials have
said
that the document was never approved and there is no plan for such action.
