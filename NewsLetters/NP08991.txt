Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
While we always welcome the return of an American soldier home, there
are serious concerns and questions regarding the circumstances
surrounding Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's initial disappearance and how his
release was arranged.
The greatest concern is that the President's unilateral release of five
senior Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl
could have severe consequences for our deployed troops, and sets a
dangerous precedent that encourages the Taliban and other terrorist
organizations to capture American soldiers. Already this week Time
Magazine reported that the Taliban is emboldened to do just that. A
senior Taliban commander told Time, "It's better to kidnap one person
like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people. It has
encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an
important bird."
This is an outrage. The most troubling aspect of this situation is that
America's enemies are now encouraged and our deployed troops may be at
greater risk because of the way the President unilaterally conducted
this exchange.
I have joined the members of the House and Senate Armed Services and
Intelligence Committees in calling for a full investigation into the
exchange of the five Taliban commanders for his release.
The first major action on this will occur this Wednesday, June 11, when
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is set to appear before the House
Committee on Armed Services to answer questions about why the White
House failed to notify Congress 30 days prior to the President freeing
terrorists from Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl as he is statutorily
required to do. The purpose of the hearing is to examine the
circumstances of the exchange, and to discern the likelihood of the
five released Taliban leaders reengaging in hostile action against U.S.
troops.
In addition to investigating the exchange for Bergdahl, it is important
that we get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's
disappearance and whether or not he deserted his post.
There is information to that end coming forward from many sources
including men who served with Bergdahl, government and military
officials, and even Afghani villagers. It is critically important that
the facts of this case are sorted out to get a clear picture of what
happened on that day in 2011 when Bergdahl disappeared from his base.
His fellow soldiers and the families of the troops that were killed
while searching for him deserve nothing less than the truth, and I
expect a full military investigation into his disappearance and on how
he came to be captured by the Taliban.
I am working with my House colleagues on the Armed Services and
Intelligence Committees to ensure the American people get answers on
why five terrorists were set free, why the President violated the law,
the threats posed to deployed U.S. troops because of this exchange, and
how Bergdahl was captured in the first place.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Tipton: President's new EPA regulations would cause electricity costs
to skyrocket, kill jobs: The rules announced through the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) targeting coal based power plants could cost
224,000 jobs each year through 2030 according to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. Forty percent of the nation's electricity is generated by
coal-based power plants, and the Institute for Energy Research
estimates that Americans can expect to pay $200 more a year for
electricity as a result of the proposed rule. Read more

Tipton Tours Grand Mesa Mudslide: Congressman Tipton joined state and

conditions and determine additional threats posed by the mudslide to
the Collbran area. "This is an incredibly tough time for the Collbran

Tipton: EPA water rule will hurt small businesses: Congressman Tipton
questioned witnesses during a House Small Business Committee hearing to
examine the impact that the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
proposed rule to redefine "waters of the U.S." would have on small

comment period that ends on July 21, drastically expands the agency's
regulatory authority by redefining "waters of the U.S." under the Clean
Water Act (CWA) to include virtually every form of surface water
including tributaries and ditches. Read more

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
While
we
always
welcome
the
return
of
an
American
soldier
home,
there
are
serious
concerns
and
questions
regarding
the
circumstances
surrounding
Army
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl&#8217;s
initial
disappearance
and
how
his
release
was
arranged.
The
greatest
concern
is
that
the
President&#8217;s
unilateral
release
of
five
senior
Taliban
terrorists
from
Guantanamo
Bay
in
exchange
for
Bergdahl
could
have
severe
consequences
for
our
deployed
troops,
and
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
that
encourages
the
Taliban
and
other
terrorist
organizations
to
capture
American
soldiers.
Already
this
week
Time
Magazine
reported
that
the
Taliban
is
emboldened
to
do
just
that.
A
senior
Taliban
commander
told
Time,
&#8220;It&#8217;s
better
to
kidnap
one
person
like
Bergdahl
than
kidnapping
hundreds
of
useless
people.
It
has
encouraged
our
people.
Now
everybody
will
work
hard
to
capture
such
an
important
bird.&#8221;
This
is
an
outrage.
The
most
troubling
aspect
of
this
situation
is
that
America&#8217;s
enemies
are
now
encouraged
and
our
deployed
troops
may
be
at
greater
risk
because
of
the
way
the
President
unilaterally
conducted
this
exchange.
I
have
joined
the
members
of
the
House
and
Senate
Armed
Services
and
Intelligence
Committees
in
calling
for
a
full
investigation
into
the
exchange
of
the
five
Taliban
commanders
for
his
release.
The
first
major
action
on
this
will
occur
this
Wednesday,
June
11,
when
Defense
Secretary
Chuck
Hagel
is
set
to
appear
before
the
House
Committee
on
Armed
Services
to
answer
questions
about
why
the
White
House
failed
to
notify
Congress
30
days
prior
to
the
President
freeing
terrorists
from
Guantanamo
Bay
for
Bergdahl
as
he
is
statutorily
required
to
do.
The
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
examine
the
circumstances
of
the
exchange,
and
to
discern
the
likelihood
of
the
five
released
Taliban
leaders
reengaging
in
hostile
action
against
U.S.
troops.
In
addition
to
investigating
the
exchange
for
Bergdahl,
it
is
important
that
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
Bergdahl&#8217;s
disappearance
and
whether
or
not
he
deserted
his
post.
There
is
information
to
that
end
coming
forward
from
many
sources
including
men
who
served
with
Bergdahl,
government
and
military
officials,
and
even
Afghani
villagers.
It
is
critically
important
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
sorted
out
to
get
a
clear
picture
of
what
happened
on
that
day
in
2011
when
Bergdahl
disappeared
from
his
base.
His
fellow
soldiers
and
the
families
of
the
troops
that
were
killed
while
searching
for
him
deserve
nothing
less
than
the
truth,
and
I
expect
a
full
military
investigation
into
his
disappearance
and
on
how
he
came
to
be
captured
by
the
Taliban.
I
am
working
with
my
House
colleagues
on
the
Armed
Services
and
Intelligence
Committees
to
ensure
the
American
people
get
answers
on
why
five
terrorists
were
set
free,
why
the
President
violated
the
law,
the
threats
posed
to
deployed
U.S.
troops
because
of
this
exchange,
and
how
Bergdahl
was
captured
in
the
first
place.
