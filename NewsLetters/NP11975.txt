Yellen to Heller: Nevada Faces
Long Slog Towards
Recovery
Heller Asks Federal Reserve Chair about
Economic Recovery in Nevada, Minimum Wage,
Actual Unemployment
(Washington, D.C.)
At a
hearing yesterday of the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) questioned Janet
Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, about the
debate on minimum wage, actual unemployment
figures, and economic recovery in
Nevada.
When responding to questions about
Nevadas economy, Yellen stated,
It is still going to be a long slog
before things are back to normal in the
housing market in Nevada and some of those
hard-hit areas.
Regarding minimum wage, Chair Yellen
stated, Almost all economists think
that the minimum wage has two main effects.
One is to give higher wages to those who
continue to have jobs and were earning the
minimum wage, and then second there would
be some amount of negative impact on
unemployment as a consequence. And there is
a considerable debate about just what the
employment impact of it would be. CBO is as
qualified as anyone to evaluate that
literature
She also indicated that the figure for
individuals who are not fully employed or
are working part-time seeking additional
work is around 13 percent.
