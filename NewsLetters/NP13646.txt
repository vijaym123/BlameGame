Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Participates in Hearing on Iran
Earlier today, Congressman Cook participated in a House Foreign Affairs
Committee hearing on the Administration's nuclear deal with Iran.
Secretary of State John Kerry testified before the committee and took
members' questions.
Congressman Cook has been deeply concerned about the deal because of
its one-sided concessions to Iran. The deal would ease sanctions
without demanding that Iran dismantle any of its nuclear program or
even halt uranium enrichment.
Said Cook, "President Obama brought us to the verge of war against the
Syria just a few months ago over its use of chemical weapons. Iran has
been the chief financier of the Syrian regime and the Hezbollah
terrorists that are leading the fight against the Syrian rebel forces.
These are the same terrorists that killed hundreds of American marines,
sailors, and soldiers in a terrorist attack in Beirut back in the
1980s."
Iran's President Rouhani was a leading Iranian military figure at the
time of the Beirut attacks. Rep. Cook submitted the following question
for Secretary Kerry and looks forward to a response:
"Does the President really believe that a regime that is a state
supporter of terrorism and is complicit in the use of chemical weapons
will suddenly give up their pursuit of nuclear weapons? Can we really
trust an Iranian President with the blood of hundreds of Americans on
his hands?"
Innovation Act
Last Thursday, Congressman Cook voted for H.R. 3309, the Innovation
Act. The Act is smart policy for America. Abusive patent litigation can
cost tens of billions of dollars each year and, as a result, can hinder
progress and job creation. This legislation incentivizes innovation,
which will allow entrepreneurs to focus on the technological
advancements that improve our lives and strengthen our economy, while
discouraging costly and frivolous lawsuits.
The expectation is that the Innovation Act will substantially reduce
the "trolling" issue within the patent system and maximize the utility
of the Patent and Trademark Office to inventors. By reducing the threat
of expensive and meritless litigation, the Innovation Act will foster
ingenuity and economic security for the benefit of all Americans.
Being on the cutting edge of innovation is one of the qualities that
sets America apart. Congressman Cook is proud to support this piece of
legislation as it protects and encourages creativity, growth, and
because it creates jobs.
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act
Congressman Cook is pleased that H.R. 2019, the Gabriella Miller Kids
First Research Act of 2013, will be up for a vote this week in the
House. He is a cosponsor of H.R. 2019, legislation which will expand
pediatric research through the National Institutes of Health. It
prioritizes funding for scientific research of pediatric diseases and
disorders such as cancer and autism.

Participates

Hearing
on
Iran
Earlier

Congressman

participated
in
a
House
Foreign

Committee
hearing
on
the
Administration&#8217;s
nuclear
deal
with
Iran.
Secretary

Congressman

Iran.
The

would
ease

that
Iran

or

Said
Cook,
&#8220;President

brought
us
to
the

of
war
against
the
Syria
just
a
few
months
ago
over
its
use
of

Iran
has

the
chief
financier
of
the
Syrian
regime
and
the
Hezbollah
terrorists
that
are
leading
the
fight
against
the

rebel
forces.
These
are
the
same
terrorists
that
killed
hundreds
of
American
marines,
sailors,
and
soldiers
in
a
terrorist
attack
in
Beirut
back
in

Rep.

and

will
suddenly
give
up
