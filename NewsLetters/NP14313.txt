Dear Friends,
It&rsquo;s open enrollment season for the new health care insurance marketplace here in California, known as Covered California. In order to be covered on January 1st, you must enroll by December 15th, 2013. Otherwise, you may enroll as late as March 31st, 2014, and your coverage will start 30 days after enrollment.
With the
Covered California website
up and running, I want to make sure that those of you who want to sign up for health insurance have the tools you need to make an informed decision about which health plan is best for you.
During my telephone town hall last Wednesday, many of you expressed your desire for assistance in navigating the Covered California website, and your need for answers to specific questions about the new health insurance options available under the Affordable Care Act.
To this end, I will be holding an event entitled
Healthcare 411: Information &amp; Advice about the New Healthcare Law
on Saturday, November 23, 2013 from 11:00am-4:00pm at the City of San Mateo Public Library. There you can take advantage of Covered California website workshops with Certified Covered California Educators, a self-service enrollment center with Educator guidance, a Small Business Majority presentation for employers who want information about Covered California&rsquo;s small business options, one-on-one appointments with Covered California representatives, and FREE preventative health screenings.
