Dear Friend,
This
month, we commemorate the rich and storied history of African-Americans
and our contributions to American history. We have achieved astounding
accomplishments, and due in large part to those contributions, our
country is as strong as it has ever been. The scores of African-American
musicians, artists, pioneers and activists, have told the story of
this country, from where weve been to where we are now.
We
are by no means a perfect nation, which is why I continue to fight for
the needs of those I serve. There is still much work to be done. Just
as the great men and women who fought for freedom, equality, and social
justice we must do the same for future generations.
As I
reflect on the Civil Rights movement,I know that I would not be where I
am today if it were not for the giants upon whose shoulders I stand.
When faced with racial barriers they pressed forward, and their
persistence led to some of the most significant strides in American history.
Because of their courage and sacrifice, all Americans
regardless of race, will enjoy a better quality of life for years to
come.
Throughout Black history month, I will go to the floor of the
House of Representatives to honor many of the pillars of the civil
rights movement, who have played significant roles in Louisiana. Last
week, I spoke about
Leah Chase ( click here to watch ),and her role helping to facilitate the Civil
Rights movement in New Orleans. Other luminaries I will acknowledge in
the coming weeks will be:
Norman Francis, Lolis Eli, Llewelyn
Soniat, TJ Jimison, Ruby Bridges, The McDonogh Three: (Leona Tate,
Tessie Prevost, Gail Etienne), Rudy Lombard, Lionell Collins, and Jerome
Big Duck Smith.
These great men and women are my
inspiration, and exemplify the sacrifice necessary to affect real change in
society. Moving forward we must continue to fight injustice in all of
its forms, stand up in the face of oppression, and speak up when our
voices are being stifled. There is no better way than this to honor the
legacy of those who have come before us.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
