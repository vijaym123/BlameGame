Honored to serve you in the 114 th
Congress
I am humbled and honored to begin my service to Southwest Washington for a third term in Congress. Over these next two years, I will continue to work tirelessly to promote the interests of Southwest Washingtons citizens.
Check out this brief clip of Dan and Abigail joining me for the swearing-in ceremony!
Restoring working hours for Americans
With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the definition of a full time work week was slashed from 40 hours to 30 hours. Although the employer mandate has been delayed multiple times, in anticipation many employers have had to cut workers hours in order to avoid the mandates costly requirements.
Yesterday, I helped the U.S. House pass the bipartisan Save American Workers Act in an effort to reestablish Americas traditional 40 hour work week, and thus protect Americans from losing their hours at work. Along with protecting the work hours of Americans, if enacted, the bipartisan legislation will reduce monetary burdens on small businesses and enable them to hire more employees.
At a time when unemployment is still high in our region and businesses are just beginning to recover from the recession, we must work to create more economic opportunities
not limit them.

Bipartisan Women's Caucus Gavel Passing
It has been an honor to co-chair the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues in the 113th Congress. One of the highlights of this past year was the bipartisan effort to tackle Human Trafficking by spreading awareness and passing important legislation.
I'm excited to "pass the gavel" onto my colleagues, Congresswoman Kristi Noem and Congresswoman Matsui for the 114th Congress.
