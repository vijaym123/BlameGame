&ldquo;Probably the very first thing to do is to go after the EPA regulations.&rdquo;
-- Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK),

Dear Friend,
If Democrats lose the Senate this year, we won&rsquo;t have to wait long to feel the repercussions of that loss.
The GOP has already threatened more shutdowns if they win, and Sen. Inhofe -- who denies the existence of climate change -- says he wants to go after the President&rsquo;s proposed carbon emissions rule. And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg. This year&rsquo;s races could jeopardize everything Democrats have worked for. We need your help to keep fighting -- give $5 before our FEC deadline on Tuesday.

The Tea Party-led House has already passed a budget that would destroy Medicare as we know it. The GOP has repeatedly said no to equal pay for equal work and no to a higher minimum wage. A Republican takeover of the Senate would cement the Tea Party&rsquo;s gains and force Democrats to play defense for the next two years. We can&rsquo;t let that happen -- not after all we&rsquo;ve accomplished.
The carbon rules Sen. Inhofe says he wants to &ldquo;go after&rdquo; are one of the few substantive steps we&rsquo;ve taken toward combatting climate change. We can&rsquo;t afford to give even an inch on this issue. Your support helps us stand tall against the obstructionists, the climate change deniers, and the other extremists who make up the GOP. Give $5 and help us keep Massachusetts out of Republican hands.
Thanks for your help.
