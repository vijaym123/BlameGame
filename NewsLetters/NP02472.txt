Janine,
Today is Amis birthday, and this week he's been receiving many cards in the mail.
We can assure you-- he's having a great birthday. But this is our chance to make it his best celebration yet.
Tonight, we're going to send Ami the list of supporters who have chipped in for his birthday. Can we send him 50 names for his 50th birthday?We're close-- we only need 30 people to pitch in today.secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bdaybera?refcode=J3
Will you help us reach 50 supporters by midnight? Chip in $5, $50 or any amount right now by clicking here. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bdaybera?refcode=J3
Tomorrow will be too late-- help us celebrate Ami's 50th birthday with a small gift today.
Thanks for making this a memorable day!
Team Bera

Friend,
I wanted to make sure you saw the email below.
Today is Ami&rsquo;s birthday and the team still needs 14 supporters to reach their goal by midnight--
will you give $5 to be one of the 50 supporters chipping in today for Ami&#39;s 50th?
They are so close and only need a few more people to step up. If you can help, now is a good time to give.
Thanks for helping us celebrate!
Janine
