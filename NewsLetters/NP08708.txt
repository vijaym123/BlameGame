Dear Friends,
This week I wanted to share with you a recent op-ed I wrote in Forbes
about my work to prevent taxpayers from being left on the hook for
fraudulent Obamacare subsidies. As I explain below, more than one
million Americans who signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges
may be receiving an incorrect subsidy amount because of President
Obama's reckless decision to move ahead with this disastrous law before
any system was in place to verify eligibility. I am fighting back by
introducing the No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2014. I hope
you'll read more below and take a minute to join me in this effort by
becoming a Citizen Cosponsor of my bill HERE
.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress
Let's At Least Make Sure People Receiving Obamacare Subsidies Are
Eligible for Them
from Forbes
Consider that after all of the President's unilateral changes to his
signature law, Obamacare, we have now reached the point where the
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cannot even calculate
what fiscal impact this law will have on our nation's deficits. In
addition, while the individual mandate that all Americans purchase
health insurance or be penalized has been described as "central" to the
law's implementation, the estimate for the amount of people who will be
subjected to this tax has been slashed by a third because of enrollment
exemptions given by this Administration.
Now reports from the Washington Post and the Associated Press confirm
one of my biggest concerns with the implementation of this boondoggle.
More than one million Americans who signed up for healthcare on the
federal exchange may be receiving an incorrect tax payer subsidy for
their plans due to the fact that the Obama Administration pushed this
law through before the systems were in place to accurately confirm
eligibility. This isn't mere incompetence on the part of the White
House; no, this was a direct result of the Administration's insistence
on moving forward with their arbitrary October 1st, 2013 open
enrollment date, regardless of the consequences.
Consider the problem this presents, as there is currently no real time
system in place to ensure only those who qualify for subsidies receive
them. This means that hard working American taxpayers may be left on
the hook for potentially billions in fraudulent subsidy payments.
Furthermore, it means that someone who simply fills out their Obamacare
enrollment application incorrectly could be hounded for years by the
Internal Revenue Service for back taxes owed on improper payments.
This problem was entirely preventable, and that's why, in the wake of a
clandestine holiday rules change that delayed income verification
provisions in Obamacare last summer, I introduced legislation that
would have prevented any Obamacare subsidies from being doled out until
a system was in place to make sure that only those determined eligible
would receive them. The House acted on this legislation, passing it in
a bipartisan vote last September to help protect American taxpayers
from rampant fraud and abuse.
Unfortunately, instead of giving my bill the consideration it deserved,
the Senate stripped the verification provision contained in the bill
and replaced it with language requiring a mere report to Congress by
Health and Human Services' (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the end
of last year, certifying that there is a system in place to verify
incomes before subsidies are paid out.
Predictably, this weakened income verification language has failed, as
we now learn from news reports - not the White House - that over a
million Americans are potentially receiving an amount in error. That is
why I have now introduced H.R. 4805, the No Subsidies Without
Verification Act of 2014. The tax credits and cost-sharing assistance
for Obamacare premiums administered by HHS is estimated to amount to a
staggering $10 billion per month, making this one of the largest
entitlement programs in the nation.
H.R. 4805 would simply require an
income verification system to be put in place before any additional
taxpayer subsidies are given out.
Even if one were to ignore the millions of Americans who have lost
their insurance plans, their doctors and hospitals, and who are
struggling to manage spiking premiums, Obamacare is a complete disaster
whose costs cannot even be calculated by the CBO, Congress' neutral
score keeper. Implementation of the law has become so embarrassing to
this Administration that HHS has even decided to stop administering
monthly enrollment reports. My commonsense legislation would simply
slow the bleeding this law is having on American taxpayers, and I look
forward to working with my colleagues to move it forward.

Dear

I

Let's

Forbes
Consider
that
after
all
of
the
President&#8217;s
unilateral
changes
to
his
signature
law,
Obamacare,
we
have
now
reached
the
point
where
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
cannot
even
calculate
what
fiscal
impact
this
law
will
have
on
our
nation&#8217;s
deficits.
In
addition,
while
the
individual
mandate
that
all
Americans
purchase
health
insurance
or
be
penalized
has
been
described
as
&#8220;central&#8221;

the

implementation,
the
estimate
for
the
amount
of
people
who
will
be
subjected
to
this
tax
has
been
slashed
by
a
third
because
of
enrollment
exemptions
given
by
this
Administration.
Now
reports
from
the
Washington
Post
and
the
Associated
Press
confirm
one
of
my
biggest
concerns
with
the
implementation
of
this
boondoggle.
More
than
one
million
Americans
who
signed
up
for
healthcare
on
the
federal
exchange
may
be
receiving
an
incorrect
tax
payer
subsidy
for
their
plans
due
to
the
fact
that
the
Obama
Administration
pushed
this
law
through
before
the
systems
were
in
place
to
accurately
confirm
eligibility.
This
isn&#8217;t
mere
incompetence
on
the
part
of
the
White
House;
no,
this
was
a
direct
result
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
insistence
on
moving
forward
with
their
arbitrary
October
1st,
2013
open
enrollment
date,
regardless
of
the
consequences.
Consider
the
problem
this
presents,
as
there
is
currently
no
real
time
system
in
place
to
ensure
only
those
who
qualify
for
subsidies
receive
them.
This
means
that
hard
working
American
taxpayers
may
be
left
on
the
hook
for
potentially
billions
in
fraudulent
subsidy
payments.
Furthermore,
it
means
that
someone
who
simply
fills
out
their
Obamacare
enrollment
application
incorrectly
could
be
hounded
for
years
by
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
for
back
taxes
owed
on
improper
payments.
This
problem
was
entirely
preventable,
and
that&#8217;s
why,
in
the
wake
of
a
clandestine
holiday
rules
change
that
delayed
income
verification
provisions
in
Obamacare
last
summer,
I
introduced
legislation
that
would
have
prevented
any
Obamacare

from
being
doled
out
until
a
system
was
in

to
make

that
only

The
House

this
legislation,
passing
it
in
a

last
September
to
help
protect
American
taxpayers
from
rampant

Unfortunately,
instead
of
giving
my

the
consideration
it

the
Senate
stripped
the
verification
provision
contained
in
the
bill
and
replaced
it
with

certifying
that
there

Predictably,
this
weakened
income

language
has
failed,
as
we
now
learn
from
news
reports
&#8211;
not
the
White

&#8211;
that
over
a
million
Americans
are
potentially
receiving
an
amount
in
error.
That
is
why
I
have
now
introduced
H.R.
4805,
the
No
Subsidies
Without
Verification
Act
of
2014.
The
tax
credits
and
cost-sharing
assistance
for
Obamacare
premiums
administered
by
HHS
is
estimated
to
amount
to
a
staggering
$10
billion
per
month,
making
this
one
of
the
largest
entitlement
programs
in
the
nation.
H.R.
4805
would
simply
require
an
income
verification
system
to
be
put
in
place
before
any
additional
taxpayer
subsidies
are
given
out.
Even
if
one
were
to
ignore
the
millions
of
Americans
who
have
lost
their
insurance
plans,
their
doctors
and
hospitals,
and

Obamacare
is
a
complete
disaster
whose
costs
cannot
even

the
CBO,
Congress&#8217;

Implementation
of
the

has
become

this

that
HHS
has
even

to
stop
administering
monthly

reports.
My

the
bleeding
this
law
is
having
on
American
taxpayers,
and
I
look

to
working
with
my
colleagues
to

it
