We're drowning, and we just don't know what else to do.
President Obama, Vice President Biden and Nancy Pelosi all emailed you asking for your help. And we were well on our way to our goal. But then NPR reported that a single right-wing megadonor gave
$10 MILLION
to Karl Rove's group.
Here's what that means: our goals just skyrocketed. And now we need 1O,OOO more donations tonight to keep pace with Rove&rsquo;s Obama-bashing ads.
If we don't hit this goal, we might as well just pack up and go home. We hate to ask you again -- but can you answer the President&rsquo;s call-to-action today?
