Dear Friends,
On Saturday night, the U.S. and other
world powers reached a deal with Iran to limit their nuclear weapons
program. In exchange for the temporary, limited lifting of economic
sanctions, Iran agreed to halt or scale back parts of its nuclear
program.
France called this deal between Obama and Iran a
suckers deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a
historic mistake.
The stated goal from this administration is to
prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but there is nothing in
this deal that moves us in that direction. Iran will still be able to
enrich uranium.
Iran will not be required to destroy any
centrifuges, and they will be able to replace centrifuges that become
inoperable. The pact does little to reverse Irans nuclear ambitions and
instead makes the world a more dangerous place.
The current
economic sanctions have been effective in curbing Irans nuclear
activities, but this new deal will ease these sanctions with the agreement
that Iran temporarily freeze its nuclear program. However, Iran has
continually hidden their development of these weapons, and they already
have the technology and capability to develop a nuclear weapon. Experts
suggest they are within a year of having a military nuclear
capability.
Instead of easing effective sanctions for a six month
period, we should be tightening existing sanctions until a long term deal
can be reached. The United States must take a strong stance to
prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. If they do not agree to roll back their
nuclear program, then they should fear stronger
sanctions.
Unfortunately, this deal does not require the approval of Congress, but
there will be a strong movement in the Senate to move ahead on legislation
already passed by the House of Representatives. I will continue to
support congressional efforts to halt Iran's nuclear activities. Iran
has actively worked against the U.S. in the region and is one the
largest state sponsors of terrorism. This type of behavior is unacceptable,
and the U.S. must take appropriate measures to safeguard our
interests. As vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and
a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will do everything
I can to protect the safety of Americans at home and
abroad.
I discussed the many issues with the nuclear agreement yesterday on
ABCs This Week. You can watch the video here:

Also last week, I met with the
president and administration officials on the possibility for a deal. I
discussed my concerns about a deal with Iran with Bret Baier on Fox News.
