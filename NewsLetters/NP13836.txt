Dear Friend,
Families all across America will come
together this week to commemorate the spirited occasion of Thanksgiving,
which is a time to appreciate what we have and celebrate with our
loved ones who have shared our joys and sorrows throughout the
year.
Among the many things I have to be thankful for this holiday, I am truly honored and privileged to represent New
York's 13th Congressional District.
In Congress, I will
continue to fight againstcuts in vital programs, including SNAP, which are
crucial during these harsh economic times, especially during the
holidays.
As we embrace the season with hope for a better
future for our community and country, I wish you all a blessed and safe
Thanksgiving!

HAPPY HANUKKAH
The story of Hanukkah
is a lot like the story of America: when people dedicate themselves
to a vision, the impossible can become possible.
To everyone
celebrating this spirit of joy and unity in our district, across America,
and all throughout the world, I warmly extend a very Happy Hanukkah.
