Dear Friend,
Our team has been working hard all spring to collect the 10,000 signatures we need to get Ed on the ballot this November. We&rsquo;re going to get there with plenty of room to spare -- and that's thanks to the dedication and sacrifice of all our volunteers and support from folks like you.
This is a big milestone, and I want to make sure we hit the ground running in this next phase of the race. You can help us get off to a great start in May by
making a $5 contribution to Ed&rsquo;s campaign.
The Republicans want to take over the Senate in 2014, just like they took over the House in 2010. We&rsquo;re not going to let them take out Ed. Let&rsquo;s give the boss everything he needs to run the kind of campaign Massachusetts wants and deserves.
Thanks,
David
