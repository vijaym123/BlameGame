Curbing Wasteful Government
Regulations
2/4/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted for H.R. 50, the
Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. This bill enhances
the ability of Congress, federal agencies, and the public to
identify federal mandates that may impose undue harm on state, local, and
tribal governments and on the private sector by providing more
complete information about the cost of such mandates and by holding Congress
and federal agencies accountable for imposing unfunded
mandates.
"H.R. 50 is a serious package
of reforms that will help prevent states, localities, and job creators
and entrepreneurs from being at the mercy of unelected bureaucrats
handing down unfunded mandates and regulations. The people who make our
economy grow deserve the opportunity to have more transparency, and
that's what H.R. 50 brings. This principled bill leaves out the fine
print and allows everyone involved in the regulatory process to play by
the same rules."
