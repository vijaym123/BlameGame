Dear Friend:
The past two weeks have been jam-packed
with events across the district and new
developments coming out of Washington.
As North and Northwest
Floridianswere dealing with cold and
icy conditions from the latest winter
storm, the President deliveredhis
fifth State of the Union address to a
joint-session of Congress. Below you
will find my reaction to the President's
speech and the latest work we are doing on
behalf of Florida's Second Congressional
District.
Meeting with our Veterans
Floridas Second Congressional
District is home to thousands of American
heroes, with 72,000 veterans calling one of
our 14 counties home. I recently had
the pleasure of meeting with some of our
local veterans at a Veterans of Foreign
Wars (VFW) meeting in Marianna.I was
privildged to have the opportunity to
discuss with them the work I am doing in
Congress to ensure that military retirees
face no decrease in their cost-of-living
adjustments (COLA) as a result of the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement.
I appreciated the opportunity to share
with these heroes some of the positive
results that came out of my vote for the
budget agreement. Here are a few of
the highlights:
Provides a
1% pay raise for
troops.
Provides troops, military families,
and retirees
$32.7 billion in Defense
Health Services.
Funds VA at
$147.9 billion .
Provides
$4.2 million veterans and
survivors in disability compensation
programs; post?9?11 GI bill education
benefits for
$764K veterans; vocational
rehabilitation and employment training
for
$175K veterans.
Increases VA medical funding to
$43.6 billion.
Provides
$7.2 billion in medical
health care.
Provides
$103 million in suicide
prevention.
Provides
$246 million to combat
Traumatic Brain Injury.
Provides
$6.2 billion to homeless
veterans.
Encouraging Job Growth
As a third generation small business
owner, I understand the economic challenges
facing job creators and hardworking
families across North and Northwest
Florida. After a recent visit
toTallahasseesC.W.
Roberts Contracting, Inc., one of
Floridas largest asphalt
contractors, it couldnt be clearer
how the decisions made in Washington, D.C.
impact hardworking families in Leon
County. That is why I have
consistently voted to reduce crushing
regulations on small businesses, keep taxes
low for job creators and individuals alike,
and restore certainty to the marketplace so
businesses can expand and hire new
employees.
Achieving Certainty for Farmers
As the only member from Florida on the
Farm Bill conference committee, I am
pleased that both parties and both chambers
were able to come together for the good of
the American people and pass a Farm Bill
Conference Report. This legislation
will restore certainty for hardworking
farming families across North and Northwest
Florida.
This legislation provided the House with
two options. We could vote for a Farm
Bill that empowers farmers and vulnerable
families with meaningful reforms in
agriculture and nutrition policy, or we
could vote against it and stick with Nancy
Pelosis costly, big government bill
from six years ago. Fortunately, a
bipartisan majority joined me in voting
both for the bill and for a change in
Washingtons culture. Rest
assured, I will continue to fight for our
farmers even after the President signs this
common sense, cost-conscious Farm Bill into
law.
Empowering Vulnerable
Families
I am pleased that Republicans and
Democrats supported a provision in the Farm
Bill Conference Report that
Iintroduced andadvanced to
empower vulnerable families witha
renewed opportunity for earned
success.
This legislation represent the first
reforms to the food stamp program since the
successful welfare reforms of 1996,
changing the culture of federal assistance
programs and moving recipients off of
government dependency to work and
self-sufficiency. The bill empowers and
incentivizes up to 10 states to operate
pilot projects to engage able-bodied adults
in TANF-type work and job training programs
with the goal of returning individuals to
work. It also builds on the original
amendment I offered in the House to provide
the skills necessary through enhanced
funding for infrastructure and employment
and training - all designed to give
individuals ahandup to a better
future for themselves and their
families.
Reaction to State of the Union
Address
The Presidents speech called for
a year of action.
Unfortunately, its his last five
years of inaction that resulted in a record
number of people living in poverty, fewer
jobs and lower wages, and a sense that the
American Dream is slipping away. I am
angered that instead of working with
Republicans in Congress to restore
certainty and empower struggling families,
the President instead doubled down on his
threat to use pen and phone to circumvent
members who disagree with his
agenda.
If the President is serious about taking
action, lets come together and
replace the disastrous health care law with
patient-centered, cost effective
reforms. Lets focus on
improving job growth rather than imposing
regulations. Lets stop the
threats of executive action designed to
divide us. The American people
deserve better and our Constitution demands
it.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
United States Representative
