&ldquo;The plan calls for a $125 million budget for Americans for Prosperity&hellip;&rdquo;beyond the biggest, boldest, broadest effort AFP has ever undertaken.&rdquo; -
Politico , 4/22/2015
Dear Friend,
The Koch brothers and their outside networks are trying harder -- and spending more cash -- than ever before to win elections in 2016 and through the foreseeable future.
They&rsquo;re not waiting for next year. They&rsquo;re doing their work right now, with plans to spend
$125 million in 2015 alone
through their dark-money backed group, Americans for Prosperity, to get a leg up. Citizens United
unleashed all this outside cash into our political process.
And if we let the Kochs win the organizing game now, Massachusetts families will be the ones who lose. It&rsquo;s the last day of the month -- and our last chance to reach $12,000 in April. We can&rsquo;t let the Koch network get ahead of us -- contribute $5, $10, or whatever you can to put us over our goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I&rsquo;m proud to have you with me as we work to improve the lives of middle class families everywhere.
Thank you for all of your support.
