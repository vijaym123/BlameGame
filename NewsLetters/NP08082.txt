Dear
Friend,
Over the next two weeks I will be
competing against my congressional colleagues in the Online All-Star
Competition to see who can gain the most new friends and followers on social
media. This year's competition will track new followers on Facebook,
Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.
The top finishers in the
competition get not only bragging rights, but also an expanded network to
communicate with in a way that is both informative and
fun.
My social platforms include information about bills in Congress,
discussions about newsworthy topics and information about events happening
at home in Wisconsin or in Washington, DC. I also frequently will
share photos, videos and links to online resources to provide my friends
and followers with up-to-date information and insight into the issues
you care about most.
Please follow me on Twitter, like
me on Facebook, or find me on my other social media platforms today.
It's easy: just click the icons below and
connect!
Sincerely,
What issues are important to you? Agriculture Budget &amp; Fiscal
