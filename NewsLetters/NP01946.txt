Dear Friends,
Last week, I introduced the
Social Security 2100 Act
to cut taxes for seniors, strengthen benefits, and ensure Social Security remains strong through this century (pictured below).
On Sunday, March 29th, please join me for a Community Forum on Social Security where I will discuss my proposal and take your questions on this vital program:
Community Forum on Social Security
Sunday, March 29th, 3PM-5PM
Glastonbury High School, Cafeteria
330 Hubbard Street, Glastonbury, CT 06033
Map it!
While Social Security remains the nation&rsquo;s bedrock retirement program, many do not believe it will be there for them when they retire. I am proud to have proposed
a common sense path forward to strengthen benefits now while ensuring Social Security will be here through the next century , and look forward to sharing this plan with you Sunday.
Please RSVP online above or by calling my office at 860-278-8888. I look forward to seeing you there.
NOTE: If you&rsquo;re a student in the Manchester area, please join me for my next Student Forum on College Affordability Monday, March 30th from 5PM-6PM (Manchester Community College, Great Path Academy, Community Commons Room). Refreshments will be provided and those who attend will have an opportunity to speak throughout.
