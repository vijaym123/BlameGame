Dear Friends,
Today, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House
of Representatives in memory of Sgt. Greg Moore, who was shot and
killed while doing his job to protect the citizens of Coeur
dAlene.
Sgt. Moore is among 71 Idaho peace officers who have died in the
line of duty. His name will be added to the Idaho Peace Officer Memorial
in Meridian at next years Peace Officers Memorial Day
ceremony.
Here is the tribute I submitted into the Congressional
Record:
I come to the floor today on Peace Officers Memorial Day to
acknowledge and honor the life and service of Coeur dAlene Police Sgt.
Greg Moore. Sgt. Moore was shot and killed in the line of duty
May 5, 2015.
Gregory King Moore was born in Walla Walla,
Wash. He attended Walla Walla High School and Walla Walla Community
College before moving to Idaho to attend the University of
Idaho. After graduating from the University of Idaho he joined the Asotin
County Sheriffs Department before transferring to the Coeur dAlene
Police Department.
During his tenure at the Coeur dAlene Police
Department he served as a Patrol Officer, Field Training Officer, and
School Resource Officer.
I did not have the pleasure of
knowing Sgt. Moore personally. But the outpouring of support from
his community tells me much about his character and service. More
than 4,000 people attended his funeral, including officers from across
Idaho, as well as Washington, Montana and Canada. This outpouring
of support warmed my heart and reminded me of the goodness of the
people of Idaho. I hope this public support was comforting to Sgt.
Moores family.
Sgt. Moores 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these
words to honor his father:
My dad was the best. He would tell
me anything, and was always there for me. All the times I was sad or
lonely, he would be right by my side to comfort me. Dad would also
reassure me that he was OK going to work by telling me he was Batman,
because he worked at night, had lots of gadgets, was skilled and charming.
Also, wherever we went, he would know someone that was there. I would
always wonder how and why he knew those people. Dads favorite place
to eat was Qdoba. It ended up being my favorite place as well. He was
a Boston fan and he has gone to a couple of games, but I know he would
have liked to see more. Every day, though, almost like tradition, we
would wrestle on the ground, and try to beat each other. Ive only won
once, but I have learned so many things from him. I love him so much
because he was a good dad, always helping people. And I want everyone
to know that he is the best.
Coeur dAlene Police Chief Lee
White said, Greg was part of a proud profession, and an even prouder
police department. Greg did things right. He was a leader, he was a
supervisor, and he was not satisfied sitting at a desk. In the end, and
the reason were here today, is that he personified the oath that we
take when we raise our right hand and were sworn in. Greg was killed
protecting the life and property and way of life of the citizens of
Coeur dAlene, Idaho. He will never be forgotten.
Throughout
Idaho hundreds of vehicles are now displaying a decal that reads K27
in honor of Sergeant Moores call number. I would like to add my
voice to those that honored Sergeant Moore by closing with phrase that
had passed over the lips of those thousands who have honored Sergeant
Moore over the past week.
K27 rest in
peace.
Sgt. Moore is among 44 U.S. officers killed in the line of duty in
2015. Last year, 133 died. I hope youll join me in praying for Sgt.
Moore, his family and the families of all fallen officers who sacrifice
themselves in the name of public safety.
Thank you ,
