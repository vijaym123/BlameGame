Update from Senator Bob Corker
April 5,
2014
TennCare Waiver Request Secured
After working
with state and federal officials, Senators Corker and Lamar Alexander
announced on Tuesday that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) has granted a portion of TennCares waiver request that provides
Tennessee an additional $80 million for the Essential Access Hospital
payments in the absence of Tennessee Medicaid disproportionate share
hospital (DSH) program funding for this current fiscal year. The
waiver also adds Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga to the Public
Hospital Supplemental Payment (PHSP) Pool, which includes $30 million of
funding for the hospital.
Im pleased CMS has granted a
portion of TennCares waiver request, ensuring Tennessee hospitals can
continue to provide uninsured and low-income patients with vital health
care services, Corker said. While this partial waiver is only a
temporary fix, I remain committed to working with Senator Alexander to find
a permanent solution as soon as possible so Tennessee patients,
doctors and hospitals are not faced with this uncertainty each
year.
Tennessee is the only state in the nation that does not have
permanent access to the Medicaid DSH program.
Tennessee
hospitals provided more than $700 million in unreimbursed TennCare costs
last year. In addition to the unreimbursed costs, Tennessee hospitals
provided $970 million in charity care and lost an additional $730 million
on services provided to Medicare enrollees. This resulted in over
$2.4 billion in unreimbursed cost from charity care and government funded
health care programs.
In past years, with the strong
bipartisan and bicameral support of the Tennessee Congressional delegation,
Congress passed legislation that included a partial payment of the
Medicaid DSH reimbursement for Tennessee hospitals.
Ensuring the Internet Remains Free and
Open
Senator Corker joined 34 of his Senate
Republican colleagues this week in sending a letter to the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), seeking
clarification regarding the recent announcement that NTIA intends to
relinquish responsibility of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
functions, the system for assigning website addresses, to the global
multistakeholder community.
With the Internet playing an
increasingly critical role in providing economic and educational
opportunity for Americans as well as powerfully promoting liberty abroad, the
United States must ensure the Internet remains free and open, and out
of the hands of foreign governments or bad actors, Corker
said.

Ukraine Bill Allows Congress to Speak with One
Voice
Senator Corker, ranking member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement
on Monday after the House of Representatives passed the Senate Ukraine
bill that he coauthored:
Passage of this bill allows
Congress to speak with one voice in support of the Ukrainian people and
against Russian aggression, said Corker. Along with our European
partners, the U.S. must demonstrate long-term resolve to deter any further
Russian intervention in Ukraine and the region, including imposing
additional economic sanctions that will exact real costs for Putins
actions in Crimea.
On Thursday, President Obama signed the bill
into law.

Congress : Like the rest of America, Corker is fed up with Congress not
doing anything. His success in changing that remains a work in
progress... From the day he came to Washington in 2007, the silver-haired
61-year-old has made it clear he wants to be a player and jumped feet-first
into some of the most complicated issues facing Congress
from
Dodd-Frank to a mortgage industry overhaul to what should be done about the
slaughter in Syria The senator, like most politicians, insists that
hes not thinking past his current office (though he was quick to shoot
down the prospect of becoming a Senate lifer
la West Virginias
Robert Byrd, who died in office at the age of 92). I still look at the
term as a lease, Corker insists. I dont really look beyond that.
Im not just saying that, I really dont. In doing so, I never feel
handcuffed politically, he says. I just feel like I can call em like
I see em and always be direct and transparent... Read more
