We&rsquo;re in a tough race -- one of the toughest in the country. Just look at what&rsquo;s happened this month:
FIRST:
Cheri was named one of the MOST vulnerable Democrats in the country.
THEN:
Boehner announced Cheri&rsquo;s one of his TOP targets in 2016.
David, we know it&rsquo;s only February. But if we&rsquo;re going to keep Illinois&rsquo; 17th district blue, we have to get to work immediately.
Will you add your name to stand with Cheri at this critical moment?
Your support last election made the difference.
We can do it again -- and keep fighting to protect Medicare, Social Security and Illinois&rsquo; middle class families -- but only if we act now. David, can we count on your support? http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-Back
Thanks,
Team Bustos
