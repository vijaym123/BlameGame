May is Foster Care Month

C are Month
Recent reports suggest a majority of children involved in sex trafficking are either currently in foster care or have been involved with the child welfare system in the past.
Of children reported missing to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children who are also likely sex trafficking victims, 60 percent were in foster care or group homes when they ran away.
That is why the House of Representatives recently passed H.R. 4058, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act.
The legislation is designed to prevent the sex trafficking of youth in Americas foster care system and reduce this vulnerability.
After passage Congressman Dave Camp (R-Midland) said, it is unacceptable that foster care is leaving youth vulnerable to becoming victims of sex trafficking.
We can do better.
We must ensure that foster care creates a stable, supportive environment for children so they can have the tools to lead healthy, successful lives.
I commend the hard work Dave Reichert and all Committee Members put into this bipartisan legislation that will better protect youth in foster care and combat this terrible crime.
