Celebrating North Dakota's 125 Years
>From the adventures of Lewis and Clark, to the rough riding days of
Teddy Roosevelt and now the unprecedented growth that heeds national
attention, North Dakota has had 125 years of unique and defining
stories that have created a rich history. That history is built not
just on events, but the deep pride and strong sense of community that
has - and continues to - resonate throughout North Dakota's home and
families.
North Dakota's pride comes from the rich heritage of our Native
brothers and sisters and the fields and ranches that have become
responsible for feeding the world.
It comes from the generations of families who have called the prairie
and badlands home. Who have endured the long, cold winters and fallen
in love with the perfection of summer.
It comes from the liquid gold of wheat before harvest and movement of
the sun being shadowed by miles upon miles of sunflowers.
North Dakota's pride comes from the unique sense of smallness we get
from standing in a vast prairie, and from being greeted with a
two-finger wave over the steering wheel of every passing car.
We can see it in our neighbors at the football games on Friday night
and again at the potluck dinners after church on Sundays, and when we
support our friends with hot dish and a prayer.
We see it in the ability of our state's Democrats and Republicans,
Vikings and Packers fans who might not agree on many issues, but still
find a way to get the lights up at Christmas and build a new roof for
the local senior center.
North Dakota's pride comes from summers spent helping on the family
farm or showing cattle at the county fair.
It developed from family trips down the Enchanted Highway and evenings
spent at the Medora Musical, and on Lake Sakakawea's endless shoreline
where families and friends gather to fish, camp, swim, and boat.
It's the result of our plans for weddings and family reunions around
harvest and season openers, and from town decisions that are made over
a cup of coffee and hand of pinochle.
As we reflect on the great pride North Dakotans have for our great
state, we can see 125 years of hard work and appreciation for the land,
our families, and the communities we grow up in.
We can see it in the opportunity for a girl from a town of 90 people to
grow up to become a U.S. Senator. Our history comes from the belief
that anything is possible with a little hard work; that everyone has
the ability to succeed. And it comes with a modesty and pragmatism that
is unmatched.
Around North Dakota's birthday, November 2nd, I'm thankful to represent
a state that makes everyone feel at home, and never underestimates the
progress of a good day's work. I'm grateful to be a part of North
Dakota's unique history, and am deeply proud to call this state my home.

Celebrating
North
Dakota's
125
Years
From
the
adventures
of
Lewis
and
Clark,
to
the
rough
riding
days
of
Teddy
Roosevelt
and
now
the
unprecedented
growth
that
heeds
national
attention,
North
Dakota
has
had
125
years
of
unique
and
defining
stories
that
have
created
a
rich
history.
That
history
is
built
not
just
on
events,
but
the
deep
pride
and
strong
sense
of
community
that
has
-
and
continues
to
-
resonate
throughout
North
Dakota's
home
and
families.
North
Dakota's
pride
comes
from
the
rich
heritage
of
our
Native
brothers
and
sisters
and
the
fields
and
ranches
that
have
become
responsible
for
feeding
the
world.
It
comes
from
the
generations
of
families
who
have
called
the
prairie
and
badlands
home.
Who
have
endured
the
long,
cold
winters
and
fallen
in
love
with
the
perfection
of
summer.
It
comes
from
the
liquid
gold
of
wheat
before
harvest
and
movement
of
the
sun
being
shadowed
by
miles
upon
miles
of
sunflowers.
North
Dakota's
pride
comes
from
the
unique
sense
of
smallness
we
get
from
standing
in
a
vast
prairie,
and
from
being
greeted
with
a
two-finger
wave
over
the
steering
wheel
of
every
passing
car.
We
can
see
it
in
our
neighbors
at
the
football
games
on
Friday
night
and
again
at
the
potluck
dinners
after
church
on
Sundays,
and
when
we
support
our
friends
with
hot
dish
and
a
prayer.
We
see
it
in
the
ability
of
our
state's
Democrats
and
Republicans,
Vikings
and
Packers
fans
who
might
not
agree
on
many
issues,
but
still
find
a
way
to
get
the
lights
up
at
Christmas
and
build
a
new
roof
for
the
local
senior
center.
North
Dakota's
pride
comes
from
summers
spent
helping
on
the
family
farm
or
showing
cattle
at
the
county
fair.
It
developed
from
family
trips
down
the
Enchanted
Highway
and
evenings
spent
at
the
Medora
Musical,
and
on
Lake
Sakakawea's
endless
shoreline
where
families
and
friends
gather
to
fish,
camp,
swim,
and
boat.
It's
the
result
of
our
plans
for
weddings
and
family
reunions
around
harvest
and
season
openers,
and
from
town
decisions
that
are
made
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
hand
of
pinochle.
As
we
reflect
on
the
great
pride
North
Dakotans
have
for
our
great
state,
we
can
see
125
years
of
hard
work
and
appreciation
for
the
land,
our
families,
and
the
communities
we
grow
up
in.
We
can
see
it
in
the
opportunity
for
a
girl
from
a
town
of
90
people
to
grow
up
to
become
a
U.S.
Senator.
Our
history
comes
from
the
belief
that
anything
is
possible
with
a
little
hard
work;
that
everyone
has
the
ability
to
succeed.
And
it
comes
with
a
modesty
and
pragmatism
that
is
unmatched.
Around
North
Dakota's
birthday,
November
2nd,
I'm
thankful
to
represent
a
state
that
makes
everyone
feel
at
home,
and
never
underestimates
the
progress
of
a
good
day's
work.
I'm
grateful
to
be
a
part
of
North
Dakota's
unique
history,
and
am
deeply
proud
to
call
this
state
my
home.
