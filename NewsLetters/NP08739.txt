Stopping EPA Actions to Raise Your Family's Energy Costs
Earlier this month, President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), in their latest attack in their "War on Coal," announced new
regulations that are an energy tax on Indiana's #1 energy source.
Not only does coal meet 80% of Indiana's energy needs, it also provides
2,500 jobs and contributes over $750 million to our economy.
These proposed regulations, on top of the mountain of regulations that
have been issued, are a direct threat to our economy and Hoosier family
budgets.
I am taking action to stop these regulations to protect you and your
family. This week, I cosponsored legislation to stop these rules
from taking effect, and
this isn't the first volley in my defense of Hoosier families.
I want to help Hoosier businesses create jobs, while the President and
his out-of-control administration are intent on killing jobs. Through
my Red Tape Rollback
program, I have been fighting these, and other
costly regulations, from an administration that has its boot on the
neck of the economy.

Continuing the Fight to Care for Our Veterans
This week, the House continued its work to ensure veterans receive the
care they were promised by demanding accountability from President
Obama and his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The House passed two
key pieces of legislation that will reinforce congressional oversight
of the VA, give the Secretary of the VA broader authority to dismiss
failed management, and most importantly, require the VA to allow
veterans to receive care at non-VA facilities. Those responsible for
this terrible service, directly or indirectly, must be held
accountable, starting with being fired for their negligence.
H.R. 2072 - Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act
, which passed the House on Monday, requires the Veterans Affairs
Inspector General (IG) to report to the VA Secretary and congressional
veterans committees about failures by the VA to address a public health
or safety issue recommended by the IG. Upon receipt of such
notification, the VA Secretary is to take steps to address the
situation with the responsible VA manager.
H.R. 4810 - The Veterans Access to Care Act
, which
passed the House Tuesday increases opportunities for veterans to
receive medical care at non-VA facilities, requires the VA to contract
with an independent entity to conduct an assessment of the health care
provided at VA medical facilities, and eliminates bonuses and
performance awards for all VA employees for FY 2014- FY2016.
These bills build on the work the House has done in recent weeks in
response to the reports of gross misconduct and failed performance of
the Phoenix VA hospital, as well as additional performance issues at
other VA facilities across the country. To learn more about the recent
legislation, please visit the House Committee on Veterans Affairs

Hoosier Hospitality - Indiana Welcomes the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association
Rep. Rokita and Panel Discuss Aviation at AOPA's Indy Fly-In
Recently, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), of which I
am a very proud member of, held what's known as a "fly-in" event at the
Indianapolis Regional Airport. A fly-in can be many things for many
different groups. For AOPA, a fly-in is literal, as attendees fly-in to
an airport and participate in courses on the latest in general aviation
safety and technology, as well as enjoy some fellowship with others in
the community. Over 2,000 aviators attended the event.
During AOPA fly-ins, there is a pilot town hall. I helped lead this
event, along with Rep. Larry Bucshon, Sen. Joe Donelly, and State Sen.
Brandt Hershman.
Following my introduction of AOPA President Mark
Baker, we discussed the state of general aviation, and how it is such
an important industry for Indiana.
Aviators Sign the GAPPA Petition
What should alarm Hoosiers about the current state of general aviation,
however, is that it is an industry which is experiencing difficulty, in
large part, due to excessive, burdensome, and costly regulations that
are discouraging new aviators and seeing many older aviators leave the
community. It is for that very reason I introduced the General Aviation
Pilot Protection Act (GAPPA), to expand an already successful exemption
of a costly medical test in another flight class to general aviation. I
was pleased to update the AOPA community with our efforts to pass this
bill. Right now, we have 113 cosponsors and have gained key support on
the Aviation Subcommittee. You can read a recent op-ed I wrote on GAPPA
and the importance of general aviation by clicking here

Town Hall in Mooresville June 16
It is my pleasure to announce that I will be hosting a Town Hall event
in Mooresville on June 16. The event will take place at 6:00 pm in the
Mooresville High School Auditorium (550 N. Indiana Street). The Town
Hall will begin with a public reading of the Constitution and then I
will take your questions.
Like all of my Town Halls, the event is open to the public and no
appointment is required. I look forward to seeing you there.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Stopping
EPA
Actions
to
Raise
Your
Family's
Energy
Costs
Earlier
this
month,
President
Obama's
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA),
in
their
latest
attack in
their
"War

Coal,"
announced
new
regulations
that
are
an
energy
tax
on
Indiana's

energy
source. Not
only
does
coal
meet
80%
of
Indiana's
energy
needs,
it
also
provides
2,500
jobs
and
contributes
over
$750
million
to
our
economy.
These
proposed
regulations,
on
top
of
the
mountain
of

that
have
been
issued,
are
a
direct
threat
to
our
economy
and

I
am
taking
action
to
stop
these
regulations
to
protect
you
and
your

This
week,
I
cosponsored
legislation
to
stop
these
rules
from
taking
effect,
and
this
isn't
the
first

in
my

of

I
want
to
help
Hoosier

intent

killing
jobs.
Through

I
have

the

they
were

Welcomes
the Aircraft
Owners
and
Pilots
Association
Rep.
Rokita
and
Panel
Discuss
Aviation
at
AOPA's
Indy
Fly-In
Recently,
the
Aircraft
Owners
and
Pilots
Association
(AOPA),
of
which
I
am
a
very proud
member
of,
held
what's
known
as
a
"fly-in"
event
at
the
Indianapolis
Regional
Airport.
A
fly-in
can
be
many
things
for
many
different
groups.
For
AOPA,
a
fly-in
is
literal,
as
attendees
fly-in
to
an
airport
and
participate
in
courses
on
the
latest
in
general
aviation
safety
and
technology,
as
well
as
enjoy
some
fellowship
with
others
in
the
community.
Over
2,000
aviators
attended
the
event.
During
AOPA
fly-ins,
there
is
a
pilot
town
hall.
I
helped
lead
this
event,
along
with
Rep.
Larry
Bucshon,
Sen.
Joe
Donelly,
and
State
Sen.
Brandt
Hershman.
Following
my
introduction
of
AOPA
President
Mark
Baker,
we
discussed
the
state
of
general
aviation,
and
how
it
is
such
an
important
industry
for
Indiana.
Aviators
Sign
the
GAPPA
Petition
What
should
alarm
Hoosiers
about
the
current
state
of
general
aviation,
however,
is
that
it
is
an
industry which
is
experiencing
difficulty,
in
large
part,
due
to
excessive,
burdensome,
and
costly
regulations
that
are
discouraging
new
aviators
and
seeing
many
older
aviators
leave
the
community.
It
is
for
that
very
reason
I
introduced
the
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
(GAPPA),
to
expand
an
already
successful
exemption
of
a
costly
medical
test
in
another
flight
class
to
general
aviation.
I
was
pleased
to
update
the
AOPA
community
with
our
efforts
to
pass
this
bill.
Right
now,
we
have
113
cosponsors
and
have
gained
key
support
on
the
Aviation
Subcommittee.

It
is
my
pleasure
to
announce
that
I
will
be
hosting
a
Town
Hall
event
in
Mooresville
on
June
16.
The
event
will
take
place
at
6:00

The

will

I
will
