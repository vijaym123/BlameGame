Dear Friends,
Yesterday marked the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps,
the national service program that provides thousands of Americans of all
ages and backgrounds with education awards in exchange for a year or
two of community service.
Over the past 20 years, more than 900,000 individuals have served with the AmeriCorps program and have helped to improve our nation.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry, "In addition to training hundreds of new volunteers, members tutor and
mentor high risk youth; organize neighborhood watch organizations;
assist crime victims; help build affordable housing; help seniors live
independently; clean up rivers and streams; and provide emergency and
long term assistance to victims of natural disasters." Across the country, especially in Western Pennsylvania, local communities benefit from the critical services provided by AmeriCorps' volunteers, and the volunteers themselves benefit from doing it. From making schools a better place to learn to helping towns and cities rebuild after natural disasters to supporting veterans and their families, AmeriCorps members serve their communities while developing marketable job skills and experience that continue to help them throughout their careers. To learn more about how to get involved with AmeriCorps programs -- including Butler Memorial Hospital Family Services and the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council --

I thank all those involved with AmeriCorps who have served our nation, our communities, and our fellow citizens.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Statement on
13th Anniversary of 9/11
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Thursday in recognition of the 13th anniversary of the al Qaeda terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, as well as the second anniversary of the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
"Today I once again join my fellow citizens in remembering the unthinkable attacks upon our homeland that changed our world forever. My heart still aches for all the lives taken from us and the families who miss them dearly. While the pain of 9/11 will never go away, neither will the memories of the courage, the compassion, and the heroism that was showcased from the first responders on the ground in New York and Washington to the heroes in the sky above Pennsylvania. Since then, the world has witnessed our resolve and our enemies have felt our might. The phrases 'Never Forget' and 'Never Again' continue to inspire our nation as we forge ahead, year after year, with a tireless commitment to lasting security for our people.
"Thirteen years after our darkest day, the war on terror carries on. Simply put, the Islamic State is a demonic force that cannot be permitted to co-habit the globe with civilized life. Like al Qaeda, IS terrorists and their ideology are waging war on America and civilization itself. Like al Qaeda, IS has already attacked our nation by executing two of our own citizens and threatening to kill more. We must fight back, and we must win. American leadership and lethal military power must be used to fully and permanently destroy IS, wherever it exists, as quickly as possible. We must responsibly pursue any strategy that will succeed at eradicating IS and take no tool or tactic off the table in order to achieve that end."
