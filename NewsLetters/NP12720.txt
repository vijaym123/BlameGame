Even though the Great Recession was officially declared at an end in 2009, there are still too many Americans who are unemployed or underemployed. I do not take lightly the challenges our economy is facing today or the grave situation that every American will face if the economy does not recover. As I continue to fight in Washington to tear down the bureaucratic red tape that continues to hamper our economy and kill jobs, I am constantly reminded of the folks back home I am fighting for.
Its the stories of real Americans who remain unemployed or underemployed that will help us win the fight to replace the job-killing economic agenda of this administration with the pro-growth policies that will enable the economy to expand and create jobs. Are you unemployed and struggling to find full time work?
I want to hear your story .
Are you working and still unable to make ends meet because of the tepid recovery?
Let me hear about it .
A thriving democracy depends on the participation of involved citizens like you to solve the real life problems that are affecting Americans on a daily basis. If this slump in the economy caused by regulatory burdens that are making it impossible for businesses to grow and create much-needed jobs has had an impact on you, please take a moment to
