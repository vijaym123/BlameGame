Walberg Responds to Presidents Immigration Overreach, Votes for American Manufacturing
Despite the $700 million border bill already passed by House Republicans, the President has chosen to ignore Congress, the American people, and the root problems in our broken immigration system.

The American people are looking for real solutions on jobs, promoting our economy, and a workable immigration policy
not more executive orders. To share your thoughts, please visit my
