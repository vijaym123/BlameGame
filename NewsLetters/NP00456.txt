How Trade is Like a Baseball Game
Folks in Washington like to make big promises when it comes to our trade deals. But for too long, weve seen nothing but bad results.
Weve seen what so-called free trade agreements have done to our workers and our communities over the past two decades. Weve seen the factories close and the stores get boarded up. Thats why I voted against giving the president authority to rush through a huge new trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And its why Ill continue to fight for a level playing field for American workers and American businesses.
Its true that trade deals have created jobs, and that the TPP could as well. But this ignores the millions more jobs that have been lost because of unfair trade deals.
I like to look at things in baseball terms. Lauding gains from exports while ignoring a flood of imports
and skyrocketing trade deficits
is like reporting half of the score of a baseball game. The Cleveland Indians scoring three runs doesnt help the team much if the Yankees scored six runs.
We know that past trade deals have replaced manufacturing jobswith good pay and good benefitswith low-wage service sector jobs. We cant let that happen again.
And we also know that we make deals with countries that dont play by the same rules we dothey have lax labor and environmental standards, and what international rules they do have to follow too often get ignored.
Thats why we cant have trade promotion without trade enforcement.
Instead of rushing a bill through last month, the Senate should have taken the time to get this right and to include my important amendments that protect Ohio workers and manufacturers. I fought for provisions that would guarantee a level playing field for our workers and companies by cracking down on countries who manipulate their currencies, and that would give American businesses new tools to fight back against illegal foreign imports.
I also fought to make sure China isnt able to sneak into this trade pact at a later date, without any oversight or Congressional approval.
Im going to continue fighting to get these important protections to the presidents desk. This massive agreement could affect forty percent of the global economyit is too important to rush through.
We know that trade done right can create prosperity. I want trade that lifts up Ohios middle class families and that creates good-paying jobsnot trade that leads to more shuttered plants and shattered communities. That can only happen when the rules arent rigged and we have a level playing field.
Unfortunately, with the TPP we know which kind of trade were gettingthe kind the results in corporate handouts and worker sellouts.
Sincerely,
Sherrod Brown
