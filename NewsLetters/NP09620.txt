Dear Friend,
Greetings from southern Oregon where the mercury hit a record-breaking
96 degrees this week. Winter is definitely over! I am wrapping up a
422-mile swing through four counties, including meetings with wine
growers in Jacksonville, small businesses in Prineville and Ashland,
and firefighters in White City.
But my favorite meetings were with students at charter schools in
Redmond and Medford. These impressive young people have been empowered
to be proactive in obtaining a high-quality education in an excellent
environment. Charter schools help parents to play a more active role in
their children's education, open doors for teachers to pioneer new
teaching methods, and encourage local innovation in education. Here I
am with Purity, a senior at Redmond Proficiency Academy who is an
exchange student from Kenya:
While there are currently more than 23,000 students enrolled in 124
charter schools across Oregon, more than 12,000 students in Oregon-and
more than half a million nationally-are on a waiting list for a spot at
a charter school. Despite high demand, barriers to quality charter
school growth exist. For example, burdensome red tape often prevents
charter schools from accessing federal grant programs, and many charter
schools face difficulty securing facilities.
That's why, last week, the U.S. House passed the Success and
Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Act
, which seeks to expand and replicate
high-quality charter schools to offer these opportunities to more
students. I was proud to support this bipartisan legislation, which
passed the House by a vote of 360-45 (click here to watch KTVZ's report
)
This common-sense plan promotes state and local efforts to develop and
expand charter schools, encourages the replication of successful
charter models, and encourages schools to reach out to special
populations such as students with disabilities or at-risk students.
This will help reduce the charter school backlog and encourage choice,
innovation, and excellence in education. The Senate should act on this
bipartisan education reform plan right away.
Travel management bill to move forward in the House
After my time at the Redmond Proficiency Academy, I headed to
Prineville for a meeting with small businesses, city and county
officials and the Crook County Chamber of Commerce. Here's a beautiful
view of the Three Sisters as I travelled through Central Oregon:
One of the main topics of discussion was the Forest Service's travel
management plan to close roads in the Ochoco National Forest. Like so
many misguided travel management plans in Oregon and across the
country, input from local residents was pushed to the backseat when it
came to deciding who could access public lands. In March, I introduced
a bill to stop the misguided travel management rule on national forests
in the West and promote local control over future proposals regarding
forest road closures. It would require the input and consent of local
community leaders before any more roads could be shut down or future
travel management proposals could move forward.
I've received a commitment from the House Natural Resources Committee
that they will hold a hearing on this important piece of legislation at
the next available opportunity. This is the next step in moving the
bill through Congress so we can bring management back where it belongs-
local citizens.
Proposed BLM actions could harm rural power co-ops, increase
electricity costs for Oregonians
The House Resources Committee recently held a hearing on rural power
and federal lands, and I was proud to introduce Dave Markham, CEO of
Central Electric Cooperative in Redmond, as a witness (below):
The purpose of the hearing was to examine challenges faced by rural
electric utilities that have transmission and distribution lines on
federal land. These utilities, which are often the only provider in
rural coverage areas that can span tens of thousands of square miles,
are negatively impacted by a lack of federal forest management that
leads to catastrophic wildfires that can destroy transmission lines and
disrupt service to rural homes and businesses.
It also focused on delays by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and
U.S. Forest Service on renewing permits for power lines across federal
lands that deliver electricity to rural Oregon, potentially raising
costs for consumers.
Just like it shouldn't take several years to put together a timber
sale, it also shouldn't take several years for the BLM or Forest
Service to renew an existing right of way for an electric transmission
line. And when federal agencies fail to act, adjacent private land
owners, utilities, and subsequently their customers are the ones that
suffer.
Markham told the committee how he, like many Oregonians, is especially
concerned about the BLM's listing of the sage grouse. The BLM has
proposed requiring power lines in sage grouse habitat to be buried. In
the words of Dave Markham:
"Not only is this measure not technically feasible, it is cost
prohibitive. Harney Electric Cooperative, headquartered in Hines,
Oregon, serves slightly more than 4,000 members spread over
approximately 20,000 square miles in southeastern Oregon and
northwestern Nevada.
Their service territory is approximately the size
of the state of West Virginia.
Harney Electric has determined the
financial impact to burying power lines would cost a staggering
$400,000 per co-op member.
Faced with this financial burden they could
no longer operate their business and electric service to members would
terminate."
Can you believe that?! $400,000 per member, forcing the co-op to close
and leaving thousands in eastern Oregon without power. I'm glad Dave
could come to this hearing to tell Congress about the challenges facing
rural co-ops in Oregon.

Standing up for the future of the internet
In Ashland, I met with small businesses and the local Chamber of
Commerce (photo below). The town has a large and growing technology
economy, something that should be encouraged. That's why, as chairman
of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I've worked
hard to keep the internet open and free of government control. Without
regulation and government meddling, the Internet as we know it has
thrived.
That's why I was so concerned when I learned that the Obama
Administration had proposed transferring control over internet domain
names from the United States to another entity. These changes could
leave the internet vulnerable to power grabs from international
governments, like Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved legislation
I've worked on, known as the DOTCOM Act, to direct the Government
Accountability Office to conduct a thorough, independent analysis of
the proposed changes and report back to Congress before the
Administration can take action.
The bill's next step is a vote in the full U.S. House, which I hope
will win bipartisan support. We must keep the global internet vibrant
and free so that Oregon's technology economy can grow and create jobs.
Americans deserve the truth about Benghazi
At many of my meetings in Oregon, the 2012 terrorist attacks in
Benghazi, Libya come up because people demand the truth. For nearly two
years, the House has worked tirelessly to get answers about that night-
when four brave Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens and
Oregonian Tyrone Woods lost their lives-and its aftermath. Time and
time again, the Administration has stonewalled the House and the
American people, and it's time for them to come clean.
That's why I strongly supported a resolution passed by the House last
week to set up a Select Committee on Benghazi, chaired by Rep. Trey
Gowdy. This is an extraordinary step, but it's needed to force
accountability from the Obama Administration and get the truth. For
more on the House's investigation, please click here

That's all for now. Thank you for reading, and have a great week.
Best regards,
Greg Walden

Dear
Friend,
Greetings
from
southern
Oregon
where
the
mercury
hit
a
record-breaking
96
degrees
this

Winter
is
definitely
over!
I
am
wrapping
up
a
422-mile

through
four
counties,
including
meetings
with
wine

But
my

and
Medford.
These
impressive
young
people
have
been
empowered
to

in

Charter

Here
I
am
with
Purity,
a
senior
at
Redmond

who
is
an
exchange
student
from
Kenya:
While
there
are
currently
more
than
23,000
students
enrolled
in
124
charter
schools
across
Oregon,
more
than
12,000
students
in
Oregon&#8212;and
more
than
half
a
million
nationally&#8212;are
on
a
waiting
list
for
a
spot
at
a
charter

Despite
high
demand,
barriers
to

exist.
For
example,
burdensome
red

often
prevents
charter
schools
from
accessing
federal

and
many
charter
schools
face
difficulty
securing
facilities.
That&#8217;s
why,
last
week,
the
U.S.

passed
the

which
seeks
to

Travel
management
bill
to
move
forward
in
the
House
After
my
time
at
the
Redmond
Proficiency
Academy,
I
headed
to
Prineville
for
a
meeting
with
small
businesses,
city
and
county
officials
and
the
Crook
County
Chamber
of
Commerce.
Here&#8217;s
a
beautiful
view
of
the
Three
Sisters
as
I
travelled
through
Central
Oregon:
One
of
the
main
topics
of
discussion
was
the
Forest
Service&#8217;s
travel
management
plan
to
close
roads
in
the
Ochoco
National
Forest.
Like
so
many
misguided
travel
management
plans
in
Oregon
and
across
the
country,
input
from
local
residents
was
pushed
to
the
backseat
when
it
came
to
deciding
who
could
access
public
lands.
In
March,
I
introduced
a
bill
to
stop
the
misguided
travel
management
rule
on
national
forests
in
the
West
and
promote
local
control
over
future
proposals
regarding
forest
road
closures.
It
would
require
the
input
and
consent
of
local
community
leaders
before
any
more
roads
could
be
shut
down
or
future
travel
management
proposals
could
move
forward.
I&#8217;ve
received
a
commitment
from
the
House
Natural
Resources
Committee
that
they
will
hold
a
hearing
on
this
important
piece
of
legislation
at
the
next
available
opportunity.
This
is
the
next
step
in
moving
the
bill
through
Congress
so
we
can
bring
management
back
where
it
belongs&#8212;local
citizens.
Proposed
BLM
actions
could
harm
rural
power
co-ops,
increase
electricity
costs
for
Oregonians
The
House
Resources
Committee
recently
held
a
hearing
on
rural
power
and
federal
lands,
and
I
was
proud
to
introduce
Dave
Markham,
CEO
of
Central
Electric
Cooperative
in
Redmond,
as
a
witness
(below):
The
purpose
of
the
hearing
was
to
examine
challenges
faced
by
rural
electric
utilities
that
have
transmission
and
distribution
lines
on
federal
land.
These
utilities,
which
are
often
the
only
provider
in
rural
coverage
areas
that
can
span
tens
of
thousands
of
square
miles,
are
negatively
impacted
by
a
lack
of
federal
forest
management
that
leads
to
catastrophic
wildfires
that
can
destroy
transmission
lines
and
disrupt
service
to
rural
homes
and
businesses.
It
also
focused
on
delays
by
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
(BLM)
and
U.S.
Forest
Service
on
renewing
permits
for
power
lines
across
federal
lands
that
deliver
electricity
to
rural
Oregon,
potentially
raising
costs
for
consumers.
Just
like
it
shouldn&#8217;t
take
several
years
to
put
together
a
timber
sale,
it
also
shouldn&#8217;t
take
several
years
for
the
BLM
or
Forest
Service
to
renew
an
existing
right
of
way
for
an
electric
transmission
line.
And
when
federal
agencies
fail
to
act,
adjacent
private
land
owners,
utilities,
and
subsequently
their
customers
are
the
ones
that
suffer.
Markham
told
the
committee
how
he,
like
many
Oregonians,
is
especially
concerned
about
the
BLM&#8217;s
listing
of
the
sage
grouse.
The
BLM
has
proposed
requiring
power
lines
in
sage
grouse
habitat
to
be
buried.
In
the
words
of
Dave
Markham:
&#8220;Not
only
is
this
measure
not
technically
feasible,
it
is
cost
prohibitive.
Harney
Electric
Cooperative,
headquartered
in
Hines,
Oregon,
serves
slightly
more
than
4,000
members
spread
over
approximately
20,000
square
miles
in
southeastern
Oregon
and
northwestern
Nevada.
Their
service
territory
is
approximately
the
size
of
the
state
of
West
Virginia.
Harney
Electric
has
determined
the
financial
impact
to
burying
power
lines
would
cost
a
staggering
$400,000
per
co-op
member.
Faced
with
this
financial
burden
they
could
no
longer
operate
their
business
and
electric
service
to
members
would
terminate.&#8221;
Can
you
believe
that?!
$400,000
per
member,
forcing
the
co-op
to
close
and
leaving
thousands
in
eastern
Oregon
without
power.
I&#8217;m
glad
Dave
could
come
to
this
hearing
to
tell
Congress
about
the
challenges
facing
rural
co-ops
in
Oregon.

Standing
up
for
the
future
of
the
internet
In
Ashland,
I
met
with
small
businesses
and
the
local
Chamber
of
Commerce
(photo
below).
The
town
has
a
large
and
growing
technology
economy,
something
that
should
be
encouraged.
That&#8217;s
why,
as
chairman
of
the
House
Communications
and
Technology
Subcommittee,
I&#8217;ve
worked
hard
to
keep
the
internet
open
and
free
of
government
control.
Without
regulation
and
government
meddling,
the
Internet
as
we
know
it
has
thrived.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
so
concerned
when
I
learned
that
the
Obama
Administration
had
proposed
transferring
control
over
internet
domain
names
from
the
United
States
to
another
entity.
These
changes
could
leave
the
internet
vulnerable
to
power
grabs
from
international
governments,
like
Vladimir
Putin&#8217;s
Russia.
Last
week,
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
approved
legislation
I&#8217;ve
worked
on,
known
as
the
DOTCOM
Act,
to
direct
the
Government
Accountability
Office
to
conduct
a
thorough,
independent
analysis
of
the
proposed
changes
and
report
back
to
Congress
before
the
Administration
can
take
action.
The
bill&#8217;s
next
step
is
a
vote
in
the
full
U.S.
House,
which
I
hope
will
win
bipartisan
support.
We
must
keep
the
global
internet
vibrant
and
free
so
that
Oregon&#8217;s
technology
economy
can
grow
and
create
jobs.
Americans
deserve
the
truth
about
Benghazi
At
many
of
my
meetings
in
Oregon,
the
2012
terrorist
attacks
in
Benghazi,
Libya
come
up
because
people
demand
the
truth.
For
nearly
two
years,
the
House
has
worked
tirelessly
to
get
answers
about
that
night&#8212;when
four
brave
Americans,
including
Ambassador
Chris
Stevens
and
Oregonian
Tyrone
Woods
lost
their
lives&#8212;and
its
aftermath.
Time
and
time
again,
the
Administration
has
stonewalled
the
House
and
the
American
people,
and
it&#8217;s
time
for
them
to
come
clean.
That&#8217;s
why
I
strongly
supported
a
resolution
passed
by
the
House
last
week
to
set
up
a
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi,
chaired
by
Rep.
Trey
Gowdy.
This
is
an
extraordinary
step,
but
it&#8217;s
needed
to
force
accountability
from
the
Obama
Administration
and
get
the
truth.

have
a
great
