I have some bad news to share:
This morning -- just one day after Republicans voted to sue President Obama -- Speaker Boehner was shaking down his Tea Party Republicans for last-minute cash. He&rsquo;s trying to beat us in the final moments before tonight&rsquo;s fundraising deadline.
This is going to come all the way down to the wire.
Right now, we&rsquo;re coming up 4,759 short of our goal -- and we have less than 3 hours to get there.
David, we CANNOT let Boehner surpass us. Not after this disgraceful lawsuit against the President. Can you chip in one more time before the deadline? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Let's go!
