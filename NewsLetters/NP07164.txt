Friends,
I can't tell you how great it's been to be back in Northeast
Ohio. This week, I had the opportunity to meet with manufacturers, stop
by local businesses and chat with constituents during my travels
around the district.
Visiting
with constituents at Panera Bread in Willoughby,
Ohio
Here are some notable items from the past few
days:
Congratulations to Cuyahoga Community
College's faculty and staff
who worked tirelessly over the past 10 months
to secure full accreditation for the nursing program through 2022. As
co-chair of the House Nursing Caucus, I am concerned about the
significant impacts of the nursing shortage on our nations health care
system. Tri-C plays a crucial role in training the nursing workforce, with
more than 400 students graduating from its nursing program each year.
Tri-C students passing rate on Ohio State Nursing Board exams is
higher than both the national and state averages. I was pleased to write a
letter to the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing on
Tri-Cs behalf and advocate for the program throughout this
process.
Avery Diedrick, a student at
Brecksville-Broadview Heights Middle School, has been selected to represent Ohio as a
state ambassador for
Fuel Up to Play 60 . This
program, founded by the NFL and the National Dairy Council, empowers
students to take charge and make healthy changes in school. I was honored
to send her a congressional recognition to mark her
achievement.
Thursday was National Lighthouse
Day. Congress established lighthouses 225 years ago, and they've played an
important role in our nations history.
Check out this
article in The News-Herald
to learn more about the Lake Erie
lighthouses in Ohio's 14th District.

Throughout
August, I'll be posting photos on my social media sites from events all
around Northeast Ohio. Please be sure to send me yours as well! I love
