Sorry to email you late on a Friday, but I need your urgent support:
Yesterday:
for the first time in history, Congress voted to sue a sitting president.
Today:
the White House alerted us that they believe &ldquo;Speaker Boehner&hellip;has opened the door to impeachment&hellip;"
What Republicans are doing to President Obama is historic -- and offensive. With everything happening right now, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed to see that you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to chip in to defend President Obama.
David -- we could use your support today. ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
