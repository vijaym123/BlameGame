Dear Friend,
As I meet with individuals, families,
and small businesses in Ohios 16
th
District, I continue to hear
about the negative effects of our slow
economic recovery and the uncertainty it
has created for the next generation.
Northeast Ohioans are not alone in
expressing their frustration with the
direction our country is heading. According
to a recent Wall Street Journal and NBC
poll, more than 70 percent of Americans
lack confidence that their children will
have a better life than they do. I,
too, agree that we can and must be doing
more to create new opportunities for
Americans.
Since coming to Washington, I have
fought for solutions that will lead to a
healthy economy. I have consistently put
forth and supported policies that will
empower our job creators to hire and expand
and allow hardworking Ohioans to take home
more of their pay. I believe that we need a
smaller federal government that spends less
and hands down fewer job-crushing
regulations that often prevent small
businesses from achieving success.
House Republicans have a plan to help
all Americans get ahead and we have worked
hard to implement it. We have passed
initiatives that will create jobs
immediately, make higher education more
affordable, and protect 99 percent of
Americans from permanent tax hikes. We have
acted to reduce the negative effects of the
Presidents health care law,
including passing legislation that allows
Ohioans to keep their health plans and
exempts emergency responders from the
laws employer mandate. We have
passed measures that will provide the
necessary job training to those who are
looking for work. Just last month, we
passed a bicameral, bipartisan package that
will improve veterans health care
and benefits and help us keep our promises
to those who have taken care of us.
As a CPA and member of the House Ways
&amp; Means Committee, I have participated
in working groups and multiple hearings
that led to Chairman Dave Camps
comprehensive plan for tax reform. I have
advocated for a simpler, fairer tax code
that will encourage our small businesses to
create jobs, while also providing relief to
individuals and families who continue to
grapple with the complexities of our
current system. Tax reform will lead to the
creation of thousands of jobs and the
economic growth that our country needs in
order to not only recover, but
thrive.
In order to get our economy moving
again, it is critical that the Senate acts
on the dozens of House-passed bills that
are gathering dust on Senator Harry
Reids desk. Our country is the land
of opportunity, and it is time that we
restore Americans faith in our
promise of passing on a better America with
more opportunities to the next
generation.
