Standing for our
veterans
The treatment
of our nations veterans in the VA Hospital system is disturbing and
inexcusable, and the resignation of embattled Veterans Affairs
Secretary Eric Shinseki alone will not fix the systemic problems at the VA.
His resignation comes on the heels of an independent report of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which found that corruption was
systemic throughout our veterans' hospitals.
The report also
claimed, because they experienced long waits, our veterans were at risk of
being lost or forgotten and may never obtain their requested or
required primary care.
Many unanswered questions still remain.
Who ordered the schedulers to create the secret lists?
How
many employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs are involved?
But, we do know that the VAs performance is deplorable and has not
adequately served our veterans, who deserve much better than this.
My colleagues and I continue to stand for our veterans, despite the
lack of action from the White House.
Last week, the House
passed a package of Veterans Affairs accountability bills.
Additionally, Chairman Jeff Miller of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs
is working relentlessly to hold the VA bureaucrats accountable.
Well continue to fight for answers for those who have made countless
sacrifices for our country and who deserve the best medical care
possible.
Preparing for hurricane
season
Preparing for hurricane season is one of the
best things you can do to protect yourself and your family in the
event a storm approaches.
Hurricane season begins this week and
ends November 30th.
I encourage you and your family to take the
necessary steps to prepare for the months ahead by having a plan in
place in the event that a hurricane threatens our coast.
Please
take the time to learn evacuation routes, assemble a disaster kit, and
discuss the dangers that hurricanes and life-threatening weather
events can present.
We are all too familiar with the hazards that can
accompany hurricanes, including high winds, storm surge, and
flooding, as well as the destruction that these elements can cause.
Therefore, it is vital that we are all prepared and take steps to
mitigate, and respond to, the challenges that hurricanes can create.
I encourage you to click on the Hurricane Preparedness button below
for more information on storm preparation, essential supplies, and
evacuation procedures.
Reviving our
nations manufacturing base
Our national debt is racing towards $18 trillion,
and every month more and more Americans are leaving the
workforce.
The Administration should be doing everything in its power to
grow the economy and help Americans get back to work, yet radical
policies and red tape continue to be a barrier to job creation and new
manufacturing projects.
Thats why Ive introduced the Promoting
New Manufacturing Act, which will increase investment in
American manufacturing, create new jobs and reduce unnecessary and
costly permitting delays.
The Promoting New Manufacturing Act
takes critical steps toward cutting red tape, reviving our countrys
manufacturing base, and creating thousands of high-paying jobs for
hard-working Americans.
By increasing transparency and holding the EPA
accountable, we can jump start a broken permitting process that is
holding back our economy, which is good news for hard working
taxpayers.

will usher a new manufacturing renaissance:
Pushing a conservative health care
alternative
Republicans have a
repeal-and-replace solution to Obamacare, and its called The American
Health Care Reform Act.
This bill, which my colleague Dr. Phil
Roe and I introduced in the fall, has the support of 130 Members of
Congress.
Our bill lowers costs and puts patients back in charge of
their health care decisions.
Now is the time
to bring this Obamacare replacement bill to the House floor
because American families cant afford to wait any longer.
Weve seen
the detrimental effects of government regulated health care,
and know that President Obama's law is a failed
attempt to change Americas broken health care system.

reform:
It is an honor to represent you in Congress.
