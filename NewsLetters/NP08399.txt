Dear Friends,
We all know something must be down to address rising energy costs.
Whether it is gas prices to drive this summer or propane costs to heat
your home in the winter, something has to be done. In the House, we
passed several bills this week that will help the United States work
towards becoming more energy independent, while creating jobs and
improving the economy. Definitely proud to be from Northern Michigan, a
proven leader in energy production right here in the United States!
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.

Energy Efficiency and Independence
The more money your local school system has to pay heating and cooling
the school buildings, the less money that goes towards actual teaching
and likely will result in higher local taxes.
That's why I recently
voted in support of the "Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools
Act," which passed the House of Representatives this week.
This
program helps school districts figure out how they can access existing
federal programs and grants to support their efforts to upgrade and
retrofit their energy systems.
We also passed H.R. 4899, the "Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an
America that Works Act"
in the House. This is great legislation for
helping the United States work towards becoming more energy
independent, with increases in both on and offshore production.
Northern Michigan is home to many great examples of domestic production
of energy and we need to follow suit nationally in increasing this
vital commodity. It's time for us to embrace energy production at home.
