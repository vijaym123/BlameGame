Dear
Friend,
This year marks the
50th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA),
more commonly known as No Child Left Behind.
This sweeping
legislation sets accountability standards for our schools, determines the
level of federal resources allocated to our children's education, and
sets goals to reduce achievement gaps among students.
First
enacted in 1965, the law is typically renewed every five years.
Since
the last edition of No Child Left Behind expired in 2007, it is long
overdue for reauthorization.
It is our responsibility to craft a
bill that provides access to an equitable, high quality education for
all children regardless of their family income or zip code.
As
a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee and
Ranking Member of its Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education
Subcommittee, I will work to ensure the law supports the educational
needs of every student.
Among
the items in this newsletter, you will also find updates on my
subcommittee assignments, legislation I've introduced to protect women's health
and close the education resource gap, and the awarding of a
Congressional Gold Medal to a most deserving WWII veteran - one of the Montford
Point Marines.
Have a good week, and please stay safe and
warm.
Marcia L. Fudge
Member of
Congress
Committee Assignments for the 114th Congress
For the 114th Congress, I have been selected
as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary,
and Secondary Education.
This Subcommittee is part of the House
Education and the Workforce Committee on which I served since 2009.
I will also serve as a member of the Subcommittee on Workforce
Protections.
I continue to serve
on the House Agriculture Committee and its Subcommittees on
Nutrition, and Biotechnology, Horticulture and Research.
Women's Health Protection
Act
In January, I co-introduced the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA), a
bill that will make it unlawful for states to pass restrictive
legislation that endangers women's health and safety.
Women have a
constitutional right to make their own decisions regarding their
reproductive health, and that right must be respected.
Unfortunately,
legislative attacks at the state level have restricted access to
essential reproductive care in some parts of the country, including here in
Ohio.
These regulations do nothing to protect a woman's health or
safety.
I stand with Americans who believe that decisions about
reproductive health should be made by women in consultation with
their families and health care providers, and not dictated by their zip
code or the preferences of politicians.
CORE
Act
Recognizing the critical importance of the equitable
allocation of education resources, I recently introduced the Core
Opportunity Resources for Equity and Excellence (CORE) Act of 2015.
This bill aims to close the resource gap that impedes access to a
quality education for millions of our nation's students.
The CORE
Act establishes accountability requirements that compel states and
school districts to give all students equitable access to the core
resources necessary to achieve career and college readiness by high school
graduation.
These resources include high quality instructional
teams as well as rigorous academic standards and curricula.
Congressional Gold
Medal
On his 91st birthday, I had the honor of welcoming John Campbell
of Cleveland to my district office in Warrensville Heights, where he
was presented with a Congressional Gold Medal - the nation's highest
civilian honor.
In 2011, the Medal was conferred on all 20,000
African Americans who broke the color barrier and trained as Marines at
Montford Point, Camp Lejeune, NC, between 1942 and 1949.
Unfortunately, Mr. Campbell never received the honor to which he was
entitled.
His family reached out to my office to help identify awards
and service medals he may have earned.
Although the Montford Point
Marines were forced to train in a segregated facility, their bravery
in action convinced military leaders it would be reckless to keep
African Americans from serving in the Armed Forces.
Their
meritorious service helped to bring segregation in the military to an end.
It was a pleasure to celebrate acknowledgement of Mr. Campbell's
place in history with him and his loved ones.

speak on the House floor about the importance of the Women's Health
Protection Act.
"Thank you for attending to my traveling issue.
Although I
will never know how someone got my name and email address to order a
package in my name (according to the Homeland Security agent) and how my
name came to the attention of Homeland Security, I am happy that our
Department of Homeland Security is alert and conscientious.
They
were respectful to us and hopefully I will someday understand what
happened.
Please thank my congresswoman, Marcia Fudge, for her
service to our country."
