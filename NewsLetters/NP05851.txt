Friend,
I&#39;m thanking you so often, I&#39;m going to have to brainstorm new ways to say thank you!
You&#39;re really amazing. Because of you, we&#39;ve just had the most successful fundraising drive of my campaign, exceeding our goal by almost 40%.
And it couldn&#39;t have happened at a more crucial time
- with the election now a little over a month away, we&#39;re going to need all the resources we can get. I&#39;m so grateful that I can count on you.
So, until I or the people at Webster&#39;s Dictionary come up with a new word, I have to once again say -
THANK YOU.
5 more weeks - let&#39;s finish strong.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
