David -- Republicans can&rsquo;t win on their policies in November. And they know it.
So, instead of changing their policies, they&rsquo;ve decided to take away many Americans&rsquo; access to even cast a ballot:
Since 2010, 22 states have passed strict new voting restrictions.
Last year, a conservative Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.
In just the last two weeks, Ohio cut early voting hours, and Wisconsin reinstated its discriminatory voter ID law.
And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. The fight to protect voting rights is going on NOW across the country. Will you stand with Americans across the country and stand for every American&rsquo;s right to vote? Help us reach 1OO,OOO strong denouncing Republican voter suppression schemes:

This is a fight we can&rsquo;t lose.
Here&rsquo;s why: when Americans can&rsquo;t vote, our democracy is at risk.
When students can&rsquo;t vote against skyrocketing student loan rates, democracy loses.
When women can&rsquo;t vote to make their own health care decisions, democracy loses.
When the elderly can&rsquo;t vote to protect their Medicare, democracy loses.
When democracy loses, America loses.
Will you stand up and protect the right to vote of every American? SIGN YOUR NAME:

Republicans are rigging the system. It&rsquo;s dangerous for democracy -- and must be stopped.
