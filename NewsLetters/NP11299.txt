JUMPSTARTING THE AMERICAN DREAM
The celebrated promise of our country has always been that hard work
would lead to good jobs, fair pay and a shot at the American dream.
For many, though, that fundamental promise has been unraveling: a
bailout for Wall Street, too few jobs bills for Main Street, a growing
gap between the wealthy and poor, and smaller take-home pay that's
squeezing middle-class families.
I believe that our biggest challenge is to jumpstart the American dream
for middle and working-class families who are the foundation of every
New Hampshire community. We must recommit ourselves to building an
economy where all can work, where hard work merits fair pay, and, as
our economy grows, everyone prospers.
America has a jobs crisis, and Congress must take action. During this
session of Congress, I've helped introduce jobs bills that would
jumpstart our economy by putting money back into the pockets of
hardworking families, ending the job-killing policy known as
sequestration once and for all, and investing in New Hampshire's
infrastructure. There are many jobs bills waiting for a vote. I've
sponsored legislation to keep jobs in America. I've also written
legislation that would permanently double the tax deduction for new
businesses, and would help teachers who pay for educational supplies by
expanding a tax deduction for them. I've cosponsored legislation that
would allow employers to claim a $2,400 credit when they hire a
recently discharged veteran. These are common sense steps to help our
small businesses grow, support middle-class families and stand up for
veterans.
Over the past couple of decades, American workers have become more
productive, but wages have remained mostly stagnant. A study by the
Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the minimum wage
would have reached $21.72 an hour in 2012 if it had kept up with
increases in worker productivity.
The reason I, along with 63 percent of Americans, support raising the
minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for hardworking men and women is because
a stronger minimum wage means a stronger economy. Raising the minimum
wage helps working families make ends meet, and it drives economic
growth for local businesses.
Women still make only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. This pay
gap is unfair, it hurts working families, and it's a drag on our
economy. State Sen. Sylvia Larsen is leading the charge for paycheck
fairness in New Hampshire, and in the U.S. Congress, I was proud to
help launch the Women's Economic Agenda. Jumpstarting the American
dream means supporting American women who are working to achieve job
security and economic stability for themselves and their families.
Retirement security is another cornerstone of the American dream.
Before Medicare, only half of seniors had health insurance. Today,
virtually all do. Thanks to the prescription drug benefits in the
Affordable Care Act, 11,962 Granite State Medicare beneficiaries saved
an average of $807 each in 2013. I joined colleagues to introduce the
Strengthening Social Security Act of 2013, which would improve benefits
for current and future Social Security beneficiaries, protecting the
American dream.
Recently, there have been a number of proposals to balance the budget
on the backs of New Hampshire seniors. The Ryan budget would eliminate
the Medicare guarantee for seniors and reopen the Medicare doughnut
hole, costing seniors hundreds of dollars more each year. I strongly
oppose this type of budget and any budget that contains cuts to
Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security benefits.
The promise of America is not that we guarantee equal outcome; it's
that we try to provide a ladder of opportunity for all those willing to
work hard. We need to increase investments in education from preschool
to college, because education is the key to a nation's prosperity.
Education brings higher incomes, which helps not only the individual
and his or her family, but the community as well.
I believe that risk-takers and entrepreneurs should be rewarded for
their visions, their discoveries, and their innovations. I also believe
that those who work each day to carry out that vision should be paid a
fair wage. Fair play and opportunity are woven into the American dream.
As I travel throughout New Hampshire's First District, I hear my
constituents say the same thing, regardless of their political
differences. Our citizens say that people who work hard and play by the
rules should still have a shot at success. We might live in a time of
divided government, but that is no excuse for inaction. Let's work
together and jumpstart the American dream now!

Dear

Middle

need

JUMPSTARTING
THE
AMERICAN
DREAM
The
celebrated
promise
of
our
country
has
always
been
that
hard
work
would
lead
to
good
jobs,
fair

and
a

For
many,
though,
that
fundamental
promise
has
been
unraveling:
a
bailout
for
Wall
Street,
too
few
jobs
bills
for
Main
Street,
a
growing
gap
between
the
wealthy
and
poor,
and
smaller
take-home
pay
that&#8217;s
squeezing
middle-class
families.
I
believe
that
our
biggest
challenge
is
to
jumpstart
the
American
dream
for
middle
and
working-class
families
who
are
the
foundation
of
every
New
Hampshire
community.
We
must
recommit
ourselves
to
building
an
economy
where
all
can
work,
where
hard
work
merits
fair
pay,
and,
as
our
economy
grows,
everyone
prospers.
America
has
a
jobs
crisis,
and
Congress
must
take
action.
During
this
session
of
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
helped
introduce
jobs
bills
that
would
jumpstart
our
economy
by
putting
money
back
into
the
pockets
of
hardworking
families,
ending
the
job-killing
policy
known
as
sequestration
once
and
for
all,
and
investing
in
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
infrastructure.
There
are
many
jobs
bills
waiting
for
a
vote.
I&#8217;ve
sponsored
legislation
to
keep
jobs
in
America.
I&#8217;ve
also
written
legislation
that
would
permanently
double
the
tax

for
new
businesses,
and
would
help
teachers
who

by
expanding
a
tax

for
them.
I&#8217;ve
cosponsored
legislation
that
would
allow
employers
to
claim
a
$2,400
credit
when
they
hire
a
recently

veteran.
These
are
common
sense
steps
to
help
our
small
businesses
grow,
support
middle-class
families
and
stand
up
for
veterans.
Over
the
past
couple
of
decades,
American
workers
have
become
more
productive,
but
wages
have
remained
mostly
stagnant.
A
study
by
the
Center
for
Economic
and
Policy
Research
found
that
the
minimum
wage
would
have
reached
$21.72
an
hour
in
2012
if
it
had
kept
up
with
increases
in
worker
productivity.
The
reason
I,
along
with
63
percent
of
Americans,
support
raising
the
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour
for
hardworking
men
and
women
is
because
a
stronger
minimum
wage
means
a
stronger
economy.
Raising
the
minimum
wage
helps
working
families
make
ends
meet,
and
it
drives
economic
growth
for
local
businesses.
Women
still
make
only
77
cents
for
every
dollar
a
man
earns.
This
pay
gap
is
unfair,
it
hurts
working
families,
and
it&#8217;s
a
drag
on
our
economy.
State
Sen.
Sylvia
Larsen
is
leading
the
charge
for
paycheck
fairness
in
New
Hampshire,
and
in
the
U.S.
Congress,
I
was
proud
to
help
launch
the
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda.
Jumpstarting
the
American
dream
means
supporting
American
women
who
are
working
to
achieve
job
security
and
economic
stability
for
themselves
and
their
families.
Retirement
security
is
another
cornerstone
of
the
American
dream.
Before
Medicare,
only
half
of
seniors
had
health
insurance.
Today,
virtually
all
do.
Thanks
to
the
prescription
drug
benefits
in
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
11,962
Granite
State
Medicare
beneficiaries
saved
an
average
of
$807
each
in
2013.
I
joined
colleagues
to
introduce
the
Strengthening
Social
Security
Act
of
2013,
which
would
improve
benefits
for
current
and
future
Social
Security
beneficiaries,
protecting
the
American
dream.
Recently,
there
have
been
a
number
of
proposals
to
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
New
Hampshire
seniors.
The
Ryan
budget
would
eliminate
the
Medicare
guarantee
for
seniors
and
reopen
the
Medicare
doughnut
hole,
costing
seniors
hundreds
of
dollars
more
each
year.
I
strongly
oppose
this
type
of
budget
and
any
budget
that
contains
cuts
to
Medicare,
Medicaid
or
Social
Security
benefits.
The

America
is
not
that
we

equal
outcome;
it&#8217;s
that
we
try

provide
a

for
all
those
willing

We
need
to
increase
investments
in
education
from

because
education
is
the
key
to
a
nation&#8217;s
prosperity.
Education
brings
higher
incomes,
which
helps
not
only
the
individual
and
his
or
her
family,
but
the
community
as
well.
I
believe
that
risk-takers
and
entrepreneurs
should
be
rewarded
for
their
visions,
their
discoveries,
and
their
innovations.
I
also
believe
that
those
who
work
each
day
to
carry
out
that
vision
should
be
paid
a
fair
wage.
Fair
play
and
opportunity
are

the
American
