Friend,
Wow. All of you are amazing, and I can&#39;t thank you enough.
It&#39;s clear that you&#39;re as offended as I am by John Boehner&#39;s agenda to sue President Obama. What&#39;s worse - my opponent, former Congressman Doug Ose, has remained silent. He hasn&#39;t condemned John Boehner&#39;s agenda. The reason this is so offensive is because we should be working on a jobs program, rebuilding America&#39;s infrastructure, and working on policies that restore America&#39;s middle class.
I&#39;m committed to doing everything I can to restore a Congress that works for the American people - and I can&#39;t thank you enough, because I know you&#39;re committed to that as well.
Thank you again for your support and your confidence. I&#39;m grateful, and I won&#39;t let you down.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - It&#39;s great to be able to spend the month of August at home in Sacramento County. We&#39;ve got an incredibly busy month ahead as we build up to election day, and if you&#39;re in the area, we&#39;d love to see you at one of our campaign offices.
