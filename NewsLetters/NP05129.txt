&ldquo;In California Swing District, Bera Suddenly Finds Himself Vulnerable&rdquo;
-The Hill
There&#39;s two things you need to know:
Republican spending against Ami has SKYROCKETED past $10 million
With 12 days left, no one knows how this race will turn out
Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:
Ami is Republicans&rsquo; top target in the entire country. What we do -- or don&rsquo;t do -- in the next 12 days will determine who wins and who loses.
So listen, this is an all hands on deck moment.
If you&rsquo;re committed to re-electing Ami for Sacramento County, then we need to hear from you today.
