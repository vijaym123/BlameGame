As your Congressman, it is my privilege and honor to provide you with services to help you and your organization navigate the federal grants process. My office is working especially hard in these tumultuous economic times to make non profits, small businesses and municipalities more aware of grants and funding opportunities at the federal level.
This newsletter is designed to help you search for and apply for grants and to provide you with the most up-to-date grants resources. My office stands ready to assist you with your grants work in any way we can. In addition, we welcome your feedback and comments and encourage your suggestions on how to make this newsletter more helpful to your organization.
Below, you will find a list of recent grants awarded in my Congressional District and a list of some new federal funding opportunities.
