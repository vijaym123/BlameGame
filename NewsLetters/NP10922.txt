It was an honor to present Capt. Lester Slate of Exeter with his
service medals for acts of heroism during WWII, the Korean War, and
Vietnam War.
At Capitol Coffee, I was thrilled to catch up with Kim Moody, Executive
Director of the Maine Disability Rights Center.
It was an honor to welcome 71 new U.S. citizens during a Naturalization
Ceremony in Kennebunk.
While aboard the U.S.S. New Mexico I met Electronics Technician 3rd
Class Petty Officer Christapher Johnson of Greenbush, ME.
I was delighted to meet Army Guard Colonel John R. Mosher at the
Meritorious Unit Citation Ceremony for the 286th Combat Sustainment
Support Battalion in early March.
My Trip to the Arctic
In mid-March, I had the extraordinary experience of joining the Navy
for a training exercise known as Ice Exercise (ICEX) to gain a deeper
understanding of U.S. military operations in the Arctic and to learn
about the region's strategic value to our country. I'm a great believer
in the power of first-hand experience and this trip provided me with
invaluable knowledge that will better inform my work on the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
Our journey north began early Saturday morning when we departed from
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. About seven hours later, we arrived
at Camp Nautilus, about 150 miles from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Read

Policy Update
*
While testifying as a Republican witness before a subcommittee
of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, I conveyed
my concerns about overly burdensome federal regulations and expressed
my support for the Federal Permitting Improvement Act
, a bill that would improve the
permitting process for major capital projects.
*
Senator Susan Collins and I wrote a letter urging the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider the economic effect
of
regulating so-called "spent grains" on our brewers and farmers.
Beer-makers in Maine often sell or donate "spent grains" to local
famers as animal feed, but the FDA's proposed rules could make the
centuries-old process much more onerous for all parties involved.
Scenes from Washington.
I was delighted to join Senator Collins in congratulating Sarah Smiley,
her husband Dustin, and their entire family on receiving the American
Legion Auxiliary's 2014 Public Spirit Award.
It was great to have members of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce
stop by my office to catch up and share information about issues
impacting businesses throughout the state.
I am always impressed by the enormous talent demonstrated by young
Mainers and this year's U.S. Senate Youth Program
delegates, Zachary Duperry and Carolyn
Liziewski, were no exception!
