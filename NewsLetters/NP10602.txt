Dear Friend,
It was a cold, blustery, and sometimes snowy "spring" day in Missouri's
Fourth Congressional District as I began an in-district work week with
a series of town hall forums in Mexico, Fayette, Moberly, and
Boonville. The weather was less than appealing, but the reception the
MO4U team received at the various town hall venues was warm and
inviting - making up for our travels through the snow.
Wind and snow - Spring hadn't yet sprung as Congresswoman Hartzler
prepared for a town hall in Fayette
There was much on the minds of the good citizens who were able to join
us along the way. Budget concerns were among the
topics raised at each
of our stops, with citizens commenting on Washington's spending and
asking how it could be brought under control. Government overregulation
was another hot topic, with some citizens and business owners sharing
stories of administrative burdens that are costly and a hindrance to
job-creation. There was a good deal of conversation about our national
defense in light of the unfolding events in Ukraine and concerns about
Russian President Vladimir Putin acting with impunity.

We heard concerns about President Obama's health care law and the high
costs associated with it for everyday Americans who are simply looking
for quality health care plans they like and can afford. Other important
topics raised during our four-county tour included education funding,
transportation dollars from Washington, and moves to trample on our
Second Amendment rights.
In Boonville, I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with
12-year-old Grace McDowell, who attended our town hall with her
grandfather. It is so inspiring to see young people interested in the
future of our country and the direction in which it is headed.

After spending a good deal of time in Washington, it is so refreshing
to spend time in our district, meeting with hardworking people and
hearing a lot of common sense ideas. I always learn from exchanges with
Fourth District citizens and look forward to sharing many of their
great ideas with my colleagues when I return to the Nation's Capital.
On another matter, Americans from coast to coast overcame headaches and
rubbed their sleep-deprived eyes this week as the onerous task of
complying with a complex and costly tax code wrapped up for another
year. Compliance with the nearly 80,000 page tax code is a burden on
both families and small businesses. It takes away quality time from
families, leaving Dad and Mom with less time to engage in activities
with their children. And it hurts job-creating small businesses by
forcing them to spend an average of 40 hours each year making sure that
tax returns are completed in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
rules. This is a waste of time and productivity.
It is time to cut tax rates for all Americans and to end the
unnecessarily complex tax code, replacing it with a simplified, fairer
tax code that will benefit all Americans. We send enough to Washington.
Americans should be able to keep more of their hard-earned money. I
will continue to push for tax reform that will save the American people
time and money and give all of us the tax relief we desire.
Have a good week and a blessed Easter.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress
