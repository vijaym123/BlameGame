Dear Fellow Coloradan,
>From Colorado&rsquo;s towering peaks to its rolling plains, the Centennial State requires a certain toughness from those who call it home. The pioneering, strong women who settled Colorado trekked across these plains and over the Rocky Mountains, rising to the challenge of helping to settle the frontier. It was this spirit of strength and independence that has helped define our special way of life in Colorado.
We see that same rugged spirit in Colorado's women today, as they support thriving communities as business leaders, doctors, attorneys, technology innovators and other professionals who are helping Colorado win the global economic race. Mothers &mdash; whether they work in an office or in the home &mdash;
play an important role raising strong families and the next generation of Colorado leaders. Their work is what makes our state great, and it's why this Women's History Month I want to pay tribute to two of Colorado&rsquo;s most determined female leaders. These two women &mdash; like so many others throughout our history &mdash; have worked tirelessly to achieve success in their personal and professional lives, and by doing so, inspired generations of Coloradans.
Dr. Justina Ford, M.D. was Colorado&rsquo;s first black woman physician and spent her entire career serving low-income patients in the Five Points neighborhood of northeast Denver throughout the early 20th century. Dr. Ford fought against both racism and an industry that was still resistant to female doctors.
Mary Coyle Chase was a fearless journalist at the Rocky Mountain News who triumphed over adversity to become one of Denver&rsquo;s best reporters and Colorado&rsquo;s first Pulitzer Prize winner in 1945. Mary&rsquo;s mother saved just enough for Mary to attend college and propel her daughter into a career as an esteemed reporter.
It's because of the work of pioneers like Justina and Mary that Colorado&rsquo;s future is so bright &mdash; and that future generations of women leaders can achieve similar success. Women now outnumber men nearly three-to-two on college campuses across the country and lead a record number of Fortune 500 companies. In our great state of Colorado, nearly one in three doctors are women and our state legislature has one of the highest percentages of women lawmakers in the country.
But our work is not done. Not by a long shot.
We must continue to address challenges facing women, including securing equal pay for equal work, getting government out of women&rsquo;s private health care decisions, ending violence against women and combatting sexual assault in our military and society as a whole.
I&rsquo;ve been proud to work side by side with Colorado women and my female colleagues in the U.S. Senate to address these issues, among many others. I&rsquo;ve championed the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would ensure that women in the workforce don&rsquo;t receive anything less than equal pay for equal work. I&rsquo;ve strongly supported expanding access to quality, affordable child care. I also fought for the successful reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which safeguards important resources and provides much needed support for survivors of domestic violence. And I continue to stand up for a woman&rsquo;s right to keep her private health decisions between her and her doctor.
I&rsquo;ve been pleased so many of you have shared your thoughts, ideas and concerns with me through my Women&rsquo;s Policy Network since its launch last June. As always, your input has been critical in shaping my policies and legislative agenda. But our conversation is far from over.
I look forward to continuing to hear from you as I tackle the issues that matter most to women in Colorado.
Colorado women are not the type to sit idly by and accept the status quo, and neither am I. That is why we must continue working together in a collaborative way to make sure Washington listens to the needs of women and families across our state. Let&rsquo;s continue to live up to the legacy of Justina, Mary and the other women pioneers who worked to protect Colorado&rsquo;s special way of life.
Warm regards,
