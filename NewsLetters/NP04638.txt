Friends,
I wanted to send you a quick election update.
Here&#39;s what we know: as of today, it is being reported that
there are still over 100,000 ballots that have not been counted
in Sacramento County, and we expect the majority of them to be from the 7th District.
We have also been told that the Registrar of Voters will begin counting ballots
tomorrow
morning.
When I was elected in 2012, I was in a virtual tie with Dan Lungren on election night.
When the tens of thousands of late ballots were counted, we won by over 9,000 votes.
Even in 2010, we picked up thousands of votes as the final numbers rolled in.
While we can&#39;t predict what will happen over the coming weeks, we feel confident that many of the remaining ballots will go our way.
Here&#39;s why we need help today:
we&#39;re hiring the best legal team in America, just like we did in 2012.
We estimate that the ballot counting may take up to three weeks, and we will likely need to raise $100,000 to ensure a proper count.
Yesterday, you helped us raise the initial resources to hire our legal team and make sure we are ready to go
when counting begins tomorrow.
Now, we have to raise the remaining resources to cover the costs.
I hope we can count you in.

Now let&#39;s keep it.
Be well,
Ami
