Your Priorities in 2015
Dear Friend,
As Congress heads into 2015, I want to hear from you on your priorities for the next year.
Serving South Mississippi in Congress is truly an honor, and I plan to continue to fight to bring Mississippi values to Washington, DC.
We must continue to cut spending responsibly, grow our economy, and protect our homeland.
I hope you will take a moment to take
my
survey
below and let me know the most important issues for you and your family in the 114th Congress.
Also, please feel free to sign up for my E-newsletter at
www.palazzo.house.gov
to receive weekly updates on what is happening in Congress and throughout South Mississippi.
Thank you for your continued support as I continue to serve Mississippi's 4th Congressional District.

Sincerely,
Steven M. Palazzo
