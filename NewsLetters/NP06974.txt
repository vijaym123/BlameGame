Karl Rove just made an
ENORMOUS
mistake:
Since he launched his negative smear campaign targeting Brad&rsquo;s strong Democratic record, more than 1,900 supporters have chipped in to fight back. That&rsquo;s JUST in the last 5 days!!! David, it&rsquo;s safe to say Rove&rsquo;s strategy is backfiring,
but we can&rsquo;t let up. Rove&rsquo;s attacks don&rsquo;t come off Chicagoland T.V. for another two weeks. If we can hit 2,000 donors by midnight, it will be a huge boost to our Rapid Response campaign to help Brad go on offense.
