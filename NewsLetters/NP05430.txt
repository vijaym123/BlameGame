Boehner&rsquo;s gonna be
FURIOUS . THIS MORNING:
Boehner&rsquo;s corporate allies launched a massive $17 million ad blitz.
(That&rsquo;s their biggest -- BY FAR -- of the election.)
Boehner&rsquo;s goal? Winning the largest Congressional majority in decades.
BUT THEN:
We
officially
opened up the TRIPLE-MATCH, and something AMAZING happened. YOU. STEPPED. UP.
Now we&rsquo;re within range of a JAW-DROPPING
1OO,OOO
donations since President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action!
The timing could NOT be better!
The final public fundraising deadline of this election is in just 24 hours.
If we can hit our goal, we&rsquo;ll be able to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s ads and deliver the Republicans a humiliating defeat.
