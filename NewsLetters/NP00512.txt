Dear
David,
As families across
the Capital Region celebrate Memorial Day with family and friends,
please join me in taking a moment to remember the many soldiers and their
loved ones who have sacrificed so much in continued defense of our
nation. While we can never repay the debt of gratitude we owe to the
memory of these brave men and women, we pay tribute to them today by
remembering what they gave up for the freedoms we
enjoy.
For veterans and active duty service members, we must work
every day to make good on the promises we made the day they entered
the service. That means providing quality health care, housing, and job
opportunities as they return home.
Thank
you to those who have served and those who continue to serve today.
Happy Memorial Day.
Paul
