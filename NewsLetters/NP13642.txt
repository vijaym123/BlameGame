House
Passes Robert Hurt Legislation to Help
Small Businesses
Dear Friend,
With unemployment remaining unacceptably
high across the Fifth District, Congress
must focus on passing legislation that will
spur job creation for Americans. Fifth
District Virginians know that the federal
governments role is to promote
policies that create opportunities and
increase access to capital for our
entrepreneurs and small businesses to hire
and expand.
Last week, the House of Representatives
passed legislation I introduced to help
promote access to capital and the creation
of new jobs. H.R. 1105, the Small Business
Access and Job Preservation Act, passed the
House with bipartisan support.
This legislation will reduce unnecessary
regulations implemented by Dodd-Frank that
inhibit the potential for new investments
of private capital into small businesses on
Main Streets across the Fifth District. By
eliminating unnecessary and burdensome
regulations, this bill seeks to expand
capital formation so that more companies
can receive the private capital investments
they need to innovate, grow, and create
jobs. H.R. 1105 is a crucial aspect of the
bipartisan Financial Services Committee
agenda to improve access to capital for
businesses so they can infuse much-needed
jobs into our fragile economy.
Shortly after House-passage of the Small
Business Access and Job Preservation Act,
the latest unemployment report was
released. While I was pleased to see that
our national unemployment rate has dropped
slightly, the continued threat of excessive
regulations, tax increases, and
Washingtons out-of-control spending
culture is stalling our economic recovery
and impeding the creation of jobs across
the country. That is why we must implement
policies like H.R. 1105 to fuel job
creation and get our fiscal house in
order.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues in the House to bring
much-needed jobs to Virginia and across the
nation. It is my hope that the Senate will
join us in this imperative effort and
approve the pro-growth legislation we have
passed so that we may look toward a
brighter economic future.
