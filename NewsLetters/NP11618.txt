A Minute with Mike
Dear Friend,
February was a busy month in Washington, capped off by the release of
President Obama's proposed 2015 budget in early March. I am pleased
that the President is focusing on themes that I have always advocated
in Congress - creating opportunity for hard working Americans, building
a 21st century education system, and continuing the drive for
comprehensive immigration reform. In addition, I applaud the President's
proposals for investing in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and
arresting the alarming rate of climate change; although we could do
even more in these key areas. While I don't agree with every point in
this budget, it will help shift the conversation from being about "what
we can't do" to "what we can do." This change of tone is badly needed
in Washington - look no further than the 50th attempt by the House
Leadership to repeal the health care reform law on March 5th for proof.
In my role as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I look
forward to this year's budget and appropriations process. I will
continue to share my thoughts with you as I review this wide-ranging
proposal. Feel free to follow me on social media, where I will be
posting my insights. As always, it is an honor serving the residents of
Santa Clara and Alameda Counties in Congress.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress

Keystone XL Pipeline
This month, the Department of State released its final environmental
impact statement (FEIS) on the ?Keystone XL? pipeline. Most of the news
stories written about the report portrayed it as good news for pipeline
supporters. But lost in those reports was that in the FEIS, the U.S.
Department of State acknowledged for the first time that the Keystone
XL could accelerate ?climate change?. With climate change posing one of
the greatest threats to our nation today and in the future, I believe
that the President should strongly consider this finding as he decides
whether the project is truly in our national interest.?????

Crowdhall with CoveredCA
I was pleased to host a Crowdhall with Covered California in February.
We took questions from across CA-17 about the impacts of health care
reform. I was excited to take advantage of this online platform to host
a conversation on this crucial issue. You can see the hall here:

The Day We Fight Back - NSA
I was proud to support "The Day We Fight Back" on February 11th.
Thousands of individuals and organizations came together to protest
against the overreach of the NSA's surveillance programs. As an
opponent of legislation that violates our digital freedoms, including
SOPA, PIPA, and the PATRIOT Act, I am a proud co-sponsor of the USA
FREEDOM Act, which the protest called for specifically. This bill would
rein in the dragnet collection of data by the NSA, increase
transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, provide
businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA requests,
and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue cases before
the FISC. Every American has the right to privacy, and I am fighting to
protect this right.

#WhatWomenNeed this Valentines Day
Valentine's Day was an excellent opportunity to focus on
?#WhatWomenNeed?. Flowers and chocolates are fine, but what women
really need is equal pay for equal work and the opportunity to succeed.
We can support all of the women in our lives by fighting for paid
maternity leave, affordable child care, and allowing them to have
control of their reproductive health. You can see the stories people
shared at: womensucceed.dems.gov???

Anti-Asian American Racism at UCLA
In response to a hate-speech incident at UCLA, I stand in solidarity
with the ?Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)? community and
applaud President Napolitano's support of the AAPI students. Racist or
sexist speech has no place in our society. As founder of the Anti-Bully
Caucus, I stand by those who have been attacked and made to feel
marginalized. I have worked hard to foster diversity, understanding,
and awareness of Asian culture, before and after my time as Chairman of
the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.???

Meeting Secretary of Commerce Pritzker
I was happy to meet with Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker during
her visit to Silicon Valley. We discussed bringing a manufacturing hub
to the valley and the opening of the new United States Patent and
Trademark Office satellite location in San Jose.???

Federal IT Procurement
I had the pleasure of speaking at a roundtable discussion on Federal IT
procurement hosted by the Public Spend Forum. The event brought
together academics, industry experts, government representatives, and
IT experts to talk about what Federal IT procurement reform could look
like. I believe that a transparent and truly open system will create
opportunities for innovators, building on the strengths of ?Silicon
Valley?, and will ensure our government has access to the best tools
and solutions to address the challenges of the 21st Century.?
Back to top
Foresight Nanotech
It was a pleasure speaking at the Foresight Institute Conference on
?Nanotechnology?, learning about the latest advances in this
groundbreaking field, and hearing visions for its future. As a leading
advocate for nanotechnology in Congress, I developed the first nanotech
bill, co-authored the 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D; Act, and convened
the California Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology. I've used the
recommendations of that task force as the basis for my Nanotechnology
Advancement and New Opportunities Act (the NANO Act). This act, which
has been endorsed by the NanoBusiness Commercialization Association,
would encourage responsible development of the industry in a number of
ways, including creating a public-private partnership to provide
funding for pre-commercial stage nanomanufacturing R&D; projects.???

SCU Immigration Speech
I was happy to speak at Santa Clara University about reforming our
broken immigration system. Since coming to Washington, I have called on
Congress to reform our broken immigration system so that it is
comprehensive, inclusive, humane, and invests in America's future. I
believe in an immigration system that respects the dignity of immigrant
communities and recognizes their contributions to American society. It
was an honor to speak about what I am doing in Congress to continue the
fight for comprehensive immigration reform with young law students from
the Santa Clara chapters of La Raza and the ACLU at the event hosted by
the American Constitution Society.
