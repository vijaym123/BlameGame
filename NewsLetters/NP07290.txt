Dear Friend,
Like many living in Ohios 16th
District, I was deeply troubled to learn of
the widespread mismanagement within the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
According to an audit released by the VA
last month, nearly 60,000 veterans are
still waiting for their initial
appointment.
The House of Representatives acted
swiftly to address the systemic failures at
the VA that led to the unacceptable
treatment of veterans in Ohio and across
the country. Last month, the House passed
the Veteran Access to Care Act with
unanimous support. This bipartisan
legislation was the first step toward
implementing much needed reforms at the VA.
It included provisions to allow veterans to
receive private care outside of the VA if
they have experienced extensive wait times
or if they live more than 40 miles from a
VA medical facility.
Additionally, the House passed the
Veterans Affairs Management Accountability
Act, a bill that empowers the Veterans
Affairs Secretary to demote or remove
senior officials who are not doing their
jobs. Veterans who depend on the VA have an
expectation that senior leaders within the
agency are accountable to them. However, it
has become apparent that senior officials
who presided over negligence and
mismanagement linked to preventable deaths,
patient safety incidents, and backlog
increases received a bonus or impressive
performance review. This is
unacceptable.
The United States Senate followed the
Houses lead and passed similar
legislation to reform the VA. This past
week, the House voted on a package that was
the product of a compromise between House
and Senate leaders to reach an agreement on
how to best address the problems at the
VA.
The Veterans Access to Care
through Choice, Accountability, and
Transparency Act is a bipartisan, bicameral
package of bills that will bring more
accountability and provide meaningful
reforms to the VA. Highlights from this
legislation include providing $10 billion
for veterans to seek private care at
hospitals and clinics outside the VA, and
$5 billion to allow the department to hire
more doctors, nurses, and medical staff. It
provides $1.5 billion to be spent on leases
to use other medical facilities at 27 sites
around the country. It makes it easier for
the VA Secretary to fire staff at a
department where officials covered up long
wait times and prevents the VA from
awarding bonuses to employees for the next
two years. Lastly, it requires public
colleges to provide in-state tuition to
veterans and eligible dependents.
Passage of the Veterans Access to
Care through Choice, Accountability, and
Transparency Act is evidence that when the
House and Senate work together, much can be
accomplished. This legislation will not
only bring accountability to the VA, it
will also enhance veterans access to
care as well as the quality of care that
they receive. I look forward to the
President signing this important
legislation into law.
