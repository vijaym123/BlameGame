Aloha and Mele Kalikimaka David,
Wishing you and your ohana a wonderful holiday and the very best in the New Year!
It&rsquo;s been an honor to serve the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and I look forward to serving you in the new term, which convenes on January 6, 2015.
If you happen to be in our nation&rsquo;s capital, I hope you&rsquo;ll swing by our new office to share your aloha at an open house reception following the swearing-in ceremony on the House Floor.
