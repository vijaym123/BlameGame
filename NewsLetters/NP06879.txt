Dear
Friends,
Our
healthcare system today is extremely complex and few Americans have the
ability to make sound and affordable decisions for themselves and their
families. Consumers are facing rising costs and fewer options, and cant
predict with any certainty how upcoming changes in the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act will affect them.
I wanted to extend to you an invitation to
attend my Community Leadership Forum on Healthcare this Thursday,
August 28 at Elgin Community College . I plan to bring together a
diverse group of high caliber community stakeholders to address todays
challenges to the healthcare system, and provide important information
for health consumers like you in the 14th District.
Like my previous community
leadership forums, I am convening this event to give you the most relevant
and up-to-date information to make informed decisions as you engage the
healthcare system.
Please see below my signature for a complete agenda for the event so
you can plan accordingly. You can RSVP here :
