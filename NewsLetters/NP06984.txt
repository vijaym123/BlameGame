Rubio Comments On ISILs Claim
To Have Beheaded American
Photojournalist
On Tuesday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist
groups claim to have beheaded an
American photojournalist:
The brutal execution of
American journalist James Foley by ISIL
is the latest example of the evil and
barbarism of these terrorists. My
thoughts and prayers are with the Foley
family and with other Western hostages
who at this hour are still being
held.
Just as Al Qaedas
initial killings of Americans abroad
foretold the carnage they would unleash
within our borders, this barbaric
beheading of a defenseless hostage is
the clearest indication to date that
ISIL has declared war on the United
States, on the American people, and on
freedom loving people everywhere.
For more than a year, ISIL
has been murdering civilians, raping
women and young girls and enslaving
them, and carrying out a systematic
genocide of anyone who does not share
their warped and extremist Islamist
views. ISIL cannot be reasoned with,
they cant be negotiated with,
and their view of the world is
irreconcilable with civilized
society.
Iremain deeply
concerned that despite the
preponderance of evidence that proves
ISIL is a fundamentally evil and
dangerous terrorist threat to the
United States, President Obama
continues to appear unwilling to do
what is necessary to confront ISIL and
communicate clearly to the American
people about the threat ISIL poses to
our country and to our way of life.
ISIL is not a problem for only
Iraqis or Syrians to solve. A piecemeal
approach will not eliminate the growing
threat to the United States and our
allies. If we do not do more to assist
our Iraqi partners and those moderate
Syrians who are fighting ISIL and
directly target ISILs leadership
and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear
that James Foley will not be the only
American to die at their hands.
Constituent Casework Corner
Tara petitioned for a visa for her
husband, a foreign national, but the
application had not yet been approved by
the State Department. She was pregnant
and gave birth prematurely and the child
required extensive medical care. She
contacted Senator Rubios office
for assistance. A member of the staff
contacted the Consulate to request an
expedited appointment since she provided
a copy of the hospital letter. The
interview date was pushed up, and her
husbands visa was subsequently
approved.
