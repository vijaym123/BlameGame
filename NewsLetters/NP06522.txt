&ldquo;The Republican National Committee will announce Thursday that it will pour an additional $8 million into get-out-the-vote efforts in targeted Senate races, another acknowledgment that reclaiming control of the chamber remains the GOP&rsquo;s top priority in 2014.&rdquo; -
Politico , 8/28/14
Dear Friend,
Republicans read the news, too. I&rsquo;m sure they saw that the
Washington Post
gave them an 82% chance of taking over the Senate. They&rsquo;re trying to capitalize by beefing up their ground game.
We&rsquo;ve seen the disastrous results when Democrats stay home during midterm elections. With Republican offices and staffers already on the ground here in Massachusetts, we need to counter their ground-game moves with a GOTV effort of our own. Your contributions fuel our ground game. By giving $5, you&rsquo;re helping us organize precincts, contact voters, and defend Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We have a $50,000 primary day deadline in a little less than three days. We have an election in a little less than 60 days. And we&rsquo;ve got a Republican Party that&rsquo;s going to go all-out until the polls close. It&rsquo;s up to us to build a firewall for Ed.
The Republicans only need to pick up six seats, and with this recent announcement, they&rsquo;re showing that they&rsquo;re serious. We can&rsquo;t let one of those seats be from Massachusetts. Send Ed back to the Senate and help prevent a Tea Party takeover. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can before our primary day deadline on Tuesday, September 9th.
Thanks.
