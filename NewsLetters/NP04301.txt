Last Week was a Busy One
Dear Friend:
This has been an eventful news week. I want to share a few highlights with you.
Monday, November 17 th , the Congressional Institute announced that it will hold its annual issues conference for the House Republican Conference in the 15 th
District at the Hershey Lodge.
Not only is this a way to draw national attention to Derry Township and the Dauphin County region, it will also be a nice boost to the local economy as over 500 hotel rooms will be rented.
Tuesday, November 18 th ,
I learned that Speaker Boehner named me the Chairman of the House Ethics Committee. I have served on the Committee for six years and I will continue to work with Committee members from both parties to provide the accountability and transparency the American people demand of their elected leaders.

Wednesday, November 19 th , I appeared on the Dom Giordano Show to discuss immigration reform and the need to develop a sound strategy to combat President Obama&rsquo;s power grab by issuing an Executive Order that exceeds his authority. You can listen to the discussion

Also on Wednesday, I led an effort by our Pennsylvania Congressional colleagues calling on the NCAA to release all the e-mails and documents related to their investigation of Penn State.
We made the decision to act
in the wake of the revelation of e-mails that surfaced during the discovery process in the lawsuit brought against the NCAA by Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman and the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Treasurer Rob McCord. Read the story by the Morning Call&rsquo;s Mark Wogenrich

Thursday, November 20 th , I was named as Chairman for the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee controls the third largest amount of discretionary spending of the twelve Appropriations Subcommittees. The bill provides funding for military construction efforts for all branches of the military including Guard and Reserve Forces. It also designates funds to provide housing and services for military personnel and their families and base upkeep. Importantly, it also directs funding to veterans&rsquo; benefits and programs.
