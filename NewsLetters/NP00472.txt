Dear
Friends,
As I have said before, the best part of serving you in Congress
is when I am home working with you in Utah. Here is a quick re-cap of
my District Work Week:
Town Hall Meetings in Cedar City
and Hurricane
Town Halls are a great way for me to meet
with my constituents and discuss current issues. It helps me understand
how I can best represent you in Washington, D.C.. I enjoyed meeting so
many of my constituents from Hurricane and Cedar City.
Apache Flight with the
Utah National Guard
The Apache helicopter is not only an awesome weapon
system but also a critical part of our Utah National Guards
capability. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of keeping these
helicopters in the National Guard. Our Utah Gaurd Apache pilots are the best in
the business, it was an honor flying with them. As a fellow veteran,
I thank them for all they do to protect this great
nation.
Visited Farmington
Elementary
Last spring, I asked elementary students
to join me in celebrating Constitution Day by writting essays on the
importance of the Constitution. I was able to visit a number of the
participating schools and discuss the history of our great nation with
them. These experiences are truly the most rewarding. All policy makers
should spend time in the classroom among our youth and educators. I
appreciate them having me!
EPA Power Grab
Last week, while Congress was out of session, the Obama
administration finalized their Waters of the USA Rulethe most
significant power grab ever by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The rule would expand EPA regulatory authority to streams, ditches and
maybe even puddles. Specifically, the proposed rule would allow the EPA
to regulate the land and water for 4,000 feet on either side of a
regulated water way or tributary to a regulated water way. There are only
3 rivers in Utah that would not be regulated. This is very alarming.
The House has already passed legislation stopping this rule. I call on
my friends in the Senate to act and stop this executive overreach. I
will continue to fight to make sure this rule is not
enacted.
