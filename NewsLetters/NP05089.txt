LATEST POLL: SCHNEIDER AND DOLD IN A DEAD-HEAT
David, this is the last thing we needed:
Boehner's campaign arm at the NRCC is spending $2 MILLION in a last-ditch effort to catapult Bob Dold to victory.
In total, Republican spending against Brad has now topped $8 million. Here's the bottom line:
there's 8 days left and our race is TIED.
If we don't stand up to this final barrage of attacks, Brad's chances to win re-election could be in serious jeopardy. According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t yet stepped up for Brad in the final stretch.
David, in a race this close, your donation could be the difference between winning and losing. Are you in?
