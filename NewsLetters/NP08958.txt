News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
If you've read a newspaper or turned on a television at all this week,
then you already know what the news is. Last Saturday, President Obama
announced the he had swapped five high level Taliban operatives for our
only POW in Afghanistan, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. A firestorm has ensued. So
what is all of the fuss about and where do I stand on it?
Well, for starters, as you all probably know, I have been extremely
active in Congress trying to raise awareness that Sgt. Bergdahl existed
in the first place. You would be amazed at how many members of Congress
didn't know he was being held until the announcement was made last
weekend. As a father of three American soldiers, I was angry about
that. Many people, including reportedly some who served alongside
Bergdahl, have understandably questioned the loss of lives in trying to
locate him. But at the end of the day, an American solider is an
American solider and even in cases of misconduct, his country should
know he's being held captive. His country should still want to find the
guys who are holding him. Now that he's back, the Army will need to
look at the facts surrounding his disappearance and whether punishment
is in order. But in whatever case, that punishment should be carried
out by the United States military and not by the terrorists.
So where does that leave us now that the President has swapped the
prisoners for him? It depends a lot on your judgment of the deal
itself. The prospect of swapping these five Taliban leaders has been on
the table for a long time (as has the opposition to it). According to
reports, Defense Secretary Gates, CIA Director Panetta, and Secretary
of State Clinton (all former) collectively opposed the deal when it was
first brought up in 2011. According to Senator Feinstein, the Democrat
chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the opposition among those
briefed in Congress was similarly overwhelming. "Virtually unanimous",
I believe is the phrase she used. So it seems that the vast majority of
those involved in the discussion were opposed on the grounds that
releasing these militants presented too great of a threat to our troops
and to our allies.
Adding fuel to the fire, the President was required by law to notify
Congress 30 days in advance of any release from Guantanamo. Senator
Feinstein, a liberal herself and general supporter of the President,
was outraged when he didn't comply with that law. She attributed the
"oversight", as the administration put it, to a recognition within the
White House that congressional opposition to the deal was overwhelming.
As much as I wanted to see our guy out of Taliban hands, I was part of
that opposition. As a father, I think like most Americans, I felt a lot
of anguish for the family. The thought of having one of my boys being
held by the Taliban for five years is beyond anything I care to
contemplate. But as an American and as policymaker, I can't just think
as a father. Our responsibility is for the security of our forces at
large and for our nation as a whole. So while a big part of me is very
glad that the Taliban is no longer holding one of our soldiers
prisoner, I deeply question the wisdom of the President's decision.
These are not easy questions by any means and I think reasonable people
can disagree about them. It's rare that you can have two seemingly
inviolable principles that are in direct contradiction to one another:
leave no man behind and never do anything to jeopardize our national
security. In my opinion, at the end of the day, the primary
responsibility is for the nation as a whole. You do the best you can
and you do everything you can, but "doing everything" doesn't mean
putting our guys needlessly at risk.
In any case, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this. We're still
a long way from having all of the facts. Even a week later, despite the
briefing requirement, we're still getting just about all of our
information from the media. The House Armed Services Committee will be
holding a hearing this coming week and I will very definitely be an
active participant. I'm not sure how much will come out and to what
extent the information will be classified, but I sincerely hope I'll be
able to report more next Saturday. In the meantime, as always, if there
is anything I can do to be of service, please let me know.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
If
you&#8217;ve
read
a
newspaper
or
turned
on
a
television
at
all
this
week,
then
you
already
know
what
the
news
is.
Last
Saturday,
President
Obama
announced
the
he
had
swapped
five
high
level
Taliban
operatives
for
our
only
POW
in
Afghanistan,
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl.
A
firestorm
has
ensued.
So
what
is
all
of
the
fuss
about
and
where
do
I
stand
on
it?
Well,
for
starters,
as
you
all
probably
know,
I
have
been
extremely
active
in
Congress
trying
to
raise
awareness
that
Sgt.
Bergdahl
existed
in
the
first
place.
You
would
be
amazed
at
how
many
members
of
Congress
didn&#8217;t
know
he
was
being
held
until
the
announcement
was
made
last
weekend.
As
a
father
of
three
American
soldiers,
I
was
angry
about
that.
Many
people,
including
reportedly
some
who
served
alongside
Bergdahl,
have
understandably
questioned
the
loss
of
lives
in
trying
to
locate
him.
But
at
the
end
of
the
day,
an
American
solider
is
an
American
solider
and
even
in
cases
of
misconduct,
his
country
should
know
he&#8217;s
being
held
captive.
His
country
should
still
want
to
find
the
guys
who
are
holding
him.
Now
that
he&#8217;s
back,
the
Army
will
need
to
look
at
the
facts
surrounding
his
disappearance
and
whether
punishment
is
in
order.
But
in
whatever
case,
that
punishment
should
be
carried
out
by
the
United
States
military
and
not
by
the
terrorists.
So
where
does
that
leave
us
now
that
the
President
has
swapped
the
prisoners
for
him?
It
depends
a
lot
on
your
judgment
of
the
deal
itself.
The
prospect
of
swapping
these
five
Taliban
leaders
has
been
on
the
table
for
a
long
time
(as
has
the
opposition
to
it).
According
to
reports,
Defense
Secretary
Gates,
CIA
Director
Panetta,
and
Secretary
of
State
Clinton
(all
former)
collectively
opposed
the
deal
when
it
was
first
brought
up
in
2011.
According
to
Senator
Feinstein,
the
Democrat
chair
of
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee,
the
opposition
among
those
briefed
in
Congress
was
similarly
overwhelming.
&#8220;Virtually
unanimous&#8221;,
I
believe
is
the
phrase
she
used.
So
it
seems
that
the
vast
majority
of
those
involved
in
the
discussion
were
opposed
on
the
grounds
that
releasing
these
militants
presented
too
great
of
a
threat
to
our
troops
and
to
our
allies.
Adding
fuel
to
the
fire,
the
President
was
required
by
law
to
notify
Congress
30
days
in
advance
of
any
release
from
Guantanamo.
Senator
Feinstein,
a
liberal
herself
and
general
supporter
of
the
President,
was
outraged
when
he
didn&#8217;t
comply
with
that
law.
She
attributed
the
&#8220;oversight&#8221;,
as
the
administration
put
it,
to
a
recognition
within
the
White
House
that
congressional
opposition
to
the
deal
was
overwhelming.
As
much
as
I
wanted
to
see
our
guy
out
of
Taliban
hands,
I
was
part
of
that
opposition.
As
a
father,
I
think
like
most
Americans,
I
felt
a
lot
of
anguish
for
the
family.
The
thought
of
having
one
of
my
boys
being
held
by
the
Taliban
for
five
years
is
beyond
anything
I
care
to
contemplate.
But
as
an
American
and
as
policymaker,
I
can&#8217;t
just
think
as
a
father.
Our
responsibility
is
for
the
security
of
our
forces
at
large
and
for
our
nation
as
a
whole.
So
while
a
big
part
of
me
is
very
glad
that
the
Taliban
is
no
longer
holding
one
of
our
soldiers
prisoner,
I
deeply
question
the
wisdom
of
the
President&#8217;s
decision.
These
are
not
easy
questions
by
any
means
and
I
think
reasonable
people
can
disagree
about
them.
It&#8217;s
rare
that
you
can
have
two
seemingly
inviolable
principles
that
are
in
direct
contradiction
to
one
another:
leave
no
man
behind
and
never
do
anything
to
jeopardize
our
national
security.
In
my
opinion,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
primary
responsibility
is
for
the
nation
as
a
whole.
You
do
the
best
you
can
and
you
do
everything
you
can,
but
"doing
everything"
doesn&#8217;t
mean
putting
our
guys
needlessly
at
risk.
In
any
case,
I&#8217;m
interested
to
hear
your
thoughts
on
this.
We&#8217;re
still
a
long
way
from
having
all
of
the
facts.
Even
a
week
later,
despite
the
briefing
requirement,
we&#8217;re
still
getting
just
about
all
of
our
information
from
the
media.
The
House
Armed
Services
Committee
will
be
holding
a
hearing
this
coming
week
and
I
will
very
definitely
be
an
active
participant.
I&#8217;m
not
sure
how
much
will
come
out
and
to
what
extent
the
information
will
be
classified,
but
I
sincerely
hope
I&#8217;ll
be
able
to
report
more
next
Saturday.
In
the
meantime,
as
always,
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
to
be
of
service,
please
let
me
know.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
