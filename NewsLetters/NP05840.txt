Last week in Belmont County, I hosted an Energy Jobs Fair along with
Belmont College and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association. Over thirty
companies participated, and people from all over Eastern Ohio had an
opportunity to connect with employers looking to fill energy-related
jobs. A lot of people I talked to had been laid off and were eager to
get back in the workforce. Others were looking to get a better job that
paid more or provided more certainty. I've already heard some success
stories.
The companies that came were looking for good workers with the skills
they need to help expand their operations. For many of the job seekers,
though, that is the problem. They want to work. They have the drive and
the desire to go out and find new jobs, but they don't have the
training and qualifications that some of these employers were looking
for. We call this problem the "skills gap."
This skills gap is one reason that we have 320,000 Ohioans
looking for a job at the same time there are over 160,000 job openings
in our state. And until we do something about that skills gap, too many
of our friends and neighbors are going to be left behind. That's why,
in addition to the companies that came to the Jobs Fair, we invited
entities that help train workers, including Belmont College but also
community colleges and educational institutions from the region. Job
seekers who didn't have the skills they need were able to be matched up
with training institutions that can help them get those skills.
Once again, I saw firsthand how the federal workforce training programs
are falling short. The federal government has dozens of them, spread
over nine different federal departments, spending over $15 billion of
our tax dollars every year. It is a complicated, often redundant and
inefficient arrangement, one that means the unemployed aren't getting
the training they need while some of the federal funds are being
wasted.
The American people-and our nation's employers and job seekers-deserve
better. Fortunately, help is on the way. I worked with Senator Michael
Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, on bipartisan legislation called the
CAREER Act to improve our nation's retraining programs, making them
more effective and less inefficient. This issue cuts across party
lines, and we were able to pass key provisions of our legislation
recently in Congress. These provisions will create incentives that
reward those job training providers whose programs produce measureable
results in job placement and retention. They also reform training
programs to match skills with the jobs available in the market.
These provisions, which will take effect in 2015, will
help.
But we aren't stopping there. I also want to ensure that young people
have access to the skills they need to ensure they can find a job when
they graduate from high school. I recently introduced the Creating
Quality Technical Educators Act which would provide a stream of federal
funds for recruiting and training high quality CTE or vocational
teachers at no additional cost to taxpayers.
These commonsense, bipartisan reforms will ensure federal funds are
better spent, and they will help to bring down our stubbornly high
unemployment rate. They will help employers find the highly-skilled
workforce they need to grow and expand. Most importantly, they will
empower men and women from all over Ohio who want to build a better
life for themselves and their families to take advantage of the good
jobs that are waiting to be filled.
And more of those jobs are coming. A recent study found that the oil
and natural gas industry is expected to create 1.3 million new jobs by
2030. These are good jobs that will pay well above the average salary
in Ohio.

Last
week in
Belmont
County,
I
hosted
an
Energy
Jobs
Fair
along
with
Belmont
College
and
the
Ohio
Oil
and
Gas
Association.
Over
thirty
companies
participated,
and
people
from
all
over
Eastern
Ohio
had
an
opportunity
to
connect
with
employers
looking
to
fill
energy-related
jobs.
A
lot
of
people
I
talked
to
had
been
laid
off
and
were
eager
to
get
back
in
the
workforce.
Others
were
looking
to
get
a
better
job
that
paid
more
or
provided
more
certainty.
I've
already
heard
some
success
stories.
The
companies
that
came
were
looking
for
good
workers
with
the
skills
they
need
to
help
expand
their
operations.
For
many
of
the
job
seekers,
though,
that
is
the
problem.
They
want
to
work.
They
have
the
drive
and
the
desire
to
go
out
and
find
new
jobs,
but
they
don't
have
the
training
and
qualifications
that
some
of
these
employers were
looking
for.
We
call
this
problem
the
"skills
gap."
This
skills
gap
is
one
reason
that
we
have
320,000
Ohioans
looking
for
a
job
at
the
same
time
there
are
over
160,000
job
openings
in
our
state.
And
until
we
do
something
about
that
skills
gap,
too
many
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
are
going
to
be
left
behind.
That's
why,
in
addition
to
the
companies
that
came
to
the
Jobs
Fair,
we
invited
entities
that
help
train
workers,
including
Belmont
College
but
also
community
colleges
and
educational
institutions
from
the
region.
Job
seekers
who
didn't
have
the
skills
they
need
were
able
to
be
matched
up
with
training
institutions
that
can
help
them
get
those
skills.
Once
again,
I
saw
firsthand
how
the
federal
workforce
training
programs
are
falling
short.
The
federal
government
has
dozens
of
them,
spread
over
nine
different
federal
departments,
spending
over
$15
billion
of
our
tax
dollars
every
year.
It
is
a
complicated,
often
redundant
and
inefficient
arrangement,
one
that
means
the
unemployed
aren't
getting
the
training
they
need
while
some
of
the federal
funds
are
being
wasted.
The
American
people&#8212;and
our
nation's
employers
and
job
seekers&#8212;deserve
better.
Fortunately,
help
is
on
the
way.
I
worked
with
Senator
Michael
Bennet,
a
Democrat
from
Colorado,
on
bipartisan
legislation
called
the
CAREER
Act to
improve
our
nation's
retraining
programs,
making
them
more
effective
and
less
inefficient.
This
issue
cuts
across
party
lines,
and
we
were
able
to
pass
key
provisions
of
our
legislation
recently
in
Congress.
These
provisions
will
create
incentives
that
reward
those
job
training
providers
whose
programs
produce
measureable
results
in
job
placement
and
retention.
They
also
reform
training
programs
to
match
skills
with
the
jobs
available
in
the
market.
These
provisions,
which
will
take
effect
in
2015,
will
help.
But
we
aren't
stopping
there. I
also
want
to
ensure
that
young
people
have
access
to
the
skills
they
need
to
ensure
they
can
find
a
job
when
they
graduate
from
high
school.
I
recently
introduced
the
Creating
Quality
Technical
Educators
Act
which
would
provide
a
stream
of
federal
funds
for
recruiting
and
training
high
quality
CTE
or
vocational teachers
at
no
additional
cost
to
taxpayers.
These
commonsense,
bipartisan
reforms
will
ensure
federal
funds
are
better
spent,
and
they
will
help
to
bring
down
our
stubbornly
high
unemployment
rate.
They
will help
employers
find
the
highly-skilled
workforce
they
need
to
grow
and
expand.
Most
importantly,
they
will
empower
men
and
women
from
all
over
Ohio
who
want
to
build
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
to
take
advantage
of
the
good
jobs
that
are
waiting
to
be
filled.
And
more
of
those
jobs
are
coming.
A
recent
study
found
that
the
oil
and
natural
gas
industry
is
expected
to
create
1.3
million
new
jobs
by
2030.
These
are
good jobs
that
will
pay
well
above
the
average
salary
in
Ohio.
