Dear Friend,
As a doctor who has treated patients in Northern Michigan for the last
30 years, I know how important health care is to Michigan families. In
Congress, I've been fighting to protect Michigan families from
Washington's takeover of health care.

Instead of putting Washington in charge and putting our care at risk, I
want to see patient-centered reforms that actually lower costs and
improve access to care

patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington.
