15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress. As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross

Keep Your Health Plan Act
The president promised countless times that if you liked your health care plan, you could keep it. He later admitted that his promise proved to be inaccurate. I
supported the
Keep Your Health Plan Act
that would allow hard-working Americans to have their promised plans . This is one more reason why we need to replace Obamacare with health care reform that is actually patient-centered and market-based.
Farm Bill Update
The House passed a short-term extension of the farm bill to allow for the negotiations on a long-term bill to continue. It is critical that the conferees come up with a
long-term solution to give our farmers, ranchers, and growers certainty .
Budget Update
The House also
passed a bipartisan budget bill .
While this deal does not include everything I would like it to, it is a step in the right direction and reduces the deficit and does not raise taxes.
It helps provide relief for MacDill AFB and other domestic priorities in Central Florida facing across-the-board sequester cuts.
Giving More Control to Homeowners in the Event of a Disaster
I introduced
H.R. 3298, the Disaster Savings Accounts Act
that would
give homeowners more control
and will allow people to plan ahead for their safety and
reduce the need for taxpayer-funded government intervention
in the event of a natural disaster.
