Dear Neighbors,
The "Make It In America" agenda is a simple goal and national
aspiration that will rejuvenate and reinvigorate our manufacturing
industry and secure 21st Century economic success for our country.
Continuing my commitment to U.S. manufacturing, this week, I unveiled
new legislation to strengthen American manufacturing.
The Accelerate Our Manufacturers Act expands a critical tax deduction
for new equipment purchases specifically for manufacturing. This
deduction gives manufacturers greater flexibility in accounting,
improves their cash flow and actively encourages investments in new
technologies.
I am honored that Minority Whip Steny Hoyer included the Accelerate Our
Manufacturers Act in his "Make It In America" package. The "Make It In
America" suite of legislation is a comprehensive jobs plan that aims to
revitalize America's manufacturing sector and help create high-skill,
high-wage jobs.
The Accelerate Our Manufacturers Act is the second bill I've introduced
that's been included in the "Make It In America" initiative, joining
the AMERICA Works Act, which I introduced last year.
The success of American manufacturers is essential to building a strong
middle class. Helping manufacturers invest in their future and new
technologies boosts our manufacturing sector, spurs growth and creates
quality jobs. I've been committed to these goals since the day I took
office, and I will continue working to strengthen our manufacturing
industry each day.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
The
&#8220;Make
It
In
America&#8221; agenda is
a
simple
goal
and
national
aspiration
that
will
rejuvenate
and
reinvigorate
our

and
secure
21st
Century
economic
success
for
our
country.
Continuing
my
commitment
to
U.S.
manufacturing,
this
week,
I
unveiled
new
legislation
to
strengthen
American
manufacturing.
The
Accelerate
Our
Manufacturers
Act
expands
a
critical
tax
deduction
for
new
equipment
purchases
specifically
for
manufacturing.
This
deduction
gives
manufacturers

improves

and
actively
encourages
investments
in
new

I
am
honored
that
Minority
Whip
Steny
Hoyer
included
the
Accelerate
Our
Manufacturers
Act
in
his
&#8220;Make
It
In

package.
The
&#8220;Make

suite
of
legislation
is
a
comprehensive
jobs
plan
that
aims
to
revitalize

The

The

of

Helping

invest
in
their

and
creates

I&#8217;ve
