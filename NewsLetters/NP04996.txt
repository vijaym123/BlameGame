Friend -- I&rsquo;ve been FLOODING your inbox.
It&rsquo;s because today is the single most important day of the whole election
-- the deadline for our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote program hits at midnight.
I&rsquo;m pleading with you: I know it&rsquo;s the crack of dawn, but PLEASE read this:
12 races are polling within single digits. TWELVE!
Republicans must gain only six seats for Senate control.
That&rsquo;s 50-50 odds -- simply alarming! We CAN win, but
I need your help and I need it now.
Donate before the end-of-month deadline in 16 hours and we&rsquo;ll get our GOTV folks out in the field immediately. The triple-match ends at midnight!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I can&rsquo;t overstate the urgency today:
This weekend, we have plans to mobilize 575,000 additional Democratic voters.
These Democrats could vote McConnell out of office. They could keep the Senate blue. They could help us win across the deep-red South.
But we must raise $1,000,000 more to implement our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote plan -- that WON&rsquo;T be easy. I really need your last-minute help.
Will you pitch in right away? There are just 16 hours until the final end-of-month deadline ever, so time is very short.
Let&rsquo;s do this!
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
