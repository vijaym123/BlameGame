Message from Mark
I hope the start of your summer is treating you well.
It's my favorite time of year, and as we both know this stretch at its
start is particularly beautiful in the Lowcountry given its good
breezes and it's not yet too warm.
Makes me want to hurry south each
weekend, but in the meantime I just wanted to take a moment to share
some interesting things that have been happening here in Congress.
The most recent political news obviously surrounds Eric Cantor's loss
in Virginia. It was significant in two ways. One, it is a reminder that
for all our feelings of frustration at times on the difficulty of
change, here was a guy who had a campaign budget of only $200,000 while
Cantor raised over $5.5 million in this election cycle.and lost. It
says each of us has more voice in our political system than we might
believe - accordingly, it's vital that each one of us make it a point
to make our voice heard. From a political perspective, I think it
derails the prospect of immigration reform which had been growing steam
over the last few months.
The other big political news has been continued meltdown in Washington
in the way that the federal government is meant to serve the people. I
hear over and over again at home that people feel like the President
has become imperial in his attitude, and has grown to little regard the
Constitutional checks and balances in place with the Congress and
Judicial branch. It increasingly looks like there will be a consequence
to this in November, but in the meantime revelations from the IRS or VA
serve to heighten people's distrust of their government.
I came here to impact government's growth and spending, and on many
subjects I pray the Irish prayer each day in asking God to give me the
wisdom to fight the things I can change, leave alone the things I can't
- and the wisdom to know the difference. In this vein we recognized
early on that structural change could come to the NSA through a series
of rifle shot reforms and accordingly I originally introduced in HR
3436
a reform that would give independence
to the Inspector General at the National Security Agency. I am pleased
to say it was included in the Intelligence Authorization Act, which
passed the House. While I had some bigger concerns which led me to
ultimately oppose the final bill, and I think there's still further to
go on reforming the NSA (you can read more on that here
), our bill and its adoption, represents a win for
liberty and better oversight at the NSA.
Important to Charleston and Harbor deepening, the President just signed
the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), which funds
water infrastructure spending. I think the bill's approach was
important in the way they did it, as it was built on reestablishing the
balance of power between the executive branch and Congress. For more
thoughts on the details, click here
.
Finally, last week another item I have been working on passed out of
the Homeland Security Committee in the House. It's another rifle shot,
and this case only saves $17 million, but a journey of a million miles
begins with those little first steps. Our bill would end a practice at
the Transportation Security Administration where employees are paid
higher wages for skills they don't use. It's a common sense idea that
is predicated on the simple notion of paying people for the work they
do instead of the work they could do. Click here
for more on this.
It will be a busy summer with the House tackling many more spending
bills and associated amendments over the next few months, and I'll keep
you posted as things develop. In the meantime, I wanted to share a few
comments on votes I took over the last few months and some other things
we've been working on in the Lowcountry. Additionally, this May marked
one year since we took office! I'm grateful for the opportunity to
represent the First District, and I'd encourage you to check out a
quick summary of our first twelve months by clicking here
. As always, if you have
any questions or thoughts, please take a moment and email me by

I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
Take good care,
Mark

Sanford Named "Taxpayer Hero"
On June 5th, Representative Sanford was named a "Taxpayer Hero" by
Citizens Against Government Waste, ranking him 12th in the House of
Representatives for 2013 with a score of 94%.
"I'm honored to receive this award from Citizens Against Government
Waste, a group that I have always felt has had the best interests of
taxpayers in mind," said Sanford. "I've long believed that standing up
for taxpayers means cutting spending, working to limit government,
minimizing waste, and reducing our national debt.
In this vein, I look
forward to continuing this work in Congress alongside groups like
CCAGW."
Citizens Against Government Waste's Taxpayer Hero award is given
annually to Members of Congress based on their voting record on tax,
spending, transparency, and accountability measures. For 2013, Citizens
Against Government Waste scored 80 votes in the House of
Representatives.

Recent Legislation and Votes
The USA Freedom Act
The USA Freedom Act, written by Representative Sensenbrenner, was a
comprehensive National Security Agency reform bill that Representative
Sanford co-sponsored. However, a few days before coming to the House
floor for a vote, the bill was drastically changed and watered down,
causing 78 out of 152 co-sponsors, including Representative Sanford, to
vote against it. Sanford shared the following thoughts on his vote:
"There was a lot of action on the House floor yesterday, and I wanted
to note one "first" on my end. Today was the first time since returning
to Congress I voted against a bill I co-sponsored - the USA Freedom
Act. In fact, so did 78 out of the 151 other co-sponsors, which is
something you don't see all that often. The problem here is that what
started as a strong bill with any number of good ideas for reforming
the National Security Agency was changed dramatically right before
voting, so that it looks almost nothing like the bill we co-sponsored.
There were three changes made behind the scenes to this bill before we
voted on it that I found especially concerning. One, language that
would have required the NSA to make specific requests for information
in the course of an investigation was removed. That continued the
troubling practice where the NSA could collect large amounts of data in
essence just to see what they could use. Two, it would maintain the
situation where telephone and technology companies would have to
provide large amounts of information without any specific target. This
means that in theory the NSA could ask for all the data coming from the
843 area code and it would be perfectly legal. Three, it extends the
part of the PATRIOT Act that authorizes this activity for two and a
half more years, when it had initially been scheduled to expire next
year.
On top of all of that, this weaker version came to the floor under a
closed rule, meaning no one could submit any amendments to change the
bill. For example, I introduced an NSA reform bill that would have
improved internal oversight at the agency, and was planning on
introducing that as an amendment. Under this closed rule, we weren't
even given an opportunity to have these amendments considered, much
less voted on. The original reforms in the USA Freedom Act would have
been meaningful improvements and protections for Americans' Fourth
Amendment rights, but instead we're left with a watered down substitute
that I do not think addresses the legitimate concerns I hear from
people in the District about government intrusion into their private
lives."
Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act
On May 6th, the House passed a bill dealing with how individuals can
recover art they believe was stolen from them. Representative Sanford
released the following statement regarding his vote against the bill,
and how he believed it would have expanded executive power:
"There was an interesting bill about stolen art on the House floor
Tuesday night that I voted against, but the story here isn't about
thieves or museums - it's about the power of the executive branch. HR
4292 would have made it easier for the President to block individuals
from attempting to recover stolen art, and as valuable as it is to view
art from different pieces of the world, the idea of private property
rights and ownership are even more fundamental to a market based
economy. The President's ability to do this was originally intended to
promote the free flow of art between countries and encourage other
countries to share their collections without fear that it wouldn't be
returned. So as I just suggested, there's certainly an interesting
conversation to be had here about property rights, but my overriding
problem with this bill is how it expanded executive prerogative to
limit the liberty of US citizens. It's a non-controversial bill that
passed 388-4, but I think the important point is that it takes a little
bit of power away from people and gives it to the government. Those
little steps toward or against private property rights or decisions
being made by the individual rather than government represent a larger
tide on where liberty stands - and that's why I ultimately chose to
oppose this bill."
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations for 2015
Around the end of April, Congress started the process of voting on
twelve spending bills for areas of government. Representative Sanford
released the following statement about his vote for the bill dealing
with military construction and veterans affairs, which lays out how the
Department of Veterans Affairs will spend money, in addition to how the
government will spend money on building and repairing military
infrastructure:
"Today, the House passed the first in a series of 12 spending bills
that are going to lay out how each part of government gets to spend
their money in the next year. This one looked at two major pieces of
government - military construction projects and veterans affairs. I'd
offer a few thoughts on that front.
First, while it's worthwhile to make sure our government can fulfill
the promises it makes to our service members and their families, I
think it's also important to note the steps it takes to protect
taxpayer dollars. The final price tag here ended up being not only
under the spending caps set by the Ryan-Murray budget deal, but $1.8
billion below 2014 levels.
Second, though it didn't pass, there was an amendment I wanted to share
a few more thoughts on, as it would have allowed the military to
construct new facilities for Guantanamo Bay prisoners inside the United
States. Whether we like it or not Guantanamo Bay has in many ways
become a proxy for where Americans stand on the issue of indefinite
detention and if that squares with our country's core value of liberty.
I voted yes on the amendment because continuing not to deal with this
issue is dealing with it in a way that is counter to our longstanding
value of freedom. Our tradition has been that, friend or foe,
individuals are held accountable for their actions and given a
judgment. It could be death, life, or even liberty, but indefinite
detention of prisoners at places like Guantanamo runs counter to the
values our Founding Fathers talked about and which have served our
country very well.
One final thought. When I was in Congress last time, these two areas of
government weren't combined into one bill. I've long been opposed to
mixing different areas of spending that aren't closely related in order
to make political decisions easier. Given that the issues facing
veterans today are often different than the military's infrastructure
needs, it seems to me that splitting these up again would help Congress
more carefully consider the ways government spends money."
The "Doc Fix"
On March 27th, the House used a controversial legislative maneuver to
pass a bill that likely wouldn't have passed if it was put up for a
regular vote. The bill dealt with how doctors who accept Medicare
patients receive payments for seeing those patients - which has long
been a flawed process. Every year since 2003, Congress has passed
temporary "patches" to this program, and this vote forced through this
year's patch. Representative Sanford shared the following thoughts
about the maneuver:
"If you were planning to get dinner with a friend and they told you to
pick the place, but after five seconds said, "Well you didn't answer so
we are going for pizza," it'd be kind of like what happened in Congress
this month. On the floor of the House, a bill was rushed through by
voice vote to temporarily "patch" the Sustainable Growth Rate formula.
In this case, passing the bill by voice vote means they put the bill up
for a vote very quickly, then immediately ruled it as passed without
Representatives having a chance to cast their votes - yet now the
legislation moves to the Senate."
The problem? The bill spends another $15 billion of taxpayers' money
today, and won't pay for that until 10 years from now. What if you were
putting together the family budget and said, "Let's go on vacation this
summer, but let's pay for it by not going on vacation ten years from
now." I don't know anyone that would think that's a smart budget
strategy, yet this legislation does just that by moving around spending
cuts in 2024 and 2025. As we've seen repeatedly in Washington, cuts
that far away are rarely realized.
The point here is way bigger than the bill in question or how it passed
- it's this new $15 billion that taxpayers are on the hook for. It's
the continued bias in favor of spending more money. This bill wouldn't
have passed if it were put up for a vote in the normal fashion, so in
this case Republican and Democratic leadership in the House found a way
to get around that. It speaks to the larger problem of fixing a system
where some will take near any step necessary to secure higher spending
without paying for it now."

DC June
17,
2014 Message
from
Mark
I
hope
the
start
of
your
summer
is
treating
you
well.
It&#8217;s
my
favorite
time
of
year,
and
as
we
both
know
this
stretch
at
its
start
is
particularly
beautiful
in
the
Lowcountry
given
its
good
breezes
and
it&#8217;s
not
yet
too
warm.
Makes
me
want
to
hurry
south
each
weekend,
but
in
the
meantime
I
just
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
share
some
interesting
things
that
have
been
happening
here
in
Congress.
The
most
recent
political
news
obviously
surrounds
Eric
Cantor&#8217;s
loss
in
Virginia.
It
was
significant
in
two
ways.
One,
it
is
a
reminder
that
for
all
our
feelings
of
frustration
at
times
on
the
difficulty
of
change,
here
was
a
guy
who
had
a
campaign
budget
of
only
$200,000
while
Cantor
raised
over
$5.5
million
in
this
election
cycle&#8230;and
lost.
It
says
each
of
us
has
more
voice
in
our
political
system
than
we
might
believe
&#8211;
accordingly,
it&#8217;s
vital
that
each
one
of
us
make
it
a
point
to
make
our
voice
heard.
From
a
political
perspective,
I
think
it
derails
the
prospect
of
immigration
reform
which
had
been
growing
steam
over
the
last
few
months.
The
other
big
political
news
has
been
continued
meltdown
in
Washington
in
the
way
that
the
federal
government
is
meant
to
serve
the
people.
I
hear
over
and
over
again
at
home
that
people
feel
like
the
President
has
become
imperial
in
his
attitude,
and
has
grown
to
little
regard
the
Constitutional
checks
and
balances
in
place
with
the
Congress
and
Judicial
branch.
It
increasingly
looks
like
there
will
be
a
consequence
to
this
in
November,
but
in
the
meantime
revelations
from
the
IRS
or
VA
serve
to
heighten
people&#8217;s
distrust
of
their
government.
I
came
here
to
impact
government&#8217;s
growth
and
spending,
and
on
many
subjects
I
pray
the
Irish
prayer
each
day
in
asking
God
to
give
me
the
wisdom
to
fight
the
things
I
can
change,
leave
alone
the
things
I
can&#8217;t
-
and
the
wisdom
to
know
the
difference.
In
this
vein
we
recognized
early
on
that
structural
change
could
come
to
the
NSA
through
a
series
of
rifle
shot
reforms
and
accordingly
I
originally
introduced
in
HR
3436
a
reform
that
would
give
independence
to
the
Inspector
General
at
the
National
Security
Agency.
I
am
pleased
to
say
it
was
included
in
the
Intelligence
Authorization
Act,
which
passed
the
House.
While
I
had
some
bigger
concerns
which
led
me
to
ultimately
oppose
the
final
bill,
and
I
think
there&#8217;s
still
further
to
go
on
reforming
the
NSA
(you
can
read
more
on
that
here ),
our
bill
and
its
adoption,
represents
a
win
for
liberty
and
better
oversight
at
the
NSA.
Important
to
Charleston
and
Harbor
deepening,
the
President
just
signed
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA),
which
funds
water
infrastructure
spending.
I
think
the
bill&#8217;s
approach
was
important
in
the
way
they
did
it,
as
it
was
built
on
reestablishing
the
balance
of
power
between
the
executive
branch
and
Congress.
For
more
thoughts

the
details,

Finally,
last
week
another
item
I
have
been
working
on
passed
out
of
the
Homeland
Security
Committee
in
the
House.
It&#8217;s
another
rifle
shot,
and
this
case
only
saves
$17
million,
but
a
journey
of
a
million
miles
begins
with
those
little
first
steps.
Our
bill
would
end
a
practice
at
the
Transportation
Security
Administration
where
employees
are
paid
higher
wages
for
skills
they
don&#8217;t
use.
It&#8217;s
a
common
sense
idea
that
is
predicated
on
the
simple
notion
of
paying
people
for
the
work
they
do
instead
of
the
work
they
could
do.
Click
here
for
more
on
this.
It
will
be
a
busy
summer
with
the
House
tackling
many
more
spending
bills
and
associated
amendments
over
the
next
few
months,
and
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
posted
as
things
develop.
In
the
meantime,
I
wanted
to
share
a
few
comments
on
votes
I
took
over
the
last
few
months
and
some
other
things
we&#8217;ve
been
working
on
in
the
Lowcountry.
Additionally,
this
May
marked
one
year
since
we
took
office!
I&#8217;m
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
represent
the
First
District,
and
I&#8217;d
encourage
you

-- Recent
Legislation
and
Votes
The
USA
Freedom
Act The
USA
Freedom
Act,
written
by
Representative
Sensenbrenner,
was
a
comprehensive
National
Security
Agency
reform
bill
that
Representative
Sanford
co-sponsored.
However,
a
few
days
before
coming
to
the
House
floor
for
a
vote,
the
bill
was
drastically
changed
and
watered
down,
causing
78
out
of
152
co-sponsors,
including
Representative
Sanford,
to
vote
against
it.
Sanford
shared
the
following
thoughts
on
his
vote:
&#8220;There
was
a
lot
of
action
on
the
House
floor
yesterday,
and
I
wanted
to
note
one
&#8220;first&#8221;
on
my
end.
Today
was
the
first
time
since
returning
to
Congress
I
voted
against
a
bill
I
co-sponsored
&#8211;
the
USA
Freedom
Act.
In
fact,
so
did
78
out
of
the
151
other
co-sponsors,
which
is
something
you
don&#8217;t
see
all
that
often.
The
problem
here
is
that
what
started
as
a
strong
bill
with
any
number
of
good
ideas
for
reforming
the
National
Security
Agency
was
changed
dramatically
right
before
voting,
so
that
it
looks
almost
nothing
like
the
bill
we
co-sponsored.
There
were
three
changes
made
behind
the
scenes
to
this
bill
before
we
voted
on
it
that
I
found
especially
concerning.
One,
language
that
would
have
required
the
NSA
to
make
specific
requests
for
information
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
was
removed.
That
continued
the
troubling
practice
where
the
NSA
could
collect
large
amounts
of
data
in
essence
just
to
see
what
they
could
use.
Two,
it
would
maintain
the
situation
where
telephone
and
technology
companies
would
have
to
provide
large
amounts
of
information
without
any
specific
target.
This
means
that
in
theory
the
NSA
could
ask
for
all
the
data
coming
from
the
843
area
code
and
it
would
be
perfectly
legal.
Three,
it
extends
the
part
of
the
PATRIOT
Act
that
authorizes
this
activity
for
two
and
a
half
more
years,
when
it
had
initially
been
scheduled
to
expire
next
year.
On
top
of
all
of
that,
this
weaker
version
came
to
the
floor
under
a
closed
rule,
meaning
no
one
could
submit
any
amendments
to
change
the
bill.
For
example,
I
introduced
an
NSA
reform
bill
that
would
have
improved
internal
oversight
at
the
agency,
and
was
planning
on
introducing
that
as
an
amendment.
Under
this
closed
rule,
we
weren&#8217;t
even
given
an
opportunity
to
have
these
amendments
considered,
much
less
voted
on.
The
original
reforms
in
the
USA
Freedom
Act
would
have
been
meaningful
improvements
and
protections
for
Americans&#8217;
Fourth
Amendment
rights,
but
instead
we&#8217;re
left
with
a
watered
down
substitute
that
I
do
not
think
addresses
the
legitimate
concerns
I
hear
from
people
in
the
District
about
government
intrusion
into
their
private
lives.&#8221;
Foreign
Cultural
Exchange
Jurisdictional
Immunity
Clarification
Act On
May
6th,
the
House
passed
a
bill
dealing
with
how
individuals
can
recover
art
they
believe
was
stolen
from
them.
Representative
Sanford
released
the
following
statement
regarding
his
vote
against
the
bill,
and
how
he
believed
it
would
have
expanded
executive
power:
&#8220;There
was
an
interesting
bill
about
stolen
art
on
the
House
floor
Tuesday
night
that
I
voted
against,
but
the
story
here
isn&#8217;t
about
thieves
or
museums
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
about
the
power
of
the
executive
branch.
HR
4292
would
have
made
it
easier
for
the
President
to
block
individuals
from
attempting
to
recover
stolen
art,
and
as
valuable
as
it
is
to
view
art
from
different
pieces
of
the
world,
the
idea
of
private
property
rights
and
ownership
are
even
more
fundamental
to
a
market
based
economy.
The
President&#8217;s
ability
to
do
this
was
originally
intended
to
promote
the
free
flow
of
art
between
countries
and
encourage
other
countries
to
share
their
collections
without
fear
that
it
wouldn&#8217;t
be
returned.
So
as
I
just
suggested,
there&#8217;s
certainly
an
interesting
conversation
to
be
had
here
about
property
rights,
but
my
overriding
problem
with
this
bill
is
how
it
expanded
executive
prerogative
to
limit
the
liberty
of
US
citizens.
It&#8217;s
a
non-controversial
bill
that
passed
388-4,
but
I
think
the
important
point
is
that
it
takes
a
little
bit
of
power
away
from
people
and
gives
it
to
the
government.
Those
little
steps
toward
or
against
private
property
rights
or
decisions
being
made
by
the
individual
rather
than
government
represent
a
larger
tide
on
where
liberty
stands
&#8211;
and
that&#8217;s
why
I
ultimately
chose
to
oppose
this
bill.&#8221;
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
for
2015 Around
the
end
of
April,
Congress
started
the
process
of
voting
on
twelve
spending
bills
for
areas
of
government.
Representative
Sanford
released
the
following
statement
about
his
vote
for
the
bill
dealing
with
military
construction
and
veterans
affairs,
which
lays
out
how
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
will
spend
money,
in
addition
to
how
the
government
will
spend
money
on
building
and
repairing
military
infrastructure: &#8220;Today,
the
House
passed
the
first
in
a
series
of
12
spending
bills
that
are
going
to
lay
out
how
each
part
of
government
gets
to
spend
their
money
in
the
next
year.
This
one
looked
at
two
major
pieces
of
government
&#8211;
military
construction
projects
and
veterans
affairs.
I&#8217;d
offer
a
few
thoughts
on
that
front.
First,
while
it&#8217;s
worthwhile
to
make
sure
our
government
can
fulfill
the
promises
it
makes
to
our
service
members
and
their
families,
I
think
it&#8217;s
also
important
to
note
the
steps
it
takes
to
protect
taxpayer
dollars.
The
final
price
tag
here
ended
up
being
not
only
under
the
spending
caps
set
by
the
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal,
but
$1.8
billion
below
2014
levels.
Second,
though
it
didn&#8217;t
pass,
there
was
an
amendment
I
wanted
to
share
a
few
more
thoughts
on,
as
it
would
have
allowed
the
military
to
construct
new
facilities
for
Guantanamo
Bay
prisoners
inside
the
United
States.
Whether
we
like
it
or
not
Guantanamo
Bay
has
in
many
ways
become
a
proxy
for
where
Americans
stand
on
the
issue
of
indefinite
detention
and
if
that
squares
with
our
country&#8217;s
core
value
of
liberty.
I
voted
yes
on
the
amendment
because
continuing
not
to
deal
with
this
issue
is
dealing
with
it
in
a
way
that
is
counter
to
our
longstanding
value
of
freedom.
Our
tradition
has
been
that,
friend
or
foe,
individuals
are
held
accountable
for
their
actions
and
given
a
judgment.
It
could
be
death,
life,
or
even
liberty,
but
indefinite
detention
of
prisoners
at
places
like
Guantanamo
runs
counter
to
the
values
our
Founding
Fathers
talked
about
and
which
have
served
our
country
very
well.
One
final
thought.
When
I
was
in
Congress
last
time,
these
two
areas
of
government
weren&#8217;t
combined
into
one
bill.
I&#8217;ve
long
been
opposed
to
mixing
different
areas
of
spending
that
aren&#8217;t
closely
related
in
order
to
make
political
decisions
easier.
Given
that
the
issues
facing
veterans
today
are
often
different
than
the
military&#8217;s
infrastructure
needs,
it
seems
to
me
that
splitting
these
up
again
would
help
Congress
more
carefully
consider
the
ways
government
spends
money.&#8221;
The
&#8220;Doc
Fix&#8221; On
March
27th,
the
House
used
a
controversial
legislative
maneuver
to
pass
a
bill
that
likely
wouldn&#8217;t
have
passed
if
it
was
put
up
for
a
regular
vote.
The
bill
dealt
with
how
doctors
who
accept
Medicare
patients
receive
payments
for
seeing
those
patients
&#8211;
which
has
long
been
a
flawed
process.
Every
year
since
2003,
Congress
has
passed
temporary
&#8220;patches&#8221;
to
this
program,
and
this
vote
forced
through
this
year&#8217;s
patch.
Representative
Sanford
shared
the
following
thoughts
about
the
maneuver:
&#8220;If
you
were
planning
to
get
dinner
with
a
friend
and
they
told
you
to
pick
the
place,
but
after
five
seconds
said,
&#8220;Well
you
didn&#8217;t
answer
so
we
are
going
for
pizza,&#8221;
it&#8217;d
be
kind
of
like
what
happened
in
Congress
this
month.
On
the
floor
of
the
House,
a
bill
was
rushed
through
by
voice
vote
to
temporarily
&#8220;patch&#8221;
the
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
formula.
In
this
case,
passing
the
bill
by
voice
vote
means
they
put
the
bill
up
for
a
vote
very
quickly,
then
immediately
ruled
it
as
passed
without
Representatives
having
a
chance
to
cast
their
votes
-
yet
now
the
legislation
moves
to
the
Senate."
The
problem?
The
bill
spends
another
$15
billion
of
taxpayers&#8217;
money
today,
and
won&#8217;t
pay
for
that
until
10
years
from
now.
What
if
you
were
putting
together
the
family
budget
and
said,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s
go
on
vacation
this
summer,
but
let&#8217;s
pay
for
it
by
not
going
on
vacation
ten
years
from
now.&#8221;
I
don&#8217;t
know
anyone
that
would
think
that&#8217;s
a
smart
budget
strategy,
yet
this
legislation
does
just
that
by
moving
around
spending
cuts
in
2024
and
2025.
As
we&#8217;ve
seen
repeatedly
in
Washington,
cuts
that
far
away
are
rarely
realized.
The
point
here
is
way
bigger
than
the
bill
in
question
or
how
it
passed
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
this
new
$15
billion
that
taxpayers
are
on
the
hook
for.
It&#8217;s
the
continued
bias
in
favor
of
spending
more
money.
This
bill
wouldn&#8217;t
have
passed
if
it
were
put
up
for
a
vote
in
the
normal
fashion,
so
in
this
case
Republican
and
Democratic
leadership
in
the
House
found
a
way
to
get
around
that.
It
speaks
to
the
larger
problem
of
fixing
a
system
where
some
will
take
near
any
step
necessary
to
secure
higher
spending
without
paying
for
it
now.&#8221;
