Dear Friend,
When the people in Ohios 16
th District learned nearly
two years ago that the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) targeted political groups for
extra scrutiny, they were outraged
and rightly so. There is no room for
political targeting in our democracy.
That is why I introduced the Prevent
Targeting at the IRS Act. This legislation
has 50 bipartisan cosponsors, and passed by
voice vote in both this and the previous
Congress.The overwhelming support for
this legislation shows that the vast
majority of Members of Congress, regardless
of their party affiliation, believe the IRS
should be above politics.
Congress has already acted to create a
list of fireable offenses at the IRS
.
In 1998, the IRS Restructuring and
Reform Act passed by a vote of 402 to
8.This legislation sought to bring
accountability to the IRS by allowing for
the immediate termination of IRS employees
who engage in the so-called 10
Deadly Sins against taxpayers. Many
of the Members in Congress today supported
those reforms back then. Unfortunately,
while that legislation covers many
offenses, it did not include political
targeting.I have no doubt this was a
simple oversight; this is not a partisan
issue.
If a federal employee engages in
political targeting, that employee should
be fired. Its that simple. My
legislation will make sure of it. It
specifically spells out that any IRS
employee, regardless
of political affiliation, who
targets a taxpayer for political purposes
will be immediately relieved of his or her
duties.
I am pleased that my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle came together this past
week to approve it. The Prevent Targeting
at the IRS Act provides the accountability
the American people expect and deserve, and
is a step in the right direction to
restoring a government that is of the
people, by the people, and for the
people.
The Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act was
one of a number of bills this House of
Representatives approved this past week to
rein in abuse, protect taxpayer rights, and
hold agency employees accountable. For
example, we passed the Taxpayer Bill of
Rights Act, a bill that makes a strong Bill
of Rights a core responsibility of the IRS
Commissioner, and ensures that all
employees provide taxpayers fundamental
rights and protections. We also passed a
bill that prohibits IRS employees from
using their personal email for official
business. Theyre simply
commonsense.
We in the House are committed to
bringing much-needed transparency and
accountability to an agency that sorely
lacks it, and it is my hope that the Senate
will act swiftly to send these crucial
reforms to the presidents desk.
