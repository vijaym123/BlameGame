Dear Friend,
Like all
Americans, I am outraged and saddened by the murder of two Americans by
the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) last month. After those
barbaric acts, I
called
for President Obama to come
to Congress, present a coherent plan to deal with ISIS, and
if he
believed military action was necessary
request authorization for
it.
The president failed on all counts. Instead, he has
simply asserted to the country that he already has power to commit the
U.S. military to a prolonged conflict without Congresss approval, while
requesting our permission to provide weapons and assistance to
moderate Syrian rebel groups whose primary interest is removing Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad.
I voted against the presidents
request this week because it did not represent a coherent strategy. As I
warned last year, regime change could lead to a worse outcome for
America. While Assad is a brutal dictator, I still believe backing rebels
allied with al-Qaeda and on the same side as ISIS in this civil war
likely would bring to power even worse elements in Syria.
We
have seen in the past few years how political turmoil provides cover
for radical groups and terrorism. In Libya, extremist groups are taking
over the country after President Obama led a similar regime change
mission there. The rebellion in Syria
which also received support from
this administration
led to the rise of ISIS and al-Qaeda in
Syria.
I would support a targeted operation to hunt down those
members of ISIS who killed the two U.S. journalists and bring justice for
the victims and their families. America has engaged in similar
missions to kill or capture terrorists, including Osama bin Laden. They have
succeeded because the aim was achievable and American forces knew
precisely what their goal was.
I do not believe that it is the
responsibility of the United States to resolve age-old religious
civil wars in the Middle East. But I do believe that our military exists
to protect our citizens and ensure our continued security. Even as we
pursue the murderers, we need to avoid becoming entangled in endless
sectarian conflicts and focus on bringing to justice those who took the
lives of our citizens.
The most important duty of the
United States government is to protect our nation. To that end, I will
continue to live up to my oath of office and stand for policies that
protect our security and our Constitution from threats, foreign and
domestic.
Thank you ,
