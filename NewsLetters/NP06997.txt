Dear Friends,
I hope you will join me
next Tuesday , on August 26th at 3:30 p.m. outside the San Mateo County History Museum for a United Call to Action to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Let&rsquo;s celebrate August 26th, Women&rsquo;s Equality Day, the date that commemorates the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting women the right to vote by demanding that women and men be equal under the eyes of the law.

It&rsquo;s unimaginable that in the 21st century women do not have the same equal protections under the Constitution that men do. The ERA was first introduced in Congress in 1923, and over 90 years later we are still fighting to get women into the Constitution.
Passing an ERA is still relevant. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia noted, &ldquo;certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Justice Scalia&rsquo;s words should haunt every woman in this country, as well as every man who believes his daughter, his mother, his sister, his grandmother or his aunt deserve equal treatment under the Constitution.
The ERA is vitally important because it would provide all women with real remedies for justice when they face sex discrimination in pay equity, pregnancy accommodations, and domestic violence. Most notably, women face a double burden when they are victimized. First, they must prove that there was a crime or a violation and then they must also prove that the intent was to discriminate based on sex. An ERA would banish this &ldquo;intent&rdquo; requirement forever, and would compel courts to examine discrimination with the strict scrutiny it deserves
In 1923, on the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, Alice Paul first announced a new constitutional amendment. This Equal Rights Amendment was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it passed in 1972. 35 states ratified the ERA before the deadline leaving it three states short of passage. That is why I have introduced legislation that advocates for the &ldquo;three-state&rdquo; approach &ndash; eliminating the deadline for passage and gaining the ratification of three more states to pass the ERA once and for all. The resolution, H.J. Res. 113, already has 143 cosponsors and that number will only continue to grow.
But this movement needs your help, too! Join us for the United Call to Action at 3:30 p.m., Tuesday, August 26th, at Courthouse Square outside the San Mateo County History Museum, 2200 Broadway in Redwood City.
