Rep. Cuellar Votes for "VA Access to Care" Bill as Texas Facilities Flagged for Further Review
Dear Friends,
Yesterday, I voted in favor of the Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014, a bill that gives veterans the options to seek care at non-VA facilities.
This vote comes as the Department of Veterans Affairs released results from an internal audit that flagged eight facilities in Texas and two in South Texas for further review.
I have been concerned for some time about the allegations surrounding care at the VA and this report makes it even more apparent that reforms at the Department are necessary. That is why I previously supported a bill make it easier for the VA to hold the appropriate employees responsible for delays in treatment affecting veterans.
Todays legislation will allow veterans living more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility to seek care at a non-VA facility.
It will also give local providers three options for reimbursement from the VA:
1) the rate of reimbursement under VA,
2)the rate of reimbursement under Medicare, or
3) the rate of reimbursement under TRICARE.
Veterans deserve a healthcare system they can trust
not a bureaucracy that prevents them from getting the care they need.
I spoke on the Floor of the House of Representatives today in support of this bill.
