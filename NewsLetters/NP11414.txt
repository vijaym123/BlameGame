Issues
Dear
Friend:
Thank you for taking the time to read my
e-newsletter.
STOPPING THE ABUSE OF EXECUTIVE
POWER
With my strong support, the House has passed legislation to
confront executive overreach that has been pronounced under President
Obama.
The ENFORCE the Law Act would give Congress
the clear ability to challenge unilateral presidential actions in
court.
When a President decides to pick and choose what laws to
enforce or not to enforce, it strikes at the separation of powers that
is at the heart of our Constitutional
system.
REGULATORY REFORM GAINS STEAM
For more than a
year, I have been working on reining in out-of-control federal agencies
that are issuing a staggering number of new rules. Federal regulations
now consume 14% of our economy, absorbing money that businesses could
otherwise use to grow and expand.
The House
has approved a major set of regulatory reforms that originated in my
subcommittee
and I'm convinced they would result in the
creation of many new jobs if enacted.

PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
The data security
breaches at Target and other companies have put a greater scrutiny on
identity theft and information privacy.
As author of the
law that entitles you to a free credit report so you can monitor
financial accounts for suspicious activity,
I believe
it's time for new protections.
In addition, there must be
continued support for the work that the National Computer Forensics
Institute (NCFI) in Hoover is doing to fight cybercrime.

of NCFI in fighting financial fraud with William Noonan of the U.S.
Secret Service,

REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
President Obama's
proposed $3.9 trillion budget continues the failed "tax and spend"
approach to prosperity.
It retreats from even modest entitlement
reforms despite repeated testimony from the Federal Reserve that the
rate of spending on these programs is unsustainable.
This is all
the more reason why we should adopt the Balanced Budget Amendment to the
Constitution which I have cosponsored and which was introduced by my
Alabama colleague Congressman Mo Brooks.
THE
SITUATION IN UKRAINE, ENERGY SECURITY, AND WHY THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS
NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER
As I write, the situation in
the Ukraine remains tense.
One point of influence the U.S. has
is the increase in our own energy production, which puts us in a
position to export energy to countries heavily dependent on supplies from
countries like Russia.
The need for energy security also brings
us back to the importance of building the Keystone Pipeline with our
neighbor Canada.
When you consider the many advantages that come
from our relatively newfound ability to meet more of our energy needs
without relying on hostile regimes, why would we not build on this
strength?
Why is the Obama Administration continuing to allow this
critical project to languish?
HONORING OUR MILITARY
VETERANS
An Air Force policy that has reduced the
level of honor guard personnel at the funerals of military retirees is
causing concern and disappointment.
For many families, the
presence of a full honor guard is comforting and a demonstration of our
nation's appreciation.
There certainly must be ways to address the
concerns raised by the new policy, as I said in a letter to Secretary
of the Air Force that you can
view
here.
We must always be sure that our veterans know they have our
most heartfelt gratitude.

Shrine and Register of Honor at the American Village in

CONCUSSIONS AND SPORTS SAFETY
Dr. James
Johnston of the Neurosurgery Department at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham testified at a House hearing on sports-related concussion
injuries.
Concussion trauma, especially as it affects young people,
is finally receiving the serious attention it deserves.
Dr.
Johnston offered thoughtful recommendations on prevention research and the
development of improved helmet performance standards in testimony you
can
read here.

James Johnston talked with Congressman Bachus about his testimony on

RAILROAD
TIES
Some people dream of christening a ship, but I'll happily take the
train instead!
It was a thrill for me to christen a new Norfolk
Southern locomotive during a ceremony at historic Union Station in
Washington.
Freight rail transportation is important to our economy
and, with a grandfather who was a train engineer and a son who is now
a conductor, you could say that my family has many "railroad
ties."
