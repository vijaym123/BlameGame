A Christmas Message
Dear Friends,
Christmas is a special time of year in New Hampshire.
There's nothing like snow on the ground and a chill in the air to get you in the holiday spirit.
With two young kids at home, I can't wait for Christmas morning - I know that it will be an exciting time at our house.
But Christmas is about so much more than presents under the tree.
It's a season of giving and goodwill. And it's a time to gather with family and friends to give thanks for our many blessings.
As Americans, we're blessed to live in the greatest nation on Earth.
As we look to the promise of a New Year, may we join together and commit ourselves to building an even stronger and more prosperous county.
From my home to yours, I wish you and yours a Merry Christmas -- warmed by family, friends, and faith.
And I send my best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year.
I look forward to seeing you in 2014!
Warm Regards,
Kelly Ayotte
United States Senator
