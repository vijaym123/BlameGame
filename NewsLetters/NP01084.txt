Kansas Common Sense
May 4, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. It was a productive week on Capitol
Hill. Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
A Tradition of Listening to Kansans
Far too often, elected officials do too much talking and not enough
listening. As your U.S. Senator, I have the privilege of taking my
marching orders directly from Kansans. When it comes to making certain
your voice is heard on Capitol Hill, I believe I can best serve my
constituents if Ive personally listened to your questions and
concerns. Since being elected to Congress, it has been a top priority
to return home each weekend to visit with the folks who sent me to
Washington.
On Monday, I kicked off another round of my Kansas Listening Tour
stops in Leavenworth for the first visit to each of our states 105
counties to hear directly from Kansans. There were more than 100 folks
in attendance at the Riverfront Community Center, and we discussed a
number of issues of importance to Kansas and the nation including
veterans' affairs, Iran and the Farm Bill.
Personally visiting with Kansans like those who came out in Leavenworth
reinforces my long-held belief in the strength and spirit of our
communities and the values that make Kansas a great place to live, work
and raise a family. I truly believe our state will continue to thrive
thanks to the work ethic, concern and kindness of its people
but its
vital that Congress to be an ally of the people, not an adversary.
Thanks again to Leavenworth/Lansing Chamber of Commerce President
Jennifer Daly for hosting the event.
Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Rice County
I continued my listening tour with a stop in Rice County this
afternoon. Thanks to the more than 50 Rice County residents and
Sterling College students who came to visit with me in Sterling. The
conversations ranged from veterans issues and trade to the national
debt. Special thanks to Caitie Stineman for arranging the town hall, as
well as Sterling College President Scott Rich for hosting the meeting
in historic Cooper Hall.
Senate Continues Debate of Nuclear Deal Review Legislation
This week the Senate continued to debate the Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act, legislation that would require the president to submit to
Congress the details of any deal his administration strikes with Iran
while also providing Congress an opportunity to disapprove of a bad
deal.
Over the weekend, I spoke about this legislation on the Sunday Morning
Futures program on Fox News and reaffirmed the need for Congressional
oversight over whatever comes of the Obama Administration's
negotiations with Iran. President Obama's efforts to ignore the
concerns of Congress amid increasingly troubling reports emerging from
the diplomatic talks underscore the need for Congressional review of
any deal.
If or when Congress does evaluate any potential nuclear deal, we must
prioritize American national security above partisan politics. The
health of our democracy depends on the Congress asserting its
constitutional checks on presidential powers, regardless of which party
happens to occupy the White House. I encourage you to watch a clip of
the discussion by clicking below.
Hearing on the National Guard and Reserve Components
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I
questioned National Guard Bureau (NGB) Chief General Frank Grass and
Air National Guard (ANG) Director Lieutenant General Stanley Clarke
during a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing with the
Reserve Components on Wednesday. I raised several defense and national
security issues that are crucial to Kansas such as cyber defense
capabilities in the Kansas National Guard, the impressive Kansas
Intelligence Fusion Center, and the importance of transitioning the
931st Refueling Group out of McConnell Air Force Base to the status of
a Wing.
A few weeks ago I visited the Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center in
Topeka and wanted to hear Gen. Grass perspective given his support for
their incredible operation. I was pleased to hear Gen. Grass recognize
the real value of the Kansas fusion center as a model for the future
across the nation because of the partnerships and information sharing
abilities with federal, state, and public and private entities.
I reminded Lt. Gen. Jackson about a letter I wrote to the Air Force
Chief of Staff General Welsh in August 2013 regarding the potential for
the 931st Air Refueling Group at McConnell Air Force Base to be
designated as a wing, particularly given the arrival of the KC-46A
tankers and increase in personnel. The Air Force Reserve continues to
consider this transition for the 931st a top priority, and I will
continue to work with Lt. Gen. Jackson on the current plan for wing
structure by FY17 or FY18, if not sooner.
For more than two years, I have been working with the Department of
Defense (DoD) and NGB to make certain the cyber personnel and
capabilities in the Kansas National Guard are not reduced or diminished
and weve had success in halting these potential reductions through
mandates in the FY14 and FY15 National Defense Authorization Acts, as
well as in the FY15 Defense Appropriations. Secretary of Defense Ash
Carter has made it abundantly clear that DoD is recruiting cyber talent
and going to great lengths to retain the cyber capabilities the
Department currently possesses. My questions to Gen. Grass and Lt. Gen.
Clarke were to make certain the Air National Guard formalizes their
plan to not only abandon efforts to reduce the cyber capacity in the
Kansas National Guard, but also to grow cyber defense units in Kansas.
Im pleased that Gen. Grass and Lt. Gen. Clarke took immediate action
and signed a memorandum that codifies the cyber defense plan and future
of cyber capabilities in the Kansas National Guard.
SHARP Academy
Before I flew back to Washington last Monday, I met with Sexual
Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) Academy Director
Colonel Geoff Catlett in Leavenworth. The United States Army Combined
Arms Center was selected to command the SHARP Academy, a natural fit
with Fort Leavenworth as the Intellectual Center of the Army. SHARP
exists to provide world-class instruction and foster a climate that not
only prevents assaults, but also instills response principles as
habitual and inherent characteristics across the force. This is
accomplished by training personnel to serve as sexual assault response
coordinators and victim advocates. The programs mission is an
important one
to eliminate sexual harassment and sexual assault in
the military.
Visiting Rush County Memorial Hospital
On Friday, I traveled to La Crosse to visit with medical staff at Rush
County Memorial Hospital (RCMH). RCMH is a 16-bed Critical Access
Hospital (CAH) that provides a wide range of services. A few years ago,
RCMH underwent a significant renovation to improve and modernize
patient care delivery.
During my tour, we visited about concerns regarding Obama
Administration proposals that would cut reimbursements to CAHs and
eliminate hospitals from the CAH program. These proposals would come at
a huge cost to rural patients and their communities. They would
eliminate CAH designation for hospitals based entirely on a strict
mileage requirement, rather than an evaluation of their ability to
deliver vital services within their community and their communitys
need for such services. Not only do CAHs maintain access to care in
rural areas, they are often one of the largest employers in their
communities. CAHs and other rural health care facilities comprise a
significant component of rural Americas health care safety net, and
they are essential to the survival and success of many rural
communities. I will continue to oppose this fundamentally flawed and
short-sighted proposal that disproportionately impacts access to
essential health care services in our state. Thanks to RCHM CEO Brenda
Legleiter for hosting my visit.
Letter Carriers State Convention
On Saturday, I attended and spoke at the Kansas State Association of
Letter Carriers Annual Convention. It was a great opportunity to speak
at the convention once again. When I travel across Kansas, one of the
most common questions I hear from rural constituents is, What can I do
to save my Post Office? The Post Office is often as much a staple of a
community as a school or a grocery store. The USPS is under financial
pressure due to mandated prefunding payments into the USPS employee
retirement system. As a result, USPS is seeking ways to cut costs that
could lead to Post Office closures, slowing the timeliness of delivery,
or decreasing frequency of delivery. I will continue to work in
Congress to push for commonsense improvements to the USPS that enable
it to maintain healthy finances while providing high quality service to
people across our state and country. It was an honor to have the
National Association of Letter Carriers Executive Vice President Tim
OMalley in attendance as well. Thank you to President-Emeritus Rod
Holub for inviting me to participate and for his years of service to
the Kansas State Association of Letter Carriers.
Stewardship of NIH Research Resources
On Thursday, I participated in a Senate Appropriations Health
Subcommittee hearing on the Administrations Fiscal Year 2016 budget
request for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This Subcommittee
has jurisdiction over funding for NIH, the focal point of our nations
health research infrastructure. I asked NIH Director Francis Collins to
discuss how NIH stewards the resources it has been given by the
American public to advance the medical research to save and improve
lives, reduce health care costs, spur innovation, and strengthen our
countrys global leadership in biomedical research. Dr. Collins
explained that this research prioritization includes advanced methods
of portfolio analysis to identify the most compelling scientific
opportunities within each Institute and Center. Additionally, NIH
fosters collaborations among its Centers and is partnering with other
agencies and drug-makers to develop the next generation of drug targets
for Alzheimers disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cancers,
lupus, and other conditions. Dr. Collins also discussed how NIH is
developing an overarching strategic plan to support this focus on
priority setting. Click here
to see video of my discussion with Dr. Collins.
Visiting Legg Company in Halstead
On Friday afternoon I toured LEGG Company in Halstead. With a legacy
that dates back to 1939, LEGG specializes in manufacturing industrial,
agricultural and specialty conveyor belts. LEGG Vice President Steve
Chartier discussed the advantage of headquartering a company in
Halstead
a strong workforce with a good work ethic, as well as a
central location for shipping. Special thanks to Mayor William Ewert
and City Administrator JR Hatfield for joining me on the tour.
Iola Kiwanis Club
This week I had the opportunity to meet with the Iola Kiwanis Club. I
learned of the Clubs partnership with Mommies of Miracles (MOM) to
build an inclusive playground in Iola. This playground will serve
children of all needs in Iola for many years to come. The Iola Kiwanis
Club is part of Kiwanis International, which supports local communities
through a variety of service projects. Thanks to Mike and Nancy Ford
for your efforts on this project!
Honored to Serve You
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Common
Sense
May

2015
Hello,
Welcome
to
&#147;Kansas
Common
Sense.&#148;
It
was
a
productive
week
on
Capitol
Hill.
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
A
Tradition
of
Listening
to
Kansans
Far
too
often,
elected
officials
do
too
much
talking
and
not
enough
listening.
As
your
U.S.
Senator,
I
have
the
privilege
of
taking
my
marching
orders
directly
from
Kansans.
When
it
comes
to
making
certain
your
voice
is
heard
on
Capitol
Hill,
I
believe
I
can
best
serve
my
constituents
if
I&#146;ve
personally
listened
to
your
questions
and
concerns.
Since
being
elected
to
Congress,
it
has
been
a
top
priority
to
return
home
each
weekend
to
visit
with
the
folks
who
sent
me
to
Washington.
On
Monday,
I
kicked
off
another
round
of
my
&#147;Kansas
Listening
Tour&#148;
stops
in
Leavenworth
for
the
first
visit
to
each
of
our
state&#146;s
105
counties
to
hear
directly
from
Kansans.
There
were
more
than
100
folks
in
attendance
at
the
Riverfront
Community
Center,
and
we
discussed
a
number
of
issues
of
importance
to
Kansas
and
the
nation
including
veterans'
affairs,
Iran
and
the
Farm
Bill.
Personally
visiting
with
Kansans
like
those
who
came
out
in
Leavenworth
reinforces
my
long-held
belief
in
the
strength
and
spirit
of
our
communities
and
the
values
that
make
Kansas
a great
place
to
live,
work
and
raise
a
family.
I
truly
believe
our
state
will
continue
to
thrive
thanks
to
the
work
ethic,
concern
and
kindness
of
its
people
&#150;
but
it&#146;s
vital
that
Congress
to
be
an
ally
of
the
people,
not
an
adversary.
Thanks
again
to
Leavenworth/Lansing
Chamber
of
Commerce
President
Jennifer
Daly
for
hosting
the

I
continued
my

with
a

this
afternoon.
Thanks
to
the
more
than
50
Rice

and
Sterling
College
students
who
came
to
visit
with
me
in
Sterling.
The
conversations
ranged
from
veterans&#146;
issues
and

to
the
national

Special
thanks
to

Senate
Continues
Debate
of
Nuclear
Deal
Review
Legislation
This
week
the
Senate
continued
to
debate
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act,
legislation
that
would
require
the
president
to
submit
to
Congress
the
details
of
any
deal
his
administration
strikes
with
Iran
while also
providing
Congress
an
opportunity
to
disapprove
of
a
bad deal.
Over
the
weekend, I spoke
about
this
legislation
on the
Sunday
Morning
Futures
program
on
Fox
News and reaffirmed
the
need
for
Congressional
oversight
over
whatever
comes
of the
Obama
Administration's
negotiations
with
Iran.
President
Obama's
efforts
to
ignore
the
concerns
of Congress
amid
increasingly troubling
reports emerging
from
the
diplomatic
talks
underscore
the
need
for
Congressional
review
of
any
deal.
If
or when Congress does
evaluate
any
potential nuclear
deal,
we must prioritize American national
security
above
partisan
politics. The
health
of
our democracy depends
on the
Congress
asserting
its
constitutional checks
on
presidential
powers,
regardless
of
which
party
happens
to
occupy
the
White
House.

Hearing
on
the
National
Guard
and
Reserve
Components
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee,
I
questioned
National
Guard
Bureau
(NGB)
Chief
General
Frank
Grass
and
Air
National
Guard
(ANG)
Director
Lieutenant
General
Stanley
Clarke during
a
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee
hearing
with
the
Reserve
Components
on
Wednesday.
I
raised
several
defense
and
national
security
issues
that
are
crucial
to
Kansas
such
as
cyber
defense
capabilities
in
the
Kansas
National
Guard,
the
impressive
Kansas
Intelligence
Fusion
Center,
and
the
importance
of
transitioning
the
931st
Refueling
Group
out
of
McConnell
Air
Force
Base
to
the
status
of
a
Wing.
A
few
weeks
ago
I
visited
the
Kansas
Intelligence
Fusion
Center
in
Topeka
and
wanted
to
hear
Gen.
Grass&#146;
perspective
given
his
support
for
their
incredible
operation.
I
was
pleased
to
hear
Gen.
Grass
recognize
the
real
value
of
the
Kansas
fusion
center
as
a
model
for
the
future
across
the
nation
because
of
the
partnerships
and
information
sharing
abilities
with
federal,
state,
and
public
and
private
entities.
I
reminded
Lt.
Gen.
Jackson
about
a
letter
I
wrote
to
the
Air
Force
Chief
of
Staff
General
Welsh
in
August
2013
regarding
the
potential
for
the
931st
Air
Refueling
Group
at
McConnell
Air
Force
Base
to
be
designated
as
a
wing,
particularly
given
the
arrival
of
the
KC-46A
tankers
and
increase
in
personnel.
The
Air
Force
Reserve
continues
to
consider
this
transition
for
the
931st
a
top
priority,
and
I
will
continue
to
work
with
Lt.
Gen.
Jackson
on
the
current
plan
for
wing
structure
by
FY17
or
FY18,
if
not
sooner.
For
more
than
two
years,
I
have
been
working
with
the
Department
of
Defense
(DoD)
and
NGB
to
make
certain
the
cyber
personnel
and
capabilities
in
the
Kansas
National
Guard
are
not
reduced
or
diminished
&#150;
and
we&#146;ve
had
success
in
halting
these
potential
reductions
through
mandates
in
the
FY14
and
FY15
National
Defense
Authorization
Acts,
as
well
as
in
the
FY15
Defense
Appropriations.
Secretary
of
Defense
Ash
Carter
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
DoD
is
recruiting
cyber
talent
and
going
to
great
lengths
to
retain
the
cyber
capabilities
the
Department
currently
possesses.
My
questions
to
Gen.
Grass
and
Lt.
Gen.
Clarke
were
to
make
certain
the
Air
National
Guard
formalizes
their
plan
to
not
only
abandon
efforts
to
reduce
the
cyber
capacity
in
the
Kansas
National
Guard,
but
also
to
grow
cyber
defense
units
in
Kansas.
I&#146;m
pleased
that
Gen.
Grass
and
Lt.
Gen.
Clarke
took
immediate
action
and
signed
a
memorandum
that
codifies
the
cyber
defense
plan
and
future
of
cyber
capabilities
in
the
Kansas
National
Guard.
SHARP
Academy
Before
I
flew
back
to
Washington
last
Monday,
I
met
with
Sexual
Harassment/Assault
Response
and
Prevention
(SHARP)
Academy
Director
Colonel
Geoff
Catlett
in
Leavenworth.
The
United
States
Army
Combined
Arms
Center
was
selected
to
command
the
SHARP
Academy,
a
natural
fit
with
Fort
Leavenworth
as
the
Intellectual
Center
of
the
Army.
SHARP
exists
to
provide
world-class
instruction
and
foster
a
climate
that
not
only
prevents
assaults,
but
also
instills
response
principles
as
habitual
and
inherent
characteristics
across
the
force.
This
is
accomplished
by
training
personnel
to
serve
as
sexual
assault
response
coordinators
and
victim
advocates.
The
program&#146;s
mission
is
an
important
one
&#150;
to
eliminate
sexual
harassment
and
sexual
assault
in
the
military.
Visiting
Rush
County
Memorial
Hospital
On
Friday,
I
traveled
to
La
Crosse
to
visit
with
medical
staff
at
Rush
County
Memorial
Hospital
(RCMH).
RCMH
is
a
16-bed
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH)
that
provides
a
wide
range
of
services.
A
few
years
ago,
RCMH
underwent
a
significant
renovation
to
improve
and
modernize
patient
care
delivery.
During
my
tour,
we
visited
about
concerns
regarding
Obama
Administration
proposals
that
would
cut
reimbursements
to
CAHs
and
eliminate
hospitals
from
the
CAH
program.
These
proposals
would
come
at
a
huge
cost
to
rural
patients
and
their
communities.
They
would
eliminate
CAH
designation
for
hospitals
based
entirely
on
a
strict
mileage
requirement,
rather
than
an
evaluation
of
their
ability
to
deliver
vital
services
within
their
community
and
their
community&#146;s
need
for
such
services.
Not
only
do
CAHs
maintain
access
to
care
in
rural
areas,
they
are
often
one
of
the
largest
employers
in
their
communities.
CAHs
and
other
rural
health
care
facilities
comprise
a
significant
component
of
rural
America&#146;s
health
care
safety
net,
and
they
are
essential
to
the
survival
and
success
of
many
rural
communities.
I
will
continue
to
oppose
this
fundamentally
flawed
and
short-sighted
proposal
that
disproportionately
impacts
access
to
essential
health
care
services
in
our
state.
Thanks
to
RCHM
CEO
Brenda
Legleiter
for
hosting
my
visit.
Letter
Carriers
State
Convention
On
Saturday,
I
attended
and
spoke
at
the
Kansas
State
Association
of
Letter
Carriers
Annual
Convention.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
speak
at
the
convention
once
again.
When
I
travel
across
Kansas,
one
of
the
most
common
questions
I
hear
from
rural
constituents
is,
&#147;What
can
I
do
to
save
my
Post
Office?&#148;
The
Post
Office
is
often
as
much
a
staple
of
a
community
as
a
school
or
a
grocery
store.
The
USPS
is
under
financial
pressure
due
to
mandated
prefunding
payments
into
the
USPS
employee
retirement
system.
As
a
result,
USPS
is
seeking
ways
to
cut
costs
that
could
lead
to
Post
Office
closures,
slowing
the
timeliness
of
delivery,
or
decreasing
frequency
of
delivery.
I
will
continue
to
work
in
Congress
to
push
for
commonsense
improvements
to
the
USPS
that
enable
it
to
maintain
healthy
finances
while
providing
high
quality
service
to
people
across
our
state
and
country.
It
was
an
honor
to
have
the
National
Association
of
Letter
Carriers
Executive
Vice
President
Tim
O&#146;Malley
in
attendance
as
well.
Thank
you
to
President-Emeritus
Rod
Holub
for
inviting
me
to
participate
and
for
his
years
of
service
to
the
Kansas
State
Association
of
Letter
Carriers.
Stewardship
of
NIH
Research
Resources
On
Thursday,
I
participated
in
a
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee
hearing
on
the
Administration&#146;s
Fiscal
Year
2016
budget
request
for
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH).
This
Subcommittee
has
jurisdiction
over
funding
for
NIH,
the
focal
point
of
our
nation&#146;s
health
research
infrastructure.
I
asked
NIH
Director
Francis
Collins
to
discuss
how
NIH
stewards
the
resources
it
has
been
given
by
the
American
public
to
advance
the
medical
research
to
save
and
improve
lives,
reduce
health
care
costs,
spur
innovation,
and
strengthen
our
country&#146;s
global
leadership
in
biomedical
research.
Dr.
Collins
explained
that
this
research
prioritization
includes
advanced
methods
of
portfolio
analysis
to
identify
the
most
compelling
scientific
opportunities
within
each
Institute
and
Center.
Additionally,
NIH
fosters
collaborations
among
its
Centers
and
is
partnering
with
other
agencies
and
drug-makers
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
drug
targets
for
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease,
diabetes,
rheumatoid
arthritis,
cancers,
lupus,
and
other
conditions.
Dr.
Collins
also
discussed
how
NIH
is
developing
an
overarching
strategic
plan
to
support
this
focus
on
priority
setting.

Dr.
Collins.
Visiting
Legg
Company
in
Halstead
On
Friday
afternoon
I
toured
LEGG
Company
in
Halstead.
With
a
legacy
that
dates
back
to
1939,
LEGG
specializes
in
manufacturing
industrial,
agricultural
and
specialty
conveyor
belts.
LEGG
Vice
President
Steve
Chartier
discussed
the
advantage
of
headquartering
a
company
in
Halstead
&#150;
a
strong
workforce
with
a
good
work
ethic,
as
well
as
a
central
location
for
shipping.
Special
thanks
to
Mayor
William
Ewert
and
City
Administrator
JR
Hatfield
for
joining
me
on
the
tour.
Iola
Kiwanis
Club
This
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
the
Iola
Kiwanis
Club.
I
learned
of
the
Club&#146;s
partnership
with
Mommies
of
Miracles
(MOM)
to
build
an
inclusive
playground
in
Iola.
This
playground
will
serve
children
of
all
needs
in
Iola
for
many
years
to
come.
The
Iola
Kiwanis
Club
is
part
of
Kiwanis
International,
which
supports
local
communities
through
a
variety
of
service
projects.
Thanks
to
Mike
and
Nancy
Ford
for
your
efforts
on
this
project!
