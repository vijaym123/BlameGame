Friend -
Commuters in the Fourth District sit in traffic every day wondering and waiting for the new road or bridge to open up that will help ease daily congestion.
I introduced the 414 Plan to cut red tape and costly regulations, and instead accelerate construction and repair of our roads and bridges.
We have a choice: red tape and bureaucracy, or roads and bridges.
The 414 Plan is common sense
lets put Americans back to work and make repairing our aging infrastructure a priority.
Yours in service,
Randy
