Is Your Identity Safe with Obamacare Navigators?
Today I joined a House Oversight Committee field hearing
in Dallas on the Obamacare Navigator program.
Navigators are hired to
explain Obamacare and help people sign up for coverage.
However, there
are a number of concerns with the program.
The most troubling issue is
that Navigators aren't required to undergo criminal background checks,
despite the fact that they can access your social security number,
address, birthdate, and salary-in short, everything needed to steal
your identity.
What it boils down to is this: someone who has been
tried and convicted of identity theft or fraud could become a Navigator
under the current law.
I'm proud that the state of Texas is taking steps to protect our
citizens with more stringent requirements.
A rule proposed by the
Texas Department of Insurance would require background checks, privacy
training, and proof of identity and citizenship for Navigators.
These
basic safeguards will help protect Texans from the dangers of identity
theft.
West Texans have had enough of Obamacare's broken promises.
They were
told if they liked their plans, they could keep them.
They were told
if they liked their doctors, they could keep them.
One of my
constituents wrote me and asked if the next pledge from the
Administration would be, "If you like your identity, you can keep it."
Let's make sure we don't have to add that to the list of broken
promises.
My Budget Vote
I've been keeping you updated on the Budget Conference Committee's
progress over the last few weeks, and I told you I was hopeful they
could come to an agreement to fund our government and reduce our
deficit.
They did reach an agreement last week, but after careful
consideration, I decided I could not vote for it.
House Budget
Committee Chairman Paul Ryan worked hard on this deal, and I know that
he shares my commitment to reducing our government's debt.
But the
compromise that was reached allows for more federal spending now in
exchange for promised savings ten years down the road.
I'm just not
confident that we'll ever see those savings.
The budget agreement sets overall discretionary spending for FY 2014 at
$1.012 trillion and raises the sequester spending limits by $63 billion
for the next two years.
That spending is primarily offset by extending
the sequester of mandatory spending through 2023. More than 60% of the
savings from this proposal come after 2020.
Washington needs to quit our habit of spending money now and promising
to save later.
That's how we ended up $17 trillion in debt.
It's time
to make the difficult decisions necessary to get our country back on
track.
One Month Farm Bill Extension
The Farm Bill Conference Committee is still working hard on finalizing
a five-year Farm Bill, and negotiations are going to continue while
Members are back home working in our Districts.
But we need a bit more
time to finalize a long-term deal.
Knowing that was the case, last
week, the House passed a temporary extension
by voice vote.
The extension is meant to
ensure that consumers aren't affected by the higher prices that could
take effect if the Farm Bill expires.
The Senate has made it clear
that they don't intend to vote on this extension, but I don't think
that's a problem.
Why not? Because I'm optimistic that we'll reach an
agreement very soon.
I'm looking forward to the next official
Conference Committee meeting-likely in the first week of January.
My
priority remains a five-year Farm Bill.
Farmers need long-term policy
so they can make decisions on plantingand investing in new equipment.
I spoke with Josh Koch at Ag Day Lubbock recently about the progress
being made on the Farm Bill.

Is
Your
Identity
Safe
with
Obamacare
Navigators?
Today
I
joined
a
House
Oversight
Committee
field
hearing
in
Dallas
on
the
Obamacare
Navigator
program.
Navigators
are
hired
to
explain
Obamacare
and
help
people
sign
up
for
coverage.
However,
there
are
a
number
of
concerns
with
the
program.
The
most
troubling
issue
is
that
Navigators
aren&#8217;t
required
to
undergo
criminal
background
checks,
despite
the
fact
that
they
can
access
your
social
security
number,
address,
birthdate,
and
salary&#8212;in
short,
everything
needed
to
steal
your
identity.
What
it
boils
down
to
is
this:
someone
who
has
been
tried
and
convicted
of
identity
theft
or
fraud
could
become
a
Navigator
under
the
current
law.
I&#8217;m
proud
that
the
state
of
Texas
is
taking
steps
to
protect
our
citizens
with
more
stringent
requirements.
A
rule
proposed
by
the
Texas
Department
of
Insurance
would
require
background
checks,
privacy
training,
and
proof
of
identity
and
citizenship
for
Navigators.
These
basic
safeguards
will
help
protect
Texans
from
the
dangers
of
identity
theft.
West
Texans
have
had
enough
of
Obamacare&#8217;s
broken
promises.
They
were

they

One

asked
if
the
next
pledge
from
the
Administration
would
be,
&#8220;If
you

your
identity,
you
can
keep
it.&#8221;
Let&#8217;s
make
sure
we
don&#8217;t
have
to
add
that
to
the
list
of
broken
promises.
My
Budget
Vote
I&#8216;ve
been
keeping
you
updated
on
the
Budget
Conference
Committee&#8217;s
progress
over
the
last
few
weeks,
and
I
told
you
I
was
hopeful
they
could
come
to
an
agreement
to
fund
our
government
and
reduce
our
deficit.
They
did
reach
an
agreement
last
week,
but
after
careful
consideration,
I
decided
I
could
not
vote
for
it.
House
Budget

Chairman
Paul
Ryan
worked
hard

this

and
I
know
that

my

But
the
compromise
that
was
reached
allows
for

ten
years
down
the

I&#8217;m
just
not

that
we&#8217;ll
ever
see
those
savings.
The
budget
agreement
sets
overall
discretionary

for
FY
2014
at
$1.012
trillion
and
raises
the
sequester

years.
That

the
difficult

necessary
to
get
our

One
Month
Farm
Bill
Extension
The
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
is
still
working
hard
on
finalizing
a
five-year
Farm
Bill,
and
negotiations
are
going
to
continue
while
Members
are
back
home
working

our
Districts.
But
we
need
a
bit
more
time
to
finalize
a
long-term
deal.
Knowing
that
was
the
case,
last
week,
the
House
passed
a
temporary
extension
by
voice
vote.
The
extension
is
meant
to
ensure
that
consumers
aren&#8217;t
affected
by
the
higher
prices
that
could
take
effect
if
the
Farm
Bill
expires.
The
Senate
has
made
it
clear
that
they
don&#8217;t
intend
to
vote
on
this
extension,
but
I
don&#8217;t
think
that&#8217;s
a
problem.
Why
not?
Because
I&#8217;m
optimistic
that
we&#8217;ll
reach
an
agreement
very
soon.
I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
the
next

in
the

of
January.
