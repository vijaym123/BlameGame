Higher Costs, Reduced Coverage: Stories from Obamacare
We&rsquo;ve all heard stories stemming from Obamacare: loss of coverage, higher costs, technology glitches, and red tape a mile long. But for
all too many American families, these stories are real life nightmares. The fact of the matter is that the President&rsquo;s health care law is not
working to improve the affordability or availability of health care for many Americans. This is the message I have consistently heard from families
and businesses in the Sixth District of Virginia. The examples, unfortunately, are plentiful.
From Luray to Roanoke, I have heard from numerous families that their premiums are simply unaffordable. One family of four who
paid $603 per month for a policy with dental coverage last year discovered that the 2015 rate for the same policy, even without dental, is now well
over $1,500 per month. I receive letters, emails, and phone calls almost every day from individuals whose premiums have drastically increased. I
cannot understate the number of families who&rsquo;ve contacted me to share their stories over the past two years. Many families in the Sixth District
are proof that contrary to the White House&rsquo;s claims, you cannot, in fact, keep your health care plan if you like it.
Hearing these horror stories is difficult, especially when many Democrats in Congress and the
Administration are not willing to act with the House to address the problems presented by this health care law. As the 2015 enrollment period for
Obamacare draws to a close and the problems continue to come to light, it&rsquo;s clear that not even the strongest glue would fix the cracks in this
law. The best thing Congress can do for the people we represent is to get rid of this Washington bureaucrat managed, one-size-fits-all health care
program. Let&rsquo;s work together to find appropriate remedies to address the challenges folks face in getting the coverage they both want and need.

Honoring Victims
of Alzheimer's
This week on the House Floor I had the opportunity to speak in support of the victims of
Alzheimer's.
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease robs an individual of a most valued possession &ndash; their memory.
I&rsquo;ve met with many families
across the 6th District of Virginia who have been impacted by Alzheimer&rsquo;s and it has been my honor to represent them by being a member of the
Bipartisan Congressional Alzheimer&rsquo;s Task Force. Thank you to the men and women who care for those suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s &ndash; the
spouses, children, grandchildren, friends, doctors, and nurses who assure them who they are, where they are, and affirm for them their dignity as an
individual.

Goodlatte: Change to Unilateral Immigration Program Provides Pathway to Citizenship:
This morning, I sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson
expressing concern about the startling new changes made to the expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that could place potentially
hundreds of thousands of unlawful immigrants on a pathway to citizenship.
