Dear Friend,
The Holiday Season is a time to gather with loved ones, celebrate
honored traditions, and give thanks for the many blessings in our
lives.
It is also a time to give back to our community and to show generosity
to those less fortunate.
This year, I am especially mindful of the brave men and women who have
risked - and continue to risk - their lives to defend our country and
protect the principles we hold so dear. I hope you will join me in
taking a moment to reflect on our nation's heroes and give thanks for
their service and sacrifice.
On behalf of my family and staff, Happy Holidays and best wishes to you
and yours in the New Year. Call on us any time.
Sincerely,
Washington, D.C. Office
