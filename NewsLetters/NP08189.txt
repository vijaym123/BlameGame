Dear Friends:
In
July 1776, George Washington was preparing for the defense of New York
City.
British vessels filled the harbor, and the apprehension
was palpable.
A communication sent by Continental Congress
President John Hancock and dated July 6, 1776, arrived at the generals
headquarters.
The letter instructed Washington to share the contents
of an enclosed document with the men under his command.
He was
eager to comply.
At 6 p.m. on July 9 th , the
Continental Army assembled according to Washingtons orders.
It was here
that the men who took up arms first heard the words that continue to
reverberate through time and history
That these United Colonies are,
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States.
They
heard
the
words.
The Declaration of Independence was preserved for posterity in
written form and transmitted as such throughout the colonies, both in
printed broadsides and in newspapers; however, it was the public reading
of these words that heightened patriotic passions.
Washington
assembled the men indicating that, the declaration of Congress,
shewing the grounds and reasons of this measure, is to be read with an
audible voice.
He reported back the following day that, Agreeable
to the request of Congress I caused the Declaration to be proclaimed
before all the Army under my immediate Command, and have the pleasure
to inform them, that the measure seemed to have their most hearty
assent; the Expressions and behaviour both of Officers and Men testifying
their warmest approbation of it.
Patriots in towns up and down
the east coast experienced the full force of the measure when it was
read aloud.
After the citizens of New York City heard the
Declaration of Independence read, they proceeded to tear down a statue of King
George III.
Similar displays of patriotic fervor followed
readings of the Declaration of Independence throughout the
states.
Today, when we observe the Fourth
of July, the warm summer breeze is filled with the sound of bands
playing in parades, burgers and hot dogs crackling on the grill, and
fireworks exploding in the night sky.
In the spirit of 1776, I
encourage you to add a reading of the Declaration of Independence to those
sounds that accompany your celebration with friends and family.
While the original document may be on display behind glass at the
National Archives, the ideas expressed were never meant to be
encased.
They are living, inspirational words meant to be declared.
They were penned to be heard.
Happy 238 th
Birthday to the United States
of America!
From the Front...
