Veterans
Health Care: Disturbing News Requires Immediate
Action
With the resignation of Secretary Shinseki as head of the Department
of Veterans Affairs, I hope that the President will now ensure that
the scandalous neglect of veterans throughout the VA health care system
is corrected
and corrected immediately.
The preliminary
report issued on Wednesday by the Inspector General (IG) of the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) painted a disturbing picture.
IG: Phoenix VA hospital missed care for 1,700
vets , was the headline in the
Washington
Post , in a
story
that also reported that the
average wait time in Phoenix for a first appointment was 115
days!
Even more disturbing, the report found that the recently
identified failures found in Phoenix were not an isolated case.
Long delays in veterans ability to schedule appointments, and efforts
to hide those long delays, have been found across the entire system,
according to the IGs report, which can be found
here .
This situation is completely
unacceptable.
As a nation, we have a solemn commitment to care for those who have
served in uniform.
Congress has increased funding
levels for the Department of Veterans Affairs by more than 60 percent
since 2009 and this years budget request includes an increase of 6.5
percent over last years spending.
Clearly, the VA has a serious
management problem that must be addressed
immediately.
Obamacare
Consequences of Bad Legislation
The
law of unintended consequences is getting a workout as the long list
of the unexpected shortcomings and failures of the Affordable Care Act
continue to mount.
THE
LATEST:
Hospitals are charging indigent patients now as a result of Obamacare,
as this
New York Times
article
points out.
The IRS will assess
heavy penalties on companies that continue to offer tax-free payments to
their employees to allow those employees to purchase health insurance
or cover other out of pocket costs. Read more
here .
People who receive subsidies for their health
insurance could be hit with a big tax bill next April if their income
rises and they dont report the increase to the health care exchange. Read
more

The
Presidents Speech at West Point:
Washington Post s Editorial
Viewpoint
President Obamas much-anticipated foreign
policy speech at West Point on Wednesday, President Obama received
widespread criticism from a broad array of news outlets.
This
editorial
from the
Washington
Post
asserts that his speech did little to convince the
country or the world that his foreign policy is not weakening Americas
leadership in the world.
Presidents Departure
Strategy in Afghanistan Risks Repeating Iraqs
Failure
President Obamas announcement this week of a timetable for
withdrawal from Afghanistan might enable him to keep a campaign pledge, but
it might not allow Afghanistan to keep the social, economic, and
political progress its made over the past decade.
Jim
Michaels,
writing
in
USA
Today , examines how the events that have followed our complete
withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 should serve as cautionary tale for how
we proceed to disengage from Afghanistan.
Must Read:
Former CIA Director Discusses
Americas Purpose and
Role in a Changed World
Michael Hayden, former
director of the CIA published a thoughtful and sobering
piece
in the current issue of
World Affairs
Journal
discussing what our nations role can and
should be in a changing world.
As he looks at all the trouble
spots in the world, and reflects on where Americas current foreign
policy is heading, Hayden concludes: Our greatest security danger in
coming years? It might well be us.
I highly recommend giving
this article a close and careful read.
West Orange,
Edison Historic Site to Celebrate Edison Day on June
7
On June 7, from 11 am to 7 pm, the Thomas Edison National
Historic Park and West Orange will celebrate Edison Day, saluting one of
the greatest technology innovators of all time.
Not enough
people know that New Jersey can justly be called the cradle of the
modern technological revolution.
From the West Orange laboratories of
Thomas Alva Edison came a long list of inventions that changed the
world and the way people live.
Every day we make use of products
and technologies that were born in Edisons fertile mind and in his
labs.
More information about Edison Day can be found
here .
Salute: Florham Park Police

Congratulations to Florham Park Police Chief Patrick P. Montuore on the
resounding
success
of this years Police Unity

Chief Montuore founded this annual event in 1997 to honor
the sacrifice of police officers who died in the line of

Salute: National Special Olympics to

This year, the national
Special Olympics is being held right here in New Jersey
in and around

Olympic-style team and individual sports, with the support of 1,000
