Dear
Friend,
As the primary sponsor
of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I am proud to say it's working.
This Open Enrollment season, 11.4 million more Americans have
signed up for coverage under the ACA.
Since its implementation, 2.1
million New Yorkers have erolled in insurance through the Marketplace
including 552,993 this season alone.
After watching
President Obama's
BuzzFeed Video
where he's taking
a selfie, I decided to take one myself as a fun way to promote
HealthCare.Gov.
If you see me around the District, don't be shy about
stopping me to take a selfie and tweet me
@cbrangel .
To commemorate Black History Month, I asked you
to share some of your favorite Black History facts about our District.
This
is what you
said.
Your opinion
is valuable to me. So please visit my website at Rangel.house.gov
for more
information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great honor
serving you.
Best regards,
Charles B. Rangel
Please forward my e-newsletter to your friends
&amp; family.
