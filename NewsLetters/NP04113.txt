Wishing You and Your Family a Happy
Thanksgiving
Each year, on the fourth Thursday in November, Americans gather around
the table to celebrate Thanksgiving. We take this time to reflect on the
many things for which we are grateful: our family and friends; our
co-workers; our jobs; our health and the freedoms we enjoy in America.
Too often, we get caught up in the pace of everyday life and dont take
the time to appreciate just how fortunate we are. This is a time for
such reflection.
As Americans, we have to cherish this
special time of thanksgiving and togetherness. We also can give thanks and
remember those who have sacrificed for our freedoms.West Virginia is
home to a significant number of men and women who have served in our
Armed Forces and sacrificed so much so that we may enjoy life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness here at home. Let us give thanks to these
men and women, and give thanks for our great country.
Happy
Thanksgiving!
