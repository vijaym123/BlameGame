Dear
Friends,
Im pleased to announce today the launch of a newly designed
website,
Becerra.house.gov.
As your
representative in Congress, one of my main responsibilities is helping
you navigate the various federal agencies. Whether Its dealing with
Social Security, Veterans benefits, IRS, or passport issues, my office
is ready to assist you. One of the best tools I have to serve you and
keep you informed is an accessible and easy-to-use
website.
I invite you to visit the new Becerra.house.gov and use it
to share your thoughts with me via email, sign up for the Becerra
Bulletin, or to stay updated on upcoming events in the 34th District.
And in todays digital world, you can always stay connected with me
through my
Facebook
page,
Twitter , or
Youtube .
Sincerely,
XAVIER BECERRA
