Veterans Day is a special occasion
to honor the more than 22 million brave men and
women who have served in our nations Armed Forces. It is because of the
selfless sacrifices of our veterans and their families that
we have the freedom and liberties we now enjoy. We owe our
veterans all the respect a grateful country can
offer.
I am humbled to represent a region of over 85,000 veterans
who have served our country with great distinction. One of the
greatest ways we can honor our veterans is to make sure they receive
all the benefits and services they are entitled to under the law. Too
many veterans suffering from physical and mental wounds have been forced
to wait through long backlogs while their disability
claims are processed.
More than 700,000 benefit
claims are pending with over 411,000 considered to
be severely backlogged.
These delays
are unacceptable.
President Calvin Coolidge
once said, "the nation which forgets its defenders will itself be
forgotten." I hope that everyone can take some time out of their day today
to remember, honor and express appreciation and gratitude for all of
our veterans around the country who have risked both life and limb to
protect us and our way of life.
Thank you to
all who have served. God bless you and God bless the United States of
America.
