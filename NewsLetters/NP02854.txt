The
Presidents Budget Proposes the
Same Failed Policies
Dear Friend,
As I travel the Fifth District listening
to those I represent, it is clear to me
that Virginians recognize that the status
quo is unsustainable. Our nation has
borrowed $18 trillion, and Washington
continues to borrow nearly 20 cents on
every dollar it spends. Parents are gravely
concerned about the impact of our national
debt on their childrens futures.
Last Monday,
President
Obama released his budget
for the
Fiscal Year 2016. His $4 trillion annual
budget proposal never balances
ever
making it impossible to even begin
paying down our staggering debt. Over the
course of ten years, his proposal includes
a $2.4 trillion spending increase, a $2.1
trillion tax increase, and adds $8.5
trillion to our tremendous national debt.
The President has missed yet another
opportunity to put forth solutions that
tackle the long-term drivers of our
national debt by reforming entitlement
programs.
Our nation is clearly on an
unsustainable fiscal path that is
exacerbated by the excessive spending
culture under this Administration. With our
national debt exceeding an astounding $18
trillion, we cannot afford to adopt
President Obamas budget plan, which
violates bipartisan spending reforms,
increases taxes on an already strained
economy, never balances, and passes the
buck to our children and grandchildren.
Our country needs a pro-growth budget
that cuts wasteful spending, reforms the
tax code, strengthens and protects
entitlement programs for future
generations, and most importantly
balances the budget. Each day, families
across Virginias Fifth District are
cutting back to ensure they can balance
their checkbooks. Our nations budget
should be no different. But rather than try
to fix the mess we are in, the
Presidents recent budget proposal
continues the unsustainable practice of
borrowing money we do not have to pay for
more reckless government spending.
Now that the President has submitted his
budget proposal, the House and Senate will
evaluate it and propose their own budgets.
Just like our last two budgets, I fully
expect that the House Budget will include
responsible spending reforms to balance the
budget over ten years and enact pro-growth
policies to stimulate the economy.
Since coming to Congress, addressing the
national deficit and crippling debt has
been one of my top priorities. While we
have successfully implemented some spending
reforms, such as eliminating earmarks and
reforming several government programs, we
must take further action to rein in the
programs that represent over $100 trillion
in unfunded liabilities for future
generations. We will never be able to
balance our budget and pay down our debt
without strengthening and protecting these
critical programs for future
generations.
I look forward to the House of
Representatives once again leading the way
by passing a pro-growth budget. I remain
committed to working with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to balance our
budget and get our fiscal house in order so
that we can grow our economy and build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
