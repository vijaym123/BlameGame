Greetings,
I wanted to share with you this important message from Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a conservative leader in the Senate, regarding an important fight in Washington.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
Dear Friends,
Congressman Mike Pompeo has a simple solution to end Washingtons harmful habit of picking winners and losers:
Stop corporate welfare.
You see, Mike has offered legislation that would eliminate all special tax credits for energy production, and instead would even the tax code and level the playing field.
Imagine:
Companies would have to compete for customers and not political patrons!
I liked this idea so much that I decided to offer companion legislation in the Senate just last week.
Already weve seen a great deal of support from conservative groups such as Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Freedom Action, Heritage Action, National Taxpayers Union, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Im proud to stand alongside Congressman Pompeo, a true conservative reformer in the House, as we fight to make Washington work for Kansas and the rest of America, rather than the other way around.
Sincerely,
Mike Lee
U.S. Senator
