November 13, 2013
Dear
Friend:
I recently met with residents in the University
Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles about a terrible environmental
injustice they have been living with in their community.
(To view

Children, families, and others living just across the street from an oil and
gas pumping facility have described horrible odors and illnesses
including dizziness, headaches, respiratory ailments, and recurring
nosebleeds.
When I first heard about these problems, I asked
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard local residents
and end their suffering.
EPA and other officials have started
investigating the source of the illnesses that many people have
experienced.
Last week, I called on the facilitys owner to
suspend operations while EPAs investigation is being
conducted.
I support EPAs efforts and will work with them and state and local
officials to ensure that the health and safety of this community is
being protected.
The safety of our families must be the highest
priority.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
