Friend,
The Fourth of July is one of my favorite days of the year. Parades, barbecues, and fireworks on a warm summer day - a perfect way to celebrate our hard won freedoms. I hope you had as wonderful a Fourth of July weekend as I did -
click below to see part of how I spent my Fourth.
Every year on Independence Day, I pause to reflect on what it means to be an American. To me, the American Dream is a very real and concrete thing -- I am the product of it, and I&#39;m aware that my story is a uniquely American story.
My parents emigrated from India with nearly nothing, and in one generation my father could sit in the House Gallery and watch his son get sworn in to the United States House of Representatives.
My success and the success of my brothers came from hard work, dedication, and great public schools, which I attended from kindergarten through medical school.
For those and many other reasons, I&#39;m proud to be an American. I&#39;m interested to hear your stories: how was your Fourth of July, and why are you proud to be an American?

We&#39;re all so fortunate to be citizens of this amazing country - I&#39;m cognizant of that fact every day. I hope your holiday weekend was safe and fun, and that you enjoyed time with family and friends celebrating the United States of America - I know I did!
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
