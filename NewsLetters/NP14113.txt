Dear Friend,
Over the past two weeks Massachusetts has
had the honor of being visited by two of the militarys
highest-ranking officials. Air Force Chief of Staff
General Mark Welsh visited Hanscom Air Force Base
and MITs
Lincoln Labs on November 7 and 8; Army Chief of Staff
General Ray Odierno toured Natick Soldier Systems Center
last Friday, November 15.
I have long been a strong
advocate for Massachusetts military installation, especially Hanscom and
Natick, due to both the economic activity they generate and the
important role they play in securing our country and protecting
servicemembers. That is why I invited General Welsh to visit Hanscom and urged
General Odierno to visit Natick, to see firsthand the impressive,
cutting-edge work.
Natick Soldier Systems Center works to provide
U.S. soldiers with the best equipment in the world, serving as the
Armys one-stop soldier-support organization responsible for researching,
developing, fielding and managing food, clothing, shelters, airdrop
systems and soldier support items. At Hanscom and MITs Lincoln
Laboratories, unparalleled technology is being developed in the areas of
cyber, radar, and communications, amongst others. All the work being done
at these facilities helps our soldiers and airmen in the field stay
safe and be successful.
Here in Massachusetts we combine
world-class academic institutions, advanced industry partners, and two of
the nations leading federally funded research and development centers.
Both Generals were impressed with what they saw during their visits,
with General Odierno saying that Natick has a bright
future.
I look forward to continuing my work with General Welsh and
General Odierno, as well as all the armed forces, to create efficient and
modern soldier resources.
Please be sure to scroll down to
read more information on some of the other topics on which I have been
working.
As always, I hope that you continue to provide me
with your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on these or any other
subjects via my
website
or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION
ACT
On November 19 I spoke on the House Floor in
support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). I strongly urged
Speaker John Boehner to bring this Senate-passed bill to a vote in the
House of Representatives. My late husband Paul was the first U.S.
Senator to introduce legislation to ban job discrimination based on sexual
orientation more than 30 years ago, in 1979.

ENDA
ALZHEIMERS AWARENESS MONTH
One of my
constituents, Alan Holbrook of Groton, Massachusetts, lost his wife this
year after their family endured an eight year battle with Alzheimers
disease.
Bernadette Holbrook was diagnosed with Alzheimers at 57.
Alan left his job to lovingly take care of her.
He is not
alone.
For every person with Alzheimer's, there are approximately 2
to 3 others that generously give unpaid care.
On
Wednesday, November 20 I spoke on the House Floor to recognize National
Alzheimers Awareness Month. I discussed the tremendous physical,
emotional and financial toll this disease can have on a family and called on
my colleagues to support prevention and research efforts.

50 TH
ANNIVERSARY OF JFK
DEATH
Today is the 50 th
Anniversary of the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy. He was a man who defined a generation
and has influenced our country ever since. I was asked to share my
perspective of this tragic day with the Washington Post and discuss the
overarching sentiments that reverberated from it. Having been a young
girl whose military family was stationed in Japan at the time, I had a
unique experience that showed the changing times and the broad reach of
this endearing American leader.

GIRLS, INC. TURNS
100
Congratulations to Girls, Inc. on its 100th anniversary!
This organization provides a positive all-girl environment that offers
pre-teen programs aimed at helping young women achieve their personal
and professional goals. The efforts of this organization helped drive
the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, and have continually sought to remove
roadblocks that many girls may encounter in their careers. I wish
them the best of luck in their next century!
