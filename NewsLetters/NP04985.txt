Friend -- I&rsquo;ve been emailing a TON.
But I&rsquo;m emailing once more because this moment is absolutely critical.
I know you&#39;re a busy person, but this is an absolute MUST-READ:
Our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push is on the chopping block: We&rsquo;re still $1,389,071 short with 24 hours left.
If we don&rsquo;t fill that budget gap, we&rsquo;ll be forced to scale back our plans to mobilize 575,000 voters this weekend. These are voters who could determine the outcome of the whole Senate.
I&rsquo;m begging for your help to close the gap IMMEDIATELY. If we fall short before the last end-of-month deadline tomorrow, our chance to keep the Senate gets a whole lot smaller.
Will you pitch in to the Final Weekend GOTV Push before the final deadline in 24 hours? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
The Senate race is SO close today:
Six Senate races are absolutely deadlocked today. SIX.
If we protect three of these six seats, Democrats keep the Senate.
But that gives us just 50-50 odds with five days left. That&rsquo;s simply scary.
YOU can put your finger on the scale and tip this race to Democrats. The power of grassroots support can WIN us this election. And that&rsquo;s something to be proud of.
I&rsquo;m counting on you, Friend. Will you pitch in before tomorrow at midnight so we can turn out every voter and win?
Thanks,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
