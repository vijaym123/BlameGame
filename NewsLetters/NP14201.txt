STIVERS ANNOUNCES TOYS FOR TOTS DROP-OFF LOCATIONS IN OHIO DISTRICT OFFICES
This time of year, we are reminded to be thankful; but, we must also remember the importance of giving. This year, my Ohio District Offices will be drop-off sites for the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program.
From now until December 13, 2013, members of the community may drop off new, unwrapped toys Monday through Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm at any of the following locations:
Hilliard District Office: 3790 Municipal Way, Hilliard, OH, 43026
Lancaster District Office: 123 South Broad Street, Suite 235, Lancaster, OH, 43130
Wilmington District Office: 69 North South Street, Suite 178, Wilmington, OH, 45177
The upcoming weeks will be a busy time of year for many families, but I hope the drop-off sites in my Ohio District Offices will make it easier for members of the community to come together and make a difference.
Please know that my offices stand ready to help you with any issues you may have throughout the year, so do not hesitate to contact me at the following phone numbers: Hilliard District Office (614) 771-4968; Lancaster District Office (740) 654-2654; Wilmington District Office (937) 283-7049.
