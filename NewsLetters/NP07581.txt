July 27, 2014
Friends,
Thank you to everyone who
participated in our Seventh District Telephone Town Hall Event last
week.
We had some great questions and an informative discussion
about the federal issues headlining the news daily.
T he two
most common topics of discuss were immigration and transportation.
There has been some movement on immigration and border
security legislation but nothing has yet to come before the full House
for consideration.
In regards to our district's
transportation issues,
I had an encouraging meeting with Major
General Peabody, Army Corps of Engineers, Secretary Darcy, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster about the dredging needs of the
Georgetown Port.
As you know, the Georgetown Port has
silted in over the years due to lack of funding.
South Carolina
has committed more than half of the funds needed for the dredging
project and we are hoping to get a sizable federal contribution.
The Army Corps was engaged throughout our presentation and has
requested additional information and a follow-up meeting . This
is a good step in the right direction.

Helping Students Prepare for
their Financial Future
Today,
nearly
40 million people
hold
student loan debt.
As tuition rates continue to rise, borrowing
will continue to follow suit.
Many student borrowers have little
to no income and are approved for loans that amount to an entry-level
salary.
Combine this with the dismal job market, and students
could easily become trapped in a horrible financial
situation.
In order to assist our graduates and future workforce, the
House passed the
Empowering Students
Through Enhanced Counseling Act .
This legislation
creates a roadmap to repayment for borrowers (both student and parent
borrowers) by improving the timing and frequency of loan counseling and
ensures that counseling is tailored to a borrowers individual
situation.
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Signed Into
Law
The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act was signed into law this week by
President Obama.
This bill includes provisions to better link
job-seekers with employers who need their skills, allows communities more
flexibility to make training fit local needs, and encourages young
people to re-enter the job market through education and
training.
This signing marked a seldom
moment of bicameral bipartisanship, in which the White House, Senate,
and House of Representatives all joined together to enact legislation
that will truly help Americas job-seekers.
Here are some
of the provisions:
Eliminates 15 existing programs that were ineffective or
redundant
Creates smaller and more strategic
state and local workforce development boards
Allows local areas to better tailor programs to
needs of communities and individual workers
Aligns workforce development programs with economic
development and education
efforts
