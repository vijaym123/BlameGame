Friend -- I know I&rsquo;ve been sending a lot of emails.
It&#39;s because this is URGENT. Please read this FIRST THING today -- before you do ANYTHING ELSE:
12 races are virtually TIED with only 11 days left.
The Republicans only need to win six to take over the Senate.
That makes our odds of winning 50-50 -- much too close!
Our aggressive turnout operation WILL beat the GOP -- IF we can get it 100% funded. But right now, we&rsquo;re worryingly short.
You MUST act IMMEDIATELY for us to fight back and WIN the Senate.
Will you pitch in today so we can turn out every voter and make it a devastating Election Day for the GOP? Donate by midnight and we&rsquo;ll match your gift.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I want to take a second to remind you about the stakes in this election. If we fall short, Mitch McConnell and the GOP will take control and erase decades of progress with their failed policies.
Health care reform, financial reform, economic recovery: All this and more will be at risk -- which would be so crushing for working families.
But we can still stop them.
If you give to our GOTV effort TODAY, we&rsquo;ll send it right to the field, turn out millions of voters, and hand the Republicans an absolutely gut-wrenching defeat.
Will you please help Democrats win this election? It&rsquo;s never been more important to contribute -- give before midnight and your gift will be matched.
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
