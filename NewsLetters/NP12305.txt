Dear Friends,
I am deeply saddened by the
tragic deaths of students who participated in protests in Venezuela to
demand fundamental human rights and respect for democratic principles.
The repressive tactics used by Venezuela's autocratic leader Nicolas
Maduro have undermined the rights and dignity of the Venezuelan
people, and now some of the nations brave youth have fallen victim to his
dictatorial rule.
These deaths could have been avoided if this
regime had not pursued disastrous economic policies and curtailed
democratic institutions such as the independent press. This along with
the intimidation and persecution of journalists and independent voices
led to a consolidation of powers and the creation of a
dictatorship.
But with the Venezuelan constitution and democracy under siege,
the people wish to speak out against efforts to acquire complete
control of the country. Recent events have demonstrated that the
Venezuelan people still have a voice
and they wont be
silenced.
Those who work with the press have joined the students in protest. They
all fear the direction the country is heading in and the lack of
economic opportunities for the Venezuelan people. These students are the
future leaders of Venezuela and they are tired of Maduro. We must support
them during this critical time and help them restore their
democracy.
I urge responsible nations everywhere to stand in solidarity
with those in Venezuela who bravely express their opposition to this
regime and seek to protect their democratic liberties. In the struggle
for freedom where the state uses violence to harm its people,
neutrality is not an option.
This is why I have introduced with my
colleague from New Jersey, Albio Sires, HR 1687
the Countering ALBA
Act of 2013. This bill urges the President to sanction officials from
ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas) countries or anyone acting
on behalf of an ALBA country that the President has determined to be
responsible for or complicit in ordering, controlling, or otherwise
directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against citizens
of ALBA countries.
The appalling actions by the Maduro
regime are an example of the human rights violations being committed by the
antidemocratic leaders of these nations.We must come together
and unite with other governments in the region to fight against the
anti-democratic forces in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Bolivia and
the direction that they are heading in.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
