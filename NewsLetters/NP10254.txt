Sen. Bob Dole Visits Johnson
County
It was a joy for many 3rd District residents who gathered in
Johnson County last week to welcome back and spend time visiting with
Senator Bob Dole . Sen. Dole is a true American hero and
public servant in every sense of the word. He has sacrificed much for
his fellow citizens and his country through his time as a World War II
soldier and devoted public servant once he returned
home.
"Hundreds turned out to see Dole on Monday
as he returned to Kansas to renew old friendships and political
bonds. He offered a word of thanks to the voters who made him the
longest-serving Republican U.S. Senate leader in
history.
"I love this state," Dole said." - the
Kansas City Star .

UMKC Civility Forum
It was a pleasure to join my
colleague
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II
(D-MO)
at the
University of Missouri, Kansas City
last Monday
afternoon for a forum discussion hosted by the
Institute for Civility in Government . Both
Congressman Cleaver and I spoke about serving in Congress and the
importance of staying respectful and civil in the increasingly polarized
environment in Washington, DC. Personal friendships across the
political aisle also improves working relationships and our ability to get
things done at the Capitol.
Thank you to UMKC and to the Institute of Civility in Government for
organizing and hosting Mondays forum.
Wyandotte County Sheriff Don Ash
Wyandotte County Sheriff
Don Ash hosted me at the Wyandotte County Sheriff's office last week. I
met with Lieutenant Kelli Bailiff, Warden Jeffrey Fewell, and other
law enforcement officers and we discussed the state of public safety in
Wyandotte County. I also took a tour of the facility and I was
impressed with the way Sheriff Ash and his whole team work to keep the
citizens of Wyandotte County safe.
Thank you, Sheriff Ash, for showing me around your office and facility.
And thank you and your staff for the important work you do for all
Wyandotte County residents.
Blue Valley High
School Visit
Students in Mr. Kristoffer Barikmos AP
Government class at
Blue
Valley High School
welcomed me to their class last week. We
had a great conversation and these bright students asked excellent
questions about issues facing our
country.
Afterwards, members of
the Blue Valley High School award-winning debate team spent time with
me asking follow-up questions and sharing with me their opinions and
concerns. I was even interviewed by Blue Valley Tiger
TV.
Thank you Mr. Barkimo, all the Blue
Valley AP government students, the debate team, and to student leader, Ajay
Subramanian, for inviting me.
JCERT
5-year Anniversary

week. While there we celebrated the first five years of success of a
unique partnership between
t he University of Kansas

Student artists in the 3rd Congressional District

used.

Cub Scouts Know the Importance of Community
Service
I enjoyed visiting with several members of
Cub Scout
Pack 3095
at Ravenwood Elementary School early last week. These
young men were very bright and energetic, and we talked about
government, civic involvement and how becoming involved in your community at a
young age is important.
Thanks to Cub Scout Pack 3095 for inviting me to visit them - its great
to see so many kids staying involved in activities like Cub
Scouts.

Report: IRS
rewards tax-delinquent employees
A news report last week
from the Inspector General of the IRS states that millions of dollars
in bonuses were recently paid out to IRS workers who were delinquent
on their own taxes and had other disciplinary
problems.
This is just one more very egregious example of
waste and abuse of taxpayer
resources.
