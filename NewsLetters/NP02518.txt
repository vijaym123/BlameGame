Friend,
I&#39;m excited to share that Ami is turning 50 on March 2 nd
and I wanted to ask you for a quick favor.
In past years, Syd and I have given him fishing rods, clothes and even a bike to celebrate-- but with his busy schedule both in our district and DC, he&#39;s hardly home to enjoy them!
So, this year, I thought I&#39;d focus on something he&#39;ll appreciate even more-- our support for the work he&#39;s doing to improve Sacramento County.
This is a special birthday and I hope you&#39;ll join me in supporting Ami&#39;s campaign-- especially as news broke last week that he&#39;s already a national target.
Can I count on you to pitch in $50, $5 or whatever you can to
celebrate Ami&rsquo;s 50th birthday?
Ami and I are incredibly grateful for all the support and generosity you&rsquo;ve shown, and I know how touched he&#39;ll be by your ongoing support.
Thanks for being a part of our team,
Janine
P.S. Ami tells me 50 is the new 35-- click here if you agree! (It will make him feel young).
