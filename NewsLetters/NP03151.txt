It&rsquo;s a disaster: In Republicans&rsquo; first weeks controlling Congress, they&rsquo;ve tried to DESTROY Social Security, abortion rights, and even Obamacare.
Meanwhile, the Koch brothers and Karl Rove are already gearing up their enormous right-wing money machine,
meaning Republicans running for White House and Senate will be incredibly well-funded.
With a huge surge of grassroots donations, we can stop the GOP from gaining an insurmountable lead. But if we fall behind before the first FEC deadline of the year in 96 hours, it&rsquo;ll be a major setback to our chances to win the White House and Senate.
Will you renew your membership now before the FEC deadline in 96 hours? We need 50,000 strong Democrats to step up.

Or donate another amount.
Let&rsquo;s start fighting back!
