Congressman Lamborn Supports the VA
Accountability Act
5/21/14
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn cosponsored and voted for the bipartisan H.R. 4031, the V.A.
Accountability Act. The bill will give the VA Secretary greater
authority to fire employees and remove them from the VA's Senior
Executive Service due to poor performance.
The scandals currently rocking our VA system show a lack of
competent management. When bureaucrats know that it is almost
impossible to be fired, performance often takes a nose dive. Thats why I
cosponsored and voted for the bipartisan VA Accountability Act. This bill
gives VA leadership the authority needed to remove failing senior
executives. I demand they use it.
