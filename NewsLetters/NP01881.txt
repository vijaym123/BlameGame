&ldquo;69 percent of the cuts in the GOP budgets would have to fall on programs helping people with lower incomes&rdquo;--
The Washington Post , 3/24/15
Dear Friend,
A budget lays out your priorities.
The budget the GOP just passed shows their priorities loud and clear
-- spare the billionaires, and make the poor and vulnerable pay.
I won&rsquo;t stand for this, and I&rsquo;m looking to enlist your help to fight back. The first FEC deadline of the year is one day away. Help us reach our goal and push back against the GOP agenda by giving $5.
Economic inequality is shaping America in deep and lasting ways. Washington could help to slow or even reverse that trend, but not with this current gang of Republicans in charge.
The Republicans truly believe that the best way to help low-income people is to cut the programs on which they rely. They truly believe that if we rip up the social safety net, it can be remade into bootstraps.
Those beliefs are not supported by either the available data or the lived experiences of millions of people -- and yet, the Republicans persist in advancing their supply-side dogma. I&rsquo;m fighting in the Senate to limit the damage the Republicans can do, but ultimately, we need to elect legislators who will support a pro-middle class agenda. And to do that, we need to hit our fundraising goals. Help us finish the quarter strong before the FEC deadline tomorrow night -- give $5, $10, or $25 if you&rsquo;re able.
Thank you,
Ed
