Dear Friend,
This week marked the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court&#39;s landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion in our country. Since the court&#39;s ruling, more than 56 million innocent lives have tragically been lost. To put that into perspective, there are roughly 56 million people living in the states of New York and California combined.
To raise awareness for the Pro-Life cause, thousands of grassroots advocates from across the country are in Washington this week for the Annual March for Life. For the last 41 years the March for Life has been a rallying cry for all of those who believe life begins at conception and that all life has value. I admire the courage of their conviction and I appreciate the voice they are giving to the unborn.
Every representative, every physician and every American needs to be reminded that at the center of our Pro-Life struggle is the protection of all human life. We cannot live in a society where some human life is valued and other life is not.
I stand united with the March for Life delegation and Pro-Life advocates across the country in a belief that all life is precious. All life has value and the casual taking of life is morally wrong. Across our great nation, millions of Americans are coming together today to demand that the federal government stop assisting in this great assault on innocent life. The federal government should not spend one single dime on Planned Parenthood or any associated groups. Taxpayer dollars should never be used to take the life of the unborn.
As work continues to overturn Roe v. Wade, we must also lay the foundation for a society that does not accept abortion as a form of birth control. Pro-Life advocates have taken up this cause, but work still remains. Open hearts and open minds can heal our nation and change abortions into adoptions. We must join together to pray for the protection of the unborn. The intersection of prayer and action can produce amazing results. I know we can accomplish our goals, and innocent human life can be saved.
