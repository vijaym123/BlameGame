Rep. Miller Backs House Legislation to Improve Veteran Care; Highlights Opportunity to Reform VA
House passes the Veterans Access to Care Act, cosponsored by Rep. Candice Miller, that provides non-VA care options to veterans subject to wait times over 14
days or who live over 40 miles from a VA medical facility
Washington &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after House passage of the Veterans Access to Care Act (H.R. 4810):
&quot;Just yesterday, the VA released its internal audit of 731 facilities that further underscored the systemic nature of the
serious problems at the VA.
According to the report, over 57,000 veterans have waited over 90 days to get an appointment, and 64,000 in the network, including 1,500 from Michigan, have never seen a doctor despite their requests.
Additionally, the report,
which flagged three facilities in Michigan for further review, found that approximately 13 percent of VA schedulers nationwide falsified appointment information. Our veterans honorably served this country, and the VA is embarrassingly failing to provide them
with the care they need and deserve.
&#8220;While alarming, I believe these incidents present an opportunity to finally reform the VA and deliver the best service
to our veterans in a way that is convenient to them and cost effective.
&#8220;Today, the House took the biggest step yet to address these problems and do right by our veterans with the passage of the
Veterans Access to Care Act &#8211; legislation with
commonsense reforms that allow patients to access non-VA care for two years.
It also holds VA officials responsible by withholding bonuses through FY 2016 and requires an independent assessment with recommendations
for projected health care capabilities.
&#8220;Locally, I have always heard great things about our VA facilities. In fact, the facilities in Yale and Bad Axe have received
outstanding support and feedback for the delivery and support of the veterans in my district.
And although most VA facilities in Michigan have performed well by comparison, there is always room for improvement.
&#8220;It is imperative that we fix these problems so that the brave men and women who served this nation get the care they deserve
&#8211; immediately. I am pleased with the House&#8217;s swift passage of this important legislation, and I am hopeful that the Senate will take immediate action so that we can start to address this inexcusable problem.&#8221;
Highlights of the Veterans Access to Care Act (H.R. 4810):
&middot;
Requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to offer non-VA care at the Department&#8217;s expense to any enrolled veteran who cannot get an appointment within 14 days or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility
&middot;
Bans bonuses for all VA employees from FY 2014 &#8211; 2016
&middot;
Requires the VA to submit a quarterly report to Congress that includes usage info and an account as to what purchase methods were used to provide non-VA care
&middot;
Requires an independent assessment of the VA&#8217;s performance with recommendations for improvement of its current and projected health care capabilities and resources
