Rep. Miller Votes for Legislation that Improves Veteran Services &amp; Authorizes $35 Million for Fueling Infrastructure Improvements at Selfridge Air National Guard
Base
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, issued the following statement after the House passed the FY 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations
Bill (H.R. 4486):
Miller on Veterans Affairs Appropriations:
&#8220;The brave men and women returning from service abroad and at home have selflessly put themselves in harm&#8217;s way to protect the liberties that we enjoy every day. Many have made great
sacrifices and have incurred injuries &#8211; both physical and mental &#8211; in the line of duty.
Their first priority is our safety and well-being and, upon return, ours should be theirs.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I voted, today, for legislation that ensures our veterans get the medical care, mental health treatment and other health and job training services they have earned for their service. It also addresses the shameful backlog
of veteran disability claims by modernizing the claims process and holding those in charge at the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs accountable by restricting funds until they can prove the system works.
&#8220;Our veterans have made great sacrifices to ensure our liberty and safety.
They deserve better.
They deserve the best &#8211; they&#8217;ve earned it &#8211; and it is our moral responsibility to ensure they get the best care and services we can provide.&#8221;
Miller on $35 Million Fueling Infrastructure Investment at Selfridge Air National Guard Base:
&#8220;The Selfridge Air National Guard Base hosts every branch of the U.S. military and multiple agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, making it vital to our national security.
This overdue investment is a testament to the need to preserve
the base&#8217;s capabilities and ensure the readiness of each military branch stationed there.&#8221;
Highlights of FY 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill (H.R. 4486):
Veteran Services:
&middot;
Ensures veterans have the quality medical care, job training and other benefits they have earned for their service by increasing discretionary funding for veterans programs by $1.5 billion, providing a total of $64.7 billion in
discretionary spending for VA programs
&middot;
Includes funding for mental health care, suicide prevention, traumatic brain injury treatment, homeless veteran programs, and rural health initiatives
&middot;
Addresses backlog of disability claims by increasing operational funding by $20 million and restricting funds for VA and DOD until they can prove the claims system&#8217;s functionality
&middot;
Provides $6.6 billion for the construction of military housing, military medical facilities, DOD education facilities and Guard and Reserve facilities
Selfridge Air National Guard Base Fueling Infrastructure:
&middot;
Provides $35 million to replace the station&#8217;s 1950s-era inoperative fueling system to support two Air National Guard flying squadrons; a U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue Group; an Army National Guard rotary wing group; and the
U.S. Border Patrol air and marine contingent.
