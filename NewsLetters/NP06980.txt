Dear
Constituents,
Our Valley is in competition for what could
be one of the most significant economic development opportunities of
the decade. Tesla Motors, Inc. is in the process of selecting a
location for its new "Gigafactory" that will produce lithium-ion batteries
for use in their new line of electronic
vehicles.
Growing up in the Coachella Valley near the
Salton Sea, I know how rich our communities are in opportunity and
culture. Known for its world class festivals and resorts, it is also host to
a thriving local economy of small business owners and hardworking
families. Additionally, the area around the Salton Sea is a cradle of
renewable energy innovation, with an educational pipeline that is
preparing individuals for a career in the renewable energy
sector.
If Tesla Motors chooses our area,
this new factory would create 6,500 jobs, and could foster development
around the Salton Sea to help mitigate the harmful health effects of
the drying salt lake. Furthermore, the Sea is home to one of the largest
deposits of lithium in the U.S., which is already being extracted
using new, green technology that utilizes existing saltwater brine
produced by geothermal power plants.
You can read more about
the Gigafactory in
this
Sacramento Business Journal
article.

My vision is to facilitate
investment into the Salton Sea and make it the largest renewable energy
industrial park in the country to create jobs, improve families
lives, and focus on what the Sea offers our community for the 21st century
economy. I hope to share this vision with all of you, and I remain
dedicated to improving the quality of life for the residents of
California's 36th Congressional
District.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz,
M.D.
Representing California's 36th
