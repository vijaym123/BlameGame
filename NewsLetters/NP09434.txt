Dear Friend, Republicans in Massachusetts have rallied around a candidate for the U.S. Senate.
Now we know who we&rsquo;re up against. And we know, in a state where we&rsquo;ve had Republican governors for the last 16 of 23 years, and where there are more registered Independents than Democrats and Republicans
combined ,
we can&rsquo;t afford to take a single day for granted. This month, we&rsquo;re aiming to raise $20,000 to keep our organization strong and growing. Our deadline is 9 days away. Can you contribute $5 to help us hit our target?

Or donate another amount.
Our 2014 election stage is set. We know the official players. But let&rsquo;s not forget that since
Citizens United , this election isn&rsquo;t just about candidate vs. candidate anymore --
it&rsquo;s about grassroots vs. special interests, too.
Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and many of their friends will have cameos in this year&rsquo;s elections. And Democrats like me are a huge target for them.
I am fighting to protect Medicare, raise the minimum wage, reduce the effects of climate change -- in short, I am fighting for everything the special interests are working against.
They would love to see me replaced with someone who will do their bidding for them in the United States Senate. But that&rsquo;s not going to happen -- because I have all of you on my side. The deadline is close. If you can, give $5 or more today to get us to $20,000 before the end of May.
Thank you for your support.
