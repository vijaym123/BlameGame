Dear
friend,
On July 4, 1776
238 years ago today
our Founding Fathers gathered
in Philadelphia to sign one of the most important documents in world
history, the Declaration of Independence.
It was on that day that
America was born.
It was on that day that four million subjects
in 13 colonies fused into one people, the American people.
It
was on that day that a radical idea was born
an idea that would
inspire generations of Americans and generations of people throughout the
world
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and that whenever any Form
of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of
the People to alter or to abolish it.
Today, on
Independence Day, we celebrate Americas Founders and the country they
created.
We must never think that Americas birth, her victory in war, and
her survival through today, was a foregone conclusion.
Quite
the opposite.
The odds were against us, right from the
start.
And even after the Revolutionary War, there were many challenging
periods throughout our history
the Civil War, the Great Depression,
the Cold War, and many others
when the survival of our republic was in
grave doubt.
Through it all, we have persevered and thrived as
a people
mainly because of the wisdom and the courage of our
founding documents.
In our darkest times, our Founders, the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution have served as an
inspiration for every generation, including our own.
Freedom
is not the default condition of humankind.
Rather, there have
been many peoples throughout history who have won their freedom, only to
have it vanish away, usually without even noticing
it.
As
Thomas Jefferson pointed out, The natural progress of things is for
liberty to yield and government to gain ground.
We
cannot allow that to happen in our time. Therefore, we must remain
eternally vigilant in defending our Constitutional rights.
Ronald Reagan once said, Freedom is never more than one
generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the
bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to
do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our
children and our children's children what it was once like in the United
States where men were free.
Today, on Americas birthday,
let us remember Reagans wisdom.
Let us never forget the wisdom
of our Founders.
Their cause is still our cause; their fight is
still our fight.
Let us be worthy of their
legacy.
Have a wonderful 4th of July!
