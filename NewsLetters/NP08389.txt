For the past year, the IRS scandal
has shocked and disturbed the nation, with new revelations of
misconduct coming out on a seemingly weekly basis.
This past week,
however, produced one of the most appalling revelations, as the IRS
record of abuse reached a new low.
First a quick recap: In the
run-up to the 2012 election, the IRS was orchestrating a systematic
campaign to target and punish Tea Party and conservative
organizations.
While President Obama called it a phony scandal, in fact, it
was an outrageous abuse of government power that should never be
tolerated.
What the IRS did is a matter of public
record.
What remains unclear
and what the committee is still
investigating
is how far up did the corruption go?
Was it just some rogue
agents acting on their own?
Or was there a plan in place
from above, maybe even from the top?
The Ways and Means
Committee and the Oversight Committee have been working tirelessly for
answers, but the administration keeps stonewalling and making
excuses.
Actually, the administrations behavior is worse than that; all
of their actions smack of a cover-up.
This week, the IRS
Commissioner told the Oversight Committee that over two years of emails
from Lois Lerner
the IRS official whos at the heart of the scandal
were mysteriously lost.
This is suspicious for
several reasons: First, the emails supposedly disappeared just 10 days
after Rep. Dave Camp, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, first
inquired about whether the IRS was engaged in targeting conservative
groups.
Next, the IRS Commissioner had
up until this week
assured
Congress that he could and would produce all of Lerners
documents.
The head of the National Archives, David Ferriero, responded to
the IRS announcement by testifying that the IRS did not follow the
law by not telling his office about the lost emails.
Lois
Lerner, meanwhile, refuses to testify before Congress and has been held
in contempt. The IRS Commissioner refuses to apologize to the American
people.
Whats at stake here, with the IRS scandal, is
nothing less than the future of the First Amendment.
As Americans,
one of our most cherished values is freedom of speech.
Our
Founders enshrined free speech in the Constitution, and we have worked over
many generations to protect that cherished principle from any and all
threats.
What the IRS did - silencing people who
simply wanted to express their constitutional freedom
is precisely the
kind of tyranny that we freed ourselves from during the Revolutionary
War.
And if it took place in a foreign country today, we would
all be united in condemning it.
President Obama
promised the American people the most transparent administration in
history.
What weve gotten, instead, is one of the most dishonest and
arrogant administrations in history, but without a mainstream media
willing to hold them accountable.
Still, I am confident that
House Republicans will get to the heart of the IRS scandal.
When
it comes to the IRS, we deserve nothing less than the truth.
And we will get it.
