Dear Friend,
Veterans dying. Falsification of VA data. Months-long backlogs of
veterans waiting for appointments are headlines that we should never
read in this country.
The recent allegations and developments regarding the Department of
Veterans Affairs are appalling. As the claims continue to grow over the
failure to adequately provide health care services to our veterans, it
is increasingly clear that more VA officials need to be held
accountable.
While the Under Secretary of Health at the VA, Dr. Robert Petzel,
announced last week he would resign, this is hardly a punishment, as he
already announced he would retire later this year. This is the same
course of action the Administration took with the IRS scandal, and
people are tired of the faux accountability that continues to take
place.
Last week, I joined with twenty-two Texas Members of Congress in
calling for an Inspector General investigation into VA facilities in
Texas.
According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal
Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic
and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed - by
supervisors - to ensure that wait times for veterans were as "close to
zero days as possible." An employee of the Veterans Health
Administration, who recently worked at all three clinics, claims that
staffers falsely logged patients' desired appointment dates to closely
coincide with appointment openings. But in reality, veterans were left
waiting for months.
If these allegations are true the employees involved need to be fired
immediately as well as the leadership who gave the orders.
Today, the House will vote on H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans
Affairs Management Accountability Act. This bipartisan bill would give
the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to
remove employees of the Senior Executive Service, whose performance the
Secretary believes warrants removal, completely from the government
service.
Simply put, our veterans deserve better. The Administrations needs to
take immediate action to fix the problems that have plagued the VA for
too long, and they must begin by firing the people who have been in
charge while these inexcusable actions took place.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Veterans
dying.
Falsification
of
VA
data.
Months-long
backlogs
of
veterans
waiting
for
appointments
are
headlines
that
we
should
never
read
in
this
country.
The
recent
allegations
and
developments
regarding
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
are
appalling.
As
the
claims
continue
to
grow
over
the
failure
to
adequately
provide
health
care
services
to
our
veterans,
it
is
increasingly
clear
that
more
VA
officials
need
to
be
held
accountable.
While
the
Under
Secretary
of
Health
at
the
VA,
Dr.
Robert
Petzel,
announced
last
week
he
would
resign,
this
is
hardly
a
punishment,
as
he
already
announced
he
would
retire
later
this
year.
This
is
the
same
course
of
action
the
Administration
took
with
the
IRS
scandal,
and
people
are
tired
of
the
faux
accountability
that
continues
to
take
place.
Last
week,
I
joined
with
twenty-two
Texas
Members
of
Congress
in
calling
for
an
Inspector
General
investigation
into
VA
facilities
in
Texas .
According
to
media
reports,
employees
at
the
North
Central
Federal
Clinic
in
San
Antonio,
the
Austin
Veterans
Affairs
Outpatient
Clinic
and
Waco
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center
were
instructed
&#8211;
by
supervisors
&#8211;
to
ensure
that
wait
times
for
veterans
were
as
&#8220;close
to
zero
days
as
possible.&#8221;
An
employee
of
the
Veterans
Health
Administration,
who
recently
worked
at
all
three
clinics,
claims
that
staffers
falsely
logged
patients&#8217;
desired
appointment
dates
to
closely
coincide
with
appointment
openings.
But
in
reality,
veterans
were
left
waiting
for
months.
If
these
allegations
are
true
the
employees
involved
need
to
be
fired
immediately
as
well
as
the
leadership
who
gave
the
orders.
Today,
the
House
will
vote
on
H.R.
4031,
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act .
This
bipartisan
bill
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
the
authority
to
remove
employees
of
the
Senior
Executive
Service,
whose
performance
the
Secretary
believes
warrants
removal,
completely
from
the
government
service.
Simply
put,
our
veterans
deserve
better.
The
Administrations
needs
to
take
immediate
action
to
fix
the
problems
that
have
plagued
the
VA
for
too
long,
and
they
must
begin
by
firing
the
people
who
have
been
in
charge
while
these
inexcusable
actions
took
place.
