Honoring the Life of Jonah Edward
Kelley, Celebrating the Future
Jonah Edward
Kelley is an American hero and a son of West Virginia. While serving in
Germany in World War Two, Sergeant Kelley was awarded the Medal of
Honor for extraordinary courage under fire when he saved the lives of
his fellow soldiers while sacrificing his own. He gave his life so that
someone else could come home to America. They came back, they got
married, and they raised families.
The award named in his honor
was given for the 70 th
time on Thursday in Keyser, and I
had the honor of speaking to the students, community leaders, and
distinguished guests. It was a pleasure to witness the Keyser community
carrying on the legacy of a man who helped make America great and a
humbling experience to meet the nominees.

Working For Our
Seniors
Yesterday, my office
hosted a seniors summit
to discuss
the priorities for West Virginias senior citizens. Seniors in rural
areas face unique difficulties and it is important we discuss how to
overcome those hardships. Rural America is a place where those most in
need of services often have the fewest options. At yesterdays summit
we learned about how we can be more effective in ensuring West
Virginias seniors have a better quality of life.
We had a
productive discussion on Medicare, transportation, financial planning, and
many other issues facing rural seniors. Now, we will take what we learned
and apply those lessons to policies in Washington.
Skeptical of Iran Deal
After
extending the talks beyond the original deadline, President Obamas
negotiators reached the outline of a framework of a deal to be discussed
for three more months and announced then. Seriously.
The
announcement this week raises more questions than it answers
primarily,
how does this keep Iran from threatening its neighbors in the region,
especially our ally Israel, whom Iran says must be destroyed. I will
continue to push the President to include Congress and seek its
approval for any final deal.
Light It Up
Blue
As the grandfather of a special-needs child, April
2 nd
was an important day for me. World Autism Awareness Day is
led by Autism Speaks and does a wonderful job of raising awareness
about the challenges these families face. Head over to my

Historic Church Lost to Fire
This Easter Weekend,
please say an extra prayer for the parish of St. John Catholic Church
in Benwood. Early this week, the church caught fire and the blaze tore
through the storied building.
Though the parishioners have
been welcomed in at nearby parishes, this is a blow to the community.
Please keep them in your thoughts. Read coverage from the Wheeling
Intelligencer
here .
Have a blessed
Easter,
David McKinley
