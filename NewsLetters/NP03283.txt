Dear Neighbor,
We&rsquo;re only three weeks into the 114 th
Congress but America&rsquo;s New Congress is working hard to represent you, and make our great nation even better. This week we heard from President Obama about the State of our Union. I want to share with you my response to the President and his speech.
Responding to the State of the Union
President Obama missed a big opportunity to speak to the issues important to you, the people of the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes. Instead the President continued his divisive rhetoric that pits Americans against Americans. And there was no mention of an all-of-the-above energy policy that would benefit our New York manufacturers. The President did strike a hopeful tone on working with this congress to solve some of our most difficult issues. I welcome him to join America&rsquo;s New Congress in solving our nation&rsquo;s problems.
House Passes Legislation to Approve the Keystone Pipeline
Almost immediately after the 114 th
Congress was sworn in, we began what we came to Washington to do &ndash; fight for American jobs and energy. The House of Representatives
passed a bill
will require the executive branch to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline through the central U.S. This is another positive step forward on a critical infrastructure project that will create over 42,000 jobs that American consumers and workers will benefit from through lower energy costs and reliable, affordable North American energy.
House Passes Legislation to Protect the Homeland
Last week my colleagues and I
voted on legislation
to fund the Department of Homeland Security.
This bill increases funding for cybersecurity and Customs and Border Protection, while prohibiting funding from being used to enforce President Obama&rsquo;s unconstitutional Executive Order on immigration.
Protecting Social Security
The Social Security disability fund is projected to be insolvent in late 2016. I was pleased to co- sponsor a rule adopted by the House which protects Social Security retirement by prohibiting transferring funds from the Social Security retirement fund to the disability fund.
Raiding the retirement fund to pay for something it wasn&rsquo;t intended for is not fair to workers who have paid into the fund expecting it to be there when they retire. We must stop raiding the retirement fund - it isn't right and it isn't a solution.
It is disappointing to see the way some are mis characterizing what we are trying to do. This is NOT an attempt to cut disability benefits for the catastrophically disabled. We care about those who are truly disabled. Our goal is to preserve both the disability fund and Social Security retirement funds for those that depend on them.
This action will force us to find a solution which does NOT include simply placing more IOUs in the retirement fund. If we don't have the rule, we will never find a better solution.
We have to change the way they think in Washington: Retirees and the truly disabled deserve real long-term solutions to our fiscal problems, not short-term fixes which actually make the long-term problems worse.
