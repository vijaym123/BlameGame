Should the Veterans Benefits Administration hire more staff to process
the overwhelmingly large number of backlogged claims?
Yes - We must do anything we can to help our Veterans
Maybe - The Veterans Benefits Administration should find a way to
address the issue without hiring more paid staff
No - It will cost too much money

On Tuesday, I commemorated the 39th anniversary of the Fall of Saigon,
which is known as Black April in the Vietnamese American community. It
has been my honor to join with the Vietnamese American community of
Little Saigon in my district to remember this important event.
Thirty-nine years ago, millions of Vietnamese were forced to leave
their homeland for fear of persecution.
Many of those people found
their way to the United States, where today they comprise a strong,
vibrant community that has given invaluable contributions to our nation.
This week, we give pause to remember the brave sacrifices of so many in
the cause of freedom, who fought tirelessly to enable their children to
live a better and brighter life.
We must ensure that their sacrifices
were not in vain by continuing to fight for democracy and human rights
in Vietnam.

Highlights From My Community Coffee Event
I want to thank everyone who was able to make it to my Community Coffee
event last weekend at the Los Alamitos-Rossmoor Library. We had more
than 75 members of the community attend! It was so great to hear
everyone's thoughts and to discuss ways in which we can make the 47th
district better together.
President Obama's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders
Congratulations to Lian Cheun, the newest member of President Obama's
Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Lian Cheun is the Executive Director of Khmer Girls in Action (KGA) in
Long Beach and a resident of the 47th district. Before joining KGA, Ms.
Cheun worked for a number of organizations, including Asian Immigrant
Women Advocates and the Asian Migrant Center, which is based in Hong
Kong. From 2000 to 2002, Ms. Cheun served as an Early Academic
Opportunity Program college counselor at Skyline High School and
Castlemont High School in Oakland, CA. Ms. Cheun received the 2013
Panther Award from the California Reinvestment Coalition for her
efforts to help students organize for better health services and
student outcomes. Ms. Cheun received a B.A. from the University of
California at Berkeley and an M.P.A. from California State University,
Long Beach.

Ending the Veterans Claims Backlog
On Wednesday, I spoke on the House floor in support of an amendment to
H.R. 4486, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act for FY 2015, which would provide funding
for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to hire more staff to help
eliminate the national backlog of veterans' disability cases. Our
veterans have done their duty, now it is time for the government to do
its duty to assist them.
Please click here
or the picture above to watch my full speech
In California there is currently one congressional affairs analyst to
assist 33 congressional offices with questions about casework. This is
unacceptable!
There are delays in responses to congressional caseworkers, as well as
even longer delays in Aid and Attendance claims particularly with
regard to elderly, frail veterans with rapidly declining health issues
and approval sometimes comes too late.
Providing overtime pay for workers who are already stretched thin is a
step in the right direction, but it is not enough of a solution. That
is why I cosponsored an amendment that would encourage the Veterans
Benefits Administration hire more staff to address the claims backlog
and help our nation's veterans get assistance more quickly.
Our military doesn't leave our soldiers behind, and neither should our
government.
My Virtual Office Wins an Award
The Congressional Management Foundation (CMF), a nonprofit organization
that works directly with Members of Congress and staff to enhance their
operations and interactions with constituents, announced today that I
received a Gold Mouse Award for my congressional website
www.lowenthal.house.gov
. Only twelve Members of the House of Representatives
received a Gold Mouse Award, and I am honored to be the only freshman
Member so honored.
To put it in perspective, there are 441 House Members and my website
was one of only 12 websites to receive the top award. I believe that to
serve my constituents well, it is important that my office and my
website provide constituents with information about what's going on in
Congress and how my office can be helpful.
I think of my website as a virtual office. It allows me to hear from my
constituents, interact with them, and provide help and information in
many cases much quicker than through my physical offices. It is one of
the most critical tools at my disposal. I'm proud that CMF has
recognized the hard work that my office puts into keeping the website
fresh, friendly, and functional.

"En Bloc" and "Voice Vote"
This week, an amendment I cosponsored was passed successfully on the
House floor by a voice vote and was added to H.R. 4486, the Military
Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act for FY 2015.
Two things about this might be of interest to regular readers of
Congress U.
First, the amendment moved en bloc. This means that several amendments
to the same bill, in this case H.R.4486, are grouped together and voted
on as a package. This grouping is done by unanimous consent of the
House, typically by a voice vote.
A voice vote-the same mechanism used to pass my amendment-is just what
it sounds like: instead of an electronic vote, where the Members enter
a voting card into a machine to tally the votes, a voice vote is done
by calling for 'ayes' and 'nays' on the floor. Whoever the Speaker or
presiding Chairman of the House determines is in the audible majority-
the ayes or the nays-carries the vote.
Many House actions begin with a voice vote. While a voice vote is
recorded as an up-down vote with no details on who specifically voted
one way or the other on whatever was being decided, a provision in
House rules allows for any Member to request a recorded vote, in which
case the Members must record their votes by electronic device.
Now that more than three million Californians have enrolled in health
care coverage through Covered California or in Medi-Cal by April 15, do
you think Congress should keep voting to repeal or dismantle the
Affordable Care Act?
36.8%
Yes - The law is not working for the majority of Americans, and
Congress must continue to try to repeal or dismantle the Affordable
Care Act
4.6%
Maybe - Congress should repeal only some provisions of the
Affordable Care Act
55.2%
No - The law is working for the majority of Americans, and
Congress must instead work to make the law even better
3.4%

My
Virtual
Office
Wins
an
Award
The
Congressional

Foundation
(CMF),
a
nonprofit
organization
that
works
directly
with
Members
of
Congress
and
staff
to
enhance
their
operations
and
interactions
with
constituents,
announced
today
that
I
received
a
Gold
Mouse
Award
for
my
congressional
website
www.lowenthal.house.gov .
Only
twelve
Members
of
the
House
of
Representatives
received
a
Gold
Mouse
Award,
and
I
am
honored
to
be
the
only
freshman
Member
so
honored.
To
put
it
in
perspective,
there
are
441
House
Members
and
my
website
was
one
of
only
12
websites
to
receive
the
top
award.
I
believe
that
to
serve
my
constituents
well,
it
is
important
that
my
office
and
my
website
provide
constituents
with
information
about
what&#8217;s
going
on
in
Congress
and
how
my
office
can
be
helpful.
I
think
of
my
website
as
a
virtual
office.
It
allows
me
to
hear
from
my
constituents,
interact
with
them,
and
provide
help
and
information
in
many
cases
much
quicker
than
through
my
physical
offices.
It
is
one
of
the
most
critical
tools
at
my
disposal.
I&#8217;m
proud
that
CMF
has
recognized
the
hard
work
that
my
office
puts
into
keeping
the
website
fresh,
friendly,
and
functional.
