Dear Friends,
The House of
Representatives voted this week to pass the Save American Workers Act, which would
define a full-time employee as a person working 40 hours a week.
Obamacare redefined full-time employment as 30 hours a week, and employees
are finding their hours cut to less than 30 hours a week by businesses
unable to afford complying with Obamacare's mandate for full-time
employees. Full-time employees are becoming part-time employees because
of Obamacare, and American workers are losing working hours and
bringing home smaller paychecks.
Passing this bill will
help create jobs. One-half of small businesses recently surveyed
said they will either cut hours or full-time employees or
replace them with part-time employees. We need to make it
easier for businesses to hire full-time employees, not
harder. But the ACAs mandate and the administrations repeated
delays have only created more uncertainty for workers,
businesses, individuals and parents throughout this country.
In
practice, many of these workers will have to find two part-time
jobs to equal what they were bringing home. And balancing
two jobs means less time with your family, not to mention the
tremendous stress that folks will feel to have to go in this
direction, I said in a speech on the House floor before the
vote.

WV ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR
I had the privilege of meeting
this week with Wendy Bailey, assistant principal of the Ben Franklin
Career Center in Dunbar. Wendy was recently named the 2014 West Virginia
assistant principal of the year by the National Association of
Secondary School Principals. Congratulations, Wendy!
SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS
MONTH
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and
I spoke on the House floor Thursday during a special order to raise
awareness of this important issue.
Sexual assault can happen
to anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or religion. One in six
women in this country has been sexually assaulted, most by someone they
know.
College women have an even higher rate of sexual
victimization than most women in the United States. Our colleges and
universities can and must play an important role in stopping sexual
assault -- this must be a priority on every college campus in America. As a
mother of a daughter, the grandmother of a granddaughter, and also the
mother of two sons who were lucky enough to go to college, I want to
make sure that when they're on those college campuses that they're
safe and know how to get help.
Many of those affected by
sexual assault struggle with depression, alcohol or drug abuse, and even
thoughts of suicide. We have to make sure they know they are not to
blame, that help is available, and that so many people care about
them.
