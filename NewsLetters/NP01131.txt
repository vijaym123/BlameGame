You may have heard that in January of this year, President Obama issued an Executive Order to expand the definition of a floodplain and establish a new Federal Flood Risk Management Standard that must be used for any new construction, development, or substantial improvement to existing structures located in designated floodplain areas. Although the Administrations proposed Executive Order (EO) is in a public comment period until May 6, I am concerned that the lack of transparency regarding this EO and its implementation will ultimately lead to new, more costly, and burdensome regulations.
Recently, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to the Administration calling for more information regarding the development of this EO and raising concerns that the entire EO itself could be in direct violation of certain safeguards enacted to prevent such an action without proper analysis under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2015, H.R. 83. This legislation, which the President signed into law, prohibits the Administration from implementing new standards until it has solicited and considered input from governors, mayors, and other stakeholders. To date, though, there has been no public disclosure of the stakeholders who were consulted, the types of alternatives considered, or any type of cost-benefit analysis.
The letter I signed, which you can read
here , requests the President to submit this information to Congress as is required under current law.
Transparency and clarity in this process are important. While it is true some regulations are necessary and beneficial, an examination and analyses of these rules is vital to ensuring that the federal government is not overstepping its bounds. I will keep you posted on the Administrations response.
Yours in service,
Randy
