In 2015, I have no higher priority than continuing my fight to support our men and women in uniform, and to protect our national security. Its not just a duty, its an honor.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. Supporting our American heroes once they return home isnt optional
it is this nations moral obligation. Thats why Im pleased the House passed Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22) this week, with my support, and its now heading over to the Senate for consideration.
