Rep. Bob Goodlatte
House Permanently Bans Internet Access Tax
On Tuesday, the House
of Representatives passed the
Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act . I was proud to introduce this necessary measure to keep Internet access
free of taxation. This
permanent ban
is crucial for protecting
access and opportunity for Americans in our growing digital economy. I urge the Senate to act on this vital legislation before the November 1st
deadline. You might also be interested in a piece I wrote about why this bill is important for innovation in
The Hill
newspaper this week -

Protecting the Balance of Powers
Over the past several years, we have seen the
Obama Administration repeatedly circumvent Congress and ignore the law.
The President has been unapologetic in announcing that he would use his pen
and his phone to act where Congress would not, instead of seeking legislation from America&rsquo;s elected representatives.
The White House&rsquo;s continued actions are in direct conflict with the carefully crafted
balance of powers found in the United States Constitution, and the House of Representatives is preparing to take action to hold the Administration
accountable and stop these abuses.
In the coming weeks, the House will vote on a resolution authorizing a lawsuit against President Obama. This
lawsuit is about ensuring that the voices of our constituents are heard through the legislative process, instead of being stifled by presidential
power grabs.

A Bill to Help Stop the Border
Crisis
Since President Obama has
refused to take actions to stop illegal crossings at our southern border, this week I joined Congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah to introduce the
Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act
( H.R. 5137 )
to stop the surge of children, teenagers, and families from Central America seeking to enter the United States illegally. The bill ends many of the
Obama Administration&rsquo;s policies that encourage Central Americans to come to the United States, such as weak standards for asylum claims that
enable the Administration&rsquo;s rubberstamping of fraudulent applications and policies that prevent Border Patrol agents from accessing federal
lands along the border. Additionally, the bill makes targeted changes to current law, which has worsened the crisis at the border.
