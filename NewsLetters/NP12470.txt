Congress Helps Prevent Wildfires
Dear Friend,
This was a big week for rural Arizona. We had two legislative victories
that will create jobs and boost economic activity for rural Arizonans.
First, President Obama signed the Farm Bill into law on Friday.
Although I voted against that bill for several reasons
, I was
pleased that it included most of my Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention
Act, which is now law.
When it comes to wildfires, 2013 wasn't a good year, which is why I'm
especially proud that the majority of my bill was signed into law.
Arizona and the nation has suffered loss of life, loss of habitat and
loss of resources as a result of recurring catastrophic wildfires. It
took years but now good forest-management practices recognize that
healthy forests must be thinned and managed in order to avoid tragedies.
Although we are never going to prevent all fires, this legislation will
help make wildfires less frequent, and less intense when they do occur.
Moreover, these provisions allow tax dollars to be spent more
effectively by focusing on prevention as opposed to suppression, which
is significantly more costly.
While this legislation is a great start, we still must pass other
important provisions of my bill that weren't included in the Farm Bill.
These include provisions in a House-passed forest health package that
will provide critical revenues for education in rural communities and
allow for active forest management on a larger scale. I urge my
colleagues in the Senate to help prevent another catastrophic wildfire
season by acting swiftly to pass this legislation. Click HERE

More Grand Canyon Flights
Second, I was thrilled by the FAA's decision to allow additional quiet
flights over the Grand Canyon by aircraft using quiet technology. This
commonsense decision will create good-paying jobs and boost economic
activity in an extremely rural area.
By recognizing quiet flight technology improvements, the FAA has given
us an example of a federal agency using evidence-based decision making.
Now, more of Arizona's visitors get to experience the beauty of this
natural treasure through unique aerial tours. As a result of the FAA's
decision, we are accomplishing two important goals: keeping noise in
the Canyon to a minimum while growing this critical sector of our
economy.
One of my bills that was enacted into law during the previous Congress,
the Grand Canyon Tourism Jobs Protection Act of 2012, paved the way for
this FAA decision. I'm honored that my bill can contribute to Arizona's
economy. Click HERE

These aren't Just Statistics, These are People
The Obama Administration is responsible for a workforce reduction of
2.5 million people. On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook for 2014-2024,
which projects that ObamaCare will reduce the number of full-time
workers by approximately 2.5 million people.
Apparently the President believes these people are just collateral
damage to his larger agenda. But these aren't just statistics, these
are real people, with real families and real lives. These are
middle-class families who are struggling to make ends meet.
This massive job contraction is absolutely tragic, especially because
it was as predictable as it was preventable. From day one, many of my
Republican colleagues and I spoke out against the disaster that is
ObamaCare. Now it's more urgent than ever that we repeal and, most
importantly, replace ObamaCare with a patient-centered, free-market
alternative, such as the American Health Care Reform Act. Click HERE

More Bad News
January's jobs numbers were released on Friday and, unfortunately,
brought us more bad news. Only 113,000 jobs were added to the economy
in January after an abysmal 75,000 jobs were added in December, making
the last two months the worst for job creation since 2012.
Additionally, the labor-force participation rate, which represents the
employment rate of adults who are able to work, continues to hover
around only 63%, the lowest rate in 35 years.
One way that President Obama can help boost our economy right now is to
approve the Keystone-XL Pipeline, which would create 2,000 jobs and
support 40,000 more. This is a no-brainer but the President has so far
only delayed this decision in order to appease the environmental
lobbyists.
Increasing Your Access to Our Public Lands
On Thursday, I voted in favor of the Public Access and Lands
Improvement Act, a package of 10 bills aimed at increasing and
preserving public access to federal lands, facilitating responsible
economic development and encouraging transparent land management.
This legislation cuts red tape that prevents tourism and economic
development on public lands as well as increases public access to
important recreation and conservation areas. This important bill
provides greater certainty to ranchers and farmers by increasing the
length of new grazing permits on public lands and streamlines the
actual grazing permitting process.
The package is also good for our environment and good for small
businesses, as the expedited removal of salvageable timber will greatly
benefit the forest products industry and also reduce the threats of
dangerous wildfires. This legislation is a great start to long overdue
public lands reform. Click HERE

Keeping the Pressure On
On Thursday, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, of
which I am a member, held a hearing investigating the IRS targeting of
conservative groups. I will keep putting pressure on the Obama
Administration so that we can finally uncover the whole truth about
this violation of our basic Constitutional rights. Click HERE

Government Waste of the Week
$3.5 million: the cost to install solar panels at Manchester-Boston
Airport that had to be covered up because their glare was blinding
pilots and air traffic controllers.
Congressional District 4: Did you Know?
La Paz, Arizona is a ghost town in present-day La Paz County. It was
settled in 1862 along the Colorado River and was a gold mining town. It
was the location of the westernmost incident of the Civil War, called
the La Paz incident, in which a local Confederate militiaman attacked
and killed 2 Union soldiers.

Congress
Helps
Prevent
Wildfires
Dear
Friend,
This was
a
big
week
for
rural
Arizona.
We
had
two
legislative
victories
that
will
create
jobs
and
boost
economic
activity
for
rural
Arizonans.
First,
President
Obama
signed
the
Farm
Bill
into
law
on
Friday.
Although
I
voted
against
that
bill
for
several
reasons , I was
pleased
that
it
included most
of
my
Catastrophic
Wildfire
Prevention
Act,
which
is
now
law.
When
it
comes
to
wildfires,
2013
wasn't
a
good
year,
which
is
why
I&#8217;m
especially
proud
that
the
majority
of
my
bill
was
signed
into
law.
Arizona
and
the
nation
has
suffered
loss
of
life,
loss
of
habitat
and
loss
of
resources
as
a
result
of
recurring
catastrophic
wildfires.
It
took
years
but
now
good
forest-management
practices
recognize
that
healthy
forests
must
be
thinned
and
managed
in
order
to
avoid
tragedies.
Although
we
are
never
going
to
prevent
all
fires,
this
legislation
will
help
make
wildfires
less
frequent,
and
less
intense
when
they
do
occur.
Moreover,
these
provisions
allow
tax
dollars
to
be
spent
more
effectively
by
focusing
on
prevention
as
opposed
to
suppression,
which
is
significantly
more
costly.
While
this
legislation
is
a
great
start,
we
still
must
pass
other
important
provisions
of
my
bill
that
weren&#8217;t
included
in
the
Farm
Bill.
These
include
provisions
in
a
House-passed
forest
health
package
that
will
provide
critical
revenues
for
education
in
rural
communities
and
allow
for
active
forest
management
on
a
larger
scale.
I
urge
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
help
prevent
another
catastrophic
wildfire
season
by
acting
swiftly
to
pass
this
legislation.

More Grand
Canyon
Flights
Second,
I
was
thrilled by
the
FAA's
decision
to
allow
additional
quiet
flights
over
the
Grand
Canyon
by
aircraft
using
quiet
technology.
This
commonsense
decision
will
create
good-paying
jobs
and
boost
economic
activity
in
an
extremely
rural
area.
By
recognizing
quiet
flight
technology
improvements,
the
FAA
has
given
us
an
example
of
a
federal
agency
using
evidence-based
decision
making.
Now,
more
of
Arizona's
visitors
get
to
experience
the
beauty
of
this
natural
treasure
through
unique
aerial
tours.
As
a
result
of
the
FAA's
decision,
we
are
accomplishing
two
important
goals:
keeping
noise
in
the
Canyon
to
a
minimum
while
growing
this
critical
sector
of
our
economy.
One
of my
bills
that
was
enacted
into
law
during
the
previous
Congress,
the
Grand
Canyon
Tourism
Jobs
Protection
Act
of
2012,
paved
the
way
for
this
FAA
decision.
I'm honored
that
my
bill
can
contribute
to
Arizona's
economy.

This

increases

This

The

I
