Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Women's Conference on Friday
On Friday, I will host the
Sixth District's Women's Conference in Roanoke at Virginia Western Community College's Whitman Theater. The event will kick off at 8AM with a Resource
Fair featuring several local organizations and opportunities. At 9AM, the program will begin with Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri as the keynote
speaker. I look forward to hearing her message. A great
line-up
of speakers and panelists is planned throughout the morning. You can find more information at
Goodlatte.House.Gov .
You can also register
online now
or upon arrival at the event on
Friday.
I look forward to seeing you there.
Please feel free to pass this information along to family and friends who may be interested. If you have any questions about the event on Friday,
don't hesitate to give my Roanoke office a call at 540-857-2672.
