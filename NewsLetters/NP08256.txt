Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter; it has been a busy week
in Washington as we work to tackle the issues at the VA, significant
portions of my SKILLS Act passed the Senate, and the Supreme Court
unanimously rejected President Obama's attempts to stack the deck at
the NLRB.
Pushing for Answers from the VA
Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson
demanding answers about all 13 South Carolina facilities. As the Obama
Administration has failed to provide answers to my questions regarding
secret waiting lists, employee bonuses and other important parts of
this scandal, I now plan to directly ask the South Carolina's VA
medical centers
and community based
outpatient clinics the questions Washington, D.C. has neglected to
answer.
I hope that each facility will be more forthcoming and transparent
about their processes, wait times and the scheduling challenges they
are facing. I'll continue to press the Obama Administration and the
Department of Veterans Affa
irs for answers because
getting to the bottom of the problems facing the VA system is vital to
ensuring our veterans and families receive the care they have earned.
Creating a More Efficient Workforce Development System
This week the Senate passed the bipartisan agreement on the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act
, which contains several key
components of my SKILLS Act - an important piece of my Opportunity
Agenda. I am very pleased the Senate moved forward in transforming our
nation's broken workforce development and training system
With the inclusion of several key components of my SKILLS Act
, those looking for work and job
training will have easier access to a more efficient workforce
development system - an essential step to competing in the global 21st
century economy. This agreement is the result of a true commitment by
both parties and both chambers to reform our workforce development
system, and will help ensure American competitiveness and reform the
current outdated system.
Unanimous Rejection by the Supreme Court
Yesterday, the Supreme Court's decided that President Obama's recess
appointments to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) in 2012 were
unconstitutional. The Court's decision is a positive step forward for
hardworking American families - we've seen firsthand in South Carolina
what happens when the NLRB acts as a partisan weapon.
As I have said from the beginning, President Obama's attempt to stack
the deck at the NLRB is unconstitutional. This administration's efforts
to turn the NLRB into a pro-union, anti-business clearinghouse has made
it that much harder for our economy to turn the corner and more
difficult for folks to get back to work.
I sat down with Greta Van Susteren last night to discuss this, you can
