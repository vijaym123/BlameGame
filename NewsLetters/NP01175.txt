David -- In the last week:
President Obama emailed you
Vice President Biden emailed you
Senator Elizabeth Warren emailed you
Why are all these top Democrats emailing? Because we have just 3 hours before midnight -- our biggest FEC deadline yet.
If supporters like you don&rsquo;t pitch in the $32,000 we still need, we&rsquo;ll be CRUSHED by the Republican money machine!
We don&rsquo;t have the GOP&rsquo;s six-figure donors. We rely on grassroots donors like YOU to give Democrats a chance.
Will you pitch in by the FEC deadline in 3 hours? TRIPLE-MATCH in effect until midnight!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
