In case you missed it, Im proud to be an original cosponsor on an important bill prohibiting the federal government (or any state receiving certain federal funding) from discriminating against child protective service providers who adhere to sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions. Take a look at
H.R. 1299 .
Faith-based providers and organizations play a big role in administering adoption, foster care, and other services that provide care for some of our communitys most vulnerable children.
These organizations' valuable contributions, and the families and children who benefit from them, should not be limited because of their beliefs . Additionally, all participants in both the foster care and adoption systems gain from having variety of service options to choose from to best accommodate their financial, spiritual, and emotional needs.
That's why I am working to make sure faith-based providers and individuals are able to continue to serve along with other agencies and organizations, to care for children and provide adoptive and foster parents with access to a diversity of providers.
Yours in service,
Randy
