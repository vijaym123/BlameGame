Dear Friend,
Nothing is more important to me than communicating effectively with my
constituents and serving their interests, which is why I'm proud to
announce the launch of my new official website at fincher.house.gov
. This new website is a huge
improvement over the previous one, making it easier for 8th
Congressional District residents to stay up-to-date with the work I am
doing both in the district and in Washington.
Designed with more prominent menus that are easier to navigate, the
site is chock-full of useful information that will help answer your
questions and give you easy access to available constituent services.
In addition to the new website launch, I've also revamped my
e-newsletter program to help keep you informed on the happenings in
Washington and the district.
Go and check it out, and be sure to sign up for my e-newsletter
in the top right corner while you're
there, for updates on what I'm doing in Washington.
Then, forward this email to five or more of your friends, coworkers or
neighbors and encourage them to sign-up on the website for email
updates too!
Have a great weekend,
Stephen Fincher
