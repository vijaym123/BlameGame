Dear
Friend,
The Revolutionary War was fought for ideals embedded in the very
fabric of our nation. Guided by principles of liberty and the right
of a people to be free from tyranny and to choose their own destiny,
these ideals fueled the Boston Tea Party and the heroics of the
Minutemen at Lexington and Concord. It is why the Continental Congress, seeing
the threat to liberty posed to all the colonies, formed the
Continental Army with men from all over, including communities right here in
Southwestern Pennsylvania, to fight not as colonists, but as
Americans.
Benjamin Franklin said, Where liberty dwells, there is
my country. It remains true this day, and never more so than in
Southwestern Pennsylvania. As I travel from town to town across our region
this Fourth of July, I hope to see you and your family
celebrating our nation's independence. Let's reaffirm our commitment
to the noble principle that all men are created equal and "endowed by
their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."
Sincerely,
Tim
Murphy
Member of Congress
