Dear Friend,
&#8220;A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221; - Second Amendment, The Constitution of United States
When I was sworn into office to represent Missouri&#39;s Eighth Congressional District in the House of Representatives, I took an oath to uphold the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The federal government should not compromise the ability of decent Americans to own a gun for protection or sport. Recently, Secretary of State John Kerry signed the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty on behalf of the Obama Administration. The treaty clearly violates the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The Arms Trade Treaty threatens our Second Amendment rights by including firearms owned by law-abiding citizens in its jurisdiction. The treaty urges record keeping of firearm sales and transfers for a minimum of ten years. Data kept on imported firearms is a de-facto registry of law-abiding firearms owners, which is a violation of federal law. Even worse, the Arms Trade Treaty could be construed to require such a registry to be made available to foreign governments.
To make my opposition to the Arms Trade Treaty known, I have joined a bipartisan group of 180 House members in sending a letter to President Obama raising our concerns. This letter makes it absolutely clear to President Obama and his administration that the House of Representatives will not support legislation to give this dangerous treaty the legs it needs to take effect. I will also oppose any efforts by Obama Administration to implement or enforce the Arms Trade Treaty through executive action. The liberty of the American people and the independence of the United States are far too sacred to ever be sacrificed to a dysfunctional global institution like the United Nations.
Since the founding of our country, &#8220;the right to keep and bear arms&#8221; has been a part of our nation&#39;s fabric. The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty violates the Second Amendment of the Constitution and I will continue speaking out against its implementation. The rights of law-abiding Americans to own firearms must be preserved.
This Week&#39;s Highlights
Next week, the National Park Service will begin holding public meetings on its ridiculous plan to limit recreational activity on the Ozark National Scenic Riverways in Missouri's 8th District. I urge folks throughout our district to attend public meetings in Van Buren, Salem and Kirkwood to show opposition to the Park Service's attempts to restrict our access to the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.

On November 26, I welcomed House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to Cape Girardeau to discuss the harmful impact Obamacare is having on families, individuals and small businesses in Missouri's Eighth District. It was an honor to welcome Leader Cantor to Missouri and to stand with him in opposing ObamaCare.
I was honored to record a Christmas greeting this week for our troops serving overseas. Members of our military and their families make extraordinary sacrifices for our freedoms. I want to wish them all a very Merry Christmas!
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
