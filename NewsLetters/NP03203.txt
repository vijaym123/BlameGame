Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
January 23, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week was filled with hours of debate and two dozen votes on
amendments to the Keystone XL pipeline legislation that is currently
being considered in the U.S. Senate. It may seem that this is exactly
how the Senate should operate, but when you consider the fact that
we've held more roll call votes in the first three weeks of this year
than we did under the Democrat-led Senate in all of 2014, you can see
that the new Senate Republican majority is keeping our promises to make
the Senate function as it should.
As I mentioned, the bill under consideration was S.1, legislation to
approve the KeystoneXL pipeline, of which I am a co-sponsor
. We expect to finish voting on amendments to the legislation on
Monday and I look forward to a final vote on approval soon.
First VA Hearing as Chair
On Wednesday, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, under my
chairmanship, passed unanimously a bill that would improve mental
health care and suicide prevention resources for American service
members.
The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was passed
during the first official meeting of the Senate VA Committee for the
114th Congress. It passed the U.S. House on Jan. 12, 2015, and will now
proceed to the full Senate floor for consideration.
When you have 8,000 veterans a year committing suicide - which is more
veterans than have died in all of Iraq and all of Afghanistan since
we've been fighting - then you have a serious problem and this is
emergency legislation that we need to pass to help our veterans. I hope
that it will be passed by the Senate and quickly signed into law by the
president.
I also announced that our next Senate VA meeting will be a field
hearing in February at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington
with VA Secretary Robert McDonald and other department
employees. I look forward to at least two site visits to VA facilities
around the country where there have been serious problems with wait
times for veterans seeking health care or serious problems with
construction costs overruns, as well.
The problems at the VA stem from a case of 'out of sight, out of mind.'
If VA understands we are going to be conducting true oversight and come
out to them, then employees and veterans will understand we are serious
about the Veterans Choice Act legislation signed into law last year and
we will all be better for it.
State of the Union
On Tuesday, President Obama delivered the annual State of the Union
address to the nation.
I was very disappointed the president chose to lower expectation and
announce a plan to raise taxes on the American people just at a time
when we are beginning to recover. His plan is like pouring cold water
on small businesses and employers. It is time to lift overly burdensome
regulation and have a tax policy that's fair and equitable to all
Americans.
I'm also disappointed there wasn't much of a talk about foreign trade
and about trade promotion authority from the president which Congress
needs to act on quickly. We have three pending trade agreements, which
are important for American business: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the African Growth
and Opportunity Partnership. All need to be reauthorized or initiated,
and they need to be done this year.
I am happy the president mentioned cybersecurity, which is the number
one threat to our country and I pledge to work with him to find those
ways we can to track those who would come to America and do harm to our
people.
Obamacare Health Insurance Tax Repeal
I recently co-sponsored the Jobs and Premium Protection Act which would
eliminate the hidden, unfair and punitive tax within the Obamacare law
that is placed on every individual, family and small business
purchasing health insurance.
Specifically, this legislation amends the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act by eliminating the health insurance tax, an annual
fee on health insurance plans enacted by the health care law.
With the Jobs and Premium Protection Act, we are seeking to eliminate
another burdensome tax
on American small businesses,
families and seniors that is raising costs for every American with
health insurance. Under Obamacare, you're taxed if you don't have
health insurance and you're also taxed if you do have health insurance.
As we work toward the goal of repealing and replacing this entire law,
we must immediately address the damage that individual provisions such
as the health insurance tax are already inflicting on our economy.
Reining in Burdensome Regulations
Congress should be required to 'check' regulatory agencies and the
executive branch to ensure they adhere to the intent and spirit of laws
passed by Congress. That way we can prevent them from imposing costly,
job-killing overly burdensome regulations on America's families,
businesses and local governments before those regulations cause more
harm than good.
That's why I co-sponsored another piece of legislation on Thursday to
prevent the executive branch and federal agencies from unilaterally
imposing burdensome, costly regulations on America's families,
businesses and local governments.
The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, or
REINS Act, was introduced by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and would impose
tough restrictions on unelected bureaucrats in federal agencies who
write rules and regulations needed to carry out laws passed by Congress
. Under the
REINS Act, Congress would be required to take an up-or-down vote on
every new major rule proposed by the executive branch before it could
be implemented. The bill defines a major rule as one that is designated
by the White House Office of Management and Budget as having an impact
of $100 million or more.
In Other News
On Monday, I was glad to again attend the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Annual Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. It
has become atradition for me to attend this important service to honor
the life and legacy of Reverend King. You can read my full remarks here
or wat
ch them online
. I also spoke with host Chris Beckham at WVGA radio in
Valdosta, Ga., about many of the issues addressed in this newsletter,
met with Mayor Hardie Davis of Augusta, Ga., and
Brookhaven, Ga., Mayor J. Max Davis. And special
kudos to the great group of Georgia high school students that Sen.
David Perdue, R-Ga., and I met with on the snowy Capitol steps on
Wednesday.
Also, Georgians working and living in or near Oconee County, you have
an opportunity to meet with two of my representatives in the state next
Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2015, in the Grand Jury Room of the Oconee County
Courthouse, located at 23 North Main Street in Watkinsville, Ga. 30677
from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. Come out during your lunch break and make
sure they hear your concerns. I use these "open office day"
opportunities to help ensure that your views and concerns are reflected
in the operation of my office. Look out for more opportunities coming
up around the state soon
!
What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will continue debate on S.1, the KeystoneXL
pipeline bill.

Dear
Friends,
This
week
was
filled
with
hours
of
debate
and
two
dozen
votes
on
amendments
to
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
legislation
that
is
currently
being
considered
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
It
may
seem
that
this
is
exactly
how
the
Senate
should
operate,
but
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
we've
held
more
roll
call
votes
in
the
first
three
weeks
of
this
year
than
we
did
under
the
Democrat-led
Senate
in
all
of
2014,
you
can
see
that
the
new
Senate
Republican
majority
is
keeping
our
promises
to
make
the
Senate
function
as
it
should.
As
I
mentioned,
the
bill
under
consideration
was
S.1,
legislation
to
approve
the
KeystoneXL
pipeline,
of
which
I
am
a
co-sponsor .
We
expect
to
finish
voting
on
amendments
to
the
legislation
on
Monday
and
I
look
forward
to
a
final
vote
on
approval
soon.
First
VA
Hearing
as
Chair
On
Wednesday,
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee,
under
my
chairmanship,
passed
unanimously
a
bill
that
would
improve
mental
health
care
and
suicide
prevention
resources
for
American
service
members.
The
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act
was
passed
during
the
first
official
meeting
of
the
Senate
VA
Committee
for
the
114th
Congress.
It
passed
the
U.S.
House
on
Jan.
12,
2015,
and
will
now
proceed
to
the
full
Senate
floor
for
consideration.
When
you
have
8,000
veterans
a
year
committing
suicide
&ndash;
which
is
more
veterans
than
have
died
in
all
of
Iraq
and
all
of
Afghanistan
since
we've
been
fighting
&ndash;
then
you
have
a
serious
problem
and
this
is
emergency
legislation
that
we
need
to
pass
to
help
our
veterans.
I
hope
that
it
will
be
passed
by
the
Senate
and
quickly
signed
into
law
by
the
president.
I
also
announced
that
our
next
Senate
VA
meeting
will
be
a
field
hearing
in
February
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
in
Washington
with
VA
Secretary
Robert
McDonald
and
other
department
employees.
I
look
forward
to
at
least
two
site
visits
to
VA
facilities
around
the
country
where
there
have
been
serious
problems
with
wait
times
for
veterans
seeking
health
care
or
serious
problems
with
construction
costs
overruns,
as
well.
The
problems
at
the
VA
stem
from
a
case
of
'out
of
sight,
out
of
mind.'
If
VA
understands
we
are
going
to
be
conducting
true
oversight
and
come
out
to
them,
then
employees
and
veterans
will
understand
we
are
serious
about
the
Veterans
Choice
Act
legislation
signed
into
law
last
year
and
we
will
all
be
better
for
it.
State
of
the
Union
On
Tuesday,
President
Obama
delivered
the
annual
State
of
the
Union
address
to
the
nation.
I
was
very
disappointed
the
president
chose
to
lower
expectation
and
announce
a
plan
to
raise
taxes
on
the
American
people
just
at
a
time
when
we
are
beginning
to
recover.
His
plan
is
like
pouring
cold
water
on
small
businesses
and
employers.
It
is
time
to
lift
overly
burdensome
regulation
and
have
a
tax
policy
that's
fair
and
equitable
to
all
Americans.
I'm
also
disappointed
there
wasn't
much
of
a
talk
about
foreign
trade
and
about
trade
promotion
authority
from
the
president
which
Congress
needs
to
act
on
quickly.
We
have
three
pending
trade
agreements,
which
are
important
for
American
business:
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership,
the
Transatlantic
Trade
and
Investment
Partnership
and
the
African
Growth
and
Opportunity
Partnership.
All
need
to
be
reauthorized
or
initiated,
and
they
need
to
be
done
this
year.
I
am
happy
the
president
mentioned
cybersecurity,
which
is
the
number
one
threat
to
our
country
and
I
pledge
to
work
with
him
to
find
those
ways
we
can
to
track
those
who
would
come
to
America
and
do
harm
to
our
people.
Obamacare
Health
Insurance
Tax
Repeal
I
recently
co-sponsored
the
Jobs
and
Premium
Protection
Act
which
would
eliminate
the
hidden,
unfair
and
punitive
tax
within
the
Obamacare
law
that
is
placed
on
every
individual,
family
and
small
business
purchasing
health
insurance.
Specifically,
this
legislation
amends
the
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act
by
eliminating
the
health
insurance
tax,
an
annual
fee
on
health
insurance
plans
enacted
by
the
health
care
law.
With
the
Jobs
and
Premium
Protection
Act ,
we
are
seeking
to
eliminate
another
burdensome
tax
on
American
small
businesses,
families
and
seniors
that
is
raising
costs
for
every
American
with
health
insurance.
Under
Obamacare,
you're
taxed
if
you
don't
have
health
insurance
and
you're
also
taxed
if
you
do
have
health
insurance.
As
we
work
toward
the
goal
of
repealing
and
replacing
this
entire
law,
we
must
immediately
address
the
damage
that
individual
provisions
such
as
the
health
insurance
tax
are
already
inflicting
on
our
economy.
Reining
in
Burdensome
Regulations
Congress
should
be
required
to
'check'
regulatory
agencies
and
the
executive
branch
to
ensure
they
adhere
to
the
intent
and
spirit
of
laws
passed
by
Congress.
That
way
we
can
prevent
them
from
imposing
costly,
job-killing
overly
burdensome
regulations
on
America's
families,
businesses
and
local
governments
before
those
regulations
cause
more
harm
than
good.
That's
why
I
co-sponsored
another
piece
of
legislation
on
Thursday
to
prevent
the
executive
branch
and
federal
agencies
from
unilaterally
imposing
burdensome,
costly
regulations
on
America's
families,
businesses
and
local
governments.
The
Regulations
from
the
Executive
in
Need
of
Scrutiny
Act
of
2015 ,
or
REINS
Act ,
was
introduced
by
Sen.
Rand
Paul,
R-Ky.,
and
would
impose
tough
restrictions
on
unelected
bureaucrats
in
federal
agencies
who
write
rules
and
regulations
needed
to
carry
out
laws
passed
by
Congress .
Under
the
REINS
Act ,
Congress
would
be
required
to
take
an
up-or-down
vote
on
every
new
major
rule
proposed
by
the
executive
branch
before
it
could
be
implemented.
The
bill
defines
a
major
rule
as
one
that
is
designated
by
the
White
House
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
as
having
an
impact
of
$100
million
or
more.
