CNN: Boehner Marks Cheri as a TOP 2016 Target
David -- Boehner just announced he&rsquo;s going ALL IN to defeat Cheri in 2016.
We can&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re too surprised.
Republicans love going after leaders who actually listen to the middle class and fight on behalf of the people they represent
-- not special interests.
The GOP feels threatened by Cheri, and they&rsquo;re going to stop at nothing to try to beat her. We can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Will you add your name to stand with Cheri at this critical moment?
Last election, Boehner&rsquo;s outside group spent over $6.5 MILLION to defeat Illinois Democrats. In 2016 it could be
even more.
We must be prepared. Will you commit to standing with our campaign by midnight tonight? http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-Back
Thanks,
Team Bustos
