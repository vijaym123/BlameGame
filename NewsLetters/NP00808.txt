VISITING DC
May 11, 2015
On Sunday, I
joined ABCs Martha Raddatz on This Week and we discussed the Islamic
States threat to the United States and the expiration of the Patriot
Acts data collection provision at the end of the month.
While
speaking about the renewal of the Patriot Act, I noted that "I do think
it [Patriot Act] should continue for the simple reason it's very
effective at keeping America safe. Watch my full interview by clicking
below.

Burr joins ABC's "This Week"
Sundays interview also
addressed the Islamic States sobering announcement that they have over
seventy trained soldiers in the United States waiting for the
opportunity to attack Americans. In a few more days, one of our nations most
successful tools against terrorism is set to expire, the Patriot Act.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and I recently introduced a bill
that would keep the Patriot Act up and running for about five more
years. Last week, I took to the floor with other members of the Senate to
talk about why the Patriot Act is so important:
Why in the
world would we think about rolling back the tools that are
the only tools that put us post-9/11 versus pre-9/11? The
threat is greater today domestically and around the world than
it's ever been, and the argument that [Congress] will
be consumed with is whether we do away with tools that have
been effective for law enforcement to protect America. Madam
president, I would suggest that we reauthorize this bill for five
and a half years, as is. And that we make the
same commitment to the American people we do when we reauthorize and
fund the T.S.Awe're going to keep America safe. We're not
going to let it revert back to where we're susceptible to
another 9/11.
Our goal should not be limiting the tools that
our law enforcement and intelligence community have access to but
protecting American lives. You can watch my full comments below.
Were here today
with a choice. The choice is whether we're going to reauthorize this
program that has been very, very effective It's my choice to continue the
program because the program has worked.
Chairman
Burr
Wall Street Journal editorial board came out in support of a clean
authorization of the Patriot Act last week which can be read
here .
Wednesday, Senator Tillis and I introduced
the Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act, a bill to provide for the
responsible management of the wild-horse population around Corolla, North
Carolina and the Outer Banks. The beauty of the Corolla horses draws
people from across North Carolina to witness these wild animals in their
natural habitat. They are one of our many natural state treasures and
I am proud to introduce legislation that will provide for their
preservation. You can read more about the Corolla Wild Horses Protection
Act,
here .
Lastweek, Senator Bennet and I
introduced legislation that would fix current federal policy that keeps
Medicare patients from receiving the most-cutting-edge medical
technologies. This relatively simple bill will help seniors and veterans get
new technologies that will enable them to heal faster so that they
can enjoy a better quality of life. Read about the specifics of the bill
here .
Earlier in May, a ceremony was
held at the Arlington National Cemetery honoring the Montagnards, along
with the unveiling of a new memorial commemorating their service and
sacrifice. The Montagnards are an indigenous people from Vietnam who
fought bravely alongside American vets during the Vietnam War but have
received little to no recognition until
recently .
At
the ceremony honoring the Montagnards.
North Carolina is home
to the largest Montagnard community outside of Vietnam and our state is
made better by their presence. You can read more about the
Montagnards and their memorial in the
Winston-Salem
Journal .
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
