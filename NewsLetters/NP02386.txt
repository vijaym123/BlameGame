LEGISLATION
March 08, 2015
Dear
David,
This past week, the House passed
H.R. 240 , a measure to fund the Department of Homeland
Security through September. I was one of 167 members to vote against
the "clean" measure. I could not in good conscious vote for a bill
that allows the Presidents immigration plan to move forward. There is
nothing clean about this bill. For it to be clean, it would not include
radical changes to our nations immigration system, such as those the
President is attempting to enact outside of our laws. The President
has said 22 times that he lacks the power to change the law without
working with Congress, and yet his immigration plan would do just that by
giving legal status to millions who entered the country
illegally.
I am continuing to support legislation to bring lasting reform
and relief to California. Below I have included some highlights from
DC and our district. To learn about how I can serve you and to follow
me throughout the week, please visit
my website
and stay in touch with me on
my Facebook page .
Sincerely,
This illustration from the
California Department of Water Resources

As California faces its fourth year
of drought, the need for long-term water storage is apparent. On
February 25th, I introduced legislation to speed up the commencement of
construction of the widely supported and much-needed Sites Reservoir.
Located in Colusa and Glenn counties, Sites Reservoir is a proposed
off-stream reservoir that would store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water,
generating an
additional 900,000
acre feet of water
during droughts for cities, agriculture, and the
environment.
H.R. 1060
cosponsored by Representative Garamendi
would accelerate the completion of a
feasibility study of Sites Reservoir, and authorize construction of
the project should it be found feasible. Two-thirds of Californians
voted to invest in new surface storage projects like Sites Reservoir. It
is time to fulfill the promises made to voters, and it is time to
bring drought relief to California.

In the wake of VA
scandals in California and across the nation, the House passed two measures
last week to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs.
HR 280
would authorize the VA secretary to
recoup bonuses for VA employees, granting the ability to rescind bonuses
awarded to employees under false pretenses or based on fabricated
performance data. The second measure,
HR
294 , allocates funds towards long-term care in foster health
facilities for approximately 900 eligible veterans. Last year, the VA paid
more than
$380,000 in cash bonuses
to top executives at 38 hospitals
that are under investigation for
falsifying wait times for medical care.
VA employees who are
responsible for fraud and mismanagement should not be receiving benefits
while thousands of claims languish and veterans await basic
care.
Rep.
LaMalfa greets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the House
floor after his address to a joint meeting of Congress on March 3rd.
Last
week, I had the great honor of welcoming Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
to the House floor
to address a joint meeting of Congress. His speech is a wake-up call to
those who havent yet accepted that Irans determined pursuit of
nuclear weapons is dangerous not just for Israel, but also for the United
States. Our enduring friendship with Israel, one based upon mutual
trust and respect, demands that we stand against those who threaten
Israels existence. To read my full statement on the Prime Minister's
address,

Rep.
LaMalfa congratulates Bob Macfarlane who received the 2015 Top Hand at
the Fall River-Big Valley Cattleman's Association Annual Meeting on
February 21st. Mr. Macfarlane is awarded for his commitment to the beef
cattle industry and his impact on the community and to the organization.
Congratulations to Ed Bosworth Jr. for being named the Cattleman of
the
Year.
