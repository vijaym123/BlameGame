Jobs at the Forefront:
Ever since I first took office, I've been
working to make your priorities known in Congress. Creating jobs to get
Americans back to work continues to be the focus of our work in the
House of Representatives. This past week, the House made job creation and
economic growth a reality by passing three separate
jobs-bills:
1)
The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act - This bipartisan,
bicameral agreement helps workers acquire the skills and education they
need to succeed.
Economists
have reported that there is often a gap between the
skillset of the unemployed and the jobs available to themand this
legislation helps to close that gap by promoting skills-training for in-demand
jobs. This bill is on its way to the president for his signature and
will play a large role in getting America back to work.
2)
Amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 -
This tax
reform bill allows for companies to deduct half the cost of new
business equipment. This is very important for economic growth and job
creation. If a farmer buys a tractor, they are working to increase
productivity and should be rewarded for doing so. Making this deduction
permanent means business owners will bring in additional profits, which will
allow them to create more jobs and provide higher wages to
employees.
3)
The Energy and Water Appropriations
Bill - This bill funds national security efforts, energy security, and
supplies $5.5 billion to fund infrastructure projects, which will create
jobs and spur economic growth.
While nearly 300,000 Americans found jobs last
month, research shows that there were more Americans who gave up
entirely on the job search. This is disheartening and is precisely why I have
worked with my colleagues in the House to
pass more than 40 jobs bills . Please know
that I am fighting to create good-paying jobs, grow a healthy economy,
and help hardworking Americans like you take home more of your
paycheck.

D.C. Happenings:
This week I met with members of the N.C. Soybean Producers Association
including Ryan Cahoon, Charles Hall, and Bernard Lennon. They thanked
us for cosponsoring Rep. Pompeo's legislation entitled "The Safe and
Accurate Food Labeling Act of
2014."
I had the opportunity to
partake in a Conservative Women's Leadership Roundtable on Friday
with other members of the Republican Women's Policy Committee. The
moderator, Kim Strassel of the
Wall Street Journal , inquired about
the issues facing conservative women today. Other participants
included Americans for Tax Reform, and the College Republican National
Committee. It was great to hear from my female colleagues about things we
can improve on.
