It's Sunday night and we seriously didn't expect this:
Since 5pm, 1573 people have stepped up. That's the kind of momentum we need! (With a boost like this, we can take on Republicans all over the map -- even in deep-red states like Nebraska, Arkansas and West Virginia!)
Let's keep this going!
Will you step up now before our final week ad buy deadline in 48 hours?
