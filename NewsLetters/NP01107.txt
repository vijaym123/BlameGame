Dear Friend,
Massachusetts was the very first state to allow same-sex couples to marry.
Over a decade ago, our state embraced the principle that all families deserve recognition and protection under the law. Since then, 36 states have followed our lead. But in too many places, same-sex couples are still denied the right to marry.
It&rsquo;s far past time the rest of the country follow our example.
Today, the Supreme Court is hearing arguments on four cases dealing with marriage equality. The Court&rsquo;s decisions in those cases could be a huge victory for LGBT equality in America. Join me in telling the Supreme Court: Love is love. Click here, sign your name, and join me in standing up for marriage equality.
I have always fought for our LGBT brothers and sisters. Back in 1996, I was one of only a few dozen House members to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). I fought it ever since. It was a proud day for me when the Supreme Court struck down discriminatory provisions of that law back in 2013.
The movement toward marriage equality has grown by leaps and bounds. And right now, the Supreme Court has the chance to give same-sex couples all across the country the freedom they deserve -- the freedom to pursue happiness with whomever they choose.
It&rsquo;s time.
The LGBT community has waited long enough for equality. Join me in calling on the Supreme Court to advance marriage equality in America.
Thank you for standing up in this historic moment for the LGBT community.
