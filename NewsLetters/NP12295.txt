FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN TED YOHO
Friends,
Hello, and Happy Presidents' Day.
Today is not just another holiday. The third Monday in February is a
day when we celebrate the father of our country, George Washington.
Presidents' Day was originally established in 1885 to recognize the
birthday of President George Washington and it is still officially
called "Washington's Birthday," by the Federal government. Washington's
actual birthday is February 22. Now, Presidents' Day is widely viewed
as a day to celebrate all U.S. presidents past and present.
I hope you are able to set aside some time and reflect on the office of
the Presidency and give thanks to the Founders, who set up a system
that enabled the peaceful transition of power from one chief executive
to another. Many countries, to this day, do not have this luxury.
As we celebrate, I also want to point out some important votes that
happened in Congress.
The Debt Ceiling:
The leadership of the House decided to bring a clean debt-ceiling bill
to the floor. Clean meaning there would be no other attached bills or
spending cuts. The bill passed 221 to 201. I joined 199 of my
colleagues in voting against suspending our debt limit. Let me be
clear, no one in Congress wants the United States to default, myself
included. My 'no' vote is a statement that says, we can not keep
walking the path we are on - increasing the limit on our credit card -
without addressing the underlying factors that are causing our
out-of-control national debt.
The debt has sky rocketed under President Obama from $10 trillion, when
he first took office, to $17 trillion today. Our national debt is
probably the single biggest threat to our national security. If left
unchecked, the entire federal budget will be consumed by servicing the
interests on the debt alone. This means no money for any
programs---regardless of need or popularity. We can choose to ignore
the freight train coming our way, or we can take the needed steps to
slow it down and stabilize it before it slams into us.
I was elected to Congress to work on solutions to decrease the national
debt and enact fiscally responsible laws.
I am, and always will be,
committed to doing this. The future of our country, and the futures of
our children, and grandchildren depend on what we do.
Restoring COLAs for military retirees:
On February 11th, I voted to restore the 1% to military COLAs for
veterans. The original change was implemented during the Murray/Ryan
Budget agreement. This legislation will keep the promise made to our
veterans while, at the same time, institute reforms to make the program
more sustainable for the future. After 20 years of service, the
military allows retirement. Some military retirees begin receiving
their benefits at age 38. The passage of this bill will ensure veterans
of any age can receive the benefits they were promised and rightfully
deserve.
Thank you for spending a few moments and allowing me to update you on
what has been happening in Washington, DC. As always, I will try to
keep you as informed as possible. I hope you enjoyed your Presidents'
Day.
Best,
Ted
BILL SPOTLIGHT
Last week, I cosponsored H.R. 3996, The Military Shopping Benefits Act.
This legislation prohibits the Department of Defense from closing or
reducing the operations of exchanges or commissaries in the U.S.
through 2016.
I cosponsored this bill because I've heard from many young servicemen
and women who rely on these stores to help feed their families. The
last thing our military men and women should have to worry about is
putting food on the table. We need to cut wasteful programs at DoD, not
ones that help military families feed themselves. You can read more
about the bill here.
I also cosponsored H.R. 4008, the Educational Freedom Act of 2014. This
legislation prohibits the Federal government from mandating educational
standards on state and local authorities. This legislation would
protect states from being pushed to adopt standards such as Common Core
by the Federal government. Education is best done at the state level,
where local educators and parents can come together to shape their
children's curriculum. The Federal government should stay out of this
process and allow local entities to freely choose the educational
standards they think are best. You can read the bill text here.

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
TED
YOHO
Friends,
Hello,
and
Happy
Presidents&#8217;
Day.
Today
is
not
just
another
holiday.
The
third
Monday
in
February
is
a
day
when
we
celebrate
the
father
of
our
country,
George
Washington.
Presidents&#8217;
Day
was
originally
established
in
1885
to
recognize
the
birthday
of
President
George
Washington
and
it
is
still
officially
called
&#8220;Washington&#8217;s
Birthday,&#8221;
by
the
Federal
government. Washington&#8217;s
actual
birthday
is
February
22. Now,
Presidents&#8217;
Day
is
widely
viewed
as
a
day
to
celebrate
all
U.S.
presidents
past
and
present.
I
hope
you
are
able
to
set
aside
some
time
and
reflect
on
the
office
of
the
Presidency
and
give
thanks
to
the
Founders,
who
set
up
a
system
that
enabled
the
peaceful
transition
of
power
from
one
chief
executive
to
another.
Many
countries,
to
this
day,
do
not
have
this
luxury.
As
we
celebrate,
I
also
want
to
point
out
some
important
votes
that
happened
in
Congress.
The
Debt
Ceiling:
The
leadership
of
the
House
decided
to
bring
a
clean
debt-ceiling
bill
to
the
floor.
Clean
meaning
there
would
be
no
other
attached
bills
or
spending
cuts. The
bill
passed
221
to
201.
I
joined
199
of
my
colleagues
in
voting
against
suspending
our
debt
limit. Let
me
be
clear,
no
one
in
Congress
wants
the
United
States
to
default,
myself
included. My
&#8216;no&#8217;
vote
is
a
statement
that
says,
we
can
not
keep
walking
the
path
we
are
on
&#8211;
increasing
the
limit
on
our
credit
card
&#8211;
without
addressing
the
underlying
factors
that
are
causing
our
out-of-control
national
debt.
The
debt
has
sky
rocketed
under
President
Obama
from
$10
trillion,
when
he
first
took
office,
to
$17
trillion
today. Our
national
debt
is
probably
the
single
biggest
threat
to
our
national
security.
If
left
unchecked,
the
entire
federal
budget
will
be
consumed
by
servicing
the
interests
on
the
debt
alone.
This
means
no
money
for
any
programs---regardless
of
need
or
popularity.
We
can
choose
to
ignore
the
freight
train
coming
our
way,
or
we
can
take
the
needed
steps
to
slow
it
down
and
stabilize
it
before
it
slams
into
us.
I
was
elected
to
Congress
to
work
on
solutions
to
decrease
the
national
debt
and
enact
fiscally
responsible
laws.
I
am,
and
always
will
be,
committed
to
doing
this.
The
future
of
our
country,
and
the
futures
of
our
children,
and
grandchildren
depend
on
what
we
do.
Restoring
COLAs
for
military
retirees:
On
February
11 th ,
I
voted
to
restore
the
1%
to
military
COLAs
for
veterans.
The
original
change
was
implemented
during
the
Murray/Ryan
Budget
agreement.
This
legislation
will
keep
the
promise
made
to
our
veterans
while,
at
the
same
time,
institute
reforms
to
make
the
program
more
sustainable
for
the
future.
After
20
years
of
service,
the
military
allows
retirement.
Some
military
retirees
begin
receiving
their
benefits
at
age
38.
The
passage
of
this
bill
will
ensure
veterans
of
any
age
can
receive
the
benefits
they
were
promised
and
rightfully
deserve.
Thank
you
for
spending
a
few
moments
and
allowing
me
to
update
you
on
what
has
been
happening
in
Washington,
DC.
As
always,
I
will
try
to
keep
you
as
informed
as
possible.
I
hope
you
enjoyed
your
Presidents'
Day.
Best,
Ted
