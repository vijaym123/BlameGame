Dear Friends,
Following the November 4 midterm elections, the American people
overwhelmingly rejected
President Obama and
Senate Democrats policies.
Voters told Washington they wanted us
to work together and pass long-term solutions focused on the economy
and jobs.
Now instead of working with Congress,
President Obama is threatening to use executive authority to bypass Congress
and implement new immigration policies.
My view
on immigration remains unchanged.
We need to enforce existing
immigration laws and reform broken policies while protecting taxpayers
and hardworking Americans.
The United States has
one of the most compassionate immigration practices of any developed
country, and we want to serve as a beacon of freedom and prosperity.
We simply cannot afford to serve as the worlds shelter. We are a
nation of immigrants and we strive to be a country where people want
to build a career and raise their families, but we must also recognize
that we are a nation of laws that must be enforced and not
disregarded at the stroke of a pen.
Instead of polarizing
Washington even more, I hope the president will respect the majority
of Americans wishes and work with Congress on legislation that
promotes innovation and helps the middle class.
Stay in
touch and God bless,
We are a nation of laws that must be enforced and not
disregarded at the stroke of a pen. Do you support the president using executive action to
