Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
As Congress began the Passover and Easter break from Washington, I traveled the district visiting schools, businesses, and service organizations to hear directly from the members of our community. I had the privilege of joining Emily Lee in recognizing key volunteers and students who help with the assistance that Devereux provides at the Bates Neighborhood Resource Center in Eustis. As an organization, Devereux has been serving children and adults with emotional, developmental, educational, and cognitive disabilities for over 100 years. It was a pleasure to join Ms. Lee in thanking the local staff, community leaders and volunteers for the work they are doing to enhance the lives of those they serve.
Some of the other community service organizations and public servants that I had the opportunity to visit and thank this week included:
-	Public Education Partnership Tutoring in Winter Haven
-	UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) of Central Florida Charter School in Winter Garden
-	Kiwanis Club of Winter Haven
-	The West Orlando Rotary Club
-	City of Auburndale municipal and economic development leaders
-	Windermere Police Department

On Thursday, I joined local government officials and community leaders for the 20th Annual Celebration of Prayer breakfast, hosted by the YMCA of Central Florida. The keynote address was delivered by Major Dan Rooney, a retired US Air Force pilot and PGA professional, who has been named People Magazines Hero of the Year and ABC World News Person of the Year. Major Rooneys organization, the
Folds of Honor Foundation , has raised millions of dollars to provide education opportunities to family members of military personnel who are disabled or who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. It was an honor to participate in the breakfast and support the efforts of Major Dan Rooney.

This week, I visited several schools to thank teachers for the work they are doing to invest in the next generation and to speak to high school students about the qualities of leadership. At Polk Pre-Collegiate Charter School and Auburndale High School, I encouraged students to learn the value of wisely investing their time, understanding the importance of reading, and carefully listening to the input and advice of those around them.

It was a pleasure to once again celebrate a grand opening for Wawa, and welcome their first store in Lake County. Wawa celebrated their 50th anniversary this week, and I enjoyed commemorating their success during the Clermont ribbon cutting on Thursday.
Some of the other businesses that I visited this week include:
-	Five Star Family Growers, a blueberry farm in Auburndale
-	The Packing Corporation of America in Winter Haven
-	NeuLife Residential Rehabilitation Center in Mount Dora
-	TD Bank in Eustis
-	Slow Turtle Farm, raising poultry and goats in Eustis
-	Windermere Luxury Home Collection
-	Ellie Lous BBQ in Ocoee
-	Crown Information Management in Winter Haven
-	Main Street Mowers, recently relocated in Winter Garden

Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Eustis contacted my office regarding a tax refund that he had never received. In going through the constituents documents, my office noticed that he had never completed a form that the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) had provided, and that the deadline was quickly approaching. The constituent returned the completed forms to my office, and we were able to forward those on to TAS. After reviewing the situation, TAS found that the refund had been issued but never cashed. The TAS submitted a request for the check to be re-issued and constituent received his refund shortly afterwards.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Tuesday was Tax Day, the deadline for filing personal income taxes. The current tax code is unnecessarily complex and often very hard to navigate. How did you go about filing your taxes this year?
I prepared my own tax forms without assistance
I used a computer software program to prepare and file my taxes
I hired a third party to prepare my taxes for me

Legislative Update:
Recently, I cosponsored H.R. 495, the Free File Program Act of 2013, which would allow private sector tax preparers to continue offering free tax services to qualified tax filers. The IRS currently has a partnership with these private tax preparers to offer online individual income tax preparation and electronic filing services. This piece of legislation would reauthorize this program, which is operated at no cost to the U.S. government. You can view information about the current services on the
IRS Free File website here . Further, if you believe you are eligible for a tax refund, you may
track the status of your refund here .
