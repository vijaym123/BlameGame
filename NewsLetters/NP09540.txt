Demanding Answers for our Veterans
Our nation's veterans have sacrificed to keep America safe, and we owe
them not just our gratitude, but the best possible care.
Recent
allegations that VA healthcare employees in Arizona and Colorado
falsified records to mask delays in treating patients are of deep
concern.
But it seems this problem isn't localized to just Arizona and
Colorado, as reports of delays and cover-ups are now surfacing across
the nation - even in Texas.
I'm demanding immediate action to stop this mismanagement before more
veterans' lives are put at risk.
I've sent a letter to the VA's
Inspector General
urging him to investigate misconduct at three VA clinics in Texas: in
San Antonio, Waco, and Austin.
It's my job in Congress to provide
oversight of the executive branch, including the VA, and I am committed
to ensuring the VA tells the truth about the care they provide our
veterans.
I've also cosponsored a bill the House will vote on this
week - the VA Management Accountability Act
- which will allow the VA to fire or demote senior
employees who aren't meeting the necessary performance standards.
I
know this is an important issue in Texas' 19th District, and to
veterans everywhere.
They deserve better, and I'll continue fighting
to get answers and action.
Celebrating Texas Tech's Selection of Robert Duncan to be Next
Chancellor
Congratulations to Robert Duncan, Texas Tech's newly chosen Chancellor.
The regents have selected another strong leader, and I know Bob will
provide a clear vision for Tech's continued growth.
Bob has been a
great state representative and senator for Lubbock and now he has some
big boots to fill.
Kent Hance's accomplishments as Chancellor have
been unprecedented and will be hard to match or surpass, but I am
confident Bob will continue to lead Tech to even greater heights.
I
look forward to working with him and his wife Terri when they take on
the role of first couple.
Guns up!
This Week in Washington
Congress will be considering legislation this week to support and equip
our troops, promote strong water infrastructure and combat human
trafficking.
I want to highlight a few bills that will be important to
you in West Texas and the Big Country.
The House is expected to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2015
which provides pay and benefits for our
troops, supplies the weapons and equipment they need, and funds
research to help meet future threats.
We'll also vote on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
(WRRDA).
I support this legislation because it
will grow our economy, promote trade, and boost competitiveness.
This
bill will maintain our current water infrastructure, while cutting back
the red tape that slows the approval process and increases costs for
new projects.
Streamlining federal review could help expedite plans to
manage water resources at home in cities like Abilene and Lubbock.
The
House version of WRRDA passed with my support in October, and I'm glad
to see the majority of the House-passed reforms in the final bill.
As always, I hope you'll contact me
to weigh in with what you think of these
bills.
