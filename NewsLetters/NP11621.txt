Friend,
I want to share a few updates with you about my work in Washington.
The Situation in Ukraine
We held a hearing yesterday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
Ukraine and passed a resolution condemning Russia for its unlawful
occupation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.
I also joined a majority of
my colleagues in the House to approve legislation authorizing a loan
guarantee to Ukraine to help stabilize the new Ukrainian government.
We need to do all we can to support the Ukrainian people as they
address this crisis and develop a strategy to impose costs on Russia
for their violation of international law.
It's important for the
entire international community to strongly condemn Russia's aggressive
actions, take consequential actions, and carefully monitor this
situation.
Fighting Republican Efforts to Dismantle the Affordable Care Act
This week Republicans made their 50th attempt to dismantle and
undermine the Affordable Care Act. While Republicans have pursued this
futile crusade, the Affordable Care Act has helped 4 million Americans
enroll in health care through insurance marketplaces, 3.1 million young
adults stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and millions of
Americans secure new coverage through the Medicaid expansion. And,
according to HealthSource RI, more than 50,000 Rhode Islanders obtained
health insurance coverage in the first four months since the
marketplace opened, exceeding some of the Obama administration's
targets.
This much is clear: the Affordable Care Act is working.
It is time for
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to realize the Affordable
Care act is the law of the land, commit to working together to improve
and stabilize this law, and put an end to these repeal antics. Congress
should be focusing on renewing unemployment benefits, raising the
minimum wage, repairing our infrastructure, and expanding economic
opportunity.
Working to Renew Unemployment Assistance
I have continued to work in Congress to provide relief to struggling
Rhode Island families.
Earlier this year I introduced legislation to
renew unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed and this week
I signed onto yet another letter urging Speaker Boehner to take an
up-or-down vote to extend this critical lifeline for the over two
million Americans, including over 8,000 Rhode Islanders who have now
been cut off from this safety net.
Additionally, a recent report
issued by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 200,000
veterans are among the long-term unemployed who have lost this aid.
Our veterans who have sacrificed so much to protect our great nation
have earned our support and it's egregious that House Republicans won't
schedule a vote on this matter.
I will continue my efforts to renew
this vital program so unemployed veterans and Rhode Islanders can
receive the support they need.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov

Friend,
I
want
to
share
a
few
updates
with
you
about
my
work
in
Washington.
The
Situation
in
Ukraine
We
held
a
hearing
yesterday
in
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
on
Ukraine
and
passed
a
resolution
condemning
Russia
for
its
unlawful
occupation
of
Ukraine&#8217;s
Crimean
peninsula.
I
also
joined
a

of
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
approve
legislation
authorizing
a
loan
guarantee
to
Ukraine
to
help
stabilize
the
new
Ukrainian
government.
We
need
to
do
all
we
can
to
support
the
Ukrainian
people
as
they
address
this
crisis
and
develop
a
strategy
to
impose
costs
on
Russia
for
their
violation
of
international
law.
It&#8217;s
important
for
the
entire
international
community
to
strongly
condemn
Russia&#8217;s
aggressive
actions,
take
consequential
actions,
and
carefully
monitor
this
situation.
Fighting
Republican
Efforts
to
Dismantle
the
Affordable
Care
Act
This
week
Republicans
made
their
50 th
attempt
to
dismantle
and
undermine
the
Affordable
Care
Act. While
Republicans
have
pursued
this
futile
crusade,
the
Affordable
Care
Act
has
helped
4
million
Americans
enroll
in
health
care
through
insurance
marketplaces,
3.1
million
young
adults
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
plans
until
age
26,
and
millions
of
Americans
secure
new
coverage
through
the
Medicaid
expansion. And,
according
to
HealthSource
RI,
more
than
50,000
Rhode
Islanders
obtained
health
insurance
coverage
in
the
first
four
months
since
the
marketplace
opened,
exceeding
some
of
the
Obama
administration&#8217;s
targets.
This
much
is
clear:
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
working.
It
is
time
for
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
to
realize
the
Affordable
Care
act
is
the
law
of
the
land,
commit
to
working
together
to
improve

this
law,
and
put
an
end
to
these
repeal
antics. Congress
should
be
focusing
on
renewing
unemployment
benefits,
raising
the
minimum
wage,
repairing
our
infrastructure,
and
expanding
economic
opportunity.
Working
to
Renew
Unemployment
Assistance
I
have
continued
to
work
in
Congress
to
provide
relief
to
struggling
Rhode
Island
families.
Earlier
this
year
I
introduced
legislation
to
renew
unemployment
insurance
for
the
long-term
unemployed
and
this
week
I
signed
onto
yet
another
letter
urging
Speaker
Boehner
to
take
an
up-or-down
vote
to
extend
this
critical
lifeline
for
the
over
two
million
Americans,
including
over
8,000
Rhode
Islanders
who
have
now
been
cut
off
from
this
safety
net.
Additionally,
a
recent
report
issued
by
the
Center
on
Budget
and
Policy
Priorities
found
that
200,000
veterans
are
among
the
long-term
unemployed
who
have
lost
this
aid.
Our
veterans
who
have
sacrificed
so
much
to
protect
our
great
nation
have
earned
our
support
and
it&#8217;s
egregious
that
House
Republicans
won&#8217;t
schedule
a
vote
on
this
matter.
I
will
continue
my
efforts
to
renew
this
vital
program
so
unemployed
veterans
and
Rhode
Islanders
can
receive
the
support
they
need.
As
always,
if
you
or
someone
you
know
has
any
questions
or
concerns,
call
my
office
at
729-5600
