Background information from the
Committee
The House Committee on Veterans
Affairs will hold a hearing on Tuesday, November 18, 2014, at 1:30 PM
in room 334 of the Cannon House Office Building to explore how VAs
longstanding information technology security weaknesses may be allowing
continued data manipulation among VAs various computer
systems.
As VAs wait time manipulation
scandal raged, America learned about data manipulation schemes that
involved VA officials using scheduling software to zero out appointment
wait times and VA electronic records being changed to hide veteran
deaths.
A Government
Accountability Office review released today details how VAs failure to fully
address known IT weaknesses puts the departments information at
heightened risk of unauthorized access, modification, and disclosure. The GAO
report comes on the heels of news that VA will fail its annual
cybersecurity audit for the 16th straight
year.
The purpose of this hearing is to review the steps VA
is taking to address its longstanding IT security weaknesses and
identify who
if anyone
has been held accountable for VAs failure to
effectively deal with the departments cybersecurity
challenges.
