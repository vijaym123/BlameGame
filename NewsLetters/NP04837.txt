David -- everyone counted us out. Everyone.
But you know what? We kept fighting.
And now -- just 4 days out from the election -- we&rsquo;re seeing all of our hard work pay-off:
FOX NEWS
and
USA TODAY
are both out with new polls showing Democrats surging to a 1-point lead.
This shocking turnaround is only possible because you fought with us against impossible odds. It&rsquo;s because we still believe that simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
YES. WE. CAN.
Now, it&rsquo;s time to go out and shock the world.
Our final monthly fundraising deadline of the election is tonight at midnight. David -- will you fight with us one last time?
