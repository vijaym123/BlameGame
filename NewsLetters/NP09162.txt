I recently gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute talking
about a better approach to the problem of growing poverty in America. I
gave the speech on the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson
declaring a war on poverty.
Despite this war on poverty and many federal government efforts, 47
million Americans are still living below the poverty line today and
"deep poverty"-those making less than 50 percent of the poverty line-is
at record levels. To change that, I think we have to look beyond the
political positions of the Left and the Right and address the
underlying problems that make poverty so insidious and persistent.
Watch video of my remarks here
.
A lack of commitment is not the problem; according to some measures
U.S. taxpayers have invested over $15 trillion on poverty reduction
programs. The single most important thing is to get the economy moving
again through pro-growth policies. But while necessary, that's not
sufficient. Even though I believe a job is poverty's greatest enemy,
simply creating more economic growth is only the beginning. Someone who
is in the clutches of drug addiction, who has been in and out of
prison, who dropped out of school and has no real skills, they tend to
be left behind, no matter how much the economy grows.
To tackle poverty, we also have to go to where it starts-in our
communities, in our homes, and in our families. What we need now are
not more top down, federal government-mandated programs, but what I
call "constructive conservatism"-applying conservative principles to
the problems of our day in a pragmatic, commonsense way, tackling
issues from the bottom up instead of the top down, applying
evidence-based best practices that are tested and work.
One example is fighting drug abuse and addiction. Where the so-called
war on drugs has not been effective, one approach has: focusing on
prevention and education, treatment and recovery at the local level,
and applying evidence-based best practices. What has worked is
grassroots community coalitions, like the one I started in Cincinnati
in 1996. There are now 2000 similar coalitions operating around the
country, supported by legislation I drafted, the Drug Free Communities
Act that provides short-term, matching grants to evidence-based
community programs. States have been called the laboratory of
Democracy; these coalitions are the laboratory of drug addiction
prevention and treatment. They are on the ground, getting their hands
dirty. They are seeing what works and what doesn't. By using
scientifically proven approaches to prevention and treatment, the
coalition has seen tremendous success, with a 30 percent reduction of
adolescent substance abuse in the Greater Cincinnati area alone.
We also have to do a better job of leveraging our criminal justice
system to treat addiction instead of punishing it. As many as 85
percent of people who go through the criminal justice system struggle
with drug and alcohol abuse and addiction, which in turn drives high
recidivism rates-what we call it when someone recently released from
prison ends up right back in jail. When people are in and out of
prison, it means more crime, more fathers and mothers who are not in
their kids' lives, more broken families-and since families are the
heart of any community-more broken communities as well.
A decade ago, I
authored the Second Chance Act, which provides
matching federal funds for proven state and local reentry programs that
focus on drug treatment, mental illness counselling, and job training.
In the states that have taken advantage of Second Chance, we have seen
significant reductions in recidivism-down double-digits in Ohio alone.
Now I am proposing legislation that would apply the same proven methods
in reentry to federal prisons-the Recidivism Reduction and Public
Safety Act.
Finally, we also cannot forget about the vulnerable kids who are
growing up in difficult situations today, particularly when it comes to
the horrible crime of sex trafficking. The U.S. Department of Justice
says that approximately 300,000 children are at risk of being
trafficked and exploited. This is a crime that preys on children who
are made vulnerable by situations outside of their control. I've worked
with a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate
since I founded the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking with Senator
Richard Blumenthal, and now I have a bill that has passed the Senate
Finance Committee with Senator Ron Wyden called the Child Sex
Trafficking Data and Response Act to ensure we do a better job of
helping these kids who have been victimized.
All of these reforms are simple and they are bipartisan, but they can
make a world of difference in the lives of millions of Americans who
are struggling today to pull themselves out of poverty. They can also
help put us back on a path where community institutions and community
leadership is our foundation, where government is in support of
approaches that work, not dictating solutions from above. Every step we
take down that path from here, every success we have, we aren't just
saving lives, we are restoring the hopes and the dreams of millions
today and millions more yet unborn. And that is something worth
fighting for.
Visit to Ukraine and Poland
This past weekend, I led a delegation along with Senator Ben Cardin to
Ukraine. We went to have meetings with the Ukrainian government to talk
about the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea, a part of Ukraine, but
also to be official observers in their presidential election. We served
as election monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), joining 62 parliamentarians mostly from Europe.
Seeing the determination of the Ukrainian people to vote, even in the
face of violence by Russian-backed separatists in parts of the country,
was inspiring. They were committed to ensuring that they could chart
their own future, free from outside influence of coercion, and I was
honored to have a role in helping them do that.
>From Ukraine I traveled to neighboring Poland, a key NATO ally, to
visit with our brave servicemen and women who were deployed there in
response to the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. I
received briefings from our military and intelligence officials, but
more importantly I had the chance to thank our men and women in uniform
for all they do to ensure peace for all of us. We honor their service.
I enjoyed meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to
discuss the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea and Ukraine's
presidential election.
Over 100 Ukrainians gave their lives fighting for a free and
democratic Ukraine. Their spirit lives on through this presidential
election.
In Ukraine observing their presidential elections-an important moment
for a free and democratic Ukraine.
My Memorial Day weekend highlight was to share some time with US Airmen
deployed to Poland-including a few Ohioans.

I
recently
gave
a
speech
at
the
American
Enterprise
Institute
talking
about
a
better
approach
to
the
problem
of
growing
poverty
in
America.
I
gave
the
speech
on
the
50th
anniversary
of
President
Lyndon
Johnson
declaring
a
war
on
poverty.
Despite
this
war
on
poverty
and
many
federal
government
efforts, 47
million
Americans
are
still
living
below
the
poverty
line
today
and
"deep
poverty"&#8212;those
making
less
than
50
percent
of
the
poverty
line&#8212;is
at
record
levels.
To
change
that,
I
think
we
have
to
look
beyond
the political
positions of
the
Left
and
the
Right
and
address
the
underlying
problems
that
make
poverty
so
insidious
and
persistent.
Watch
video
of
my
remarks
here .
A
lack
of
commitment
is
not
the
problem;
according
to
some
measures U.S.
taxpayers have
invested
over
$15
trillion
on
poverty
reduction
programs.
The
single
most
important
thing
is
to
get
the
economy
moving
again
through
pro-growth
policies.
But
while
necessary,
that's
not
sufficient.
Even
though
I
believe
a
job
is
poverty&#8217;s
greatest
enemy,
simply
creating
more economic
growth is
only
the
beginning.
Someone
who
is
in
the
clutches
of
drug
addiction,
who
has
been
in
and
out
of
prison,
who
dropped
out
of
school
and
has
no
real
skills,
they
tend
to
be
left
behind,
no
matter
how
much
the
economy
grows.
To
tackle
poverty,
we
also have
to
go
to
where
it
starts&#8212;in
our
communities,
in
our
homes,
and
in
our
families.
What
we
need
now
are
not
more
top
down,
federal
government-mandated
programs,
but
what
I
call
&#8220;constructive
conservatism&#8221;&#8212;applying
conservative
principles
to
the
problems
of
our
day
in
a
pragmatic,
commonsense
way,
tackling
issues
from
the
bottom
up
instead
of
the
top
down,
applying
evidence-based
best
practices
that are
tested
and
work.
One
example
is
fighting
drug
abuse
and
addiction.
Where
the
so-called
war
on
drugs
has
not
been
effective,
one
approach
has:
focusing
on
prevention
and
education,
treatment
and
recovery
at
the
local
level,
and
applying
evidence-based
best
practices.
What
has
worked
is
grassroots
community
coalitions,
like
the
one
I
started
in
Cincinnati
in
1996.
There
are
now
2000
similar
coalitions
operating
around
the
country,
supported
by
legislation
I
drafted,
the
Drug
Free
Communities
Act
that
provides
short-term,
matching
grants
to
evidence-based
community
programs.
States
have
been
called
the
laboratory
of
Democracy;
these
coalitions
are
the
laboratory
of
drug
addiction
prevention
and
treatment.
They
are
on
the
ground,
getting
their
hands
dirty.
They
are
seeing
what
works
and
what
doesn&#8217;t.
By
using
scientifically
proven
approaches
to
prevention
and
treatment,
the
coalition
has
seen
tremendous
success,
with
a
30
percent
reduction
of
adolescent
substance
abuse
in
the
Greater
Cincinnati
area
alone.
We
also
have
to
do
a
better
job
of
leveraging
our
criminal
justice
system
to
treat
addiction
instead
of
punishing
it.
As
many
as
85
percent
of
people
who
go
through
the
criminal
justice
system
struggle
with
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
and
addiction,
which
in
turn
drives
high
recidivism
rates&#8212;what
we
call
it
when
someone
recently
released
from
prison
ends
up
right
back
in
jail.
When
people
are
in
and
out
of
prison,
it
means
more
crime,
more
fathers
and
mothers
who
are
not
in
their
kids&#8217;
lives,
more
broken
families&#8212;and
since
families
are
the
heart
of
any
community&#8212;more
broken
communities
as
well.
A
decade
ago,
I
authored
the
Second
Chance
Act,
which provides
matching
federal
funds
for proven
state
and
local
reentry
programs
that
focus
on
drug
treatment,
mental
illness
counselling,
and
job
training.
In
the
states
that
have
taken
advantage
of
Second
Chance,
we
have
seen
significant
reductions
in
recidivism&#8212;down
double-digits
in
Ohio
alone.
Now I
am
proposing
legislation
that
would
apply
the
same
proven
methods
in
reentry
to
federal
prisons&#8212;the
Recidivism
Reduction
and
Public
Safety
Act.
Finally,
we
also
cannot
forget
about
the
vulnerable
kids
who
are
growing
up
in
difficult
situations
today,
particularly
when
it
comes
to
the
horrible
crime
of
sex
trafficking.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
says
that
approximately
300,000
children
are
at
risk
of
being
trafficked
and
exploited.
This
is
a
crime
that
preys
on
children
who
are
made
vulnerable
by
situations
outside
of
their
control.
I&#8217;ve
worked
with
a
number
of
my
colleagues
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
the
Senate
since
I
founded
the
Senate
Caucus
to
End
Human
Trafficking
with
Senator
Richard
Blumenthal,
and
now
I
have
a
bill
that
has
passed
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
with
Senator
Ron
Wyden
called
the
Child
Sex
Trafficking
Data
and
Response
Act
to
ensure
we
do
a
better
job
of
helping
these
kids
who
have
been
victimized.
All
of
these
reforms
are
simple
and
they
are
bipartisan,
but
they
can
make
a
world
of
difference
in
the
lives
of
millions
of
Americans
who
are
struggling
today
to
pull
themselves
out
of
poverty.
They
can
also
help
put
us
back
on
a
path
where
community
institutions
and
community
leadership
is
our
foundation,
where
government
is
in
support
of
approaches
that
work,
not
dictating
solutions
from
above.
Every
step
we
take
down
that
path
from
here,
every
success
we
have,
we
aren&#8217;t
just
saving
lives,
we
are
restoring
the
hopes
and
the
dreams
of
millions
today
and
millions
more
yet
unborn.
And
that
is
something
worth
fighting
for.
Visit
to
Ukraine
and
Poland
This
past
weekend,
I
led
a delegation
along
with
Senator
Ben
Cardin
to
Ukraine.
We
went
to
have
meetings
with
the
Ukrainian
government
to
talk
about
the
illegal
Russian
annexation
of
Crimea,
a
part
of
Ukraine,
but
also
to be
official
observers in their
presidential
election.

served
as
election
monitors
for
the
Organization
for
Security
and
Cooperation
in
Europe
(OSCE),
joining
62
parliamentarians
mostly
from
Europe.
Seeing
the
determination
of
the
Ukrainian
people
to
vote,
even
in
the
face
of
violence
by
Russian-backed
separatists
in
parts
of
the
country,
was
inspiring.
They
were
committed
to
ensuring
that
they
could
chart
their
own
future,
free
from
outside
influence
of
coercion,
and
I
was
honored
to
have
a
role
in
helping
them
do
that.
From
Ukraine
I
traveled
to
neighboring
Poland,
a
key
NATO
ally,
to
visit
with
our
brave
servicemen
and
women
who
were
deployed
there
in
response
to
the
illegal
Russian
annexation
of
Crimea
from
Ukraine.
I
received
briefings
from
our
military
and
intelligence
officials,
but
more
importantly
I
had
the
chance
to
thank
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
for
all
they
do
to
ensure
peace
for
all
of
us.
We
honor
their
service.
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
Ukrainian
Prime
Minister
Arseniy
Yatsenyuk
to
discuss
the
illegal
Russian
annexation
of
Crimea
and
Ukraine's
presidential

Over
100
Ukrainians
gave
their
lives
fighting
for
a
free
and
democratic
Ukraine.
Their
spirit
lives
on
through this
presidential
election.
In
Ukraine

their
