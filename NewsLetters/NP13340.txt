Dear Friend,
The President will sign
into law the first bipartisan budget produced by a divided Congress in 27
years.
It is not everything we wanted, but the agreement is a step in the
right direction to alleviate the harshness of the automatic
sequester.
The sequester, which is across-the-board spending cuts that hurt
kids, parents, seniors and middle-class families and stifles the
economy.
But it is only a beginning.
Unemployment
Insurance:
We have so many critical problems that we need
to address.
The most urgent is the extension of the Unemployment
Benefits that expires at the end of this year, which the House
Republican Leadership refused to allow a vote on.
They wouldn't
even allow a short term extension.
I will work in January
with my fellow Democrats to quickly extend the unemployment benefits
to the millions of Americans who need this vital economic
lifeline.
Affordable Care Act:
I have worked
hard to prevent the Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care
Act.
The Republicans even shut the Government down in their attempt
to defund this important law.
While the roll out was far from
perfect, it is now working and people who have never before been able to
buy health insurance are now able to afford it.
Plus,
individuals with preexisting conditions can now get insurance.
I was one
of the co-authors of the Affordable Care Act and I will continue to
fight to preserve and improve this historic
law.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform:
Immigration Reform has hit a
major road block in the House of Representatives.
In June, the
Senate approved a bill to bolster border security, help business get
needed workers and provide an earned pathway to U.S. citizenship for up
to 11 million undocumented immigrants.
The House has since
passed a few limited bills, most dealing with enforcement and none
providing a pathway to U.S. citizenship.
Again, the House Leadership is
refusing to seriously address the immigration issue.
Our system is broken and needs to be repaired and I will keep
fighting for it.
We have so much left to do.
We have to work
together to find solutions.
The bi-partisan agreement shows that
it can be done.
As we celebrate the holiday season, let's hope
that the holiday spirit brings us together to find solutions.
Merry
Christmas &amp; Happy Kwanzaa!
