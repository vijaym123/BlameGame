Friends, this week I sponsored legislation calling for the House to
impeach Attorney General Eric Holder for high crimes and misdemeanors.
My decision to call for Mr. Holder's impeachment was not one that I
took lightly, but I firmly believe his conduct has left us with no
other option.
About a year and a half ago, I voted to hold Mr. Holder in contempt of
Congress
when it became apparent that the
attorney general and the Justice Department deliberately withheld
information on Fast and Furious for purely political reasons. Yet
rather than change his ways, the attorney general continued to show an
utter disregard for the very laws he swore to uphold.
We have seen the attorney general refuse to comply with a congressional
subpoena and perjure himself before the House Judiciary Committee. It
seems Mr. Holder has confused his job to enforce the law with a
permission to disobey it. These actions by the attorney general would
lead to criminal charges being filed against any other American. Mr.
Holder should not receive special consideration solely based on his
title.
For far too long, President Obama has shown that he is unwilling to
hold anyone in his administration responsible for their actions. This
sends the troubling message that he is either complicit in these
wrongdoings or feels his administration is unaccountable to the
American people - both of which are unacceptable. If the president will
not remove individuals who break the law from office, then we will.
The articles of impeachment lay out four charges against Mr. Holder:
1. Refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, seeking
information and documents regarding Operation Fast and Furious. This is
a violation of 2 U.S.C. 192.
2. Failure to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage
Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1986. This is a violation of the oath Mr. Holder swore to "well and
faithfully discharge the duties of the office" of Attorney General.
3. Refusal to prosecute the IRS officials involved in the targeting and
disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors. This is a
violation of the oath Mr. Holder swore to "well and faithfully
discharge the duties of the office" of Attorney General.
4. False testimony under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, about
the Justice Department investigation of journalist James Rosen. This is
a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1621.
As our nation's top law enforcement officer, the attorney general is
supposed to set an example. Instead his actions have provided a
blueprint to those who seek to thwart justice. We must not stand for
this.
Earlier this week, I announced my decision to impeach Attorney General
Eric Holder on my Facebook page
and received countless supportive comments.
Thank you for continuing to engage with me on these important
discussions, I always appreciate hearing your feedback and concerns.

Friends,
this
week
I
sponsored
legislation
calling
for
the
House
to
impeach
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors.
My
decision
to
call
for
Mr.
Holder&#8217;s
impeachment
was
not
one
that
I
took
lightly,
but
I
firmly
believe
his
conduct
has
left
us
with
no
other
option.
About
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
I
voted
to
hold
Mr.
Holder
in
contempt
of
Congress
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
Justice
Department
deliberately
withheld
information
on
Fast
and
Furious
for
purely
political
reasons.
Yet
rather
than
change
his
ways,
the
attorney
general
continued
to
show
an
utter
disregard
for
the
very
laws
he
swore
to
uphold.
We
have
seen
the
attorney
general
refuse
to
comply
with
a
congressional
subpoena
and
perjure
himself
before
the
House
Judiciary
Committee.
It
seems
Mr.
Holder
has
confused
his
job
to
enforce
the
law
with
a
permission
to
disobey
it.
These
actions
by
the
attorney
general
would
lead
to
criminal
charges
being
filed
against
any
other
American.
Mr.
Holder
should
not
receive
special
consideration
solely
based
on
his
title.
For
far
too
long,
President
Obama
has
shown
that
he
is
unwilling
to
hold
anyone
in
his
administration
responsible
for
their
actions.
This
sends
the
troubling
message
that
he
is
either
complicit
in
these
wrongdoings
or
feels
his
administration
is
unaccountable
to
the
American
people
&#8211;
both
of
which
are
unacceptable.
If
the
president
will
not
remove
individuals
who
break
the
law
from
office,
then
we
will.
The
articles
of
impeachment
lay
out
four
charges
against
Mr.
Holder:
1.
Refusal
to
comply
with
a
subpoena
issued
by
the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
on
October
12,
2011,
seeking
information
and
documents
regarding
Operation
Fast
and
Furious.
This
is
a
violation
of
2
U.S.C.
192.
2.
Failure
to
enforce
multiple
laws,
including
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act,
the
Controlled
Substances
Act,
and
the
Anti-Drug
Abuse
Act
of
1986.
This
is
a
violation
of
the
oath
Mr.
Holder
swore
to
"well
and
faithfully
discharge
the
duties
of
the
office"
of
Attorney
General.
3.
Refusal
to
prosecute
the
IRS
officials
involved
in
the
targeting
and
disclosure
of
tax
records
belonging
to
political
donors.
This
is
a
violation
of
the
oath
Mr.
Holder
swore
to
"well
and
faithfully
discharge
the
duties
of
the
office"
of
Attorney
General.
4.
False
testimony
under
oath
before
Congress
on
May
15,
2013,
about
the
Justice
Department
investigation
of
journalist
James
Rosen.
This
is
a
violation
of
18
U.S.C.
1621.
As
our
nation&#8217;s
top
law
enforcement
officer,
the
attorney
general
is
supposed
to
set
an
example.
Instead
his
actions
have
provided
a
blueprint
to
those
who
seek
to
thwart
justice.
We
must
not
stand
for
this.

week,
I
announced
my
decision
to
