I emailed you last week. I&rsquo;m emailing again today. It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re at the single most important moment of the election. I&rsquo;m pleading with you: stop what you&rsquo;re doing RIGHT now, and read this email!
Friend -- I emailed you last week.
I&rsquo;m emailing again today.
It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re at the single most important moment of the election.
I&rsquo;m pleading with you: stop what you&rsquo;re doing RIGHT now, and read this email!
Three frightening facts:
Control of the Senate comes down to 6 races -- and EVERY ONE is TIED.
If the GOP wins just 3 of them, McConnell takes control.
That puts our chances at 50%.
We CAN win -- but only if we go on the attack NOW.
Here&rsquo;s another scary number: The final FEC deadline of the election is 96 hours away.
It&rsquo;s our LAST chance to hand the GOP a devastating defeat.
Friend, will you give NOW so we can ATTACK Republicans and WIN the Senate? Tomorrow will be too late! All gifts will be MATCHED.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
24 days out, and the Senate race is as close as it&rsquo;s ever been. You might want to wait until the last second to give&hellip; but by then it&rsquo;ll be too late. We can&rsquo;t hire canvassers or register voters on the last day. Those are the things that need to happen NOW. YESTERDAY.
And frankly, we just don&rsquo;t have enough right now.
But YOU can change that.
Will you give so Democrats can give it our ALL in states from Georgia to Alaska?
The future of the Senate -- and the country -- depends on your answer.
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
