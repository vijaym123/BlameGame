Dear David,
One year after the disastrous launch of the
$2 billion
ObamaCare website, I continue to hear from
families, workers, seniors, and small business owners across Missouri
who are facing skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs, canceled coverage,
fewer doctors, and
job
losses .
ObamaCare is more than a website with technical glitches - it's a flawed
law that needs to be repealed and replaced with common-sense health
care
solutions .
Since the
disastrous launch of the ObamaCare exchanges, I have gone to the Senate
floor almost every week to share ObamaCare news and stories from
Missourians who have written, called, and tweeted.

floor.
I hope you'll share your opinions and
concerns about the harmful impact of ObamaCare with me on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , on
YouTube , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
