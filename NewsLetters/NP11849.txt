2014 Congressional Art Competition
I am pleased to announce my office has begun taking submissions for the
2014 Congressional Art Competition. I encourage all interested high
school age students to consider submitting their artwork for the
opportunity to represent Ohio's 16th district in the U.S. Capitol. Each
year, we are impressed by the talent and creativity of the students
from Northeast Ohio, and I expect this year to be no exception
The Congressional Art Competition is open to all high school students
in the 16th District, and the winning piece will be displayed for one
year in the U.S. Capitol along with other winners from across the
country. The artwork will be judged by an independent panel formed by
professional artists. For the first time this year, our office will
award the People's Choice award following a competition on my Facebook
Page

VIDEO: Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act

that the Ways & Means Committee completes its ongoing investigation
prior to the IRS implementing any additional regulations. Read more

power by targeting conservative groups and wasted millions of taxpayer
dollars on conferences and other activities. Not only did the federal
agency violate the public's trust, it infringed on our First Amendment
rights. Read full column HERE
