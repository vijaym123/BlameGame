#Path2Cures clearer than ever
Dear Friend:
As you probably know, last year I unveiled a bipartisan initiative called 21
st
Century Cures with my Democratic colleague, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colorado). Health innovations are happening right here in Southwest Michigan at lightning speed. From mapping the human genome to the rise of personalized medicines, we have seen constant breakthroughs that are changing the face of disease treatment, management, and cures. Health research is moving quickly,
but federal laws are simply not keeping pace.
Did you know there are 7,000 known diseases but only cures for around 500 of them? This is unacceptable and leads to the question: What policies can we enact to help get more cures and treatments to patients?
After months of review, including a bipartisan roundtable at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, we found several areas of reform that will close the gap between the science of medicine and the regulations that impact the fate of the new therapies. Our legislation will modernize all of these categories, removing outdated hurdles preventing innovation from flourishing here or from fleeing the United States.
First, we must modernize clinical trials to streamline the approval of drugs and devices.
Second, we must integrate the patient perspective into the regulatory process.
Third, we must promote better access to and sharing of information such as genomic and other clinical data to foster more collaboration among researchers.
Fourth, we must invest in the future of science to help young, emerging scientists with better resources.
Finally, we must incentivize the development of new drugs and devices for unmet medical needs.
Its time to modernize policy to move the process of discovery, development, and delivery of life-saving cures. Learn more about this groundbreaking initiative and how it can help families right here in Southwest Michigan by clicking
