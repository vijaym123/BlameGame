David -- Republicans just released their annual budget plan. And ONCE AGAIN, it&rsquo;s a horror show that helps billionaires at the expense of the middle class:
Enormous cuts to Medicare
Cuts to Medicaid and food stamps
A full repeal of Obamacare, which has newly insured 16.4 million Americans
Tax breaks for billionaires and special interests
Feel like you&rsquo;ve seen this all before? You have.
But this year is different: With GOP majorities in the House and Senate, Republicans will have more leverage in passing a Paul Ryan-style budget.
We&rsquo;re in danger of seeing these cuts made into law!
That&rsquo;s unacceptable -- and we urgently need your help to fight back.
Will you renew your DSCC membership to help Democrats battle the anti-senior, anti-middle class Republican budget? Gifts will be DOUBLE MATCHED!

Or donate another amount.
We need you NOW to show Republicans that cutting supports for seniors to enrich billionaires won&rsquo;t fly with the American people.
So THIS WEEK ONLY, we&rsquo;ll DOUBLE MATCH every membership renewal.
That&rsquo;s three times the impact to fight back against the awful GOP budget!
Will you help? Renew your membership by Friday to help us fight back, and you&rsquo;ll have triple the impact!
