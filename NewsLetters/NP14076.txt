Dear Neighbor,
I recently sent the President a
letter
detailing my Honest Proposal, a minimum three year step-by-step plan to tackle America&rsquo;s debt problems. The bipartisan group I&rsquo;m working with is growing and gaining momentum &ndash; our group of more than 25 Members met as recently as last week and will continue meeting ahead of the February 7 th
default deadline. There is a fundamental recognition among our group that it is time to tackle our debt and spending problems &ndash; not through crises, cliffs, or shutdown deadlines but through a long-term bipartisan plan. Read the Honest Proposal step-by-step
here .
Other highlights from the week so far :
VIDEO : As part of National Diabetes Awareness Month, I spoke
on the House floor this week to raise awareness for the disease. Awareness
should not be limited to one month a year &ndash; diabetes is a 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, 365 days a year disease. I spoke on the importance of
education and research, and ways I am involved whether it&rsquo;s
through JDRF, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or through the
Congressional Diabetes Caucus. Please take a moment to watch the video
here .
I had the pleasure of meeting five-year-old Kaelyn to talk about her Type 1 diabetes and her involvement with JDRF, an organization I am involved in with my son Will, who also has Type 1 diabetes.
Spent time this week with 3rd graders
at All Saints Academy in Corning (below) where we delivered dictionaries
to their classrooms for the school year.
We
introduced an amendment to the
Protecting
States&rsquo; Rights to Promote American Energy Security
that would simply
require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on
the number
of jobs created, impact on energy prices, and impact on state and federal
revenue as a result of domestic oil and gas production from shale. It is
important we know the full extent of the domestic energy sector&rsquo;s
contributions to jobs, energy costs and the economy.
Spoke at
the American Shale and Manufacturing Partnership (ASMP) launch. The group
focuses on shale development and its impact on American manufacturing. As
co-chair of both the House Manufacturing Caucus and the Congressional
Natural Gas Caucus, I work to highlight this very same topic in Congress
and just last week we held a
joint event
of the two
caucuses to discuss how domestic energy production is helping to boost
manufacturing.
Looking ahead to the next few days :
Today we
will be at the Jamestown Passenger Station (formally known as the Erie
Train Station) and visiting the bridge restoration project near Falconer.
We&rsquo;ll also
be visiting a school district to deliver some good news about a federal
impact aid award we were pleased to help secure.
Saturday we
will be in Elmira showing our support for the Elmira Psychiatric Center
and the importance of continuing the care offered there.
We&rsquo;ll be
holding
office hours
in Chautauqua
County next week.
Thank you to everyone who attended our town halls last weekend &ndash; be sure to check these updates and our
website
for upcoming town halls.
Best,
Tom
