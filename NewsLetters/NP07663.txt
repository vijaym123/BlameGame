Friend -
Approximately 16 million people fall victim to identity theft each year, totaling more than $24 billion dollars in damages annually, according to
statistics
by the U.S. Department of Justice.
That is why I support the STOP Identity Theft Act,
H.R. 744 , which calls for the Department of Justice to bring more perpetrators of identity theft to justice.
Identity theft has become all too common.
It is important to take precautions to prevent yourself from becoming a victim.
Here are five simple ways to protect yourself from identity theft:
Guard your information online by clearing logins and passwords, instead of allowing websites to remember them and store the information.
Opt out of pre-screened credit card offers at 1-888-5-OPTOUT.
Monitor your bank and credit card statements and your credit report, and order a free annual credit report at
www.annualcreditreport.com
or 1-877-322-8228.
Verify your mailing address with the post office and financial institutions to ensure that mailers with your information on them are sent to the right address.
Secure or shred your mail.
Yours in service,
Randy
