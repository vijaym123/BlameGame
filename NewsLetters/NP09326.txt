On this Memorial Day weekend, V.I. Delegate to Congress Donna M. Christensen encouraged Virgin Islanders to remember with reverence all who have been lost in all of our nations conflicts, especially those Virgin Islanders who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
They may be small in number among all of the hundreds of thousands, who have given their lives from the Revolutionary War to the present that we honor on every Memorial Day, but they are too many to us and the pain of their loss remains large in our hearts, said Congresswoman Christensen. As millions across the nation will gather together on Monday to commemorate Memorial Day, on behalf of the 113th Congress of the United States, I thank them for the supreme sacrifice that they have made on behalf of our Country, and all of us, their fellow Virgin Islanders. Ours is a debt to all who lost loved ones in every war and conflict that can never ever be fully repaid. So as we memorialize those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, let us commit ourselves as a community to their families, our remaining veterans, those who serve today and those who will serve tomorrow, Congresswoman Christensen concluded. God bless the men and women of our armed forces past and present. God bless our Country, the U.S. Virgin Islands and us all.
Congratulates USCG Academy Graduate Jamen DesCartes
and Athlete Nikki Barnes
Congresswoman Donna Christensen congratulated Cadet Jamen DesCartes of St. Thomas who is among the 212 cadets receiving Bachelor of Science degrees and commissions as ensigns this week from the United States Coast Guard Academy Connecticut. The newly commissioned ensigns report for duty aboard cutters and at sector offices in ports nationwide. Of the 212 cadets to receive orders, 88% will report to Coast Guard cutters, 8.5% to flight school, and 3.5% to sectors. Graduates of the academy are obligated to serve five years in the U.S. Coast Guard, though many choose to stay and make a rewarding, life-long career of their maritime military service. We are very excited to have another graduate from the Coast Guard Academy, said Congresswoman Christensen. I am always pleased to hear of the success of our best and brightest students who enter the service academies. I extend proud congratulations to Cadet DesCartes on this tremendous achievement, as well as his parents and family. Congresswoman Christensen said Ensign DesCartes is among a growing list of Virgin Islanders who have been afforded the unique opportunity to develop physically, ethically, and intellectually while building a foundation for a challenging and rewarding career as a military officer in the service of our nation. All of our academy graduates have done well and we are proud of them and proud of Jamen for having continued the tradition. She also congratulated freshman Nikki Barnes of St. Thomas, on being named 2013-2014 Outstanding Female Freshman Athlete of the Year. A 2012 Antilles School graduate, Barnes is known for her sailing skills and was recruited by the academy for their sailing team.

Christensen granted these three young men congressional nominations and earning an appointment to the Class of 2018 at a U.S. Service Academy is an outstanding accomplishment and a rare honor.
Gave Federal Outlook On VI Economic Prospects to USVI Alliance Summit
Congresswoman Christensen told attendees of the USVI Alliance Summit this week that despite the toxic environment in the Congress, she remains optimistic about the territorys future because of the groundwork for progress laid over the years and because of the hard work that she has put in since they last met.
Our efforts have occurred in the toxic Washington, D.C. atmosphere where essential programs such as Supplemental Nutrition are being cut and where last fall, our federal government came to a standstill during the shutdown, she said. We have
been under cuts imposed by the sequester since early last year, however with the 2-year budget deal the cuts have been reduced for 2014 and 2015, more than half in the non defense discretionary fundinghowever unless Congress acts to do otherwise the sequester cuts will be in place again until 2023 instead of 2021, she said. The general outlook is not as rosy as we would like it to be, but that doesnt mean that there are not some possible bright spots on the horizon once the Congress decides to act, she said. Despite all of that we were able to;
Have USDA hold workshops on Renewable Energy and High Energy Cost Grants that have yielded unprecedented funding for several businesses and the University of the Virgin Islands.
Have the Health and Human Services Department more than triple our Low Income Home Energy Assistance dollars, providing help to more of our low income families, seniors and people with disabilities to pay their electricity bills.
Have the Health and Human Services Department increase the federal contribution to Medicaid up to 78 percent for the newly eligible, which will free local dollars for other important purposes.
Have the General Accounting Office determine through a study the correct level of federal assets necessary to protect the Caribbean Border and to have the Office of National Drug Policy develop a specific strategy to help us address drug and gun trafficking and the violent crimes that they spawn.
Congresswoman Christensen said that progress was also being made with the broadband expansion, improved financial management, with the Diageo plant, and other initiatives that will be fertile ground for whatever federal help comes.
She said she continues to pursue legislation to Reauthorize the Production Incentive program which is the basis for the watch and jewelry industry, and to create a visa waiver program for residents of the Eastern Caribbean.
She said that work continues with federal agencies to help the hospitals, support WAPAs efforts to move to clean and cheaper energies, ensure that there are more federal contracts with Virgin Islands companies, find private equity support for small businesses, seek new sources of investment in the territory and for the implementation of the National Heritage Area program for St. Croix.
Speaking to the Summits theme, she said: Diversifying business and industry beyond the 21st century will require vision, leadership and all of us bringing our ideas and expertise to the table as we are doing here this week.
Praises Caribbean Movement Away From Fossil Fuels at CARILEC Conference
Congresswoman shared brief remarks at the opening of the Caribbean Electric Utilities Association
(CARILEC) 2014 CEO Conference and Communications Symposium.
She shared that she was pleased to join in the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the organizations commitment to the Caribbean Region, and secondly, but also very important to the USVI, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the formation of the V.I. Water and Power Authority. In her remarks, Congresswoman Christensen noted the enormous task that Caribbean energy leaders undertake on a daily basis to keep the lights on while contending with high costs, threats to energy infrastructure, and nowhere to turn for back up when complications arise.
She also used the opportunity to praise current efforts to turn away from heavy fossil fuel usage and be on the forefront of employing more indigenous sources of energy to counter these concerns.
Held a Meeting to Start Planning for the Official Launch of the Christensen Institute
On Thursday, Congresswoman Donna Christensen, Dr. Gary Puckrein, the President and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF), and Dr. Britt Weinstock, the Director of Health Policy in the Congresswomans office, met to discuss the preliminary plans for the forthcoming Donna M. Christensen Institute for Health Equity (the Christensen Institute)
a new entity that will be established within the NMQF to honor and continue the legacy of Congresswoman Christensens leadership in health equity.
