 selected a plan or were automatically re-enrolled through HealthCare.gov, including 468,464 in Georgia.
This Sunday, Feb. 15, marks the deadline and end of Open Enrollment for the 2015 Health Insurance Marketplaces.
There are only three days remaining before the February 15 deadline to sign up for coverage.
It is important for individuals in Georgia who have not yet signed up for coverage to visit Healthcare.gov before the deadline to shop for plans and financial help. You may be surprised to learn that the security that comes with health coverage is within your reach. Eighty-one percent of Georgia Marketplace enrollees as of December 2014 could obtain coverage for $100 or less after any applicable tax credits in 2015.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH: In recognition of Black History Month, I - along with my friend and colleague Congressman Doug Collins (GA-09) - introduced a bipartisan resolution this month calling on Congress to award the Freedom Riders the Congressional Gold Medal. More than 135 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle joined us to cosponsor the bill, H.R. 671. For more, click HERE . To view my Black History Month video message, click HERE .
BLACK HISTORY MONTH PROGRAM: On Tuesday, Feb. 17, I am conducting two, one-hour programs for Black History Month featuring two original Freedom Riders - Mr. Hank Thomas and Mr. Charles Person.
The Freedom Riders were heroes who rode buses and trains in the South to break the back of segregation. The riders - including my constituent Hank Thomas and my friend and colleague Representative John Lewis - endured insults and beatings and risked their lives more than 50 years ago because they believed in a different future for their children and their grandchildren. I'm pleased to be able to bring two of these heroes into our schools so young people can understand their history.
WHO: Congressman Hank Johnson (GA-04); original Freedom Riders Hank Thomas and Charles Person
WHAT: Black History Month Program on the Freedom Riders
WHEN: Tuesday, Feb. 17
WHERE: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. High School from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. | Arabia Mountain High School from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.
ATLANTA IN FAST LANE: Google announced late last month that it will install fiber that will bring fast connections to homes in Atlanta and eight nearby cities, including parts of the Fourth District that I represent. As the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over competition and regulatory policy, I have repeatedly called for greater deployment of high-speed broadband throughout Georgia and in the Fourth District. For more, click HERE .
MEETING WITH OUR PRESIDENT: This week, I joined my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) for a meeting with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the White House. I had the unique opportunity to present my criminal justice reform bills, including legislation that addresses the over-militarization of local police
and grand jury reform , to the President, his team and members of the CBC. I will continue to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress to address issues that are important to my constituents. For more, click HERE .
REMEMBERING THE HOLOCAUST: I issued the following statement to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. For more, click HERE .
FIGHTING FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS: This month, I proposed an amendment to the so-called "Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act" to protect jobs and middle-class security. For more, click HERE .
