Congress Passes Several Bills to Improve America's Economic Prospects
This week, I supported a number of bills focused on improving the economic outlook for families in the 31st District and removing burdensome government regulations from negatively affecting individuals and small businesses.
H.R. 2641, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act (RAPID Act), reforms permitting processes which have been greatly expanded far beyond their original intent and needlessly delaying many of our nation's vitally important construction projects. The bill's reforms will cut through endless bureaucratic delays and allow construction projects to move forward, accelerating job creation and fostering economic growth.
H.R. 4118, the Simple Fairness Act, is bipartisan legislation to ensure not just some, but all Americans do not have to pay the individual mandate penalty required under the President's healthcare law. It is absurd that the President has delayed the mandate not once but twice for businesses, yet has failed to do the same for everyday American citizens.
H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, is bipartisan legislation that implements reforms to provide relief to homeowners and businesses that have flood insurance. This bill slows the rate at which subsidized insurance premiums under the National Flood Insurance Program must be raised to actuarial rates that reflect the most recently estimated flood risk, and it repeals the requirement that flood insurance premiums for homes that are sold be increased immediately to full actuarial rates. These changes provide relief for hundreds of thousands of individuals who were at risk of losing their homes and businesses due to skyrocketing flood insurance costs.
