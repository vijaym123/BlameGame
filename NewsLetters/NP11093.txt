House passes H.R. 3060 for hometown hero
It is with great pleasure that I announce the House passed my bill,
H.R. 3060, last week to dedicate the post office facility in Burleson,
TX, as the Sergeant William Moody Post Office Building.
The bill now
awaits Senate action.
Sgt. Moody is truly a hometown hero.
Raised in Burleson, Sgt. Moody
joined the Marines after graduating from Burleson High School.
He
served two tours of duty in Iraq, and later joined the Army where he
deployed twice to Afghanistan.
Throughout his years of service, Sgt.
Moody's commendable service earned him numerous honors and service
medals, including the Global War on Terror Service Medal, a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart.
On June 18th, 2013, Sgt. Moody was killed along with three other
American soldiers as a result of indirect enemy fire at Bagram Air Base
in Afghanistan.
He leaves behind a wife and three children.
This
dedication of this Post Office building will not only serve as a
memorial for his family to cherish, but as a reminder of the true price
of freedom.
Sgt. Moody fought with courage, served with integrity, and
will be remembered forever.

Obama's changes to Obamacare
Last week, the Obama administration has extended yet another deadline
for Obamacare.
This time it's the deadline to enroll before the
previous March 31st deadline.
This comes just days after Secretary of
Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress that the
administration would absolutely not push back this deadline.
With a disastrous rollout of the Obamacare website and bleak enrollment
numbers, it's no surprise that the administration is in panic mode.
This law was a disaster from the start, and it continues to fall apart.
The worst part is that it's taking hardworking taxpayers and businesses
with it.
I still believe the only way to fix our broken healthcare
system is to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety and let the private
sector and YOU be in charge.
The government has no business in your
healthcare decisions.

Reining in Executive Overreach
This month, the House has focused its efforts on ensuring the executive
branch isn't overstepping its Constitutional authority.
This
Presidency has been characterized by a willingness to use executive
powers to significantly change the law.
In some cases, the
Administration has simply chosen not to enforce existing legislation,
and the Attorney General recently encouraged states to do the same on
controversial issues.
While other Administrations may have issued more
executive orders, none have used this tool to influence such a broad
range of major policies.
That's why I supported the Faithful Execution
of the Law Act, which requires federal officials to report to Congress
whenever the Administration fails to fully enforce current law.

House
passes
H.R.
3060
for
hometown
hero
It
is
with
great
pleasure
that
I
announce
the
House
passed
my
bill,
H.R.
3060, last
week to
dedicate
the
post
office
facility
in
Burleson,
TX,
as
the
Sergeant
William
Moody
Post
Office
Building.
The
bill
now
awaits
Senate
action.
Sgt.
Moody
is
truly
a
hometown
hero.
Raised
in
Burleson,
Sgt.
Moody
joined
the
Marines
after
graduating
from
Burleson
High
School.
He
served
two
tours
of
duty
in
Iraq,
and
later
joined
the
Army
where
he
deployed
twice
to
Afghanistan.
Throughout
his
years
of
service,
Sgt.
Moody&#8217;s
commendable
service
earned
him
numerous
honors
and
service
medals,
including
the
Global
War
on
Terror
Service
Medal,
a
Bronze
Star
and
a
Purple
Heart.
On
June
18th,
2013,
Sgt.
Moody
was
killed
along
with
three
other
American
soldiers
as
a
result
of
indirect
enemy
fire
at
Bagram
Air
Base
in
Afghanistan.
He
leaves
behind
a
wife
and
three
children.
This
dedication
of
this
Post
Office
building
will
not
only
serve
as
a
memorial
for
his
family
to
cherish,
but
as
a
reminder
of
the
true
price
of
freedom.
Sgt.
Moody
fought
with
courage,
served
with
integrity,
and
will
be
remembered
forever.

Obama&#8217;s
changes
to
Obamacare
Last week,
the
Obama
administration
has
extended
yet
another
deadline
for
Obamacare.
This
time
it&#8217;s
the
deadline
to
enroll
before
the
previous
March
31st
deadline.
This
comes
just
days
after
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Kathleen
Sebelius
told
Congress
that
the
administration
would
absolutely
not
push
back
this
deadline.
With
a
disastrous
rollout
of
the
Obamacare
website
and
bleak
enrollment
numbers,
it&#8217;s
no
surprise
that
the
administration
is
in
panic
mode.
This
law
was
a
disaster
from
the
start,
and
it
continues
to
fall
apart.
The
worst
part
is
that
it&#8217;s
taking
hardworking
taxpayers
and
businesses
with
it.
I
still
believe
the
only
way
to
fix
our
broken
healthcare
system
is
to
get
rid
of
Obamacare
in
its
entirety
and
let
the
private
sector
and
YOU
be
in
charge.
The
government
has
no
business
in
your
healthcare
decisions.
Reining
in
Executive
Overreach
This
month,
the
House
has
focused
its
efforts
on
ensuring
the
executive
branch
isn&#8217;t
overstepping
its
Constitutional
authority.
This
Presidency
has
been
characterized
by
a
willingness
to
use
executive
powers
to
significantly
change
the
law.
In
some
cases,
the
Administration
has
simply
chosen
not
to
enforce
existing
legislation,
and
the
Attorney
General
recently
encouraged
states
to
do
the
same
on
controversial
issues.
While
other
Administrations
may
have
issued
more
executive
orders,
none
have
used
this
tool
to
influence
such
a
broad
range
of
major
policies.
That&#8217;s
why
I
supported
the
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act,
which
requires
federal
officials
to
report
to
Congress
whenever
the
Administration
fails
to
fully
enforce
current
law.
