Dear Friends,
This week I chaired a Homeland Security Committee hearing on the crisis
of unaccompanied children crossing the border. I told the Secretary of
Homeland Security that the administration needs to create a deterrent
to stop this from continuing and recommended they explore the option of
allowing the National Guard to assist in securing the border. You can
watch the exchange below.
I also spoke about the outcome of the hearing on Fox News and CNN on
Tuesday. You can watch the clips below.
Last Sunday I discussed the crisis in Iraq and the danger the
extremists pose to national security and the homeland on Meet the
Press. You can watch the clip below.
The House of Representatives also passed a series of important Energy
Reform bills which are crucial in developing an "all of the above"
national energy policy that will increase domestic production and
create thousands of jobs.
The North American Energy Infrastructure Act
eliminates presidential permit requirements for pipelines, like the
Keystone XL Pipeline, that cross international borders and places hard
deadlines for their approval. This would help with the approval process
for future pipelines.
The Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act
will end the Obama Administration's stranglehold on U.S. national
gas exports to help lessen our European allies' dependence on Russian
energy and create jobs in America.
The Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act
requires the Department of the
Interior to open up public lands and the outer-continental shelf to
energy exploration in order to increase domestic production and drive
down gas prices in America.
