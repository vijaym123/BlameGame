When I first thought about running for the Senate, the DSCC told me that I&rsquo;d probably need to raise $20-30 million to win.
David &mdash; When I first thought about running for the Senate, the DSCC told me that I&rsquo;d probably need to raise $20-30 million to win.
I was shocked. I&rsquo;d never run for office; my only fundraising experience was selling cookies with my daughter&rsquo;s Girl Scout troop. Besides, my Republican opponent &mdash; Scott Brown &mdash; had a $10 million head start.
Here&rsquo;s the most unbelievable part: The DSCC was wrong about needing to raise $20 million.
It actually took our campaign $42 million to go toe-to-toe with Scott Brown and fight back against the right-wing attacks.
If that&rsquo;s what it took to win a Senate campaign in Massachusetts, imagine what we&rsquo;ll need to win in states like Ohio, Illinois, or Nevada &mdash; states we need to take back the Democratic majority in the Senate in 2016.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for your help today. The DSCC needs to raise $154,000 from grassroots donors like you in the next 14 hours to build the early groundwork they need to win back the Senate.
Donate now.
We have a clear choice ahead of us: We can sit back, whine, and complain about the Koch brothers and the other powerful interests shoveling money into our Republican opponents&#39; campaigns. Or we can stand up and fight.
Me? I&rsquo;m going to fight. Are you with me?
I know all too well what it&rsquo;s like to be running against someone with a $10 million fundraising head start. But I also know that when thousands of grassroots supporters chip in $5 or $10 at a time, we can stand up to even the most powerful interests and win.
So please, will you chip in today?
