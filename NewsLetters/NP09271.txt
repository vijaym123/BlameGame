Senator Johnson
Commemorates Memorial Day
As
most of us take a day off from our workday routines, may we all pause to
remember that the ordinary, peaceful life of our country is a gift
bought by the men and women of Americas armed forces who laid down
their lives in defense of the nation. We can never fully repay our debt to
the more than 1 million service members who died to defend this
incredible experiment in liberty that is America. But on Memorial Day, we
can remember their sacrifice and commit ourselves to understanding and
supporting the freedom they gave us.

Ron's Constituent Outreach
Ron held a lengthy discussion
with more than 40 stakeholders regarding the state of the timber
industry at the Wood Technology Center of Excellence in Antigo.
Representatives of federal, state, county and tribal forests, the timber
industry, the paper industry, the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation, the Wisconsin Towns Association, small business owners and private
woodland owners discussed forestry management and the supply of timber
in northern Wisconsin.
Ron went to Sun Prairie, where he gave his State of the Nation
presentation, which highlights the fiscal challenges our country faces
today.
Following the presentation, he took questions from the
audience.
