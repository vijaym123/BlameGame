The President's Missed Opportunity
This week President Obama gave his annual State of the Union address. I went in hopeful he would extend an olive branch and say he wants to work with Congress, not against us. But he didn't. It was a missed opportunity to rally the country around bipartisan solutions. The challenges of our time require new solutions that empower hardworking Americans, not grow the size of Washingtons bloated bureaucracies by raising taxes and creating more unfunded programs. For more of my reaction to the President's speech,
