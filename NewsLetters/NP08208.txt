Dear
Friends,
One year ago today, over
two-thirds of my Senate
colleagues voted to pass S.
744, Border Security,
Economic Opportunity, and
Immigration Modernization
Act, a bipartisan bill that
would modernize our
immigration system,
strengthen our borders and
ports of entry, enhance our
national security in a manner
that is practical, humane and
fair and grow our
economy by almost one
trillion
dollars.
In Delaware, we just
celebrated the 376th
anniversary of the arrival of
the first Swedes and Finns on
the shores of the Christina
River. These immigrants
came to our country many
years ago to live what we now
call the American
Dream
the
remarkable idea that,
regardless of your background
or station in life, you can
come to this country, work
hard, and build a better life
for you and your family.
Today, we still see
millions of immigrants, from
all parts of the world,
coming to America to achieve
the American Dream. The
promise of the American Dream
is such a strong draw that
some immigrants are even
willing to risk life and limb
to achieve that dream in an
unlawful way. We need only to
look at the recent crisis at
our Southern Border where
thousands of families and
young children, mainly from
Central America, are willing
to make a treacherous journey
of thousands of miles to
reunite with their families
and try to live a better
life. This is not a problem
we can ignore
it is a
crisis that can only be
solved through action that
addresses the root causes of
this complex problem.
The Senates bill,
although not perfect, is a
significant improvement over
the status quo and provides
our nation with the policies
and resources needed to
address the estimated 11
million undocumented people
living in the shadows.
That is why now, more than
ever, it is time for my
colleagues in the House of
Representatives to follow the
Senates lead and take
up comprehensive immigration
reform. Fixing a broken
system is far too important
to allow partisanship to get
in the way.
I urge my colleagues in
the House of Representatives
to act.
Sincerely,
Stay Connected with
Senator Carper
