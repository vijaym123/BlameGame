American Veterans Deserve
the Highest Quality Care
Dear Friend:
The brave men and women of our Armed Forces have sacrificed so much, putting their lives on the line to keep the nation safe and secure. As veterans, they deserve nothing less than the best quality care
theyve earned it.
Unfortunately, our current veterans care system is in disarray and is failing to meet the needs of those who served. In fact, a recent nationwide audit found that 57,000 of our veterans have been waiting more than 90 days for an appointment, and that an additional 64,000 have fallen through the cracks. That is just unacceptable and we need a fix right away.
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4810, the
Veteran Access to Care Act , which expands veteran access to medical care in the private sector if they are unable to get it within the VA system. This legislation, which passed the House of Representatives this week by a unanimous vote, provides immediate relief now until a thorough investigation and overhaul of the VA can be completed.
Specifically, H.R. 4810 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter contracts with non-VA facilities to provide care for veterans who: 1) reside more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility; 2) have waited longer than the time goals established by VA for a medical appointment; or 3) have been notified by VA that an appointment is not available within the Departments current wait-time goals.
The
Veteran Access to Care Act
also requires the Secretary to contract with an independent entity to conduct an assessment of the health care provided in VA medical facilities; report the findings and recommendations of the assessment to Congress; and submit a report on the assessment, including an action plan and timeline for full implementation of the assessments recommendations. Lastly, H.R. 4810 eliminates performance awards and bonuses for all VA employees.
Just as our soldiers are given the best training and resources for the battlefield, so too do they deserve the best treatment and care when they return home. Our veterans, current service members, and their families all deserve better, and we must see to it that our veterans care system lives up to those it is suppose to serve.
God bless,
