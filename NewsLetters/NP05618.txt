Dear Friend,
In preparation for Veterans Day, we've joined the Veterans Heritage
Project and will be sharing stories of local veterans' service on our
website and in our newsletter.
Veterans Day isn't the only day we should be honoring those who have
served and Veterans Heritage Project has taken that to heart with their
year-round promise to promote the lives of our heroes. Veterans
Heritage Project is an Arizona-based nonprofit dedicated to connecting
student writers with Veterans in an effort to preserve and record
their stories of service.
In its 11 years, nearly 500 students in the
Veterans Heritage Project have interviewed more than 875 Arizona
Veterans.
Veterans stories are published in annual
books that are submitted to the Library of Congress, in Washington
D.C.
Students from schools across the Valley and Arizona learn the art
of interviewing and communication, while preserving American
history.
If you are interested in learning
more about the Veterans Heritage Project or want to get involved,
go online here . Or, you can
email the Director, Barbara Hatch,
at barbara@veteransheritage.org.
We will send you an email
each Wednesday with the featured story of the week. We hope you enjoy
this glimpse into the lives of those who have sacrificed so
much!
Until
Wednesday,
