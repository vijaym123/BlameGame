Dear Friend,
I am writing to ask you to
sign a petition
on my website that urges the Food and Drug Administration to regulate e-cigarettes.
Recent research
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that e-cigarette use among teenagers tripled over two years.
We know
that e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug that can have adverse effects on adolescent brain development. Additionally, e-cigarettes could ultimately be a gateway for children to become smokers of regular cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
found
that young people who have never smoked a conventional cigarette are twice as likely to have intentions to start smoking after using e-cigarettes.
A rule proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April would allow the agency to finally regulate e-cigarettes, and would also subject e-cigarettes to many, but not all, of the same federal regulations that currently apply to traditional cigarettes, including: banning sales to children under 18, requiring disclosure of product ingredients, and prohibiting manufacturers from claiming their products are less harmful than traditional cigarettes without scientific evidence supporting their claims. The FDA should finalize this rule to protect our nation's youth.
I will forward the petition to the FDA, but will include only your first name and the city or town in which you live. So if you feel as strongly as I do about protecting children from nicotine and tobacco,
please click here
to sign my petition and to share your thoughts about why this matters to you.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
