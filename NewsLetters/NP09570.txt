Dear Friends,
I am proud to join
with my colleagues this May to observe Lupus Awareness Month, a time
where we work to increase public understanding of this cruel
mystery.
This disease affects approximately 28,000 individuals in South
Florida and almost 1.5 million Americans nationwide. With symptoms
that imitate many other illnesses, lupus is extremely difficult to
diagnose, making it one of the nations most devastating, yet misunderstood,
diseases.
Lupus is a disabling, life diminishing,
and life threatening condition that can cause inflammation and tissue
damage to virtually any organ system in the body. It usually develops
anywhere between age 15 and 44. Of those who are diagnosed, 90% are
women and it affects minorities 2 to 3 times more than Caucasians.
Comprehensive and definitive studies are needed to better understand these
health disparities and try to close these gaps.
My
stepdaughter was diagnosed with Lupus and I know the toll this disease takes on
family members as well. The uncertainty before the diagnosis and the
lack of treatment options are stressful for the patient and the family
members alike.
Along with my fellow Co-Chairs of the
Congressional Lupus Caucus, Tom Rooney, Bill Keating, and Jim Moran, I am
committed to increasing awareness about Lupus to continue research and
find treatment options and a cure for this terrible disease. I am
confident that through our combined efforts, we can ensure a healthier and
more prosperous nation, especially for those in our South Florida
community.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
