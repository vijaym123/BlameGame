Congressman Cook's Statement on Secretary Shinseki's Resignation
Congressman Paul Cook issued the following statement in response to
Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation:
"I welcome the resignation of Secretary Shinseki. The time has come for
new leadership. Accountability must come from the top and it's clear
that the entire leadership of the VA needs to be held accountable.
"This sets the stage for the nomination and confirmation of a new
Secretary who will have a mandate and a duty to carry out serious
systemic reforms. The culture of callousness that has developed at the
VA must end immediately, and I look forward to working with the new
leadership and my fellow members of Congress to implement real reform.
America's veterans have kept their promises to our nation, and I'm
determined to ensure that we keep our promises to them."
Improving and Expanding Care to Veterans
Last Wednesday, Congressman Cook voted in favor of a number of measures
to help veterans, as he always does. H.R. 4261, the Gulf War Health
Research Reform Act, will help provide better care for Gulf War
veterans. H.R. 2527 will provide veterans with counseling and treatment
for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training. H.R.
2942 will reestablish the Professional Certification and Licensure
Advisory Committee, which helps veterans transition to civilian life by
advising the Secretary of the VA on what licensing and certification
courses veterans can use their G.I. Benefits to cover.
Said Cook, "While recent scandals have highlighted the need to hold VA
officials accountable, it's important that we don't lose sight of our
mission to help America's veterans. These bills will help veterans
transitioning back to civilian life, and I'm proud to support this
worthy legislation."
Congressman Cook Participates in a Hearing Investigating Phoenix VA
Scandal
Last week, Congressman Cook participated in a hearing in the House
Committee on Veterans Affairs that investigated the allegations of
secret waitlists at the Phoenix Veterans Administration (VA) Medical
Center. Members of the committee questioned Dr. Thomas Lynch, Assistant
Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Clinical Operations, Joan Mooney,
Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs, and
Michael Huff, Congressional Relations Officer, about the existence of
an unofficial waitlist, the destruction of that list, and the failures
of the Veterans Administrations to address these problems immediately.
Said Cook, "We're now five weeks into this scandal and 23 veterans are
dead from manipulated schedules and secret waitlists, but the VA's only
response is that the lawyers are handling it and say they can't talk
about it. The VA works for America's veterans, not for the lawyers. We
can't accept excuses anymore, it's time to stand up for our veterans
and keep the promises we made to them. This hearing made it clear that
there's no sense of urgency among the leadership of the VA and its
business as usual. This is totally unacceptable."

District Update
Honoring Veterans In California's 8th District
Last week, Congressman Cook held the Heroes of the 8th Awards Ceremony.
The event commended 48 veterans living in the district who served
bravely from World War II through the present.
These veterans were recognized for a variety of reasons including
distinguished service, post-military community involvement, and
volunteer work for causes and organizations that serve veterans. Edward
Acosta, Bob Spogona, and M.J. "Mac" Dube were all recognized
posthumously for exemplary service on and off the battlefield.
Cook said, "It was truly an honor to be in the presence of so many
great Americans. No matter where or when they served, all service
members deserve recognition and appreciation for fighting to defend us
all. This is the land of the free because of the brave and I won't soon
forget the sacrifice made by our nation's finest."
Helping Vets get Access to Care
My office can be a resource for helping veterans navigate government
bureaucracy. Here is one example of how I was able to help a veteran
get a necessary surgery in a timely manner.
After it came to my attention that a veteran needed help getting a
procedure scheduled, I directed my caseworkers to contact the
Department of Veterans Affairs on his behalf. After working with the
department, my staff was able to get him into surgery within the two
weeks. I'm proud that my staff was able to help this veteran get the
service he was owed and if you know of any veterans having difficulties
with the VA, I would urge you to have them contact my district office
at 760-247-1815 to speak to my caseworkers.

Congressman
Cook
Participates

a
Hearing
Investigating
Phoenix
VA
Scandal
Last
week,
Congressman
Cook
participated
in
a
hearing
in
the
House
Committee
on
Veterans
Affairs
that
investigated
the
allegations
of
secret
waitlists
at
the
Phoenix
Veterans
Administration
(VA)
Medical
Center.
Members
of
the
committee
questioned
Dr.
Thomas
Lynch,
Assistant
Deputy
Under
Secretary
for
Health
for
Clinical
Operations,
Joan
Mooney, Assistant
Secretary
for
Congressional
and
Legislative
Affairs,
and
Michael
Huff,
Congressional
Relations
Officer,
about
the
existence
of
an
unofficial
waitlist,
the
destruction
of
that list,
and
the
failures
of
the Veterans
Administrations
to
address
these
problems
immediately.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;We&#8217;re
now
five
weeks
into
this
scandal
and
23
veterans
are
dead
from
manipulated
schedules
and
secret
waitlists,
but
the
VA&#8217;s
only
response
is
that
the
lawyers
are
handling
it
and
say
they
can&#8217;t
talk
about
it.
The
VA
works
for
America&#8217;s
veterans,
not
for
the
lawyers.
We
can&#8217;t
accept
excuses
anymore,
it&#8217;s
time
to
stand
up
for
our
veterans
and
keep
the
promises
we
made
to
them.
This
hearing
made
it
clear
that
there&#8217;s
no
sense
of
urgency
among
the
leadership
of
the
VA
and
its
business
as
usual.
This
is
totally
unacceptable."
