Dear Friend,
As I travel around Northeast Ohio, I
continue to hear that small businesses are
struggling to comply with the
presidents health care law. That
challenge is even greater for small,
seasonal employers.
The presidents health care law
requires that employers with 50 or more
full-time employees, or full-time
equivalents, offer health care coverage or
pay a fine. Largely designed with
traditional jobs in mind, the health care
laws employer provisions fail to
account for the exceptional circumstances
of employers with highly seasonal
workforces. Though the Treasury Department
attempted to remedy these issues through
regulation, the resulting rules are
confusing and create unnecessary obstacles
to compliance for small, seasonal
employers. Based on current law and
regulation, a seasonal worker is not
necessarily a seasonal employee.
David, who owns a small business in
Ohio, is experiencing first-hand the overly
burdensome provisions within the health
care law. He has several full-time
employees and hires an additional 40 or
more seasonal employees during his busy
spring season. Once he hires seasonal
employees, he runs the risk of being
required to perform complex calculations to
determine if his business qualifies as a
large or small business in order to meet
compliance. He told me he cant
afford to hire an employee to handle human
resources and sort through all of the
paperwork.
As a former small business owner myself,
I know how difficult it is to navigate our
convoluted tax code and the amount of time
and money thats associated with
compliance. That is why I introduced the
Simplifying Technical Aspects Regarding
Seasonality (STARS) Act. This legislation
replaces the complex, arbitrary seasonal
worker exemption with one definition of
seasonal employment. This simplified
standard is consistent across industries
and will reduce the administrative burden
for small businesses and help them to avoid
hefty penalties under the presidents
health care law.
The STARS Act is commonsense, bipartisan
legislation that will bring much-needed
clarity and flexibility to seasonal
employers, allowing them to focus on
growing their businesses and investing in
their employees instead of devoting their
limited resources to deciphering the
presidents health care law.
