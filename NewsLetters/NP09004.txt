VA Mismanagement :
As another
Memorial Day passes, let us pledge to our veterans that we will not
rest until they have a Department of Veterans Affairs worthy of their
service and sacrifice.
The mismanagement at the VA goes
beyond phony waiting lists, it is a widespread epidemic. The story does
not end with the resignation of Secretary Shinseki. Veterans are waiting
for results, not scapegoats from their Commander-in-Chief.
The
President needs to show he is capable of leading. This is not a
partisan or political issue; this is an American tragedy that we need to
fix. We owe it to our older veterans, we owe it to those who are coming
back home today, and we owe it to our future heroes who will serve our
country.
The House took the first step in passing the
VA Management and Accountability Act, and despite more than 160 House
Democrats voting for the bill, the Senate has blocked it. If
President Obama is serious about bringing real accountability and change to
the VA, I encourage him to urge the Senate to pass the House
legislation, and continue to work with Congress to put this scandal behind us and
provide the highest quality care to our nations
heroes.
529
College Savings Legislation on 5/29 :
The
class of 2014 just graduated with the highest student loan debt ever
recorded. These students will leave school with an
average $33,000
to pay back, nearly double the amount borrowers had to
pay 20 years ago.
I have introduced two bipartisan bills to
help families save for college by improving upon 529 saving plans.
This week, as we marked 529 day, I highlighted steps we can take to
address the smothering amounts of student loan debt for future
generations.
H.R. 529 and H.R. 4333 are bipartisan, sensible steps in
making the college savings process easier. Saving for our childrens
college education is one of the most important, and at times, most
difficult aspects of being a parent. My legislation will not only make that
process easier, but will make higher education a real opportunity for
all Americans.
Jobs &amp; the Economy Remain
Our Priority :
Hardworking Americans continue to
suffer in this Obama economy. Costs for everyday things like gas,
groceries, and electricity continue to rise, while household incomes
remain stagnant.
Americans are fed up with the new normal, where
folks are paying more for everything, while taking home
less.
Instead of campaign rhetoric and pet projects that have become a
standard for folks across the aisle, I urge the President to call on
the Senate to pass the dozens of jobs bills that are currently
collecting dust on Harry Reids desk. Bills like the Regulatory Accountability
Act, the SKILLS Act, the Working Families Flexibility Act, and the
Save American Workers Act.
Americans need a plan, and we have
one. To watch my remarks at a Republican Leadership press conference,

Pictures
from the week:
This week I had the pleasure of
meeting Tina Woods, a student at KU who traveled to DC as part of
National Foster Care month. Tina spent 6 years in the Kansas foster care
system, and is now an advocate for youth in foster care. She is the
current President of the Kansas Youth Advisory Council, and spends her
time offering council and solutions to help improve the quality of our
states foster care system. Thank you Tina for your hard work and
advocacy efforts!
On Friday morning, I welcomed the Holland family
from Leavenworth County to my office for a Capitol tour. Their eldest
son was a participant in the Scripps National Spelling Bee at National
Harbor, Maryland.
If you are visiting DC this Summer I
encourage you to contact my office to set up a Capitol tour and sign my
chalkboard wall!
