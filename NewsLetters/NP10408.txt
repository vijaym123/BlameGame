Dear Friends,
Carolyn and I would like to wish each and every one of you a Happy
Easter. May you and your family be blessed with peace and joy today and
everyday.
District Work Period:
The first half of my district work period has been very productive.
Everyday, I am meeting people around the district - individuals, small
businesses, community groups - and I consider myself lucky to represent
the best district in Florida.
I hosted a town hall in Gainesville at the beginning of last week and
will be hosting another tomorrow in Lake City. I hope you will be able
to attend. I really enjoy these meetings and the opportunity to hear
what is on your mind. I can't tell you how helpful they are for me when
I travel back to Washington to represent you. If you are unable to
attend a town hall meeting I hope you will attend our mobile office
hours, which are hosted by our very attentive district team members.
Notifications for these are on my Facebook page or you can call my
offices in Gainesville (352-505-0838) and Orange Park (904-276-9626)
for dates and details.
Taking Action Against Tax Fraud:
Last week I took proactive steps to combat the issue of identity
theft-related tax fraud. Thirty-six of my House colleagues - a
bipartisan group - signed on in support of my letter
to the
acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner, John Koskinen,
urging him to make combating this problem a top priority.
In July 2012, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) found 1.5 million potentially fraudulent tax returns in 2011,
resulting in $5.2 billion in losses to the Treasury. Identity
theft-related tax fraud is exploding in our country and it needs to
stop. Taking proactive steps and conducting proper oversight will save
billions of dollars. We must do all we can to prevent millions of
Americans from being victimized.
In addition to the fraudulent tax returns, there are reports from TIGTA
about the fraudulent use of Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs),
which resulted in 23,944 of them being mailed to a single address in
Atlanta. This one example cost the American taxpayer $46.3 million.
This should infuriate people as it has infuriated me. I want to know,
along with all Americans, what immediate and future actions the IRS is
going to take to stop this abuse.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. I look forward
to speaking with you next week.
Sincerely,
Ted

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
Carolyn
and
I
would
like
to
wish
each
and
every
one
of
you
a
Happy
Easter.
May
you
and
your
family
be
blessed
with
peace
and
joy
today
and
everyday.
District
Work
Period:
The
first
half
of
my
district
work
period
has
been
very
productive.
Everyday,
I
am
meeting
people
around
the
district
-
individuals,
small
businesses,
community
groups
-
and
I
consider
myself
lucky
to
represent
the
best
district
in
Florida.
I
hosted
a
town
hall
in
Gainesville
at
the
beginning
of
last
week
and
will
be
hosting
another
tomorrow
in
Lake
City.
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
attend.
I
really
enjoy
these
meetings
and
the
opportunity
to
hear
what
is
on
your
mind.
I
can&#8217;t
tell
you
how
helpful
they
are
for
me
when
I
travel
back
to
Washington
to
represent
you.
If
you
are
unable
to
attend
a
town
hall
meeting
I
hope
you
will
attend
our
mobile
office
hours,
which
are
hosted
by
our
very
attentive
district
team
members.
Notifications
for
these
are
on
my
Facebook
page
or
you
can
call
my
offices

Taking
Action
Against
Tax
Fraud:
Last
week
I
took
proactive
steps
to
combat
the
issue
of
identity
theft-related
tax
fraud.
Thirty-six
of
my
House
colleagues
-
a
bipartisan
group
-
signed
on
in
support
of
my
letter
to
the
acting
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
Commissioner,
John
Koskinen,
urging
him
to
make
combating
this
problem
a
top
priority.
In
July
2012,
the
Treasury
Inspector
General
for
Tax
Administration
(TIGTA)
found
1.5
million
potentially
fraudulent
tax
returns
in
2011,
resulting
in
$5.2
billion
in
losses
to
the
Treasury.
Identity
theft-related
tax
fraud
is
exploding
in
our
country
and
it
needs
to
stop.
Taking
proactive
steps
and
conducting
proper
oversight
will
save
billions
of
dollars.
We
must
do
all
we
can
to
prevent
millions
of
Americans
from
being
victimized.
In
addition
to
the
fraudulent
tax
returns,
there
are
reports
from
TIGTA
about
the
fraudulent
use
of
Taxpayer
Identification
Numbers
(TINs),
which
resulted
in
23,944
of
them
being
mailed
to
a
single
address
in
Atlanta.
This
one
example
cost
the
American
taxpayer
$46.3
million.
This
should
infuriate
people
as
it
has
infuriated
me.
I
want
to
know,
along
with
all
Americans,
what
immediate
and
future
actions
the
IRS
is
going
to
take
to
stop
this
abuse.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
newsletter.
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
next
week.
