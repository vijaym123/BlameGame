Dear David,
I wanted to take a moment to give you a brief update on what I've been
up to these past couple of weeks. But first, I want to take moment and
reflect on the meaning of Memorial Day.
I served in the Army and deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Between
those tours, I had the honor-a solemn honor-of serving at The Old Guard
at Arlington National Cemetery. Our main responsibility was military
honors funerals. But every Memorial Day weekend, The Old Guard walks
through the cemetery and places a flag at every gravesite-hundreds of
thousands of graves. These flags are a symbolic reminder that we will
never forget the sacrifices of our fallen comrades, nor the cause for
which they fought. Tomorrow, let us all join in this memory of our
valiant countrymen and celebration of our great country.
Between newsletters, don't forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook
page for daily updates! As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply
want to express your opinion. I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,
>From the House Floor
H.R. 4435:the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015
This week, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act,
legislation to provide necessary authorities and funding for our
military. Unfortunately, President Obama has made significant cuts to
our military in recent years, but this bill will ensure they are
supported within the budget limits for the upcoming year.
H.R. 4031: the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability
Act
Our veterans deserve the very best and the recent problems at the
Department of Veterans Affairs are unacceptable. This week, the House
passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability
Act, legislation that brings much needed accountability to the VA by
making it easier to remove or demote senior leaders who are failing to
live up to their responsibilities to our service men and women.
H.R. 3361:the USA Freedom Act
The USA Freedom Act makes reforms to certain government intelligence
gathering programs to better protect the privacy of Americans. In
particular, it ends the bulk collection of Americans' records. It also
creates a new, narrowly-tailored authority for the collection of call
records and imposes new limitations and safeguards to protect civil
liberties while preserving national security capabilities.
Combating Sex Trafficking:
Human trafficking is an egregious-and unfortunately all too common-crime
in the United States. In the first 6 months of 2013, a staggering 69
percent of all trafficking cases in Arkansas reported to the National
Human Trafficking Resource Center were related to sex trafficking. The
problem is only getting worse. This week the House passed a package of
bills aimed at reversing this trend. These bills include H.R. 3530:the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, H.R. 3610: the Stop
Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, H.R. 4225: the Stop Advertising
to Victims of Exploitation Act, H.R.4058:the Preventing Sex Trafficking
and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act, and H.R.
4573, International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex
Trafficking Act. Read my statement here

Rep. Cotton with members of the Arkansas AARP Chapter
Committee Spotlight
This week the House Financial Services Committee
Financial Institutions subcommittee held a hearing
on legislative proposals to improve transparency and accountability at
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Created in 2010 by President
Obama and his liberal allies in Congress, this agency has unprecedented
power and authority that could affect all types of financial products
from credit cards to car loans, and is not subject to the traditional
checks and balances set up by the Constitution. I'm working with my
colleagues to reform the CFPB so its regulatory actions would be
subject to oversight by taxpayers' representatives in Congress, which
could limit the burdens the agency is putting on businesses such as
community banks and car dealers in Arkansas.
Also this week, the Financial Services Committee passed a number of
regulatory relief bills to reduce the government red tape that is
making it needlessly difficult for small businesses to grow and create
jobs. Additionally, the legislation would provide clarity to community
banks and credit unions who are struggling to serve customers as a
result of rules written by Washington bureaucrats. I will continue to
work with my colleagues to ensure that these bills are soon considered
in the full House.
This week the House Foreign Affairs Committee
held a hearing examining the U.S.-Mexico relationship.
Members of the Committee were able to question Obama Administration
officials about the steps being taken to improve economic and security
relations with Mexico. The Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade
Subcommittee also looked at the enduring threat of al-Qaeda in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. The U.S. and our allies have fought al-Qaeda
and their affiliates on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border
for over a decade, making significant progress along the way. As U.S.
troops prepare to leave Afghanistan, we must not lose sight of the
progress that's been made. We must continue to examine the presence of
al-Qaeda in the region and its relationship with local extremist
groups. On Wednesday, the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee
held a hearing on the ongoing and unprecedented humanitarian crisis in
Syria and later looked at the multilateral cooperation with the Arab
Gulf states.
Fighting Back Against Obamacare: Stopping Insurance Company Bailouts
Did you know that Obamacare contains a provision to bailout insurance
companies should they incur any financial losses under this unworkable
law? This provision is known as the Risk Corridor Program. It was
originally intended as a safety-net, and the Obama Administration
assured the public these bailouts would not negatively impact the
federal budget. Obamacare's opponents knew this wouldn't be the
reality. What this provision actually does is guarantee insurance
companies a profit-a nice exchange for their cooperation in the
President's healthcare overhaul.
But what's worse, President Obama's recent unlawful fixes to this
unworkable law have made these bailouts almost a certainty, and
taxpayers will be left footing the bill. The Administration has
repeatedly assured Congress the program would be deficit-neutral, but
recently admitted that was no longer the case. Last Friday evening,
they quietly announced new regulations
that would leave the door open to
additional bailouts for insurance companies. It's troubling that, yet
again, President Obama is moving the goal posts and sending the bill to
hard-working Arkansans. That is why I've sponsored H.R. 3541
, the No Bailouts for Insurance Companies
Act, legislation that prevents taxpayer bailouts of insurance companies
by ending Obamacare's risk corridor program. Rest assured, I will
continue to fight for full repeal and to save Arkansans from the worst
effects of this unworkable law.
Rep. Cotton discussing the Keystone pipeline at Welspun Tubular
Around Arkansas
Recently, I had the opportunity to tour Welspun Tubular to highlight
the importance of approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.Approving the
Keystone XL pipeline is a win for Arkansas's economy. The House voted
to approve the pipeline last year, but unfortunately it remains stalled
in the Senate, where it so far has yet to even be scheduled for debate.
Our underground pipeline infrastructure is aging and this is an
opportunity to replace it with state-of-the-art pipe, built right in
the Natural State. I was grateful for the opportunity to discuss this
important matter and appreciate Welspun's efforts. I will continue to
work to get the Keystone XL pipeline approved.
Spotlight: The Water Resources Reform and Development Act
This week, the House passed the Water Resources Reform and Development
Act
. Originally passed by the House
in October, the House worked with our colleagues in the Senate to
resolve differences between our two versions of the bill. I am pleased
with the final result, which ensures Arkansas waterways remain open for
business, while saving taxpayers money and increasing efficiency. This
legislation streamlines required environmental studies and caps the
time in which they must be completed, ultimately allowing for more
infrastructure projects. It also provides private businesses with the
flexibility to fund infrastructure development, providing additional
funding for projects across Arkansas.
The final legislation also included two amendments I offered last year
during debate on the House-passed version of this bill. The first
addresses a discrepancy between population growth and water supply in
small, rural communities. This amendment empowers communities across
Arkansas to determine the most cost-effective water-management strategy
for their needs. The second allows the Army Corps of Engineers to enter
into cooperative agreements with local groups such as Friends of Lake
Ouachita to maintain recreational facilities that would otherwise close
because of budget cuts. Rest assured I will continue to fight to keep
Arkansas's waterways open for business and recreation.

Boko Haram
On the night of April 14, up to 200 armed fighters of Boko Haram, a
U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization with ties to the
al-Qaeda network, stormed the northern Nigerian town of Chibok. And
abducted nearly 300 schoolgirls from the Chibok Government Girls
Secondary School. More than a month after their kidnapping, the
whereabouts of these young women is still unknown. The Nigerian
Government has been widely criticized for its slow response to the
abductions and its initial reluctance to embrace offers of
international assistance.
This week, the House passed a resolution condemning Boko Haram and
urging the President to strengthen U.S. cooperation with Nigerian
forces. On Wednesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on
Boko Haram and their growing threat throughout the region. The
Administration should use every tool at its disposal to ensure the safe
return of the women and to hold Boko Haram responsible for this heinous
crime. Likewise, I urge the Nigerian government to cooperate with the
U.S. and other nations who have offered their assistance.

This

to
question
Obama

about
the
steps
being

to
improve

The
Terrorism,

also
looked
at
the
enduring

and
their

on
both
sides

border
for
over

Fighting
Back
Against
Obamacare:
Stopping
Insurance
Company
Bailouts
Did
you
know
that
Obamacare
contains
a
provision
to
bailout
insurance
companies
should
they
incur
any
financial
losses
under
this
unworkable
law?
This
provision
is
known
as
the
Risk
Corridor
Program.
It
was
originally
intended
as
a
safety-net,
and
the
Obama
Administration
assured
the
public
these
bailouts
would
not
negatively
impact
the
federal
budget.
Obamacare&#8217;s
opponents
knew
this
wouldn&#8217;t
be
the
reality.
What
this
provision
actually
does
is
guarantee
insurance
companies
a
profit&#8212;a
nice
exchange
for
their
cooperation
in
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
overhaul.
But
what&#8217;s
worse,
President
Obama&#8217;s
recent
unlawful
fixes
to
this
unworkable
law
have
made
these
bailouts
almost
a
certainty,
and
taxpayers
will
be
left
footing
the
bill.
The
Administration
has
repeatedly
assured
Congress
the
program
would
be
deficit-neutral,
but
recently
admitted
that
was
no
longer
the
case.
Last
Friday
evening,
they
quietly
announced
new
regulations
that
would
leave
the
door
open
to
additional
bailouts
for
insurance
companies.
It&#8217;s
troubling
that,
yet
again,
President
Obama
is
moving
the
goal
posts
and
sending
the
bill
to
hard-working
Arkansans.
That
is
why
I&#8217;ve
sponsored
H.R.
3541 ,
the
No
Bailouts
for
Insurance
Companies
Act ,
legislation
that
prevents
taxpayer
bailouts
of
insurance
companies
by
ending
Obamacare&#8217;s
risk
corridor
program.
Rest
assured,
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
full
repeal
and
to
save
Arkansans
from
the
worst
effects
of
this
unworkable
law.
Rep.

discussing
the
Keystone
pipeline
at
Welspun
Tubular
Around
Arkansas
Recently,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
Welspun
Tubular
to
highlight
the
importance
of
approving
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline.Approving
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
is
a
win
for
Arkansas&#8217;s
economy.
The
House
voted
to
approve
the
pipeline
last
year,
but
unfortunately
it
remains
stalled
in
the
Senate,
where
it
so
far
has
yet
to
even
be
scheduled
for
debate.
Our
underground
pipeline
infrastructure
is
aging
and
this
is
an
opportunity
to
replace
it
with
state-of-the-art
pipe,
built
right
in
the
Natural
State.
I
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
important
matter
and
appreciate
Welspun&#8217;s
efforts.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
get
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
approved.
Spotlight:
The
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
This
week,
the
House
passed
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act .
Originally
passed
by
the
House
in
October,
the
House
worked
with
our
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
resolve
differences
between
our
two
versions
of
the
bill.
I
am
pleased
with
the
final
result,
which
ensures
Arkansas
waterways
remain
open
for
business,
while
saving
taxpayers
money
and
increasing
efficiency.
This
legislation
streamlines
required
environmental
studies
and
caps
the
time
in
which
they
must
be
completed,
ultimately
allowing
for
more
infrastructure
projects.
It
also
provides
private
businesses
with
the
flexibility
to
fund
infrastructure
development,
providing
additional
funding
for
projects
across
Arkansas.
The
final
legislation
also
included
two
amendments
I
offered
last
year
during
debate
on
the
House-passed
version
of
this
bill. The
first
addresses
a
discrepancy
between
population
growth
and
water
supply
in
small,
rural
communities.
This
amendment
empowers
communities
across
Arkansas
to
determine
the
most
cost-effective
water-management
strategy
for
their
needs.
The
second
allows
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
enter
into
cooperative
agreements
with
local
groups
such
as
Friends
of
Lake
Ouachita
to
maintain
recreational
facilities
that
would
otherwise
close
because
of
budget
cuts. Rest
assured
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
keep
Arkansas&#8217;s
waterways
open
for
business
and
recreation.

a

slow
response
to
the
abductions
and
its
initial
reluctance
to
embrace
offers
of
international
assistance.
This
week,
the
House
passed
a
resolution
condemning
Boko
Haram
and
urging
the
President
to
strengthen
U.S.
cooperation
with
Nigerian
forces.
On
Wednesday,
the
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
held
a
hearing
on
Boko
Haram
and
their
growing
threat
throughout
the
region.
The
Administration
should
use
every
tool
at
its
disposal
to
ensure
the
safe
return
of
the
women
and
to
hold
Boko
Haram
responsible
for
this
heinous
crime.
Likewise,
I
urge
the
Nigerian
government
to
cooperate
with
the
U.S.
and
other
nations
who
have
offered
their
assistance.
Don&#8217;t
Forget!
My
staff
will
be

Assistance

in

and
