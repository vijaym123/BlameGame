Dear Friend,
The 100-day evaluation is a marker in U.S. politics
superficial sometimes, though often a leading indicator of whether the year will be shaped only by partisan confrontations or if it will feature a decent dose of actual governing.
In the first 100 days of Americas new Republican-led Congress, this period has seen real progress on the American peoples priorities, including:
The first real entitlement reforms in nearly two decades through a bipartisan repeal of Medicares Sustainable Growth Rate;
New mental health resources to help prevent veteran suicides;
Stopping the presidents tax on college savings;
Putting a jobs bill to build the Keystone pipeline on the presidents desk;
Nearing completion on a budget that will balance within 10 years;
Passing a package of reforms to stop human trafficking; and
House-passed bills to restore the 40 hour work week for middle-class workers; expand liquefied natural gas exports; make permanent small business tax relief; stop IRS abuse; and much more.
We have much more to do, and just yesterday, committee leaders in the House and Senate introduced trade legislation to help create more jobs and opportunities for Americas families and small businesses.
I am optimistic that we have moved away from being a divided Congress and will continue to work on the priorities that Americans want.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
