Dear Friend:
As you know, last night President Obama announced a historic executive action on immigration.

I applaud the President for stepping up and taking bold and constitutional action to bring people out of the shadows, thereby strengthening our economy and keeping families from being torn apart. These steps will increase border security and hold people accountable by requiring them to undergo background checks and pay taxes.
President Obama has waited patiently for 17 months for House Republicans to act on a bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by two-thirds of the Senate. It is one thing if Republicans in Congress don't want to do their job, but they can't expect the President not to do his job.
This President is following in the footsteps of every president of the last 70 years - including every Republican President - by taking executive action on immigration.
If Republicans do not like the President's actions, they shouldn't be threatening to shut down the government or file wasteful lawsuits - they should just take up and pass the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform bill now.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
