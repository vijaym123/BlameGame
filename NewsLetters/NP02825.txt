How concerned are you
with the federal debt and Washington's spending? I want to hear from you. Very Concerned Somewhat Concerned Not Concerned Unsure *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to

Friends,
Weve all heard the phrase,
If you find yourself in a
hole, quit digging .
Unfortunately, when President Obama
unearthed his budget proposal this week, we were reminded that this common
sense advice too often falls on deaf ears in Washington.
I
had hoped the President would use this opportunity to finally address
our nations fiscal challenges and offer solutions to the people who
are suffering under the Obama economy, but his plan makes it obvious
that hes more interested in his kick-the-can-down-the-road,
business-as-usual
approach.
Washingtons reckless spending has landed us in a hole of more than $18
trillion of debt.
Written in full, we are talking about more than
$18,000,000,000,000
thats a staggering, almost
incomprehensible number. To put it into perspective, thats more than
$56,000 debt for you and every other man, woman and child in the United
States. The numbers speak for themselves and help paint a truly troubling
picture of the fiscal crisis we face. But for me, its more than the
numbers, charts and graphs.
Its about real people Ive met
and listened to who are playing by the rules, but barely keeping their
heads above water.
Its about a couple in North Carolina who
both work part-time jobs and worry if theyre going to be able to pay
the bills this month. Its about a mother in our district who is
fighting to provide a better life for her children, but struggling to make
ends meet.
These are the constant
worries and anxieties felt by real people right here at home.
Unfortunately, President Obama just doesnt get it.
Our
economy is experiencing the slowest recovery since World War II - one that
hasnt touched the lives of too many families in North Carolina.
We have to climb out of this rut and get the economy growing
faster, and that starts with putting the shovel
down.
As I reviewed the Presidents $4
trillion budget, four nonstarters stood out to
me:
First, the Presidents budget never balances.
EVER . North Carolina families balance their own budgets, and they
expect and deserve the same from their
government.
Second, it increases the national debt by $8.5 trillion.
This
is simply irresponsible and leads us further down an unsustainable
path.
Third, the Presidents budget increases
taxes by $2.1 trillion
this is on top of $1.7 trillion in
tax hikes already imposed by this Administration. Asking hard-working
taxpayers to fork over more of our money to maintain the status quo
in Washington would effectively halt the economic growth needed to get
folks back to work.
And last, but definitely
not least, it funds Obamacare
and funnels $12.9 billion
into the IRS, the agency responsible for enforcing the individual
mandate. This disastrous health care law has sent costs skyrocketing, taken
choice from patients, and moved us into a part-time economy. Thats
exactly why I voted this week to
repeal Obamacare
and put us on a path to advance patient-centered reforms that foster
job creation, lower costs and empower patients with more
choices.
We need a plan that grows the economy instead of the
government and offers real solutions to folks here at home. I support a
budget that balances while protecting our national security interests.
This is how we will get our nation out of the hole were in,
get people back to work, and provide folks the peace of mind that
tomorrow will be better than
today.
Until next
week
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)
What a moving moment
I was so inspired to meet with the Ingold family
from Concord and other families whose lives will be impacted by the
ABLE
Act.
This is why I ran for Congress
to serve North
Carolinians and fight to empower folks to build better lives for themselves and
their
families.

ICYMI: This week, the Senate approved the
House-passed
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention For American
Veterans Act.
This
critical piece of legislation to expand quality mental health care for
Americans in uniform and help prevent veteran suicides now heads to the
President's desk. I encourage him to join us in our efforts to provide
our service members the quality care and support they deserve.

I had a productive meeting with Senator
Tillis, Senator Burr and Congressman Rouzer this
week.
I look forward to continuing our work to advance
NC's
priorities.
