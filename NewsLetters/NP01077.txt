PEARCE VOTES FOR A BALANCED BUDGET THAT EMPOWERS
CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS
On April 30, by a
vote of 226-197, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the
Conference Report to S. Con Res. 11, which establishes the budget for the
Fiscal Year 2016, and sets levels for FY 2017 through 2025. The
House-Senate unified plan balances the federal budget within 10 years, without
raising taxes, and contains over $5 trillion in savings. Following his
vote for passage, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce
stated:
Washington continues to move in the right direction.
The American people
deserve a balanced budget, and finally we have a Congress that is
delivering.
For the first time since 2001, the United States
Congress has passed a 10-year balanced budget, Pearce
stated.
This 10-year federal budget finally puts our nation on a path that
reduces our debt and commits to continuing the priorities I came to
Congress for:
priorities that will make Washington more effective,
efficient and accountable; prevent tax increases on hardworking Americans;
strengthen Medicare and Social Security; and repeal damaging and
costly Obamacare.

VOTES TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY
CONSTRUCTION
On April 30, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2016
(H.R. 2029) by a vote of 255 to 163.
Following his vote for
passage, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued the following
statement:
Todays vote signals the continued change in Congress demanded by
the American people in November. With passage of this legislation, the
House shows its ability to work efficiently and effectively by passing
a bipartisan appropriations bill. In fact, this is the earliest the
appropriations process has started in the House since the 1970s,
Pearce stated.
This legislation increases funding for military
construction projects, providing for quality housing for our military
families. It enables the training and equipment necessary to keep our
military members at peak readiness. In New Mexico alone this bill
helps all three Air Force bases - Cannon AFB, Holloman AFB, and Kirtland
AFB
as well as Ft. Bliss, by continuing to fund the construction of
the William Beaumont Army Medical Center.

PEARCE PRAISES PASSAGE OF BILL TO FUND
ALL-OF-THE ABOVE ENERGY POLICY
On May 1, by a bipartisan
vote of 240-177, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2028,
the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill.
U.S.
Rep. Steve Pearce issued the following statement following his vote
for passage:
New Mexico has become a leader in energy
research, development, and production.
From advanced solar and wind
technology, to the utilization of brackish water for oil and gas
production
energy research and development has had an enormously beneficial
impact on the economy in New Mexico, but more importantly it has
provided stable and good-paying jobs for countless hardworking
families.
Passage of the bill today promotes a true all-of-the-above
energy policy, which will allow New Mexico and the nation to continue
developing efficient and safe fossil and renewable energy sources, said
Pearce.
