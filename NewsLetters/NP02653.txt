Rubio Takes Aerial Tour Of Northern
Everglades
On Friday, Marco took a helicopter
tour over the northern Everglades to view
restoration projects currently under
construction by both the South Florida
Water Management District (SFWMD) and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
Following his tour, Marco issued this
statement:
Todays helicopter tour
of the northern Everglades highlighted
the continued need to address our water
management challenges, particularly the
areas deeply impacted by runoffs and
releases from Lake Okeechobee,
Rubio said . I look
forward to continuing to explore
solutions to Floridas water
management problems, and working with
all stakeholders so that we better
serve local needs.
It is important that we
continue moving forward with ongoing
projects, like our water retention
capabilities, which continue to
alleviate some of the issues we face
now,
added Rubio . But we must
also look for other innovative projects
and programs and I remain deeply
committed to finding a longer term
solution to this issue, and preserving
the Everglades for future generations
to enjoy.

Rubio Calls For Immediate Release Of
Mayor Antonio Ledezma In Venezuela
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the arrest of the Mayor of
Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, by Venezuelan
intelligence agents:
The arrest of Mayor Antonio
Ledezma and harassment of other key
members of the democratic opposition is
only the latest example of the Maduro
regimes cowardly and paranoid
oppression of the Venezuelan people.
Just one week ago marked the one year
anniversary of the violent repression
of peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela.
Now, Mayor Ledezmas arrest is
only further proof that Nicols
Maduro will stop at nothing to secure
his tyrannical rule and silence the
Venezuelan peoples demand for a
democratic and free future.
I urge the
Obama Administration to demand the
immediate release of both Mayor Ledezma
and opposition leader Leopoldo
Lpez, and furthermore, to implement
provisions of the Venezuela sanctions
bill that President Obama signed into law
last year. These latest actions by the
Maduro regime require a response from the
Obama Administration. We cannot allow the
Venezuelan people to suffer at the hands
of Nicols Maduro any longer, and
implementing these sanctions is long
overdue.
Constituent Casework Corner
Eric contacted Senator Rubios
office regarding his appeal to have his
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
disability rating increased. Members of
the staff initiated an inquiry, and were
subsequently informed that VA officials
approved his claim for Individual
Unemployability and granted his
disability as permanent and total. As a
result, he received a retroactive check
from the VA for approximately $65,000. In
addition, Erics monthly disability
payment increased, and VA hospitals must
treat him for all ailments at no charge
from here on out.
