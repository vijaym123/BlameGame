Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
One of my elementary school teachers, Mrs.
Pickard, was the person who instilled in me the love for reading. The
most important lesson I learned growing up was from my mother. She
taught me to have confidence when I wavered, and that I could handle
anything that the world would throw at me. Since I can remember, women
have shaped me and helped me become the person I am
today.
Today, we celebrate International Womens Day, and this year's theme is
Inspiring Change. On this day, we celebrate the social, economic, and
political achievements of women around the world. While we focus on
these achievements, we must acknowledge there is still much to do to
achieve true equality.
Women still face many challenges every
day, and one that I care deeply about is systematic economic
discrimination in the workplace. Women are not paid the same as men for the
same job. Rather, they make only 77 cents for every dollar made by men
in the same position. For Latino women, that figure is 54 cents. This
is deeply unfair; I find it difficult to understand how we could still
face such a situation in the 21 st
Century. The first bill I
brought to the floor after President Obama was inaugurated, and the
first bill the President signed into law, was the
Lilly Ledbetter
Fair Pay Act .
I am also a strong supporter of the
Paycheck Fairness Act , which would go further to prevent employers
from paying unequal wages to men and women who do the same job. I
hope Republicans can agree that women and men deserve to be paid fairly
and equally. I object to the idea that my daughter or my
granddaughters, or those of anybody else, might be subject to discrimination based
on their gender. I will keep fighting to make sure women are recognized
as equals and paid equally.
In my office, many women are
among my top advisers, and in 2007, I created the Diversity Initiative
to broaden the diversity of applicants to positions in the Senate's
Democratic Caucus.
I wish all women in Nevada, my outstanding
female colleagues in the Senate and House, and all those women who
are working to make the United States a better country, a happy
International Women's Day.
