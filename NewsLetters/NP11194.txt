Friend,
I want to start by sharing my deepest sympathies with the Snohomish
County community - all of those whose lives were lost and who were
affected by the mudslide are in my thoughts and prayers, including the
brave first responders. Here in Washington State, we take pride in our
close-knit communities. So our hearts break when a tragedy of this
magnitude hits a place like Oso. My team and I are in close contact
with the governor, our senators, and Representatives Suzan DelBene and
Rick Larsen. As we watch these events unfold, we will do whatever we
can to support their efforts and continue to pray for all our neighbors
in Northwest Washington.
Let me provide an update on other issues affecting our region and our
country.
Advocating for Campaign Finance Reform
A big shout out to the nearly 150 folks who made it to Olympic College
in Bremerton last week to discuss campaign finance reform and, in
particular, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. It was great
to see such a big turnout to discuss an issue of enormous importance to
our democracy. In my view, much of the dysfunction you see in our
nation's capital is the result of a campaign finance system that is
broken. Congress ought to take some key steps to ensure that the voices
of regular citizens are not drowned out by special interests and deep
pockets. In fact, I recently published an op-ed in the Kitsap Sun
regarding the need to change big money's influence on politics. Check
out the op-ed by clicking here

Casework Corner
Some of the most important work my office does is providing casework
assistance to citizens who are grappling with federal agencies. We have
a terrific staff of people who work for you - helping citizens who may
be struggling to get their VA benefits, to get an expedited passport,
or to deal with an issue related to Medicare and Social Security.
I would like share a moving casework story involving an international
adoption. Mrs. Salimeh Evjen, from Indianola, contacted my office about
her family's adoption of an orphan girl named Lulu, living in
Guangzhou, China. Lulu was born with Biliary Atresia, a rare liver
disease causing the liver to quickly deteriorate. Salimeh sought
expedited processing of the adoption in order for Lulu to enter the
U.S. quickly and receive treatment. I sent a letter to the Department
of State and the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou informing them of the
urgency of the situation and Lulu's story. Thankfully, our office's
advocacy worked. Soon after, Salimeh received the great news that the
expedited request was approved. Lulu is now here in the U.S. and doing
well with her new family.
If my team and I can help you in dealing with an international adoption
or any other issue, please let me know. We are here to help you.
A New Law - The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act
I am thankful that the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act was
signed into law on March 21st. While there is still more that ought to
be done to address rising flood insurance premiums, the passage of this
law was an important step forward for folks in our region. I spoke in
support of this bill on the House floor last month:
#DemandAVote
At nearly every town hall meeting I have, I am asked "Why isn't
immigration reform moving forward?" In fact, earlier this week, during
my fifth telephone town hall, the last question of the night focused on
the importance of modernizing our immigration system.
Late last year, the United States Senate passed a comprehensive
immigration reform bill with bipartisan support. The House should do
the same thing.
The votes are there. We need to work across party
lines to get this done. The current immigration system is broken. By
improving our system of legal immigration, we can make illegal
immigration less attractive. In addition, done right, immigration
reform will be good for American jobs, innovation and competitiveness.
In fact, the analysis of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
shows that comprehensive reform will lower deficits by $900 billion.
Earlier this week I joined dozens of my colleagues to try to force a
vote on the bipartisan bill, signing something called a "discharge
petition." If a majority of members of the House sign it, the bill will
get taken up and we can finally move forward. You, too, can
#DemandAVote on immigration reform.
I will continue working to move
important issues like this forward.
"Save to Win" Prize-Linked Savings Event
To encourage better money savings techniques, I will be participating
in a prize-linked savings event open to the public next Monday at the
Peninsula Credit Union in Belfair. Prize-linked savings accounts are
safe, regulated, and innovative products that are designed to encourage
saving. These accounts are typical savings products that offer
participants the chance to win prizes. The more participants save, the
more chances they have to win prizes. And they can't lose - the worst
that can happen is that the person saves money. The goal here is to
strengthen a person's financial safety net and prepare them to meet
future financial needs.
I've sponsored a bill in Congress to allow more financial institutions
across the country to be able to offer this innovative product. I'll be
talking about that bill and the value of savings at 8:00AM, Monday
March 31st, at Peninsula Credit Union, 23550 Highway 3, Belfair WA.
(Two More) Service Academy Information Events
To continue to spread the word about an exciting opportunity to
students in our region who are considering a top-tier education with
service to our nation in our armed forces, I am holding two more
Service Academy Information events in the coming weeks. Service Academy
representatives will be in attendance at these events - the first on
Saturday, April 5th at 11:00AM at the Lobby and Council Chambers of the
Norm Dicks Government Center in Bremerton. The second will be on
Wednesday, April 16th at 5:00PM in the Commons area of Montesano High
School in Montesano.
And a quick reminder - don't forget to encourage high school students
you know to participate in the House App Design Competition
and the Congressional Art Competition
.
It's an Honor to Represent You
Finally, before I wrap up, I want to share a quick happy birthday wish
to my grandma (aka "Oma") who on Monday will turn 104-years-old. She's
an inspiration to me (and I sure hope I have her genes!).
Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I or my
office can be helpful to you. I'm honored to work for you.
Thank you,
Derek Kilmer

2014 Friend,
I
want
to
start
by
sharing
my
deepest
sympathies
with
the
Snohomish
County
community
-
all
of
those
whose
lives
were
lost
and
who
were

by
the
mudslide
are

and
prayers,
including
the

Here
in
Washington
State,
we
take
pride
in
our
close-knit
communities.
So
our
hearts
break
when
a
tragedy
of
this
magnitude
hits
a
place
like
Oso.
My
team
and
I
are
in
close

with
the
governor,
our

and
Representatives
Suzan
DelBene
and
Rick
Larsen.
As
we
watch

we
will
do
whatever
we

to
our

my
view,
much
of
the

is
the
result
of
a
campaign

Casework
Corner
Some
of
the
most
important
work
my
office
does
is
providing
casework
assistance
to
citizens
who
are
grappling
with
federal
agencies. We
have
a
terrific
staff
of
people
who
work

VA

to

or
to

I
would
like
share
a
moving
casework
story
involving
an
international
adoption. Mrs.
Salimeh
Evjen,
from
Indianola,
contacted
my
office
about
her
family&#8217;s
adoption
of
an
orphan
girl
named
Lulu,
living
in
Guangzhou,
China. Lulu
was
born
with
Biliary
Atresia,
a
rare
liver
disease
causing
the
liver
to
quickly
deteriorate. Salimeh
sought
expedited
processing
of
the
adoption
in
order
for
Lulu
to
enter
the
U.S.
quickly
and
receive
treatment. I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Department
of
State
and
the
U.S.
Consulate
in
Guangzhou
informing
them
of
the
urgency
of
the
situation
and
Lulu&#8217;s
story.
Thankfully,
our
office&#8217;s
advocacy
worked. Soon
after,
Salimeh
received
the
great
news
that
the
expedited
request
was
approved. Lulu
is
now
here
in
the
U.S.
and
doing
well
with
her
new
family.
If
my
team
and
I
can
help
you
in
dealing
with
an
international
adoption
or
any
other
issue,
please
let
me
know. We
are
here
to
help
you.
A
New
Law
&#8211;
The

I
am
thankful
that
the
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability

premiums,
the

&#8220;Save
to
Win&#8221;
Prize-Linked
Savings
Event
To
encourage
better
money
savings
techniques,
I
will
be
participating
in
a
prize-linked
savings
event
open
to
the
public
next
Monday
at
the
Peninsula
Credit
Union
in
Belfair.
Prize-linked
savings
accounts
are
safe,
regulated,
and
innovative
products
that
are
designed
to
encourage
saving.
These
accounts
are
typical
savings
products
that
offer
participants
the
chance
to
win
prizes. The
more
participants
save,
the
more
chances
they
have
to
win
prizes. And
they
can&#8217;t
lose
&#8211;
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
that
the
person
saves
money. The
goal
here
is
to
strengthen
a
person&#8217;s
financial
safety
net
and
prepare
them
to
meet
future
financial
needs.
I&#8217;ve
sponsored
a
bill
in
Congress
to
allow
more
financial
institutions
across
the
country
to
be
able
to
offer
this
innovative
product. I&#8217;ll
be
talking
about
that
bill
and
the
value
of
savings
at
8:00AM,
Monday
March
31st,
at
Peninsula
