Happy Thanksgiving From Rep. Walberg
Dear Friend,
As we gather with family and friends this week, I hope youll join me in taking time to reflect on what we are grateful for. I feel especially blessed for the opportunity to celebrate Thanksgiving with my loved ones, for the freedoms that abound in this great country, and for the privilege you all have given me to serve Michigans 7 th
District.
This year, I encourage you to count your blessings and have a very Happy Thanksgiving!
