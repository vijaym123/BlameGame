HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

The Taga Latte Stone Quarry is one of many sites of national significance on Rota that will be considered for inclusion in a Rota National Park as part of a "suitability and feasibility" study approved by the House in the National Defense Authorization Act Thursday. The unusual move to add this Parks provision to the Defense bill will culminate six years of legislative work, if, as expected, the Senate passes the measure next week. The National Park brand could draw thousands of visitors from around the world to Rota in the years to come. (photo: Rota congressional district office)
Rota National Park study passes House - After six years of work it now appears that a study of whether to make areas of Rota a National Park will become law. The House approved the Rota study as part of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act
this week. The Senate is now expected to approve the Act, which is the product of months of House/Senate negotiations, and then send the measure to the President to sign into law. Rota Senator Diego Songao began the process of establishing a Rota National Park over ten years ago and persuaded the Interior Department to report on whether Rota contained archaeological, historical, and/or natural resources of "national significance." A 2005 Interior report said yes. I picked up the ball on coming to Congress and have gotten legislation through the House in 2010, 2012, and 2013, authorizing the next step: the "suitability and feasibility" study. But each time the Senate failed to act. Inclusion in the "must-pass" Defense bill seems to have overcome that final hurdle. Hundreds of public lands bills are introduced each year, authorizing studies, changing boundaries, or improving management plans. But only eight studies, including the Rota study, have been added to the Defense measure. Having a National Park would put Rota on the map as an international destination for eco-tourists and adventure travelers.
Divert language dropped from NDAA conference bill - Most of us believe that Tinian would be the better site of an Air Force divert field, not Saipan. And the Governor, who is responsible for public lands in the Commonwealth, has made clear that is his position. So I included language in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, passed by the House in June, allowing the $29 million Congress has provided for the divert field to be spent anywhere in the Northern Mariana Islands . This week, however, a final version of the NDAA, worked out by House and Senate negotiators, passed the House without my language. The negotiators concluded that it was premature to make the change I wanted because the Air Force is still doing an environmental impact study. Language in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the 2015 NDAA
does, however, welcome a legislative proposal from the Air Force to modify the scope or location for the project should the EIS Record of Decision, expected next year, decide that Tinian is the preferred location.

The Marianas Institute of Filipino CPAs and Accountants celebrated its 20th anniversary on Saturday and asked me to deliver the keynote address. I simply noted that for organizations to have that kind of staying power requires them to have a proven value to their members and to the community they serve. And whoever thinks accountants don't know how to have fun would do well to attend a MIFICPA event! Thank you, MIFICPA, for the invitation. Keep up the great work and the spirit that lasted these 20 years.
Army Corps waiver increase exceeds expectation - The Northern Mariana Islands is now allowed a $455,000 waiver of any local matching requirement for Army Corps projects, the Corps announced this week. That is more than double the current waiver of $200,000 and $55,000 more than estimated in previous e-kilili reports. The waiver increase is the result of language I added to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 . It required the Corps to recompute the waiver, accounting for inflation over the 28 years since it was first enacted. The Corps has also announced that two projects currently underway - the Tinian and Rota Harbor feasibility studies - are both now eligible for the $455,000 dollar waiver. This could save the Commonwealth Ports Authority over half a million dollars. And the waiver will apply separately to the studies and to the eventual harbor construction, so the Commonwealth may use the higher waiver twice for one project.
Veterans Choice Cards on their way to NMI Vets - Qualified Veterans living in the NMI should expect to receive their Veterans Choice Cards through the mail in the coming weeks. The Choice Cards, authorized by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act , which we passed in Congress this year, entitle veterans living more than 40 miles away from a VA facility to seek out non-VA healthcare, if they have waited longer than 30 days for an appointment. I am grateful to Chairman Jeff Miller, Ranking Member Mike Michaud and Rep. Corrine Brown for including at my request the language giving veterans in the Northern Marianas and other rural areas of America this option to access non-VA medical care. With the Veterans Choice Card, our islands' veterans can more easily receive the medical care they deserve. For more information about the new Veterans Choice Cards or to find out if you are eligible, visit http://www.va.gov/opa/choiceact/.
House approves new savings account program for disabled - Persons with disabilities have long faced a Catch 22: If they start earning money so they can be independent and live on their own, they can lose access to important safety net programs, such as Medicaid, because their income or growing savings now disqualify them for assistance. This week, the House voted overwhelmingly to address that problem with the ABLE Act, H.R. 647 . The Act allows states to establish a tax-advantaged ABLE program. Savings accounts could then be set up for persons with disabilities, and the earnings and distributions from the accounts would not be counted as taxable income. Family members, friends, or disabled person themselves could contribute to the accounts. Distributions could only go to certain qualified expenses, such as education, housing, or assistive technology. But the amounts in the ABLE accounts would be disregarded in determining eligibility for Medicaid and other means-tested federal programs.

Deadline nears, submit your service academy application now - There are only seven days left before the December 12 deadline to submit your application for a congressional nomination to the U.S. Service Academies. I strongly encourage young men and women from the Northern Marianas, interested in a college education and committed to serving our country, to apply now to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity. There are five openings available this year: two at the Naval Academy, two at the Air Force Academy, and one at the Merchant Marine Academy. Attending any of the academies is a unique opportunity to obtain a topnotch education and an officer's commission in return for five years of service. As your Congressman, I make nominations, but the final selection among nominees is made by academy admission officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. More information and an application form are available at http://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/academy-nominations, or you may also go to your local congressional office.
Submit your entry for the White House Student Film Festival - U.S. students, grades K-12, are invited to submit their original films to the second White House Student Film Festival . This year's theme is The Impact of Giving Back. Films must tell a story about paying it forward, about community service, or about making a difference and can be either fictional or documentary. The official selections will be featured on the White House website and shared worldwide through White House social media accounts. If selected, you may even have a chance to attend the film fest yourself at the White House. Deadline is January 20, 2015. For guidelines and more information, go to http://www.whitehouse.gov/filmfestival .
$28,942 grant for Maternal and Child Health - The Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant of $28,942 for the CNMI Maternal and Child Health Data System Linkage and Training Initiative to the Commonwealth Health Corporation. The purpose of this grant is to carry out special maternal and child health projects of regional and national significance; to conduct training and research; to conduct genetic disease testing, counseling, and information development and dissemination programs. Congratulations to CHC.
