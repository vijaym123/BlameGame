Dear Friend,
This week, I
joined House and Senate Democrats in calling for the extension of
Unemployment Insurance before millions of Americans lose this important aid.
While continuely fighting to help those in need through pushing for the
Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid, we also took the
time to remember the life and legacy of President John F. Kennedy on the
anniversary of his assassination.
Extension of
Unemployment Insurance:
The vital insurance for the
unemployed, which helps them pay for basic services as they try to re-enter the
workforce, is set to expire on December 28. Just days after Christmas,
1.3 million Americans, including 250,000 New Yorkers, who are
actively searching for work will lose the money they need to get by. These
are people who - through no fault of their own - are out of work and
already struggling to put food on the table. In addition, if Congress
does not pass an extension of Unemployment Insurance, another 2 million
will lose their insurance in the first 6 months of 2014. Democrats are
working together to pass legislation that would extend this insurance
through 2014. Republicans should work with us to pass this bill before
the December recess.
Medicaid and the
ACA:
A new report by Families USA, a non-partisan consumer
advocacy organization, reveals that as many as three-fourths of the people
signing up for the Health Care exchanges under the ACA are eligible for
the extended Medicaid benefits, making their health insurance even
more affordable. This is just further evidence of the campaign of
misinformation being waged against the ACA. All those families being told by
their insurance companies that their policies are being "cancelled" to
try and bait them into buying more expensive insurance from the same
company are finding that by entering the exchanges, they get better
coverage at less cost. It is crucial that we continue getting people
enrolled and helping families and individuals find coverage that's right
for them at a price they can
afford.
Remembering JFK:
This week marks the 50th anniversary of the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Although he was in office for
less than three years, President Kennedy provided vital leadership during
crucial moments in our nation's history, such as the Civil Rights
Movement and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I join America in paying tribute
to President Kennedy and his remarkable legacy.
