"Every day my team works to help district
residents, including seniors, cut through bureaucratic red tape to get
the services they need," said Rep. Lipinski.
"During my time in
office, we have helped countless retirees get answers and solve
problems involving Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, veterans' benefits,
the Postal Service, and other federal issues.
Seniors have worked
hard and sacrificed much for our nation, so it is my hope that the
upcoming fairs will make life a little easier for
them.

Rep. Lipinski Helps Secure Funds for Safety Upgrade at
Lockport Lock That Will Protect Community and Ensure Continued
Operations of Local Economic Engine
Congressman Lipinski has
announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will soon be moving
forward with a major rehabilitation project at the Lockport Lock and
Dam.
Nearly 12 million dollars will be used to construct a
replacement forebay wall that holds water used in the functioning of the
lock.
The procedure will reinforce and modernize existing
infrastructure, helping to prevent a catastrophic failure of the wall and thus
better protect the local community from flooding.
This project is an
important step in rebuilding our aging water transportation system, said
Rep. Lipinski.
It will not only protect the Lockport community,
but also ensure the continued positive economic impact of a properly
functioning waterway system.
According to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, roughly $81 billion in goods are shipped through Illinois
waterways and ports, helping to support 48,195
jobs.

Rep. Lipinski Reviews Operations
at
Hanson Quarry in McCook;
Residents Safety is Top
Priority
Recently, Congressman Dan Lipinski reviewed operations at the Hanson Quarry
in McCook.
The quarry recently resumed normal operations,
including blasting activities.
It suspended blasting activities
following a seismic event that occurred after a routine quarry blast
on November 4th of last year.
After the incident - which I felt at my home - I was
involved in bringing Northwestern University and the US Geological
Survey out to the quarry to investigate what had happened and what is
happening at and around the operation, said Rep. Lipinski.
My top
concern has been and always will be the safety of the residents of the
district, and I will continue to monitor the situation.
