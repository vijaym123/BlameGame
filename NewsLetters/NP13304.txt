Greetings,
None of us likes SPAM filling our in-boxes. So I was concerned to learn from some constituents that they received multiple copies of last week&#8217;s
e-kilili newsletter &#8211; as many as 60 copies in one case!
To those of you who received multiple copies and took the time to let us know, thank you. We immediately opened our subscriber list looking for
duplicate addresses and checked with House Information Resources, the office that handles distribution. We wanted to make sure the problem was not what we were doing &#8211; and we found no problem there.
We did notice, however, that everyone who told us they got SPAMMED had a Yahoo! mail account. And, as you may have read, Yahoo! itself was hacked
last week. That may have caused the problem for some e-kilili readers.
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. And I hope that you only receive one copy of this explanation.
If you do ever experience a problem with your e-kilili subscription, let us know immediately. We want the weekly newsletter to be a valued source
of information, never an annoyance.
Regards,
Kilili
