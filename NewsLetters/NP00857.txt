Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the Army Corps of Engineers jointly proposed a rule clarifying
the definition of waterways subject to clean water permits, known as
waters of the U.S.
In reality, the clarification amounts to a
massive land and water grab.
It would have a devastating impact
on everyday life in the Ozarks, which is why I voted this week to pass
the
Regulatory Integrity Protection Act , which
would force the EPA to withdraw and reconsider this ridiculous
rule.
The EPA and the Corps currently only have permit-issuing
authority to uphold the natural integrity of our navigable waterways,
interstate streams, territorial seas or connected wetlands.
The
existing standards have been in place since the Clean Water Act of
1972.
The proposed expansion, however, would broaden federal power to
tributaries, ditches, streams only flowing during heavy rains and
waters in flood plains.
This massive shift would give the
all-powerful EPA authority to require farmers that plow and plant to
seek permits beforehand.
Construction of barns, homes or
businesses would need a permit as well due to potential impact on a local
stream.
Highway ditches and infrastructure would fall under the
expansion.
Even if the nearest running stream is miles away, the
typically dry creek nearby would be considered a water of the U.S. and
any activity surrounding the creek would be unnecessarily stuck with
red tape, which could take months to comply with.
I have
heeded the concerns of Seventh District farmers, businesses and officials
about this absurd regulation.
It would have undue harm on our
areas economy and way of life.
Thats why I voted to force the
EPA to withdraw the regulation and consider the economic costs, Supreme
Court cases and comments from farmers, businesses, state and local
officials and anyone whom a reconsidered rule would impact.
After
all, it is those caring for the land and resources who know best how
to protect them.
I will continue to fight against the EPA
and its nonsensical regulations that pay no mind to generations-old
southwest Missouri lifestyles and traditions.
