Farm Bill Finalized
We're nearing the finish line on the Farm Bill, which is good news for
consumers and producers.
The Conference Committee report was just
finalized
.
We're hoping to bring it to the House
floor for a vote
on Wednesday.
This has been a long process that
began two years ago with detailed examinations of every single farm
program.
We've held dozens of hearings and we've gone through a few
different versions of this bill.
We've worked to reform farm programs
to make them more market-based, and to bring accountability and
transparency to nutrition programs.
I'll be honest with you-this bill isn't perfect.
I'm disappointed that
we weren't able to close more loopholes on nutrition assistance so that
you could be sure your taxes were only supporting families in need.
I
had hoped we'd get the government out of the business of marketing
products by ending the trade-distorting Country of Origin Labeling
(COOL) program.
But we'll continue to work on these issues in
appropriations legislation.
All told, this is a good bill that saves taxpayer dollars through
free-market reforms.
The Farm Bill will reduce our deficit by $24 billion over ten years.
We've closed loopholes in the nutrition programs to save $8 billion.
We're also implementing a pilot program that will help get able-bodied
adults off food stamps and back to work.
Instead of sending out direct
payments, which aren't tied to a farmer's current production, the
conference committee strengthened crop insurance, which requires
farmers to pay a premium and only pays out in the event of a loss.
I'm
also proud that my market-based Shallow Loss Coverage Option (SCO) was
included in the final report.
This group insurance program helps
farmers manage smaller losses-bad seasons that wouldn't necessarily
trigger an individual crop insurance policy, but over time could put a
farmer out of business.
These are all very positive reforms, and if we want to see them
implemented, we need to pass this through the House and Senate.
I'm encouraging my colleagues to vote for this bill, which will give
our farmers and ranchers certainty while they work to feed and clothe
America.
State of the Union
Tomorrow night, President Obama will make his annual visit to Congress
to address the nation about the state of our union and his agenda for
2014.
We already have an idea of what will be in his remarks.
He's
made it clear that he intends to side-step Congress with executive
orders, saying that he has a pen and a phone
and he doesn't need Congressional
cooperation to push his agenda.
That disregard for our checks and
balances is unacceptable, and I'm working to ensure that the President
doesn't abuse executive powers.
So what will the President discuss? I think we'll hear a lot of the
same themes we've heard
in previous
years. In his speech, he'll probably focus on his priority to grow
government. The President sees government expansion as a "solution" to
our problems.
I would rather hear ideas to make the government more
accountable to the American people.
You deserve transparency and
results-not more failed government programs.
The President is going to defend Obamacare.
Americans are tired of
broken promises and don't want another sales-pitch-they want real
solutions for people that are losing their coverage or being hit with
higher costs.
I'm hoping that the President will make jobs and economic growth a
priority.
But Americans recognize that his rhetoric on jobs is an
empty promise if he won't take action on any of the House-passed jobs
bills.
I'm interested in your take on the State of the Union.
This week's
question asks you to rate the current status of our country-I'm looking
forward to your responses.
Action Item: Ending Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Tomorrow I will vote to permanently end taxpayer funding for abortion.
As an original cosponsor of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for
Abortion Act
, I'm proud that
we'll take action to prohibit the government from using your tax
dollars to fund the tragic practice of abortion.
Right now, there is a
patchwork of bills and amendments that prohibit federal funding for
abortions. H.R. 7 unifies that policy under a single bill.
It's
important that we do this, because the majority of Americans
oppose abortion, and we don't want our
tax dollars paying to end innocent lives.
This bill would also clarify
which plans on the Obamacare exchanges require its enrollees to
subsidize others' abortions on demand.
I'm working in Washington to
eliminate abortion from our society altogether, and tomorrow my
colleagues and I will take an important step in the right direction.

Farm
Bill
Finalized
We&#8217;re
nearing
the
finish
line
on
the
Farm
Bill,
which
is
good
news
for
consumers
and
producers.
The
Conference
Committee
report
was
just
finalized .
We&#8217;re
hoping
to
bring
it
to
the
House
floor
for
a
vote
on
Wednesday.
This
has
been
a
long
process
that
began
two
years
ago
with
detailed
examinations
of
every
single
farm
program.
We&#8217;ve
held
dozens

and
we&#8217;ve

a

of
this

We&#8217;ve
worked
to
reform
farm
programs
to
make
them
more
market-based,
and
to
bring
accountability
and
transparency
to
nutrition
programs.
I&#8217;ll
be
honest
with
you&#8212;this
bill
isn&#8217;t
perfect.
I&#8217;m
disappointed
that
we
weren&#8217;t
able
to
close
more
loopholes
on
nutrition
assistance
so
that
you
could
be
sure
your
taxes
were
only
supporting
families
in
need.
I
had
hoped
we&#8217;d
get
the
government
out
of
the
business
of
marketing
products
by
ending
the
trade-distorting
Country
of
Origin
Labeling
(COOL)
program.
But
we&#8217;ll
continue
to
work
on
these
issues
in
appropriations
legislation.
All
told,
this
is
a
good
bill
that
saves
taxpayer
dollars
through
free-market
reforms.
The
Farm
Bill
will
reduce
our
deficit
by
$24
billion
over
ten
years.
We&#8217;ve
closed
loopholes
in
the
nutrition
programs
to
save
$8
billion.
We&#8217;re
also
implementing
a
pilot
program
that
will
help
get
able-bodied
adults
off
food
stamps
and
back
to
work.
Instead
of
sending
out
direct
payments,
which
aren&#8217;t
tied
to
a
farmer&#8217;s
current
production,
the
conference
committee
strengthened
crop
insurance,
which
requires
farmers
to
pay
a
premium
and
only
pays
out
in
the
event
of
a
loss.
I&#8217;m
also
proud
that
my
market-based
Shallow
Loss
Coverage
Option
(SCO)
was
included
in
the
final
report.
This
group
insurance
program
helps
farmers
manage
smaller
losses&#8212;bad
seasons
that
wouldn&#8217;t
necessarily
trigger
an
individual
crop
insurance
policy,
but
over
time
could
put
a
farmer
out
of
business.
These
are
all
very
positive
reforms,
and
if
we
want
to
see
them
implemented,
we
need
to
pass
this
through
the
House
and
Senate.
I&#8217;m
encouraging
my
colleagues
to
vote
for
this
bill,
which
will
give
our
farmers
and
ranchers
certainty
while
they
work
to
feed
and
clothe
America.
State
of
the
Union
Tomorrow
night,
President
Obama
will
make
his
annual
visit
to
Congress
to
address
the
nation
about
the
state
of
our
union
and
his
agenda
for
2014.
We
already
have
an
idea
of
what
will
be
in
his
remarks.
He&#8217;s
made
it
clear
that
he
intends
to
side-step
Congress
with
executive
orders,
saying
that
he
has
a
pen
and
a
phone
and
he
doesn&#8217;t
need
Congressional
cooperation
to
push
his
agenda.
That
disregard
for
our
checks
and
balances
is
unacceptable,
and
I&#8217;m
working
to
ensure
that
the
President
doesn&#8217;t
abuse
executive
powers.
So
what
will
the
President
discuss?
I
think
we&#8217;ll
hear
a
lot
of
the
same
themes
we&#8217;ve
heard
in
previous
years.
In
his
speech,
he&#8217;ll
probably
focus
on
his
priority
to
grow
government.
The
President
sees
government
expansion
as
a
&#8220;solution&#8221;
to
our
problems.
I
would
rather
hear
ideas
to
make
the
government
more
accountable
to
the
American
people.
You
deserve
transparency
and
results&#8212;not
more
failed
government
programs.
The
President
is
going
to
defend
Obamacare.
Americans
are
tired
of
broken
promises
and
don&#8217;t
want
another
sales-pitch&#8212;they
want
real
solutions
for
people
that
are
losing
their
coverage
or
being
hit
with
higher
costs.
I&#8217;m
hoping
that
the
President
will
make
jobs
and
economic
growth
a
priority.
But
Americans
recognize
that
his
rhetoric
on
jobs
is
an
empty
promise
if
he
won&#8217;t
take
action
on
any
of
the
House-passed
jobs
bills.
I&#8217;m
interested
in
your
take
on
the
State
of
the
Union.
This
week&#8217;s
question
asks
you
to
rate
the
current
status
of
our
country&#8212;I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
your
responses.
Action
Item:
Ending
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Tomorrow
I
will
vote
to
permanently
end
taxpayer
funding
for
abortion.
As
an
original

of
H.R.
7,
the
No
Taxpayer

for
Abortion
Act ,
I&#8217;m
proud
that
we&#8217;ll
take
action
to
prohibit
the

from

of
abortion.
Right

there
is
a

of
bills
and
amendments
that
prohibit
federal
funding
for
abortions.
H.R.
7
unifies
that
policy
under
a
single
bill.
It&#8217;s
important
that
we
do
this,
because
the
majority
of
Americans
oppose
abortion,
and
we
don&#8217;t
want
our
tax
dollars
paying
to
end
innocent
lives.
This
bill
would
also
clarify
which
plans
on
the
Obamacare
exchanges
require
its
enrollees
to
subsidize
others&#8217;
abortions
on

I&#8217;m
working
in
Washington
to
eliminate
abortion
from
our
society
altogether,
and
tomorrow
my
colleagues
and
I
will
take
an
