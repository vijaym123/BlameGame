Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today, the
Senate acted to ensure that our nations veterans receive the care they
deserve. This bipartisan legislation starts the process of fixing the VA
by holding officials manipulating the system accountable, expanding
access to quality health care, and giving the VA the authority to hire
more doctors and nurses to decrease wait times.
This week,
Ive been greatly concerned by the results of an audit showing the VA
is not serving the needs of Nevadas veterans. I hope the legislation
we passed today will help the VA facilities in Nevada get back on
track. Senators Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and John McCain (R-AZ) worked
extremely hard to come to an agreement on this legislation and I thank
them for their work on it. In the Senate, we will continue to
investigate and address other longstanding issues in the VA.
