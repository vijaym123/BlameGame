Friend,
We&#39;ve got a little over $1,650 left to raise in order to hit our goal before midnight.
It&#39;s within reach but
we have
less than 5 hours until the deadline.
With our dollar-for-dollar donor match, if we don&#39;t hit this goal, we&#39;ll be leaving funds on the table.
If you&#39;ve been waiting to give, now is the time to help out.
Click here and help us reach our goal before midnight.
Every dollar will be matched.
Be well,
Ami

Friend,
Amazing news:
Another donor has stepped up to extend our match. That means all donations up to $15,000 will be matched if you give before midnight tonight.
Bad news:
We have less than 8 hours left before our deadline at midnight tonight and
we are $3,884 away from our goal.
We have a long way to go and little time to waste.
We wouldn&rsquo;t ask if it wasn&rsquo;t important&mdash;we&rsquo;re running up against our deadline and need your help.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Express Donate: $250
Express Donate: another amount
Everyone at Bera HQ is extremely excited about the news of the extended match but it&rsquo;s all hands on deck to make sure we hit our goal before midnight tonight.
We have less than 8 hours left until our deadline
and we need a few more folks to pitch in before time runs out.
Click here to rush a donation to our campaign.
Thanks,
Team Bera
