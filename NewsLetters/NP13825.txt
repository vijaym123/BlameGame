Passing
Bills
You probably hear a lot
about the gridlock in Washington.
People say that nothing is
getting done in this town.
Yet in the House, we have acted on a number
of fronts.
Since the beginning of the year, the House
has passed 189 bills that were sent to the Senate for its
consideration.
However, of those 189 bills, only 41 of them have been signed
into law.
That means that the Senate has refused to even consider
a total of 148 House-passed bills.
Many of these bills
would have a great impact in improving our economic climate, getting
Americans back to work, and helping you and your family save a little
extra money.
For instance, the House has passed
several bills to increase the availability of various domestic energy
supplies, which would help lower costs for consumers and reduce our
dependence on foreign oil.
We also passed the SKILLS Act and similar
bills to both reform as well as improve our nations job training
programs and reduce our unemployment rate.
These are just
a few of the constructive actions the House has taken since
January.
But we need the Senate to act too, and it seems that the Senate
leadership is by and large unwilling to work with
us.
Ill continue to support bills that make things easier for you and
your family
from the cost of your health care to the price you pay
at the pump.
In the meantime, I hope the Senate will begin
considering some of those 148 bills to help our economy and create new
jobs.

Sincerely,
Sam Graves
