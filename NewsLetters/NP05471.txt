You guys are the best!
With 3 hours to go, we&rsquo;ve cut the Koch Brothers advantage in half!
Now, we&rsquo;re just 24,OOO donations away from completely closing the gap!!!
If you step up before midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a major victory for us&hellip;but if we don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll be a tragic conclusion to what could have been a great night.
