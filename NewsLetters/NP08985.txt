Dear Friend:
This past weekend, President Obama ordered the release of five senior
Taliban leaders in exchange for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl - who
had been held captive by Taliban forces for nearly five years.
Serious
concerns have been raised regarding the impact of releasing such
high-level terrorists and the President's lack of consultation with
Congress.
Please take a brief moment to answer the following question so I can
hear directly from you on this topic. Be sure to participate if you
want to see the results and hear my opinion on the matter in our next
newsletter.
Do you support the President's decision to bypass Congress and exchange
five hardened terrorists for Sgt. Bergdahl's freedom?
Yes
No
