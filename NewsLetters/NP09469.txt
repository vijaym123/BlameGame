Happy Memorial
Day!
Dear Friends:
As we gather with friends and family this
weekend to celebrate Memorial Day, I hope we can
all take a moment to remember the true meaning of
this holiday and express sincere gratitude to our
nations veterans who have paid the
ultimate sacrifice in the cause of freedom.
From Gettysburg to Heartbreak Ridge, Bellau
Wood to Bastogne, and Kasserine Pass to Kandahar,
millions of Americans have paid the ultimate
sacrifice to ensure, as President Abraham Lincoln
put it, that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from
the earth. Today, thanks to the
sacrifices of our veterans, America not only
endures but inspires heads and hearts across the
globe with a love of freedom and opportunity.
Our military service men and women and their
families are true heroes, and it is a great honor
and sacred duty to pay homage to them at every
opportunity
on long ago battlefields such
as Gettysburg; at the graves of 5,000 Americans
in a beautiful cemetery in Luxembourg; at the
World War II, Korea and Vietnam Memorials on the
National Mall in Washington; and to fallen Utah
heroes, wherever they may rest. These are
not merely tourist stops or vacation destinations
they are sacred ground.
So I hope youll join with me this
Memorial Day weekend and pay tribute to
sacrifices the men and women who don our
nations uniform and their families make
each day to protect our freedom.
May God bless each of you
and may God
bless the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
