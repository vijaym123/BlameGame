Rep. Bob Goodlatte
House Jobs Bills Stuck in the Senate
The
stack of pro-growth
jobs bills passed by the House of Representatives
continues to pile up on the Senate's doorstep. Despite the need
for
more policies that will help
spur job creation and help put
Americans
back to work, many of these bills are being blocked by Senate
Democrats .
Included
in this
growing list
are two bills that I
have introduced and seen passed by the House over the last year with bipartisan support - the
Innovation Act
( H.R.
3309 ) and the
Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act
( H.R. 3086 ). What's the Senate waiting
for?
Time to tackle that to-do list.
You can

Women's Conference:
Thank you!
Thank
you to everyone who helped make the Sixth District's Women's Conference
on August 1st a success!
Even though it was a rainy day in Roanoke, it
was a great event with a good turnout and a powerful line-up of
speakers. If you were able to attend,
I hope you will
let me know
what you thought of the event.
And if you have ideas for future events,
please pass those along as well. Again, thanks to everyone who
participated in the Women's
Conference!
The
Leadership Panel, featuring women in a
variety of fields from medicine
to agriculture to economic development, takes questions from the
audience. Click

House Acts to Curb Border Crisis
Over the last month, the flow of Central Americans attempting to enter the United
States along the southern border has not stopped. Since the Obama Administration has refused to take the actions needed to curb illegal immigration at
our border, the House of Representatives acted last week to provide law enforcement agents on the ground targeted resources to assist them in doing
their job of securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws.
The bill, passed with my support, provides targeted, narrow funding for border
security, enforcement of immigration laws, and illegal immigration deterrence through September 30, the end of Fiscal Year 2014, in order to meet law
enforcement&rsquo;s immediate needs at the southern border.
The provisions in this bill are paid for through reductions of existing funds and will
result in no new or additional federal spending.
While more reforms will
be necessary, it does provide law enforcement with many tools they have requested right now.
For example, while I was in the Rio Grande Valley last
month, Border Patrol agents cited environmental restrictions barring access to federal lands as a significant stumbling block to securing the border.
This bill prohibits the Administration from preventing Border Patrol access to federal lands so that they can stop drug traffickers, human smugglers,
and unlawful immigrants from exploiting these gaps along the border.
The legislation also ensures that all unaccompanied minors receive a prompt
hearing and provides the necessary resources to return individuals to their home countries. Another bill passed by the House, H.R. 5272, freezes the
&ldquo;Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals&rdquo; program and prevents the President from expanding this program.
The Obama Administration&rsquo;s lax immigration enforcement
policies have only propelled more people to come to the United States illegally. While the House acted to provide targeted and narrow funding to meet
immediate needs at the southern border, it is ultimately up to the President to end this crisis by reversing his policies that created it.
