Friend,
It&rsquo;s time for Congress to take the next step and address comprehensive immigration reform.
As a child of immigrants, I&rsquo;m a direct beneficiary of our country&rsquo;s immigration system. Yet at this point in our nation&rsquo;s history, that process is broken. We must do better.
Good people are waiting for us to act.
Click here to add your voice to the thousands calling on the House to take up comprehensive immigration reform before the end of the year.
Our country was built by immigrants, and it is because of our diversity that we continue to thrive. There&rsquo;s no excuse to wait any longer &ndash; we must reform the system. This issue impacts families, businesses, educational institutions and many other constituencies, and it is unacceptable that we continue to let this issue linger without any dialogue or solution.

It&rsquo;s time to make the American Dream a reality again.
Please add your voice today.
Be well,
