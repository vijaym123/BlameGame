ISSUES AND LEGISLATION
September 28, 2014
Eric Holder
Resignation :
There is not a lot Eric Holder and I agree on. I
supported House efforts to hold him in contempt of Congress for his failure
to provide documents related to the botched Fast and Furious
gun-running operation.
I believe he politicized his position, exhibiting
an unprecedented display of disregard for the rule of law and
Congressional oversight authority.
It is my opinion that Holders
resignation is past due, as his credibility with the American public
has diminished and his legacy has become one of scandal and abuse of
power by the federal government. I am hopeful the President will appoint
and the Senate can confirm a candidate who will align more with
Kansas values, and restore the American peoples' faith in
government.
Efforts to Help Rural Health
Facilities :
A few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed a
bill I introduced that will delay the enforcement of burdensome
regulations on rural healthcare facilities. This week, the Kansas Health
Institute featured the legislative efforts of Senator Moran and I as we work
together to ensure rural communities and patients receive the timely
and quality healthcare.

KCP&amp;L
and Westar Energy Tour:
This week, I had
the opportunity to tour KCP&amp;L and Westar Energy's Power Plant in
La Cygne. I had a chance to see the new construction that will enable
them to produce more electricity in a cleaner and more efficient
manner.
I appreciate the tour and the opportunity to hear their
concerns.
Open Office Hours :
It was great to meet
face-to-face with constituents this week during my Open Office Hours
session in Topeka. I host these meetings for folks who want to come in and
share personal stories, legislative concerns, or casework issues, in a
one-on-one setting. Thanks to all those who came out!
The
Open Office Hours are scheduled during congressional work periods
throughout the year. For information on how to get in touch, or to check on
