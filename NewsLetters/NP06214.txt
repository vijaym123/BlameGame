More Transparency in the Federal
Reserve
9/17/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a bipartisan majority in
supporting H.R. 24, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. This
legislation requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct
an audit of the Federal Reserve System within 12 months of enactment
of the legislation.
After completion of the audit, the GAO would
submit a report to Congress.
H.R. 24 would also repeal
current-law prohibitions that prevent the GAO from auditing the Federal
Reserves monetary policy and international transactions.
"The financial health of our nation
rises and falls on the whims of the Federal Reserve. Because of the
importance of their activities, it is crucially important for the Fed's
operations to undergo a thorough audit and then be subject to more
Congressional oversight. This is an issue of critical importance and I
encourage the Senate to act swiftly to empower the GAO to audit the
Fed."

Lamborn (CO-05)
