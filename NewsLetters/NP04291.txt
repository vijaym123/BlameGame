Friends,
As you
likely saw, this week President Obama went around Congress by
announcing an
executive
action
on immigration reform, offering protection from deportation to
nearly 5 million unauthorized immigrants currently living in our
country.
In the elections earlier this month, throughout
Ohio and across the nation the people spoke with a loud and unified
voice against the Presidents policies and for the partisan gridlock to
end. The voters made it clear it is time for the White House to work
together with Congress to get things done in DC.
So, it was
my hope that the President would recognize the wishes of the American
people, and begin to actually sit down and work with us
in Congress going forward. Unfortunately, he has
circumvented Congress with his unilateral executive action and quickly made
it clear he has no desire to work with us.
As a
former prosecutor, I believe firmly in the rule of law, and we certainly
need to change the laws of our broken immigration system. However, as
our founding fathers laid out, these changes must come
from Congress, and not by an overreaching President.
As a
practical matter, securing our borders and enforcing the law needs
to be the first of these changes when it comes to immigration reform.
On an average day, our border patrol seizes 11,945 pounds of drugs,
conducts 1,153 apprehensions between ports of entry, arrests 22 wanted
criminals and seizes $4.7 million in intellectual property rights
violations. This is a shocking breach of national security. In the
House, we passed a $700 million border bill to secure our
borders and to help fix President Obamas border
crisis.
Unfortunately, the President's decision to act on his own does not secure our
borders. Further, his executive action will likely make our
border less secure as more immigrants will be encouraged to enter the
country illegally to reap the benefits of this executive
action.
This is just one reason why this unilateral action by
the President is disappointing and discouraging. In order
for Democracy to work, Congress and White House need to be able to work
together to come up with real changes and real solutions to the real
problems facing our country. Unfortunately, the President has
definitively signaled he has no real desire to work with us in Congress these
next two years.
You elected me to bring Northeast
Ohio common sense to Washington and I will continue to approach this
issue in a practical manner. I am ready to work with anyone make real
reforms to our broken immigration system and welcome your feedback on
this important issue.
