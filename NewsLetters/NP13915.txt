Dear Friend,
Today, I spoke on the House floor about the millions of Americans who
lost their health insurance under Obamacare. Click HERE
or below to watch my speech.
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform - the federal
government's chief watchdog - is holding a field hearing this Friday in
Apache Junction entitled "ObamaCare Implementation, The Broken Promise:
If You Like Your Current Plan You Can Keep It".
As a member of this Committee, I'm joining Chairman Darrell Issa
(CA-49) to listen as Arizonans tell their Obamacare nightmares. Reps.
David Schweikert (AZ-06) and Trent Franks (AZ-08) are also attending.
I want to know how this terrible law is hurting you personally, so we
can show President Obama and Senate Democrats the damage Obamacare is
inflicting throughout Arizona and across the country.
I encourage you all to come and let your voice be heard. I AM
LISTENING.
