David, I wouldn&rsquo;t email you if it wasn&rsquo;t important.
My friend Ron Barber is locked in a tough fight against Republican Martha McSally for Arizona&rsquo;s 2nd district.
-- Ron&rsquo;s race is heading for a recount
-- only 161 votes separate Ron from his opponent
-- and he needs resources to make sure every lawful vote is counted
I know I&rsquo;ve asked for your support a lot this year. But I&rsquo;m asking for a friend: Will you chip in $5 or more to the Ron Barber Recount Fund? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks for all you do,
Cheri
