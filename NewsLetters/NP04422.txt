VISITING DC
November 14, 2014
During the month of October, I was in North Carolina for a
state-work period. While I was there, I sat down with
WRAL about our states ability to respond to Ebola
and
penned an op-ed
with my colleague Senator Coburn on an Ebola
vaccine. I had a chance
to spend the day at Pope
Airfield
with some of our men and women in uniform and
spoke at the 2014 Federal Construction, Infrastructure &amp;
Environment (FEDCON) Summit
in Wilmington, NC.
This week, I
was back in DC. We picked up where we left off in September, on a bill
that holds a lot of importance to me. Yesterday, we took a procedural
vote on the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of
2014. This procedural vote, which passed 96-1, will allow the Senate to
vote on CCDBGs final passage next week. The Senate has already once
voted and passed (96-2) an earlier version of the legislation, introduced
by Senator Mikulski and me. In September, it was unanimously approved
by the House of Representatives after certain negotiated changes were
made. The modified bill must now pass the Senate again before being
sent to the President to become law.
Senator Mikulski and I
have been working together on this bipartisan legislation for several
years now in a way rarely seen in the hyper-partisan environment of
the United States Senate and we are proud of what this bill contains.
The CCDBG reauthorization bill incorporates feedback and suggestions
provided to the Committee since 2012.
CCDBG is a welfare
reform success story
it promotes high quality care for children while
empowering parents to take control of their own future. The bill enhances
parental choice by providing information about available care options
from all providers and allowing parents to choose the child care
provider that best suits their familys needs. We also ensure that
taxpayers hard-earned money doesnt continue to subsidize providers who
create unsafe settings and threaten the well-being of our nations
children. Working together, we made sure that our hardest working parents
have access to quality, safe child care.
The text of the bill
is available
here .
Senator Mikulski
and I held a press conference yesterday, following the procedural vote
on our bill, to urge our fellow colleagues to push CCDBG to the
Presidents desk. You can watch the press conference in full

Finally, I want to encourage you to follow me on

need help with a federal agency, you can
