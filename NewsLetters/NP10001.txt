Dear Friend,
May is National Foster Care Month
. It is an opportunity for Congress to
highlight the challenges facing the youth in the foster care system. As
a former foster mother, this topic is particularly near and dear to my
heart. I hope you will join my colleagues and me in continuing to
improve the lives of foster youth, because every child deserves the
chance at a forever family.

Washington, A Man of Prayer
On Wednesday, May 7, I will be hosting a prayer event
with Gov. Mike
Huckabee to honor the 225th anniversary of George Washington's
inauguration. For a third year in a row, Members of Congress and their
guests will gather to pray for the nation and its leaders. President
Washington dedicated our great nation to the glory of God, and this is
an opportunity to recognize what he did and follow his example.
Visit here
for more information on this event, and how to watch
it live.
Benghazi: In Search of Justice
Speaker John Boehner announced today that the House will be voting on a
select committee to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Twenty
months later, after the terrorist attack in Benghazi that left four
Americans dead, the Obama Administration still hasn't produced answers
to the questions that the victims' families and the American people
deserve to have answered.
A few weeks ago, former acting CIA Director Mike Morell testified before
the House Intelligence Committee on allegations he misled Congress
regarding the "protests" prior to the attack in Benghazi. I grilled him
on the false narrative
that the White House and the State
Department pushed about what happened that night.
A Select Committee on Benghazi is long overdue. Americans deserve to
know the truth, not the politically motivated false narrative.
Sincerely,
Michele
