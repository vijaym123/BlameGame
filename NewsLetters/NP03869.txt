Hanukkah 2014 Statement
12/15/14
To mark the
start of Hanukkah, Congressman Doug Lamborn has released the following
statement:
Hanukkah is the
time of the year to remember that we should be proud and grateful of
our religious beliefs and values. From Matityahu, Judah, and the
Maccabees it is evident that not only is the strength of the arm important,
but a firm belief in freedom and justice is needed to overcome the
forces of evil. The story of Hanukkah reminds us that the past and our
heritage shed light and can help us navigate the uncertainty of the
future.
Today modern
Maccabees live in Israel. In the image of their forefathers, young men and
women fight battles for their heritage and for freedom and justice. In
Israel the impact of history is combined with the contemporary
strength of innovation. Together they bring a warm light of hope for the
future. I am proud of and committed to being a partner in this ongoing
miracle.
