Dear Friends,
I want to address several issues that
are becoming increasingly problematic for Israel and the broader Jewish
community. As usual, these troubling developments are centered on
Iran.
Israel continues to face many existential threats, and
while most focus on the Iranian nuclear threat and the P5+1
negotiations, I want to focus on the fact that Iran remains the worlds foremost
state sponsor of terrorism.
I believe that many are being
willfully ignorant of this fact because they want so desperately to say
that they have reached a comprehensive agreement with Iran over its
nuclear program. But its nuclear program doesnt exist in a vacuum. It
is related to its ballistic missile program; to its weaponization
program; to its support for terrorism
which is specifically targeted
against the U.S. and Israel.
By now we have all seen the
pictures that the Israeli Prime Minister has sent on the Iranian arms
shipment headed to terrorist groups in Gaza that was seized by Israel. And
the Prime Minister was absolutely correct in excoriating Western
leaders for negotiating with the Iranian regime and opening up relations
with this untrustworthy bunch while that very regime is shipping arms to
other terrorists.
Hezbollah remains a very real and
dangerous threat and continues to be under Irans control, and we have seen
Israel take action several times over the past year to destroy advanced
weapons that are being transferred to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been
relatively quiet these past few years, but that is only because it has
been rebuilding its stockpile of missiles and because it has been
distracted by its participation in the violence in Syria.
That
is why the Foreign Affairs Committee is drafting a bill that will
target Hezbollah, and its patron Iran, because it seems clear that the
Administration is unwilling to take any decisive action while it remains
focused only on the nuclear negotiations.
Its folly to try
to address the nuclear program without addressing all of these other
troubling developments, and it is dangerous folly to believe that the
Supreme Leader, Rouhani, and all of their cronies dont continue to
seek to do harm to Israel.
Just a few weeks ago, in a speech
to commemorate the Persian New Year, Khamenei again denied the
Holocaust. Think about that for a second: in a speech that is supposed to
mark the celebration of the New Year, the Supreme Leader went out of his
way to once again deny the Holocaust.
In a time when
anti-Semitism is on the rise and many seek to isolate Israel, we cannot
afford to let this happen. We must always stand resolutely and proudly by
Israels side, and defend her even when no one else
will.
Sincerely,
