Dear Friend,
I'm looking for photos of
Christmas in #AZ06 to share on Facebook. Send me your favorite,
high-resolution photo of what Christmas looks like in Arizona's 6th
Congressional District for a chance to have your photo featured on my Facebook
page.
Submissions can be emailed to
AZ06Photo@mail.house.gov. One submission per application, please. I'll announce and post
the winner on Friday, December 19, 2014!
Looking forward to seeing some cacti with
lights!
Sincerely,
Scottsdale District Office
