Dear David,
This week
I have been busy in New Mexico...
Organ
Mountains Community Discussion
This past week I participated in a
community meeting on the Organ Mountains in Las Cruces.
The town
hall was filled with attendees who were eager to hear the
presentations of local residents about how to best preserve the Organ
Mountains while balancing interests including recreation, cultural, business,
water, farming and ranching and public
safety.
I have
proposed
a bill
which would preserve the
Organ Mountains and establish a responsibly managed national monument
without endangering the local economy or public
safety.
March is Womens History
Month!
As a pilot, I have long been inspired by women in
aviation history.
Many know the story of Amelia Earhart, but New
Mexico has its own examples of heroic women pilots. Harriet Davidson
Nye was a New Mexican pilot who helped to popularize airmail in the
1930s, flying mail in and out of Socorro, New Mild 24.exico, in a
Fairch
Ashley Olson was ten years old when I met her in Silver City.
At that time she told me about her dream of attending the Air Force
Academy and asked for my assistance.
Thirteen years later I had the
honor of commissioning her at her graduation from the Air Force
Academy.
She is now serving her country flying C-17s, and serving as
a role model to other young women who aim high and follow their
dreams.
Womens history month is an important time to remember and learn
about the women who have led and inspired us, in aviation and in every
area.
Town hall pans proposed U.S. Senate legislation on Organ Mountains
national monument
Pearce town hall
promotes House legislation to designate smaller national
monument
By Steve Ramirez, Las Cruces
Sun-News
LAS CRUCES &gt;&gt;
Interior Secretary
Sally Jewell's visit to Las Cruces earlier this year apparently sparked
what turned out to be a standing-room-only public meeting Wednesday to
talk about federal legislation that could lead to Organ Mountains,
and possibly other peaks in Doa Ana County, being designated as a
national monument.
The auditorium at the New Mexico Farm and
Ranch Heritage Museum was filled to capacity and an overflow crowd of as
many as 100 more spilled into the museum hallway to talk about
markedly different pieces of legislation that have been introduced into the
U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, respectively, aimed at
protecting the Organ Mountains.
The town hall meeting was
organized by Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., who is proposing the Organ
Mountains National Monument Establishment Act to protect 54,800 acres in
and near the Organs, east of Las Cruces.
The Senate
legislation, introduced by Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, New Mexico
Democrats, proposes to set aside 498,815 acres
including much the Organs
and other undeveloped areas of the county
that would be designated
as the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument.
At
the core of many of the concerns voiced at Wednesday's town hall was
the vast difference in the size of a proposed national
monuments.
"I've been attending these meetings for several years," said Las
Crucen Ron Camunez, who was clear he doesn't support the Senate
legislation. "I say it's time we stand up and say enough is enough. It's
time we tell those in Washington (D.C.) to leave us alone and stop the
grandstanding and lying to us. Let's stop this
nonsense."
Most of the comments at the meeting echoed much of the same sentiment.
Mark Cox, whose family has owned and operated the Cox Ranch near White
Sands Missile Range since 1893, said years of the U.S. government
telling his family what they could and couldn't do on the family ranch
after the federal government acquired much of the family's ranchland to
establish White Sands Proving Grounds in 1945
has Cox skeptical
about the Senate proposal.
"You'll understand if we're a little
dubious about it," Cox said. "My desired outcome would be to get rid
of the wilderness study area and leave me alone.
"... We'd
like to have the ability to manage our ranch. To me, in great part,
this is about our family. Our history there is deep, deep, deep, and I
will fight for it," he said.
Carol Cooper, whose family's
cattle ranch is west of Las Cruces, said the massive national monument
land designation proposed in the Senate legislation would be too
restrictive.
"Ranching is not capable with restrictive land-use
policies," Cooper said. "Half of our ranch would be designated as a
wilderness area. We should not even consider jeopardizing the remainder
of the acreage."
John Holly, a water resources consultant
and geologist, said a national monument designation of almost
half-a-million acres could have a future determination in who controls water
supplies.
"It's all about a lack of water," said Holly, of the
Senate proposal.
It wasn't until about the last 20 minutes
of the 1-hour, 45-minute meeting that supporters of the Organ
Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument got to have their
say.
"Why are there no supporters of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks," said
Las Cruces city councilor Nathan Small. "There were requests made, but
that is not the case here. We all love our community, but to have
something with no other perspective, no other points of view does not
seem to promote that dialogue of a public meeting."
Pearce
countered that the same courtesies were not extended to opponents of the
national monument proposal when Jewell, Udall and Heinrich came to Las
Cruces earlier this year. He added Wednesday's meeting to was to
provide interested residents with more information about his
legislation.
"These are lively issues that have been discussed here,"
Pearce said. "We appreciate both sides of the issue."
