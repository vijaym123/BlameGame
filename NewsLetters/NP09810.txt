An Update on Effort to Extend Unemployment Benefits
Immediately following the Senate's approval of a bipartisan, fully-paid
extension of temporary unemployment benefits, I reached out to House
leadership
to express my strong belief that action must
be taken. Back home in South Jersey, I held a press conference in
Pleasantville
with local residents negatively
affected by the expiration of unemployment benefits to discuss the need
to give our residents a lifeline while looking for work. I continue to
advocate
for a temporary extension of unemployment benefits.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
I've joined with Rep. Joe Crowley (NY) on bipartisan legislation to
improve road safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The "Pedestrian
Reduction Act" takes proactive steps rather than simply reacting after
a tragic event occurs. Our common-sense approach will help states and
communities properly plan for road improvement and expansion projects,
building safety for all users into the plans. Get the full details
here.
LATEST NEWS
Next week as part of National Law Enforcement Week, the names of 286
Americans will join more than 19,000 fallen law enforcement officers on
the memorial wall. While thankfully no New Jersey names will be added
this year, many South Jersey officers and supporters will make the ride
to Washington, D.C. for the ceremony to show their support. I continue
to work with the law enforcement community to ensure they have the
resources they need to protect themselves as they keep us safe,
including bulletproof vests. Read more about the annual event.
SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC"
At a reception at the Ocean City Music Pier, I announced that Viterson
Cenat of Absegami High School is this year's winner of the 2014
Congressional Art Competition
for the 2ndDistrict. Thirty-seven students from 8 South
Jersey high schools entered the annual contest. Viterson's
self-portrait will be on display along the main tour route for visitors
to the U.S. Capitol.
