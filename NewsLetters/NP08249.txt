Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
What Happened to Lerner's Emails?
Monday evening, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee continued its investigation into the IRS targeting of groups for ideological reasons and once again the answers from Administration officials left more questions than answers.
I still find the IRS's claims that Lois Lerner's emails are gone forever both deeply troubling and implausible.
However, my greater concern is the damage this episode has done to the American people's trust in this all-powerful agency.
How can the American people trust they will be treated fairly by the IRS when they cannot produce these very important emails?
During Monday's hearing, I expressed this sentiment to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

Calling on EPA to Act in Asheville
For nearly three decades residents of Asheville have lived with the dangerous effects of groundwater contamination caused by a former CTS plant in the area.
The EPA's response to this contamination has been and continues to be woefully insufficient.
While I have called for an Inspector General investigation into the Agency's response, what is truly needed is immediate clean up so the area can be restored to livable conditions and the people of Asheville can live without fear of becoming sick.
This week, I asked EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy about her Agency's response.

ACA Continues to Cause Pain in NC-10
While the Affordable Care Act has faded from the headlines, it continues to cause real pain for the American people, especially the residents of the 10th District.
Last week the Manhattan Institute
released detailed analysis
of just how much this broken law has driven up premiums for the residents of Western North Carolina.
Below is a
county by county chart
detailing just how much premiums have gone up for individuals purchasing healthcare policies in each of the 10th District's seven counties.
I remain committed to getting rid of this broken policy and replacing it with a law that brings down prices and provides more healthcare choices for the American people.

High-tech home run: CommScope, Charlotte Knights partner to build techie ballpark
Hickory Daily Record
I thoroughly enjoyed this story on the large role Hickory-based CommScope played in the construction of the Charlotte Knights new stadium, BB&amp;T Ballpark.
This isn't the first time CommScope has contributed to the construction of a new stadium, they also contributed to the construction of the Dallas Cowboys' new stadium in Texas.
