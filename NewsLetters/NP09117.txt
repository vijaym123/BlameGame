House sharpens focus on VA scandal
Capitol Hill Fireworks During Rare Evening Hearing
VA scandal takes center stage again in House
Dear Friends,
As we continue to address the lack of accountability at the VA, today,
Secretary Shinseki resigned.
It was a necessary step that I called for
previously, but it still does not solve the problem.
After serving as
a surgeon at a VA hospital for 20 years, I understand the bureaucracy
that is preventing veterans from receiving the care they deserve, and I
have been working for the solutions that veterans need.
The time for
excuses is over, the time for accountability and action is now.
On a positive subject, after many years of hard work by local citizens,
Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness was dedicated with a celebration earlier
today.
This was a great occasion for the economy and jobs in Northern
Michigan, and I am honored to have played a role in passing the
Sleeping Bear Dunes legislation.
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.
Member of Congress
Michigan's First District
Our Veterans Deserve the Best
This week the Veterans' Affairs Committee held a hearing where we were
able to question top VA officials regarding the allegations of
misconduct at the Phoenix VA.

Great Lakes Conservation
On Tuesday, it was announced that key conservation programs across the
country will be combined in order to streamline efforts.
This allows
funds to be awarded to local programs that work to protect and preserve
our region. This is great news for the future of the Great Lakes and
all of Northern Michigan. It is crucial that we both preserve the
pristine beauty of the Great Lakes through common-sense principles and
ensure that conservation programs are fully funded.
I am pleased to
see that the USDA is carrying out the intent of Congress' efforts with
this announcement.

Honoring Our Heroes

women who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.
Thank
you to all those who serve in Northern Michigan and across the country!

Sleeping Bear Dunes Dedication

the recent legislation that will protect and preserve this important
economic engine for the area for generations to come.
