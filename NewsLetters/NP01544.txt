This week I joined Chairman Bill Shuster, and other members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on the "Pennsylvania Transport Roadshow." These visits and discussions examining aging infrastructure and highlighted the federal governments role and the importance of investing in Pennsylvanias roads and bridges by passing a long-term surface transportation bill in Congress.
Participating in the "Pennsylvania Transportation Roadshow" highlighting the importance of the federal government's role in transportation and the dire need to pass a federal highway bill.
This tour highlighted the critical infrastructure needs amd allowed me to gather perspectives from state and local officials and job creators about how to make federal transportation programs work more effectively, improve the flow of commerce across the country, and keep America globally competitive.
I also visited several local businesses and met with constituents about various concerns and solutions. One particular business visited was Gichner Systems in Dallastown.
Informative visit of Gichner Systems in Dallastown .
Gichner Systems has been in business in Dallastown since 1969. They manufacture tactical shelters and shelter systems for every branch of the US military. Its important that we have a responsible pro- business climate in America and Pennsylvania, where companies like Gichner Systems can continue to remain competitive and provide good-paying jobs here in our local community. Without a reasonable tax and regulatory climate its impossible for companies like these to remain competitive globally.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
