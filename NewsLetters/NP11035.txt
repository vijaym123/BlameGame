Friend,
We wanted to make sure you&#39;d heard the news - the NRCC, John Boehner&#39;s political arm, named ALL THREE of our opponents to their Young Guns Contenders list.
This is a really big deal - ALL THREE of the Republican candidates running against us are going to have national backing and attention. The Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and every other rich right-wing benefactor you can think of will be pouring money into this race.
We need your help, and we need it badly. Click here to chip in $3 now to help us hit our crucial March 31st deadline.
We know that your inbox is flooded with emails, but you&#39;re our best defense against the national Republican establishment - we can&#39;t do this without you.
We have $4,643 to go in order to hit our $10,000 goal by Monday.
Click here and give now.
Thanks,
Team Bera
PS - In case you missed it, we were the only district in the country that had more than one opponent named to the NRCC program.
They&#39;re serious about this race-- and so are we.
