The election is in just 52 short days: This is President Obama&rsquo;s final 2 years in office.
Will he have a Congress that works with him and for the American people? &hellip;or will his last two years be marred by Tea Party obstruction?
The answer is already being determined by Democrats who are committing to vote across the country. Every person who commits to vote CAN make a difference in this election.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so critical that we all answer Michelle Obama&rsquo;s call to hit
1 million
commitments to vote.
