Dear Friend,
As I travel around the Ohios 16
th
District, seniors and doctors
alike have expressed their concern about
the devastating impact that Medicare
payment cuts would have on quality of care.
During a period of uncertainty and rising
health care costs, the last thing our
seniors need is to worry if their doctors
will accept their Medicare payments.
With a long record of experience in the
health care industry, I am aware of the
problems associated with the Sustainable
Growth Rate (SGR). Currently, Medicare
payments to doctors are adjusted annually
by the SGR. However, it has consistently
overspent the spending target forcing
future payments to be reduced. When the
current patch to the SGRs
overspending expires, the payments that
many doctors rely on to see Medicare
patients who couldnt otherwise
afford to visit a doctor will be cut by
almost 21 percent. This cut in payments may
force many doctors, who already receive
less than market value for seeing these
patients, to stop admitting Medicare
patients altogether, which will severely
impact the quality of care that our seniors
receive.
For too long, Congress has passed
short-term fixes that have created much
uncertainty for those who rely on the
Medicare program. Fortunately, both
Democrats and Republicans in the House of
Representatives came together this past
week to replace this broken system with a
permanent solution that ensures seniors can
access the care that they deserve.
I was proud to support the Medicare
Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act,
legislation that replaces the flawed SGR
formula with a bipartisan, bicameral
agreement to restore stability to the
Medicare payment process. It ensures that
our doctors will keep getting paid and that
our seniors will keep receiving proper
care. It eliminates the threat of massive
Medicare payment cuts year after year and
rewards our providers based on quality and
efficiency, not quantity. Along with
providing stability in the marketplace,
this legislation is the first step to
putting Medicare on a sustainable path.
Additionally, included in this agreement
was a bill I introduced, theBetter
Efficiency and Administrative
Simplification Act. This legislation
gives the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) the authority to allow
beneficiaries to receive their Medicare
Summary Notices more frequently and to
expand the email option to other
beneficiary documents. By increasing the
frequency of these notices, beneficiaries
are able to catch fraudulent billing right
away, as opposed to months after the
services have been received. The sooner
beneficiaries can report incorrect billing,
the sooner the government can stop the
payments from going out. The idea for this
legislation came straight from a
constituent in North Canton, and its
a commonsense solution to reduce waste,
fraud, and abuse in the Medicare
system.
I am hopeful that the United States
Senate will quickly pass the Medicare
Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act and
allow the president to sign this bill,
which received 392 votes out of 429, into
law. It is certainly a step in the right
direction, and I hope it will lead to other
bipartisan, bicameral agreements. As your
representative in Congress, I will continue
to fight for a health care system that
strengthens the programs that Ohioans rely
on and emphasizes patient-centered
care.
