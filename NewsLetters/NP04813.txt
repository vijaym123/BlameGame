Friend -- Who does the government work for: Millionaires and billionaires?
Or all of us?
The Republicans have a plan to take over the Senate, and it starts and ends with Big Money &ndash; Koch Brother money, Big Oil money, Wall Street money. They have poured uncounted millions of dollars into campaigns, planning to buy elections for the candidates who will protect the tender fannies of the rich and powerful.
We&rsquo;re fighting back.
We&rsquo;re fighting back with our voices and our votes -- and it all comes down this final Get Out the Vote weekend. Door knocking and telephone banking. Getting people to fill out their ballots or getting them to the polls.
I know that everyone is stretched thin right now -- but what we&rsquo;re able to raise in the last 12 hours of the month for our Final Get Out the Vote Push could make the difference on Election Day for our closest campaigns.
Can you pitch in to support the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Get Out the Vote Push? They have just 12 hours left until their last monthly fundraising deadline of the election.

I just got back from Kentucky, where I was trying to help Alison Lundergan Grimes beat Mitch McConnell. And in the past month, I&rsquo;ve also been to Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Oregon to fight for our Democratic Senate candidates.
Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m fighting my heart out: Despite an all-out assault by the GOP and their powerful friends, six races that will decide control of the Senate are still in a dead heat.
We know what&rsquo;s at stake if we lose control of the Senate. Two years of a Senate that takes vote after vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, weaken the rules for Wall Street, and regulate women&#39;s bodies like it&#39;s 1954. Two years of a Senate not just filibustering bills on raising the minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, and student loan reform -- but refusing to let them be considered at all.
It&#39;s not too late for your contribution to make a difference.
The DSCC is mobilizing the biggest Get Out The Vote effort in midterm election history. They have an army of staff and volunteers on the ground in battleground states.
But they still need to close a $670,032 gap in their final weekend GOTV budget.
Democracy is on the line. Will the millionaires and billionaires buy this race? Or will we make the voices of the people heard?
It all comes down to getting out the vote.
Thank you for being part of this,
Elizabeth Warren
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
