Dear Friend,
As if the
Presidents attacks on Montana energy jobs werent enough, Washington State
Governor Jay Inslee recently opened a new front in the War on Coal
when he signed an executive order that would drastically cut
and
eventually eliminate
his states import of coal-fired electricity from
Montana.
Governor Inslees executive order, which
calls on Washington State agencies to eventually eliminate the use of
electrical power produced by coal, would impact the viability of
Montanas Colstrip Power Plant and jeopardize the 3,740 Montana jobs it
supports. This amounts to nothing short of economic warfare waged against
the State of Montana and its citizens.
I sent a letter to
Governor Inslee asking that he rethink his goal to eliminate
coal-fired power. In Montana, we know that coal is the most reliable, abundant,
and cost-effective source of energy for generating electricity.
Governor Inslees new regulations would have serious consequences on
Montanas coal industry
threatening Montana jobs and needlessly increasing
the price of electricity for hardworking families and
businesses.
Should Washington State push ahead with Governor Inslee's
greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals even if it jeopardizes thousands of
Montana jobs? Yes,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions is more important. No, Montana jobs are more
important. I'm not
sure. *By
