Dear Friend:
This week Utahs Hill Air Force Base got
some great news with the announcement of
congressional approval for funding for the
construction of a new maintenance hangar at Hill
Air Force Base for the F-35 stealth fighter jet.
Hills 388th Fighter Wing will perform the
operational maintenance at Hill.
This new facility will ensure that the
hard-working personnel on the base have the
resources they need to maintain the
militarys next generation aircraft.
Theres much more work to do and I look
forward to working with our congressional
delegation and state and military leaders to
continue to ensure that Hill remains a
world-class facility.
I joined with Senator Mike Lee and Congressman
Rob Bishop in making the announcement. You can
read the joint press release
here.
I also delivered two speeches this week
calling the Obama Administration to task on two
key issues: a proposed IRS rule designed to
suppress the free speech of 501(c) 4 groups, or
social welfare organizations; and broken
Obamacare promises for Utah seniors.
These speeches can be found at the links
below.

Amendment Rights; Reject 501(c) 4 Rule

for Utah Seniors
Also, a report released this week shows just
how much steep cuts to the popular Medicare
Advantage (MA) program will hurt Utah
seniors access to quality and affordable
health care. The report found that seniors who
rely on this critical program may see their
benefits reduced and premiums increased by
between $65 to $145 a month over the next two
years.

Study Shows Medicare Advantage Cuts Will Hurt
Seniors' Access to Quality Health Care
I hope this information is helpful. As always,
please do not hesitate to contact me to share any
comments or concerns you have.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
