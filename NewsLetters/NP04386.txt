Dear Friend &ndash;
Yesterday, President Obama announced he will use his authority to protect over four million undocumented immigrants from the threat of deportation.
His actions will:
- Crackdown on illegal immigration at the border
- Focus on deporting felons instead of families
- Hold accountable certain undocumented immigrants by requiring they pass a background and pay taxes
His announcement provides long-awaited relief for millions of families suffering from our broken immigration system. It&rsquo;s been 512 days since the Senate overwhelmingly passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. All House Republicans had to do was bring it to the floor. Instead, they walked out of negotiations and refused to act.
Because they were unwilling to use their power to act, the President had to act. Executive action is not ideal, but unfortunately it is necessary.
However, Republicans in the House and Senate are not off the hook. Congress has a responsibility to pass the comprehensive reform necessary to provide certainty for American communities, businesses and families.
I have and will continue to work towards the kind of permanent reform only Congress can enact.
Very truly yours,Loretta
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
