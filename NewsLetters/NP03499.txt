Dear Friend,
We can and must do more to jumpstart our
economy and create more opportunities for
Ohioans and Americans everywhere. Thanks to
our abundant domestic energy resources, our
country is in a position to do just
that.
With bipartisan support in both the
House of Representatives and the United
States Senate, the Keystone pipeline is an
energy infrastructure project that will
grow our economy and lead to the creation
of thousands of jobs. However, because a
portion of the pipeline crosses the
Canadian border, the administration must
approve it.
Something that President Obama and I
agree on is that we need an energy strategy
for our future. The Keystone XL pipeline is
a critical element of that strategy.
However, the president continues to stand
in the way of its construction.
Its been more than 2,300 days
since the pipelines application was
submitted to the U.S. State Department. The
president has stated that he would approve
the pipeline only if it does not
significantly exacerbate the climate
problem. Despite multiple studies
commissioned by the administration that
confirm the project would have little
effect on the environment, the fate of the
pipeline remains undetermined. It was even
more uncertain when in April the president
suspended the State Departments
review of the pipeline, citing a lawsuit in
Nebraska sparked by the pipelines
route. Last week, the Nebraska Supreme
Court tossed out the case
leaving
the White House with no more excuses.
This past week, the House passed H.R. 3,
a bill that approves the Keystone pipeline.
Despite veto threats from the president,
the newly-Republican controlled Senate will
also vote on legislation to approve the
pipeline.
President Obama has said that he wants
to work with the new Congress. Its
time that he works with us
instead
of against us
to advance solutions
that will help get this country back on
track. After more than six years of delay,
it is time to put politics aside and build
the pipeline to strengthen our energy
security, create thousands of jobs, and
spur economic growth.
