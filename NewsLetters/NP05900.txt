Lipinski Praises Manufacturers, Workers
on National Manufacturing
Day
Today, on the third annual National
Manufacturing Day, Congressman Dan Lipinski is thanking our nations
manufacturers and their hard-working employees for the critical role they
play in our national economy and in keeping good-paying jobs in our
local communities.
Today is an opportunity to salute a sector of our economy that over
the years has provided so many high quality jobs in my district and
across the United States, stated Rep Lipinski.
Manufacturing is
the linchpin of our economy and the foundation of our middle class, and
I promise to continue working to see that manufacturing in this
country is strengthened and provided with the tools necessary for long-term
survival.
To create a
focused strategy for growing domestic manufacturing and reverse the
offshoring of jobs, Congressman Lipinski has developed the American
Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, H.R. 2477.
It requires the
president to bring together private-sector leaders and government officials
to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the manufacturing sector and
develop specific recommendations for promoting the success of American
manufacturing.
This would be repeated every four years and the
implementation of the recommendations would be reviewed annually.
Lipinskis bill passed the House in September as part of H.R.2996, the
bipartisan Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI)
Act.
To ensure that the $530 billion the federal government
spends annually on goods and services buys products made by American
workers, Lipinski has introduced the Buy American Improvement Act, H.R.
3346.
Under this bill, products would have to be 75 percent made
in America to be considered American-made, rather than only 50
percent.

Reps. Lipinski and Davis Introduce Bipartisan
Bill
to Boost Jobs in Skilled Trades
U.S. Reps.
Dan Lipinski (IL-3) and Rodney Davis (IL-13) have introduced
bipartisan legislation, the Leveraging and Energizing Americas Apprenticeship
Programs (LEAP) Act, to reinvigorate Americas apprenticeship
programs in skilled industries.
Millions of hard working Americans continue to struggle to
find work, while jobs are left unfilled because companies are unable
to find qualified workers, said Rep. Lipinski.
This problem is
not going to go away on its own.
In an effort to better prepare
our nations workforce for today and tomorrow, and to ensure that
Americans fill these positions, its imperative that Congress approve the
LEAP Act.
Its a win-win for both employers and employees, and
the bill would be fully paid for through an offset.

Act, click

Lipinski Announces Grant
for Manufacturing
and Workforce
Development
Congressman Dan Lipinski has helped secure $200,000 for Cook
County through the Economic Development Administration.
This
investment supports the start-up efforts of the Chicago Metro Metal
Consortium Manufacturing Community.
Focused on accelerating the
development of the metals manufacturing cluster in the Chicago region, this
investment will help develop long-term growth strategies for community
investment and workforce development that will ultimately lead to
higher-skill, higher wage jobs.
Im always interested in helping local organizations and
businesses talk directly with federal agencies and tap into the
assistance that is available to them, Rep. Lipinski said.
The
last few years have been extremely difficult for the manufacturing
industry in both the region and the country, which is why I will continue
to do everything I can to help businesses create quality, long term
jobs for the middle
class.
In May of this year the Chicago Metro Metal Consortium Manufacturing
Community was announced as a designated Manufacturing Community, part
of the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership initiative.
The U.S. Commerce Department-led program is designed to
accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in communities nationwide by
supporting the development of long-term economic development
strategies that help communities attract and expand private investment in
the manufacturing sector and increase international trade and
exports.
