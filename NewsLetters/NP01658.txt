Congressman Lamborn Supports Full
Funding of PILT Program
4/7/15
Congressman Doug
Lamborn has joined one hundred of his Congressional colleagues in a
bipartisan call for full and sustainable funding for the Payments in Lieu
of Taxes (PILT) program for Fiscal Year 2016 and beyond. PILT provides
payments to local governments in 49 states and nearly 1,900 counties
to offset foregone revenue due to tax-exempt federal lands within their
jurisdictions. Current discretionary appropriations for PILT are set
to expire on September 30, 2015. Without congressional action, there
is a risk that counties' ability to operate and provide essential
services will be crippled.
