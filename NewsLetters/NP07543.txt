If you&rsquo;re wondering why you&rsquo;re getting all this email on a Friday night, it&rsquo;s simple:
THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOW A REAL POSSIBILITY
No other President in history has had to face the prospect of being taken to court by Congress. And the White House alerted us today that it could lead to impeachment.
These historic (and totally unfounded) attacks require an historic response -- and that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing right now. We are now in range of
$1,OOO,OOO
raised since Republicans voted to authorize the lawsuit (that just since yesterday!).
To hit our goal -- and show that we&rsquo;re 100% behind the President -- we need to raise $6,628 more. We have 2 HOURS to do it.
According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to fight back since the vote. We need you right now, if we&rsquo;re going to do this.
