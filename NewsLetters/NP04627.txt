Dear Friend,
Because of your efforts, I have been elected to a full term in the United States Senate.
It is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Senator, continuing the inspiring legacy of John Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and John Kerry and partnering with the incredible Elizabeth Warren in the Senate.
This victory isn&rsquo;t the end of our fight -- it is just the beginning. We have more work to do.
We must protect and strengthen the social safety net that supports our seniors for their lifetime of hard work. We must stop the tragic shootings that take young lives and leave lasting wounds in our communities. We must cure the dangerous diseases that steal lives and shatter families, like Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and cancer.
We have more work to do, friend. But I can promise you that as long as I serve as your Senator, I will stand up to Big Oil and Wall Street. I will push for gun control legislation that tells the NRA that they stand for Not Relevant Anymore in American politics. I will push for comprehensive climate change legislation that creates jobs and preserves our environment for future generations. I will push for an increase in medical research funding to find cures for these diseases and keep Massachusetts the leader in biotechnology jobs and public health breakthroughs.
You have given me the greatest honor the son of a milkman from Malden could hope for -- a chance to fight for our families in the United States Senate. And I will not back down.
This election is YOUR victory. This job I am entrusted with is about working for YOU. It&rsquo;s about YOUR families. YOUR hopes. YOUR dreams. I will never forget that.
Thank you, once again, for all of your help.
