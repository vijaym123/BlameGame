Friend,
He&#39;s here. John Boehner, in our own backyard (see the
picture from today
of he and Doug Ose enjoying their afternoon!).
He&#39;s raising big money for Ami&#39;s opponent, and we have to fight back -
click here and give $5, $10, or more right now.
Early reports have nearly 40 people crowded into the venue to get a glimpse of Boehner. And that&#39;s just the regular
$1000 per plate
attendees. Who knows how many pictures
($2600 a piece)
have been taken? Or how many hosts
($10,000 a piece)
have signed on?
***WE ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING OUTRAISED AND OUTSPENT!!!***
PLEASE GIVE RIGHT NOW SO THAT DOESN&#39;T HAPPEN
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
