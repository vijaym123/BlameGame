Week in Review
Dear Friend,
As always, thank you for subscribing to receive my e-newsletter!
I'm happy to share with you the highlights from a busy week in Washington and back home in the district.
100 Days Strong
We've reached the 100th day of the 114th Congress! From fighting for policies to strengthen agriculture and our local economy, to advocating for stronger mental heath and veterans services in CNY, to delivering quality constituent service, I'm proud to mark my 100th day in office with a complete report on our successes for the 24th Congressional District.
You can read the full report

Repealing the Death Tax
With my support, the House passed legislation to repeal the federal estate, or "death" tax.
Many hardworking CNY family farmers and small business work for years to pass on opportunity to their children -- only to face a large tax bill at death. This legislation prevents these families from being penalized by onerous tax regulations.
You can read more about this legislation,

Honored as a Champion of Change
I am incredibly grateful to be honored with the National Down Syndrome Society Champion of Change Award. CNY native and national advocate, Kayla McKeon visited my Washington office this week to discuss the important mission of NDSS. I'm proud to fight alongside Kayla and others to improve the lives of people with Down Syndrome across our country.
Community Meetings
Pastor Daren Jaime from the People's A.M.E. Zion Church stopped by my Syracuse office this week.
We had a great conversation about the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn and working to fight poverty in the City of Syracuse.
Today, I stopped by Aspen Dental's corporate headquarters in East Syracuse.
This company has a huge impact on Central New York's economy, and I was able to meet with hundreds of their employees today and learn about their exciting plans to provide dental services to our local veterans community.
Again, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
