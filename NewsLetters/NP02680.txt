LEGISLATION
February 22, 2015
Dear
David,
Last week, the
Office of Inspector General released
an official report
verifying what my office uncovered in
our year-long investigation of the Oakland
Veterans Affairs Regional office : chronic mismanagement has delayed
veterans from receiving the care they deserve. Some veterans have been
waiting 12 years for a simple response to their claim. Among its many
staggering findings,
this report
confirms that while the Oakland VA identified at least 13,184
unprocessed claims in 2012, the VA cannot confirm these claims were ever
processed or whether veterans ever received the benefits they needed. The
OIG report
(click here to read in
full)
barely scratches the surface of the dysfunction my staff
uncovered, and I am continuing to investigate this widespread problem. Our
veterans are our heroes and I will continue to champion structural
reform and access to efficient quality care for all of
them.
Below are some highlights from DC and our district. To learn about how I
can serve you and to follow me throughout the week, please visit
my website
and stay in touch with me
on
my Facebook
page .
Sincerely,
Rep.
LaMalfa visits with the Nevada County Farm Bureau in Grass Valley on
Feb. 19th to discuss priorities and concerns for North State farming
during the 114th Congressional
session.
Last week, the House passed
Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015
(HR 636) . This measure, which makes several pro-growth tax
policies permanent, is extremely important to our local farmers and ranchers
who need to update their equipment. The bill makes the current
expensing levels of up to $500,000 permanent in Section 179 of the tax code,
allowing small businesses the flexibility to invest in equipment and
technology to grow their operations. Year after year, Congress has
provided short term reauthorizations of this provision, and now is the
time to cement this common sense solution to provide much needed relief
and certainty to small businesses and our nations working
families.
Rep. LaMalfa receives the
True Blue award
from the Family Research Council for
consistently voting to defend faith, family and freedom.
