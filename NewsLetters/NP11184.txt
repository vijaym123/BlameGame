During my time as a congressman, one thing I have learned is that the
devil is always in the details. Legislation with the grandest of
intentions can lead to the most pernicious of outcomes. From federal
efforts to fix our health insurance system that led us to Obamacare to
state efforts to escape from No Child Left Behind that stuck Tennessee
with Common Core, we should remain cautiously skeptical of even the
sincerest of efforts that would cloak their details under the shadow of
empathy and urgency.
What is even worse, though, is an impromptu approach to a set of
details that conflates mere action with sound strategy.
This could never have been clearer last year when I introduced a bill
to prohibit President Obama from arming the Syrian rebels, many of whom
would surely take up those arms against us subsequently in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other places where militant Islamists and their
terrorist allies seek to challenge democracy, human rights and rule of
law. Later I voted against the President's request to arm these rebels.
That is why this week I was one of 19 representatives of the 435 in the
U.S. House to vote against allowing President Obama to send tens of
millions of dollars of aid to Ukraine. Earlier this month, I was one of
23 to vote against giving him the authority to loan Ukraine one billion
tax payer dollars.
Let me be clear: I stand against President Putin's meddling in Crimea
and support efforts to punish Russia for its intransigence and its
disregard for Ukraine's sovereignty.
However, recently I met with veterans who are wondering why our men and
women in uniform struggle to make ends meet and get squeezed by
budgetary concerns in Congress.
I cannot in good conscience vote to
support these types of assistance packages without some assurances that
the aid rendered, whether through loan guarantees or direct aid, will
be appropriately spent to secure our nation's strategic interests.
Economic aid involving the outlay of American taxpayer dollars, must be
offered in ways that ensure that money will be paid back in full.
Past
international efforts with a number of Ukrainian governments included
promises of economic reforms such as allowing the local currency to
float and the privatization of their natural gas operations.
Neither
has occurred and has precipitated Ukraine's perilous financial
position.
I think it is reasonable to demand real movement on these
issues before placing American capital aid in a risky investment that
could eventually end up in the hands of corrupt officials and never
paid back.
That said, the United States should stand strong with its European
allies in bringing pressure to bear on Russia. Removing Russia from the
G8 and sanctioning Putin's inner circle were positive first steps in
sending a strong message of unity. However, you and I both know the old
saying, "money talks."
Russia possesses an economic stranglehold on Ukraine by way of its own
immense natural gas reserves and Ukraine's energy needs. But with its
nascent shale boon, the United States can play an important and
effective role in loosening Russia's grip. Right now, exporting natural
gas (LNG) from the U.S. to most countries requires significant and
arduous regulatory approval from the federal government. President
Obama currently has 24 pending applications sitting on his desk, some
for more than two years. If we were to loosen these restrictions, not
only could we ease Ukraine's reliance on Russia, but we could also
boost our own economy and create good paying jobs here at home.
Rather than giving blank checks to this President, Congress should work
with the White House to bring more U.S. natural gas to market. By
allowing the free market to ease Putin's stranglehold on Ukraine, we
could hit Putin and his oligarch friends in their pocket books, stand
for democracy and human rights, and at the same time, support our own
energy market and provide good paying jobs here at home. That is the
kind of nation building I can get behind.

During
my
time
as
a
congressman,
one
thing
I
have
learned
is
that
the
devil
is
always
in
the
details.
Legislation
with
the
grandest
of
intentions
can
lead
to
the
most
pernicious
of
outcomes.
From
federal
efforts
to
fix
our
health
insurance
system
that
led
us
to
Obamacare
to
state
efforts
to
escape
from
No
Child
Left
Behind
that
stuck
Tennessee
with
Common
Core,
we
should
remain
cautiously
skeptical
of
even
the
sincerest
of
efforts
that
would
cloak
their
details
under
the
shadow
of
empathy
and
urgency.
What
is
even
worse,
though,
is
an
impromptu
approach
to
a
set
of
details
that
conflates
mere
action
with
sound
strategy.
This
could
never
have
been
clearer
last
year
when
I
introduced
a
bill
to
prohibit
President
Obama
from
arming
the
Syrian
rebels,
many
of
whom
would
surely
take
up
those
arms
against
us
subsequently
in
Iraq,
Afghanistan,
and
other
places
where
militant
Islamists
and
their
terrorist
allies
seek
to
challenge
democracy,
human
rights
and
rule
of
law.
Later
I
voted
against
the
President&#8217;s
request
to
arm
these
rebels.
That
is
why
this
week
I
was
one
of
19
representatives
of
the
435
in
the
U.S.
House
to
vote
against
allowing
President
Obama
to
send
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
aid
to
Ukraine.
Earlier
this
month,
I
was
one
of
23
to
vote
against
giving
him
the
authority
to
loan
Ukraine
one
billion
tax
payer
dollars.
Let
me
be
clear:
I
stand
against
President
Putin&#8217;s
meddling
in
Crimea
and
support
efforts
to
punish
Russia
for
its
intransigence
and
its
disregard
for
Ukraine&#8217;s
sovereignty.
However,
recently
I
met
with
veterans
who
are
wondering
why
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
and
get
squeezed
by
budgetary
concerns
in
Congress.
I
cannot
in
good
conscience
vote
to
support
these
types
of
assistance
packages
without
some
assurances
that
the
aid
rendered,
whether
through
loan
guarantees
or
direct
aid,
will
be
appropriately
spent
to
secure
our
nation&#8217;s
strategic
interests.
Economic
aid
involving
the
outlay
of
American
taxpayer
dollars,
must
be
offered
in
ways
that
ensure
that
money
will
be
paid
back
in
full.
Past
international
efforts
with
a
number
of
Ukrainian
governments
included
promises
of
economic
reforms
such
as
allowing
the
local
currency
to
float
and
the
privatization
of
their
natural
gas
operations.
Neither
has
occurred
and
has
precipitated
Ukraine&#8217;s
perilous
financial
position.
I
think
it
is
reasonable
to
demand
real
movement
on
these
issues
before
placing
American
capital
aid
in
a
risky
investment
that
could
eventually
end
up
in
the
hands
of
corrupt
officials
and
never
paid
back.
That
said,
the
United
States
should
stand
strong
with
its
European
allies
in
bringing
pressure
to
bear
on
Russia.
Removing
Russia
from
the
G8
and
sanctioning
Putin&#8217;s
inner
circle
were
positive
first
steps
in
sending
a
strong
message
of
unity.
However,
you
and
I
both
know
the
old
saying,
&#8220;money
talks.&#8221;
Russia
possesses
an
economic
stranglehold
on
Ukraine
by
way
of
its
own
immense
natural
gas
reserves
and
Ukraine&#8217;s
energy
needs.
But
with
its
nascent
shale
boon,
the
United
States
can
play
an
important
and
effective
role
in
loosening
Russia&#8217;s
grip.
Right
now,
exporting
natural
gas
(LNG)
from
the
U.S.
to
most
countries
requires
significant
and
arduous
regulatory
approval
from
the
federal
government.
President
Obama
currently
has
24
pending
applications
sitting
on
his
desk,
some
for
more
than
two
years.
If
we
were
to
loosen
these
restrictions,
not
only
could
we
ease
Ukraine&#8217;s
reliance
on
Russia,
but
we
could
also
boost
our
own
economy
and
create
good
paying
jobs
here
at
home.
Rather
than
giving
blank
checks
to
this
President,
Congress
should
work
with
the
White
House
to
bring
more
U.S.
natural
gas
to
market.
By
allowing
the
free
market
to
ease
Putin&#8217;s
stranglehold
on
Ukraine,
we
could
hit
Putin
and
his
oligarch
friends
in
their
pocket
books,
stand
for
democracy
and
human
rights,
and
at
the
same
time,
support
our
own
energy
market
and
provide
good
paying
jobs
here
at
home.
That
is
the
kind
of
nation
building
I
can
get
behind.
