Voted to Establish Select Committee on Benghazi
No matter how you look at it - justice has not been served for the four
Americans killed in Benghazi on the night of September 11, 2012.
The White House can claim all it wants that the questions of this
tragic night have been answered. But, that is NOT so, and this case
deserves the investigation of a Select Committee.
I am a long-time supporter of a Select Committee for Benghazi and have
pushed House legislation (H.Res.36) since early 2013 to probe and
report on the murders. On Thursday, I helped move this forward by
voting to support House Speaker John Boehner's legislation to create a
Benghazi Select Committee.
The need for this panel is more relevant than ever after a White House
email revealed that discussions were being held over how former U.N.
Ambassador Susan Rice should characterize Benghazi in news interviews.
What exactly happened on the night of September 11, 2012? The families
of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, a Foreign Service information
officer, and two security personnel killed at the U.S. Diplomatic
Mission in Benghazi, Libya deserve to know.
So do Congress and the rest of America.
Lerner Should be Held in Contempt of Congress, Special Counsel Needed
to Investigate IRS Targeting
When it comes to the IRS's targeting of conservative groups based on
political philosophy, it's clear to me that we're not finished with
this dark chapter of American history. Congress and the American public
do not have all the answers they deserve, and I won't stop fighting
until they get them.
That's why I led the fight last year as head of the Financial Services
and General Government Appropriations to cut the IRS's budget. And, it's
why I told Commissioner John Koskinen a month ago that I was 'troubled'
that he was asking for a 10 percent increase for the IRS for 2015.
But my fight to hold the IRS accountable does not end there. On
Wednesday, I voted to call on the Attorney General to convene a special
counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative groups so the IRS
can be held fully accountable for its actions. I also voted to support
holding Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer
questions that will help Congress get to the bottom of what happened.

Voted
to
Establish
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi
No
matter
how
you
look
at
it
&#8211;
justice
has
not
been
served
for
the
four
Americans
killed
in
Benghazi
on
the
night
of
September
11,
2012. The
White
House
can
claim
all
it
wants
that
the
questions
of
this
tragic
night
have
been
answered.
But,
that
is
NOT
so,
and
this case
deserves
the
investigation
of
a
Select
Committee.
I
am
a
long-time
supporter
of
a
Select
Committee
for
Benghazi
and
have
pushed
House
legislation
(H.Res.36)
since
early
2013
to
probe
and
report
on
the
murders.
On
Thursday,
I
helped
move
this
forward
by
voting
to
support
House
Speaker
John
Boehner&#8217;s
legislation
to
create
a
Benghazi
Select
Committee.
The
need
for
this
panel
is
more
relevant
than
ever
after
a
White
House
email
revealed
that
discussions
were
being
held
over
how
former
U.N.
Ambassador
Susan
Rice
should
characterize
Benghazi
in
news
interviews.
What
exactly
happened
on
the
night
of
September
11,
2012?
The
families
of
U.S.
Ambassador
Christopher
Stevens,
a
Foreign
Service
information
officer,
and
two
security
personnel
killed
at
the
U.S.
Diplomatic
Mission
in
Benghazi,
Libya
deserve
to
know.
So
do
Congress
and
the
rest
of
America.
Lerner

Special
Counsel
Needed
to
Investigate
IRS
Targeting
When
it
comes
to
the
IRS&#8217;s
targeting
of
conservative
groups
based
on
political
philosophy,
it&#8217;s
clear
to
me
that
we&#8217;re
not
finished
with
this
dark
chapter
of
American
history.
Congress
and
the
American
public
do
not
have
all
the
answers
they
deserve,
and
I
won&#8217;t
stop
fighting
until
they
get
them.
That&#8217;s
why
I
led
the
fight
last
year
as
head
of
the
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
Appropriations
to
cut
the
IRS&#8217;s
budget.
And,
it&#8217;s
why
I
told
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
a
month
ago
that
I
was
&#8216;troubled&#8217;
that
he
was
asking
for
a
10
percent
increase
for
the
IRS
for
2015.
But
my
fight
to
hold
the
IRS
accountable
does
not
end
there.
On
Wednesday,
I
voted
to
call
on
the
Attorney
General
to
convene
a
special
counsel
to
investigate
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups
so
the
IRS
can
be
held
fully
accountable
for
its
actions.
I
also
voted
to
support
holding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
that
will
help
Congress
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened.
