ANOTHER OBAMACARE
PRICE HIKE?
WE NEED TRULY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
REFORM
Blue Cross has proposed a 25.7 percent rate
hike for Obamacare plans in North Carolina.
What
happened to the "Affordable" Care Act?
Earlier this
month, I partnered with 31 colleagues to introduce legislation to
repeal Obamacare and replace it
with:
Affordable health insurance through smarter, fairer tax
deductions
Increased support for those with pre-existing
conditions
Lower costs through increased
competition
The freedom to choose the health plan thats right for your
family
Obamacare was supposed to lower health
care costs.
Can you think of any bloated, big
government program that actually lowered the true cost of
anything?
We arent proposing another Washington solution.
Instead, we
are focused on
common sense reform which lowers costs, doesnt
penalize you for buying your own insurance, and protects those with
pre-existing conditions .
Our plan offers truly
affordable health care reform by targeting specific problems that increase
health care costs, which Obamacare leaves in place.
The
American Health Care Reform
Act
was drafted by the Republican Study Committees Health Care
Task Force.
As a member of the RSC Steering Committee, I signed
on as an original co-sponsor of the new health care reform
legislation.
This week, we also had several meetings to discuss House
priorities should the Supreme Court rule against Obamacare in King v.
Burwell.
If you have questions about health care reform legislation or
recent proposals, please call my Washington office at
202-225-1976.

CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER TO IRAN: TRUTH WILL
PREVAIL
Last weekend in Paris, I addressed
a crowd of more than
100,000 people at a major rally for the
Iranian pro-democracy movement.
Focusing on the
current Iranian regimes poor human rights record, including persecution
of religious minorities and political dissidents, I told the
pro-democracy demonstrators that the
American people and American
Congress stand in solidarity with them for freedom, liberty, and
democracy. Truth will prevail.
This annual rally is a major international
gathering of Iranian expatriates and organizations calling for regime
change in Iran.
The Organization for Iranian American
Communities invited me to participate, along with several other Americans
including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former CIA
Director James Woolsey, former UN Ambassador Bill Richardson, and former
presidential candidate Howard Dean.
Unfortunately, President Obama
did not send a representative.
This past Monday, I
spoke with WBT Radio's
Charlotte's Morning News
about the
speech and my support for the Iranian pro-democracy movement.
