NY TIMES:
&ldquo;Outside Groups Set Spending Record in Midterms&rdquo;
Demand Campaign Finance Reform &gt;&gt;
Friend -- Republicans are about to take charge of the Senate in the new year -- but let&rsquo;s NEVER forget how they won it.
The new Republican Senate is bought and paid for by the Koch brothers!
The
New York Times
reports that outside groups spent a record-high $814 million to buy the midterm elections.
That&rsquo;s nearly TRIPLE what these groups spent in the last midterm election.
It&#39;s clear that we need real campaign finance reform -- and the first step is a Constitutional Amendment overturning the disastrous
Citizens United
ruling that led to it all.
ADD YOUR NAME: Stand with Democrats today and support an end to
Citizens United
and dark money in politics &gt;&gt;

Citizens United :
Signature Pending &gt;&gt;
The
New York Times
warns that &ldquo;the most obvious explanation for the rapid increase is the effect of the 2010
Citizens United
decision by the Supreme Court and the rise in spending by super PACs.&rdquo; This spending is what allowed Republican dark money groups to literally buy the GOP control of the Senate.
In return, Republicans are planning to pass even more tax breaks that favor the millionaires and billionaires bankrolling their campaigns. And to pay for it all, they&rsquo;re sure to wreak havoc on the middle class.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve got to fight back. We&rsquo;ve already had 450,000 Democrats sign on to demand campaign finance reform.
If you can get us to 500,000 grassroots signatures by midnight, it&rsquo;ll send a critically urgent message: Americans are DEMANDING an end to this corruption.
Sign on now: Demand real campaign finance reform and an END to
Citizens United!
Thanks,
Stop the GOP
