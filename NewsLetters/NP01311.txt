Hello,
This week marked 100 Days since the start of
the new Congress. I hope you'll take a moment to see the video I made to
show you what I've been up to:
Protecting Our
Great Lakes
I've been leading
the fight in Congress to ensure that our Great Lakes are preserved and
protected. This week, I was able to ensure that our drinking water
will remain safe by getting language I wrote inserted in the FY2016
Energy &amp; Water Appropriations Bill. This was a huge win for our Great
Lakes.

this

Passing
Bills
This week we had an important accomplishment. I serve on the
Military Construction &amp; Veterans Affairs subcommittee of the
House Committee on Appropriations and we passed our FY16 funding bill with
unanimous support.
The legislation
contains funding to house, train, and equip military personnel, provide
housing and services to military families, and help maintain base
infrastructure. The bill also funds veterans benefits and programs. I'm proud
that we were able to come together to pass this common sense
legislation.
Touring a Small
Business
On Friday, I had a chance to tour
Pierre's Ice Cream. A family run business for over 80 years in the
Cleveland area, I spoke with their leadership team about ways that I can
help them and the challenges they face a growing small
business.
100 Days
I'm working hard
for you every day in Congress, and we're making progress every day,
brick by brick. I hope you'll take a moment and watch a video I made to
show you how I've been working for you.
If you'd
like to stay more up to date about what's going on in Congress, I
hope you'll follow me on social media where I post updates often.

It is an honor to serve and be your voice
