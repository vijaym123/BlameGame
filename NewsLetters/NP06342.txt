Boehner sure didn&rsquo;t bargain for
THIS! LATE FRIDAY NIGHT:
Republicans dumped
$1,850,000.00
on Chicagoland T.V. to bash Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
But then...
YOU. FOUGHT. BACK.
Since Boehner&rsquo;s big ad buy, more than 900 supporters have chipped in for Brad online!
THAT&rsquo;S AMAZING!!!
If we can hit 1,000
donors by MIDNIGHT, it'll send a LOUD AND CLEAR message to Boehner:
we're not backing down.
ILLINOIS -- ARE YOU IN?
