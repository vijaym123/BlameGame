Dear
Friends,
When it comes to
immigration, I remain steadfast in my support for border security, interior
enforcement and respecting the rule of law.
We must secure our
borders and
do
a better job of monitoring visa
overstays before we can begin to entertain other immigration reform
proposals. That was the mistake that was made in the 1986 law, and I
refuse to repeat past failed
legislation.
I
do
not support the Senate
immigration bill because it rewards people who have broken the rules
over those who are trying to legally gain citizenship.
Further,
it fails to reduce the future flow of illegal
immigrants.
Most importantly, I
do
not trust this administration to enforce components of
immigration reform they
do
not support, like
strengthening border security and interior enforcement measures.
Instead of
passing redundant legislation, the American people deserve a plan
that promotes economic growth, supports the American workforce, and
protects hardworking taxpayers.
I
would appreciate your thoughts on this important issue by
particpating in the survey to the right of this page.
Please feel free
to forward this newsletter to your friends and family so they can
participate too.
Thank
you
for sharing your views.
Stay in
touch and God bless,
Tell a
Friend
