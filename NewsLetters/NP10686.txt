Dear Friend,
This week marks a deeply meaningful time for Jews and Christians throughout our community, our country, and the world. Like so many South Florida families, tonight my family and I will celebrate the first night of Passover by retelling the story of the Jewish peoples liberation from slavery. To all those gathering around the Seder table, Chag Sameach.
This week is also profoundly significant for Christian families observing Good Friday and preparing for Easter Sunday. To my Christian friends and constituents, please accept my warmest wishes for a Happy Easter.
As we gather with loved ones to celebrate Passover and Easter, we are reminded that the freedom to practice our faiths is truly precious. Like all Americans, I was deeply saddened by the shootings that claimed three lives yesterday by the Jewish Community Center in Kansas City. As we offer our thoughts and prayers to the loved ones of those lost, we must also recommit ourselves to standing up against anti-Semitism, racism, hatred, and senseless violence of all kinds.
Thank you for taking the time to read this message. It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Kind regards,
Ted Deutch
