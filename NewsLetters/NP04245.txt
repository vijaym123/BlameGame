Click here to demand voting rights be reinstated &gt;&gt;

David, last month I asked you to stand with me in support of reinstating basic voter protections.
Now, I&rsquo;m asking you again. 19 days ago, we had an election with the lowest voter turnout in over 70 years.
This was no mistake. In fact, it&rsquo;s exactly what the Republicans wanted.
But you don&rsquo;t need to take my word for it. Research by the Brennan Center for Justice has already shown what we knew all along: Republican voter suppression efforts played a crucial role in driving voter turnout to historic lows in 2014.
This cannot be allowed to continue. We must recommit ourselves to protecting voting rights for all Americans. Will you stand with me to demand basic voter protections be reinstated? Sign your name:
