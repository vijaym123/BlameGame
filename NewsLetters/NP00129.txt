There is still
time
I asked and you
delivered. In previous notices I have asked Utahns the question, "How
would you fix Washington?" I have recieved hundreds of suggestions, and I
am sifting through those good ideas as they come in. I want to thank
everyone who contributed already, and I encourage those who haven't
participated to submit their ideas. You can still share your policy
proposals on
this form . This month I will be taking
some of these good ideas and having a discussion about them during my
next Tele-townhall event. Utahns are about solutions, and I want to hear
your thoughts on how we can build a better
America.

Conserving Religious
Liberty for All
Last week I gave a speech at
Hillsdale College's Kirby Center to discuss the challenges and
opportunities facing America's tradition of religious diversity, tolerance, and
freedom. Below are a few excerpts from my speech, and I invite you to
click here to read the full
speech:
"You dont need to subscribe to any particular
faith, or hold any particular beliefs about abortion or marriage, to see
the danger of a government forcing innocent people to violate their
conscience
over a partisan triviality, no less - when they are just
trying to make a living, serve their community, or educate the next
generation."
"We should never
lose sight of the fact that the marriage equality movement is succeeding
not by focusing on marriage, but by focusing on equality. Political
conservatives and religious traditionalists may not like how the gay
marriage debate is going. But it is no small thing that the gay marriage
movement has succeeded in recent years only by adopting our
principlesof tolerance, diversity, and equal opportunity. It is those
principlesnot the parties currently enjoying their political resonancethat
hold the high ground in this debate. And because those of us who believe
in religious freedom hold those principles in our heartsand not just
in our political quiver
that high ground remains open to
us."
"Soon, it seems likely that
Americas public square will fully welcome married, same-sex couples
not as
victims or revolutionaries, but simply as equals. Just as America has
mostly avoided traditional conflicts between Protestants and
Catholics, Christians and Jews, Sunni and Shia, atheists and believers
so
too Americans commitment to tolerance, diversity, and dignity is
perfectly capable of making room for the rights and dignity of those who
disagree about the meaning of marriage. But good-faith compromise
of
the sort that is Americans unique political genius
is possible only
if the government gives us the space to find it. And those tempted by
fundamentalism will be loathe to afford us this space, lest they let a
manufactured crisis go to waste."
"If we want to reinforce religious liberty in America, our first
step must be to protect that crucial space of freedom from undue
government interference. That is the principle behind a bill I will soon
introduce in the Senate."
