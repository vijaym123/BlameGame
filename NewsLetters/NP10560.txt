An Unaffordable, Unworkable Mandate
It speaks volumes when one of the most vocal supporters of the
Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act , also known as Obamacare, says it will &ldquo;destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American
middle class&rdquo; if not fixed.
But that is what James Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, made clear last year in a letter to Democratic
leadership in Congress.
The troubling provision
in the law being referred to is the employer mandate, or the &ldquo;30-hour rule,&rdquo; which redefines a full-time employee as someone who works 30
hours per week &ndash; not the 40 hours most of us are familiar with. The employer mandate, which is set to begin in 2015, requires employers with 50
or more full-time employees, working 30 plus hours a week, to offer health care coverage.
Some businesses have already started reducing full-time
employees&rsquo; hours below 30 hours a week or have replaced those full-time employees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. I've heard from
businesses in the Sixth District who are making the tough decision to cut hours or forgo hiring new workers. I&rsquo;ve also heard from many
hardworking individuals who are facing reduced hours, and consequently smaller paychecks, due to this mandate.
This is just further proof that this law is anything but affordable for American
families and businesses.
Earlier this month, the
House of Representatives took action to protect American workers from the consequences of the new 30-hour rule. The
Save American Workers Act
( H.R. 2575 ), which I cosponsored, passed the House by a
bipartisan vote. This legislation would repeal the 30-hour definition of &ldquo;full-time employment&rdquo; in Obamacare and restore the traditional
40-hour definition. I hope the Senate will see the reality of the flawed employer mandate, and pass this bill.
While I will continue to support legislation that addresses the harmful effects of this law, I
believe the entire law should be repealed.
