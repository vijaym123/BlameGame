 at House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had blamed the senator for killing House-Senate negotiations on a California water bill. Pronouncing herself a Brooklyn street-fighter, the senator accused Leader McCarthy of not consulting closely enough with her and some of her allies.
In previous Congresses, the House approved numerous major water bills (see here , here , and here ) that the Senate refused to pass. When the Senate finally approved a weak bill
last year, we thought a path had opened to negotiate a compromise bill that would at least ease the water crisis to some degree. But apparently, a water solution is not about providing relief to water-starved families or struggling farmers or devastated communities
instead, its all about Barbara Boxer and her demand that everyone pay her the proper respect.
Senator Boxer also argued that any water solution was pointless that favors only one part of the state. Of course, one part of the state
the Central Valley
is suffering much worse than other parts. For example, San Francisco, a bastion of the environmental movement, enjoys a pristine water supply piped in from Hetch Hetchy reservoir that is not subject to the environmental regulations that have devastated the Valleys water resources. Nevertheless, a solution seemingly needs to benefit everyone equally
the Central Valley and San Francisco alike
or it will not win the senators support.
House Republicans will continue proposing solutions to the water crisis in the new Congress, and we hope Senator Boxer, who has opposed every one of our efforts, will realize that none of us in the House really wants a Brooklyn street fight in California.
Sincerely,

Dear Friends,
In a meeting with reporters this week, California Senator Barbara Boxer
lashed out
at House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had blamed the senator for killing House-Senate negotiations on a California water bill. Pronouncing herself a Brooklyn street-fighter, the senator accused Leader McCarthy of not consulting closely
enough with her and some of her allies.
In previous Congresses, the House approved numerous major water
bills (see
here ,
here , and
here ) that the Senate refused to pass. When the Senate finally approved a weak
bill
last year, we thought a path had opened to negotiate a compromise bill that would at least ease the water crisis to some degree. But apparently, a water solution is not about providing relief to water-starved families or struggling farmers or devastated
communities
instead, its all about Barbara Boxer and her demand that everyone pay her the proper respect.
Senator Boxer also argued that any water solution was pointless that favors only one part of the state. Of course, one part of the state
the Central Valley
is suffering
much worse than other parts. For example, San Francisco, a bastion of the environmental movement, enjoys a pristine water supply piped in from Hetch Hetchy reservoir that is not subject to the environmental regulations that have devastated the Valleys water
resources. Nevertheless, a solution seemingly needs to benefit everyone equally
the Central Valley and San Francisco alike
or it will not win the senators support.
House Republicans will continue proposing solutions to the water crisis in the new Congress, and we hope Senator Boxer, who has opposed every one of our efforts, will
realize that none of us in the House really wants a Brooklyn street fight in California.
