Dear Friend,
Democrats in the Senate proposed a plan to halt the negative effects of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
Hobby Lobby
decision, a ruling that restricts women&rsquo;s access to contraceptive care. Republicans in the Senate blocked it.
Like they do with pretty much everything.
I am still fighting to reverse the effects of
Hobby Lobby.
Special interests are fighting to take down Democrats like me, because we stand for everything they&rsquo;re against. I need you fighting with me in this election -- and there&rsquo;s only one week left to hit our $35,000 July goal. Give $5 to help us stay strong.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I voted in favor of the
Hobby Lobby
fix because I understand the ongoing attack on women&rsquo;s rights. Personally, I think Republicans understand that ongoing attack, too -- and they understand that if they stand up to stop it, they&rsquo;ll get hammered by their Tea Party base.
This fall, we have an opportunity to send a message to the Tea Party and everyone else who thinks that women&rsquo;s rights are a political bargaining chip. And it&rsquo;s up to supporters like you to make the most of that opportunity. Kick in $5 or more to give our team the resources we need to win.
Thanks.
Ed
