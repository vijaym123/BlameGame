The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last week, we were so happy to welcome the newest Webster into the world! Sandy and I are very grateful for the precious life of our granddaughter, Laura Eileen. On Thursday night, little Laura joined us as the firstborn of our third son and his wife, who live here in Central Florida. Laura weighed 6lbs 8oz, and was 20 long. Both mother and baby are doing well, and I have already thoroughly enjoyed having a Christmas baby in the family.

On Friday morning, it was a pleasure to join the Orlando Union Rescue Mission (OURM) in serving their annual Christmas Banquet. OURM is a great organization that has a strong history of providing life-changing solutions to men and women who are seeking help and have gone through their program. It has been my honor to support their work of serving the homeless and those in need within Central Florida.

A couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in Umatillas Cracker Christmas Parade, and last Wednesday, I returned for their Elementary Christmas Reader Program. Ms. Elizabeth Mullen, the second grade teacher for Umatilla Elementary School, invited me to read Christmas books to her class. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Countdown to Christmas with the children, answering questions, and hearing some of their favorite aspects of the Christmas season.
During my visit to Umatilla, I also met both the volunteers and young ladies of the Ruth House transition home. The Ruth House provides a unique solution, serving a broad range of women who find themselves in distress. Inspired by her past and the needs of those around her, Rebecca Randall has given up her own home in order to offer shelter, security, and help to women in need. Based on the principles of recovery and Christ, the Ruth House offers a beacon of light to women who are searching for hope.

Early last week, I shot some hoops and took a spin in the new electric race karts at the I-Drive NASCAR, the indoor racing facility center in Orlando. Last Tuesday, NASCAR held their soft opening, and I met the local managers, national representatives, and fellow local officials to get a tour of their indoor race facility.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Over the summer, I had the opportunity to speak at the Lake County Korean War Meeting in Leesburg. While there, I passed out our
Constituent Services Guide , and shared the services that my local office provides. Following that meeting, Suzette Chandler-Vienna contacted my office regarding her husband, Charles Vienna, who was an Army Sergeant from the Second Infantry Division during the Korean War.
Ms. Vienna relayed that over 50 years ago, her husband was wounded while serving in the forgotten war in Korea, and still suffers from the effects of the severe back injury he received that had caused him to be airlifted to a Japanese Hospital. She believed that the wounds her husband sustained merited a Purple Heart recognition.
Following correspondence with the Viennas, my office initiated an inquiry with the U.S. Army and monitored the situation as additional information provided by the family was forwarded to the Army to help with their research.
Recently, the Army followed up on the Congressional Inquiry and mailed Sgt. Viennas medals and awards to my office, including: a Purple Heart; National Defense Service Medal; Korean Service Medal with four Bronze Service Stars; Presidential Unit Citation; Combat Infantryman Badge; and United Nations Service Medal.
This week, I was honored to arrange a surprise presentation of these medals to Sgt. Charles Vienna. Brigadier General Timothy Sullivan, also a Lake County Commissioner, was present with me to bestow these awards and honors to Sgt. Vienna in recognition of his sacrificial service to our country in the U.S. Army.

Legislative Update:
While I am overjoyed by the release of Alan Gross last week, the nave and misguided policy changes announced by President Obama will only encourage the resolve of other ruthless dictators like the Castro brothers. The Castro Regime remains a flagrant violator of human rights. Any attempt to normalize relations, before Cuba's total disregard of liberty is ended, is just appeasement at the expense of the oppressed.
