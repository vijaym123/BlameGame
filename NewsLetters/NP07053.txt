Friend,
Last night, I found out that
Karl Rove&#39;s shady Super PAC--
Crossroads GPS -- is spending $900,000 in TV ads in our district in the NEXT TWO WEEKS.
This is exactly what they did for Dan Lungren in 2010 - they came in with a huge ad buy, right when we were closing the gap.
Now, they&#39;re coming in early to bail out Doug Ose, because they know that he can&#39;t match the strength of our grassroots team on his own.
The fact that they&#39;re starting to run ads BEFORE LABOR DAY is absolutely unheard of. If you&#39;ve been waiting to give, this is the time-
I need you now.
We didn&#39;t expect them to run their ads this early, and it&#39;s critical we fight back.
Click here to pitch in $5, $25, or whatever you can to our Rapid Response Fund.
Crossroads GPS is slinging mud in five House races, but
their largest ad buy is right here in Sacramento . Out of everyone in the country, they&#39;ve decided that beating me is their top priority - even 11 weeks out from Election Day.
Let me put it bluntly - s tarting next week, Karl Rove will be running attack ads against me throughout our district.
We&#39;ve filmed our first ad, but it&#39;s not quite ready to go up on TV.
With your help, we can get it out in our district - but it&#39;s going to take everyone pitching in what they can over the next two weeks.
This is urgent.
Karl Rove beat us once.
We won&#39;t let him beat us again.
Click here and help me fight back.
Thanks for all you do.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
There&#39;s no time to lose - they&#39;re spending almost $900,000 in the next two weeks alone.
Imagine what&#39;s coming in September.
They&#39;re hoping for a repeat of 2010, when they were able to drown out our message - chip in $5, $25, or even more right now to help us respond.
