Indigenous representation, fees to CNMI treasury highlight fishing bill - Wednesday, I introduced legislation fine-tuning fisheries policies nationwide. The Fishing Economy Improvement Act, H.R. 1826 , also gives indigenous people a greater role in fisheries management at both the national and international level and sends certain fishing fees directly to the Commonwealth treasury without any strings attached. I drafted the bill after listening to hours of testimony during the last Congress on reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act , our long-standing national policy. Magnuson is making Americas fishing industry and the fish stocks the industry depends on more sustainable, but could be improvedand there are areas of bipartisan agreement on how to do that. My bill focuses on those areas of agreement, such as replacing human observers on some commercial fishing boats with electronic monitoring and giving the public access to the inner workings of WestPac and other regional councils managing fishing. H.R. 1826
requires that traditional Pacific island fishing interests have a seat on WestPac and on the international Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission . And certain fishing fees would go to the Northern Marianas, Guam, and American Samoarather than WestPacfor the local governments to use as they decide.

Banking bill passes, ensuring deposits quickly available - When people in the Northern Marianas deposit a check, they should have access to their money as quickly as Americans in Hawaii, Alaska and other U.S. areas outside the 48 contiguous states. That is why I supported the Expedited Funds Availability Act in the last Congress and supported its passage by the House
again this week. The legislation was introduced by Congressman Eni Faleomavaega (D-American Samoa) in 2013 and by his successor Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R), as H.R. 1367 , last month. Lengthy waits for deposits to clear are more of a problem in American Samoa. Banks in the Northern Marianas tell me that with todays electronic transactions they have no problem meeting the national standards for making funds quickly available; and I have only heard once from a constituent with a complaintbut once is too much. It is time for U.S. law to reflect this 21st century reality and give the people of the Northern Mariana Islands the same protection as Americans elsewhere in our nation.

Northern Mariana Islanders now eligible for National Park Service contest - When the National Park Service announced the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Americas National Parks earlier this month it included a contest for all Americans to share their Park experiences and memoriesbut the people of the Northern Marianas, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not eligible to participate. We immediately contacted the Park Service to fix the problem. It took some time, but people in our island communities, all of which have national park areas, can now submit stories
of strolling the pathway through American Memorial Park, contemplating the names of relatives carved in the memorial, or imagining the sounds of battle during World War II. You can also tell a story about your experience at one of Americas other national parks. There are more than 400 stunning landscapes, iconic battlefields, and other historic sites that belong to all Americans and are part of our National Park System. Public voting on the entries begins October 5. The Centenary is fitting time to raise public awareness about the value of our parks. The Park Service also has plans such as growing the 21st Century Conservation Corps that puts youths to work in our parksthat will inspire the next generation of park stewards, so our National Parks endure for another 100 years.

This was my first week back at the office after surgery and I am very happy to be working again. The recovery has gone well in large part, I believe, because of the encouraging words and prayers so many of you sent my way. My heart is filled with gratitude for your support. In addition to the fishing bill I introduced and the banking bill we got through the House this week, I also took the Ranking Member seat for a hearing on Native American issues (above, with Chairman Don Young of Alaska). The weeks ahead will be equally busy but I am ready to tackle them. I also look forward to coming home to the Northern Mariana Islands in May and having the opportunity to thank everyone I can for your patience and understanding while I took care of my health.
$26,860 more for Section 402 State and Community Highway Safety Grants - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced this week an award of $26,860 to the Commonwealths Department of Public Safety. Congress provides the funds to help local jurisdictions reduce traffic crashes, deaths, injuries, and property damage. Congratulations to DPS.
