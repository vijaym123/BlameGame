What did you think about the President's State of the Union address?
It was inspiring, and he laid out a clear vision of where we are and
where we have to go
The speech was good, but I did not hear everything that I was hoping to

>From the Orange County Vietnamese American community in Little Saigon
to Cambodia Town in Long Beach and the Korean Business District in
Garden Grove, I am proud to join with thousands of constituents across
California's 47th Congressional district this year in celebrating the
Lunar New Year with festivals, parades, and family gatherings. During
this time of festivity, let us honor and celebrate our families and
communities as we look forward to a new year, filled with good health
and good fortune.
I hope the Lunar New Year serves a reminder of the important work that
we must carry on in Congress on issues important to the Asian American
community from human rights to immigration reform, to expanding access
to health care.
Last Saturday, the LGBTQ Center of Long Beach presented its annual
State of The Center Program. The event provided the community an
opportunity to learn more about The Center's successes in 2013 and a
look ahead to 2014.
(Speaking at the LGBTQ Center of Long Beach's State of The Center)
During this work period I also reviewed requests for Congressional
nominations from 23 outstanding Service Academy applicants from the
47th District. Each year, congressional offices across the nation
nominate Americans to the nation's Service Academies. Acceptance at an
Academy involves at least a five year obligation to the Service after
four years at the Academy. Appointments in the 47th District are very
competitive, and the members of my Service Academy Nomination Panel -
composed of military veterans and academy graduates - worked on the
interview process.
I am pleased to announce that 23 Service Academy nominees from the 47th
District have been submitted to the Academies. The final decision will
be made by the U.S. Military, Naval, Air Force, Merchant Marine, and
Coast Guard Academies as they consider each of
these talented and
dedicated individuals from the 47th District for admission.
The Academies base acceptance on many factors, including: the
applicant's grade point average and class rank; extra-curricular
activities; SAT scores; motivation; and interview with my Service
Academy Nomination Panel. I wish each of these 23 applicants the best
of luck!
This week I introduced, along with original cosponors Rep. Mike
Thompson (Napa, CA) and Rep. Elizabeth Esty (Newtown, CT), legislation
that I sincerely hope will refocus attention on the issue of gun
violence.
Study after study, report after report, and tragedy after tragedy bear
witness to the prevalence of gun violence. It is, quite simply, a
public health epidemic. Even more heartbreaking than the devastation
gun violence has brought to families across our nation, is the sad fact
that Congress has failed-so often and so completely-to do anything
meaningful about it.
Of the dozens of bills introduced this year that aimed to reduce the
prevalence of this epidemic, none of them have been brought to the
House Floor for a vote. Our Resolution supports multiple components of
these bills, and it instills a sense of urgency for Congress to act
this year.
Since I believe that gun violence is a public health issue, I will
continue pushing for responsible reform that enhances the safety of our
communities.
On Wednesday, the Huffington Post wrote an article about this
Resolution. To read the article, visit:

I was very disappointed that the House Republicans voted on H.R. 7,
legislation which chips away at the fundamental right of women to make
their own medical decisions. I voted "no" on H.R. 7.
You can see my speech on H.R. 7 by clicking here.
After voting on H.R. 7, I attended the State of the Union address. Each
Member of Congress invites one guest to the Capitol to hear the
President speak on the current state of our nation and his plans for
the coming year. This year, in order to raise awareness about the
damaging effects of Congress' inability to renew unemployment benefits
for more than1.6 million Americans in need, I invited a long-term
unemployed constituent named Alexandria with me to the State of the
Union address.
She is a civil engineer who earned Bachelor of Science degrees in Civil
Engineering and Ocean Engineering and has spent her two-decade career
building water treatment and waste water plants. She was laid off in
2010 after eight years with her employer and has been unemployed since
that time. I am grateful that she was willing to join me in Washington
to share her story about the challenges she has faced due to being
unemployed. I hope it helps to eliminate the myth that "unemployed"
people are different that you or I.
(At a press conference with Alexandria before the State of the Union
address)
I finished this week's votes by voting "no" on the Farm Bill, which
provides funding for our nation's agricultural sector but contains deep
cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). While I
supported many parts of the bill, cutting SNAP benefits was
unacceptable. I am saddened to think of the millions of Americans
struggling each day to get enough to eat, especially children who are
not receiving proper nutrition. While it is important for us to pass a
Farm Bill, it must include sufficient SNAP funding to help families in
need. The bill passed the House by a vote of 251-166.
State of the Union
The State of the Union is an annual address by the President of the
United States to both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The
annual address, which was President Obama's fifth State of the Union
address, reports on the condition of the nation and allows him to
outline his priorities for the next year.
The State of the Union is actually constitutionally mandated under
Article II, Section 3:
"[The President] shall from time to time give to the Congress
Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
Consideration such Measures as [the President] shall judge necessary
and expedient."
Several interesting facts:
Starting with Thomas Jefferson and until the administration of
Woodrow Wilson, almost all Presidents communicated the State of the
Union to Congress in writing.
Prior to FDR first officially calling it the "State of the Union"
address, the written or verbal address was generally known as "the
President's Annual Message to Congress."
In political circles and the political media, the address is often
called the 'SOTU,' which is pronounced 'sew-too.'
How should Congress tackle the issue of reforming the NSA's
surveillance and data collection program?
52.3%
Deliberate the President's reforms, and pass bipartisan
legislation that sensibly reforms the NSA and protects the privacy of
every American

I'm not troubled by the NSA's collection of data if it helps
keep our country safe

Last
Saturday,
the

presented
its

I
was
very

that
the
House
Republicans
voted
on
H.R.

chips

the

.
After
voting
on
H.R.
7,
I
attended
the
State
of
the
Union
address.
Each
Member
of
Congress
invites
one
guest
to
the
Capitol
to
hear
the
President
speak
on
the
current
state
of
our
nation
and
his
plans
for
the
coming
year.
This
year,
in
order
to
raise
awareness
about
the
damaging
effects
of
Congress&#8217;
inability
to
renew
unemployment
benefits
for
more
than1.6
million
Americans
in
need,
I invited
a
long-term
unemployed
constituent
named
Alexandria
with
me
to
the
State
of
the
Union
address.
She is
a
civil
engineer
who
earned
Bachelor
of
Science
degrees
in
Civil
Engineering
and
Ocean
Engineering
and
has
spent
her
two-decade
career
building
water
treatment
and
waste
water
plants.
She
was
laid
off
in
2010
after
eight
years
with her
employer and
has
been
unemployed
since
that
time.
I
am
grateful
that
she
was
willing
to
join
me
in
Washington
to
share
her
story
about
the
challenges
she
has
faced
due
to
being
unemployed.
I
hope
it
helps
to
eliminate
the
myth
that
"unemployed"
people
are
different
that
you
or
I.
(At
a
press
conference
with
Alexandria
before
the
State
of
the
Union
address)
I
finished
this
week&#8217;s
votes
by
voting
&#8220;no&#8221;
on
the
Farm
Bill,
which
provides
funding
for
our
nation&#8217;s
agricultural
sector
but
contains
deep
cuts
to
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(SNAP).
While
I
supported
many
parts
of
the
bill,
cutting
SNAP
benefits
was
unacceptable.
I
am
saddened
to
think of
the
millions
of
Americans
struggling
each
day
to
get
enough
to
eat,
especially
children
who
are
not
receiving
proper
nutrition.
While
it
is
important
for
us
to
pass
a
Farm
Bill,
it
must
include
sufficient
SNAP
funding
to
help
families
in
need.
The
bill
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
251-166.
State
of
the
Union
The
State
of
the
Union
is
an
annual
address
by
the
President
of
the
United
States
to
both
the
Senate
and
the
House
of
Representatives.
The
annual
address,
which
was
President
Obama&#8217;s
fifth
State
of
the
Union
address,
reports
on
the
condition
of
the
nation
and
allows
him
to
outline
his
priorities
for
the
next
year.
The
State
of
the
Union
is
actually
constitutionally
mandated
under
Article
II,
Section
3:
&#8220;[The

Several

&#8226;
Starting

almost
