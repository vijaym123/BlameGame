David Johnson
President Obama asked for your help today. The Republicans are going all-in on smearing President Obama to win this election.
Can you chip in $5 or more today to fight back?
It's over. It's done.
We have no ideas left.
The Republicans are spending $2O,OOO,OOO filling our TV screens with lying, Obama-bashing ads -- but we don&rsquo;t have enough cash to fight back anymore.
Two different polls show the race for Congress is a DEAD HEAT -- but we&rsquo;re still falling short.
We even had President Barack Obama email you this morning -- but we&rsquo;re still falling short.
David -- we don&rsquo;t want to miss out on this opportunity to finally defeat the Republicans. So we're putting all of our hopes in you answering President Obama's call-to-action today.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
Seriously, we're at the end of our rope here. You're our only hope.
