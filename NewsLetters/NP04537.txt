Day message.
Our nation's veterans
deserve our greatest debt of gratitude, and we can never stop finding ways
to improve the quality of life for our troops - and their families -
who are deployed here and around the world.
Happy Veterans Day
- and thank you for all that you do to keep America
safe.
I hope you'll join me in honoring our veterans online. As
always, I invite you to follow and share your thoughts with me on
Facebook , on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
