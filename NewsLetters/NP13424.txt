Friend,
Over the past year I've sent you 23 updates about what I've been up to
as your Representative. Since this e-newsletter will be the last of
2013, it's going to be a little different.
I think one of the biggest problems in Washington, DC today is that
some legislators aren't listening enough to their constituents, so I've
held 10 public town halls, four telephone town halls, and I've met
folks from our neck of the woods at over 60 festivals, county fairs,
and annual community events.
For those who haven't had a chance to be a part of that give-and-take,
let me do a rundown of the answers to some of the most common questions
I received during this first year in Congress.
So, with apologies to
David Letterman, I give you...
THE TOP TEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS I GOT THIS YEAR
10.) "Is it as bad as it looks?"
This is the question I get asked more than any other. I will tell you
that it's strange to join an organization that - according to recent
polls - is held in lower regard than head lice and colonoscopies.
After nearly a year on the job, I can affirm that Congress continues to
be a "fixer-upper." But I'm here because I hope to make it better.
While much of the past year has been focused on partisan games, I'm
hopeful that the recent budget deal is a sign that 2014 may bring more
folks from both sides of the aisle together to find solutions to our
nation's problems.
If we're going to get our economy - and this
Congress - back on track, we've got to stop seeing folks define success
as making the other political party look stupid.
9) "Yikes! That sounds frustrating. Is there any hope?"
Despite the dysfunction, there's cause for hope.
Here's why: there's a growing group of folks from both parties that are
committed to righting the ship.
Twice a month I participate in a meeting of the Bipartisan Working
Group. It's a group of Democrats and Republicans who are committed to
working to get past the toxicity in our dialogue and find ways to work
together. While the challenges facing our nation are too big to be
fixed overnight, every time I walk out of those Wednesday morning
meetings (and the meetings of the Problem Solvers Caucus that I've also
become a part of), I feel confident and hopeful that we can get things
back on track.
8) Speaking of working together. . . Does the Washington delegation
work together much?
I've learned to watch my step around some members of the Washington
delegation. Literally. Early on here, I accidently stepped on
Representative Rick Larsen's shoe and I broke it. As he hobbled around
on a broken shoe for the rest of the day, I lived with the shame of
having "flat-tired" one of my colleagues.
Seriously, though, we actually do interact quite frequently and quite
positively. For example, Rep. Larsen and Rep. Adam Smith and I are all
on the House Armed Services Committee together. Having three
representatives from Washington on the committee is helpful as we work
together to support our service members and ensure Washington State's
interests are protected.
What's more, the House members from our state - Democrats and
Republicans - get together for a periodic breakfast to catch up, to
discuss issues facing our state, and to figure out how we can work
together on some shared priorities. For instance, we've now had a
majority of the state's representatives become a part of the new Puget
Sound Recovery Caucus I am co-chairing. We're working together to
ensure that the sales tax deduction that benefits Washington State
citizens becomes a part of any tax reform proposal.
And if that's not enough, for the nights when I'm in D.C., I actually
share an apartment with our neighboring congressman (and my co-chair of
the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus), Rep. Denny Heck. People are convinced
that we should write a sitcom. For the record, I'm the "neat one."
7) How's the travel?
Not bad. Having met my wife Jennifer on an airplane back in 1996, I
built up more positive airline karma than I ever deserved.
Listen, I knew when I signed up for this job that I was also signing up
for a 3,000 mile commute to work. And, admittedly, I've learned the
exact number of pretzels to expect in an Alaska Airlines pretzel
package.
That said, I'm psyched to make it home nearly every weekend because it's
important I see and interact with my constituents as much as possible
(not to mention my own family). Sure, that means a lot of time on a
plane. But, on the bright side, I get 11 hours a week of
mostly-uninterrupted work time. I get a lot of time to read policy
briefings and to respond to letters from constituents. So if there's
something you think I should take a look at, email me!
6) So, did you get Norm Dicks' office and committee assignments?
In short, no.
As you can imagine, I was somewhat bummed to find out that I wasn't
going to be the Ranking Member on the Appropriations Committee like my
predecessor. (I did, however, get two great committees: Armed Services
and Science, Space, and Technology).
Office designations, too, are based on seniority and then on a random
drawing. Let's just say that I had about as much success in the office
lottery as I had in the recent Mega Millions drawing. Of the 435
members of Congress, I drew the 429thoffice choice.
That said, I have no complaints about my office. Not only did it come
with a few tiny, furry "friends" (which has made the book House Mouse,
Senate Mouse even more entertaining for my kids), we found out from the
Library of Congress that it was the freshman office of Washington State
legend Henry M. Jackson when he served in the House. Come visit us!
5) Any big surprises?
A few.
Prior to my tenure, Congress passed the Budget Control Act which
included sequestration as a poison pill. It was meant to be so stupid
that it would force Democrats and Republicans in the House and the
Senate to work together to deal with our nation's long-term fiscal
health. Unfortunately, to my surprise, for most of the last year,
Congress chose to swallow the poison pill.
Thankfully, the end of 2013 saw the passage of a budget that, while not
perfect, will set aside the bulk of sequestration for the next two
years and ensure we won't have another devastating shutdown. Not only
is that good news, it was a welcome surprise after a year of
partisanship to see our parties work together to make some progress on
the budget.
I was also surprised by the scrum for seats at the State of the Union.
Some of my colleagues REALLY wanted to have a seat on the aisle so they
could be on TV shaking the president's hand. I haven't seen that much
demand for seats since the last time Taylor Swift visited the Tacoma
Dome. I had a feeling it was trouble when I walked in.
4) So, what's on Congress's list of New Year's Resolutions?
For me, that's simple: I need to eat healthier, exercise more, and
teach my dog Truman not to eat the furniture.
For Congress, the top of the list is fighting to extend unemployment
benefits early in the New Year. A recent report by Washington State's
Employment Security Department found that 24,400 residents of our state
lost their benefits on December 28 due to the failure of Congress to
act. Another 37,600 Washingtonians stand to lose coverage over the
course of the next six months. The impact of letting unemployment
insurance benefits lapse will also prove to be yet another headwind to
our economic recovery. In fact, the White House Council on Economic
Advisers estimates that the failure to extend unemployment insurance
benefits will cost the state of Washington 6,183 jobs.
In addition, there are some big challenges that deserve attention: a
comprehensive immigration reform bill, improvements to the Affordable
Care Act, comprehensive tax reform to help Main Street businesses and
middle class families, actions to address climate change, and campaign
finance reform.
And most importantly, Congress should resolve in 2014 to get focused on
the economy. Not a single JOBS bill passed this year. I hope that
changes in 2014. In fact, I'm working with a group of colleagues on the
reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act. Stay tuned for details as
we work to get it passed.
3) What do I do if I'm not getting the help I need from a federal
agency?
On my district team, we've got some wonderfully talented caseworkers
who work every day to solve problems for the people we represent and
make sure government works for you. This year alone, we've helped over
500 people resolve issues with government agencies and we've helped
return over $600,000 in savings for constituents from agencies like
Medicare, the VA, or the IRS. If you have an issue or know someone who
does, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
2) So, are we making progress?
Despite the dysfunction in our nation's capital, there were some policy
successes. We saw the bipartisan passage of the Violence Against Women
Act. Just prior to the holidays, we saw Congress pass a budget for the
first time since 2009.
My focus - on the policy front and in the district - is on economic
development. I spent the past decade working in economic development,
and I feel strongly that a lot of the challenges facing our nation will
get a lot better when people get back to work. That's why I've proposed
or cosponsored bills to help small businesses, to improve workforce
development, and to improve our business climate. It's why we fought
(successfully!) to protect the Small Business Development Centers in
our region and are actively working to responsibly increase harvest
levels in the federal forests, to protect jobs at our military
installations, and to give downtown revitalization a shot in the arm.
I'm very hopeful that 2014 will see a greater focus by the Congress on
helping our small businesses.
That's also why I do "Kilmer at Your Company" events.
As we end the
year, I've visited with nearly five dozen companies in our district.
I've had the opportunity to help construct a door at the Simpson
facility in McCleary. I've visited hospitals, toured emergency rooms,
or stopped by dialysis centers in every county in the district (and
used a lot of hand sanitizer). I've slipped on some hip-waders and
gotten into a cranberry bog. I've visited IT companies, manufacturers,
and local small businesses. In each meeting, I try to get a sense of
the good, the bad, and the ugly of how our employers are interacting
with the federal government. I want to make sure that we're doing all
we can to see employers grow, succeed, and stay here in our region.
While there's obviously much more to do, I'm proud that my team has
accomplished a lot for folks in our region for the past year. Take a
look at this "Year End Report"
we put out
that shows some of our efforts and accomplishments.
1.) So, overall, how's it been?
When I first decided to run for federal office, the most common
question I received was: "Why on earth would you want to serve in
Congress when it's such a mess and you have two little kids?" My answer
remains the same now as it was then. "It's because it's a mess and I
have two little kids." Their ability to grow up in an America where
there is growing educational and economic opportunity, where our nation
is secure, and where there is clean air and water is important to me.
But getting there requires Congress to get to work.
Being your Representative is an honor and a privilege and not a day
goes by that I'm not grateful for the opportunity. I'm heading into
2014 highly motivated to get things back on track.
Let me just end by saying I'm grateful to each of you for continuing to
read these updates, and for continuing to provide me with your thoughts
and advice. I wish you a happy new year, and I look forward to hearing
from you in the coming year.
Sincerely,
Derek

30,
2013 Friend,
Over
the
past
year
I&#8217;ve
sent
you
23
updates
about
what
I&#8217;ve
been
up
to
as
your
Representative.
Since
this
e-newsletter
will
be
the
last
of
2013,
it&#8217;s
going
to
be
a
little
different.
I
think
one
of
the
biggest
problems
in
Washington,
DC
today
is
that
some
legislators
aren't
listening
enough
to
their
constituents,
so
I&#8217;ve
held
10
public
town
halls,
four
telephone
town
halls,
and
I&#8217;ve
met
folks
from
our
neck
of
the
woods
at
over
60
festivals,
county
fairs,
and
annual
community
events.
For
those
who
haven&#8217;t
had
a
chance
to
be
a
part
of
that
give-and-take,
let
me
do
a
rundown
of
the
answers
to
some
of
the
most
common
questions
I
received
during
this
first
year
in
Congress.
So,
with
apologies
to
David
Letterman,
I
give
you...
THE
TOP
TEN
ANSWERS
TO
QUESTIONS
I
GOT
THIS
YEAR
10.)
&#8220;Is
it
as
bad
as
it
looks?&#8221;
This
is
the
question
I
get
asked
more
than
any
other. I
will
tell
you
that
it&#8217;s
strange
to
join
an
organization
that
&#8211;
according
to
recent
polls
&#8211;
is
held
in
lower
regard
than
head
lice
and
colonoscopies.
After
nearly
a
year
on
the
job,
I
can
affirm
that
Congress
continues
to
be
a
&#8220;fixer-upper.&#8221;
But
I&#8217;m
here
because
I
hope
to
make
it
better.
While
much
of
the
past
year
has
been
focused
on
partisan
games,
I&#8217;m
hopeful
that
the
recent
budget
deal
is
a
sign
that
2014
may
bring
more
folks
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
together
to
find
solutions
to
our
nation&#8217;s
problems.
If
we&#8217;re
going
to
get
our
economy
&#8211;
and
this
Congress
&#8211;
back
on
track,
we&#8217;ve
got
to
stop
seeing
folks
define
success
as
making
the
other
political
party
look
stupid.
9) &#8220;Yikes! That
sounds
frustrating. Is
there
any
hope?&#8221;
Despite
the
dysfunction,
there&#8217;s
cause
for
hope.
Here&#8217;s
why: there&#8217;s
a
growing
group
of
folks
from
both
parties
that
are
committed
to
righting
the
ship.
Twice
a
month I
participate
in
a
meeting
of
the
Bipartisan
Working
Group. It&#8217;s
a
group
of
Democrats
and
Republicans
who
are
committed
to
working
to
get
past
the
toxicity
in
our
dialogue
and
find
ways
to
work
together. While
the
challenges
facing
our
nation
are
too
big
to
be fixed
overnight,
every
time
I
walk
out
of
those
Wednesday
morning
meetings
(and
the
meetings
of
the
Problem
Solvers
Caucus
that
I&#8217;ve
also
become
a
part
of),
I
feel
confident
and
hopeful
that
we
can
get
things
back
on
track.
8) Speaking
of
working
together.
Does
the
Washington
delegation
work
together
much?
I&#8217;ve
learned
to
watch
my
step
around
some
members
of
the
Washington
delegation.
Literally.
Early
on
here,
I
accidently
stepped
on
Representative
Rick
Larsen&#8217;s
shoe
and
I
broke
it.
As
he
hobbled
around
on
a
broken
shoe
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
I
lived
with
the
shame
of
having
&#8220;flat-tired&#8221;
one
of
my
colleagues.
Seriously,
though,
we
actually
do
interact
quite
frequently
and
quite
positively. For
example,
Rep.
Larsen
and
Rep.
Adam
Smith
and
I
are
all
on
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
together. Having
three
representatives
from
Washington
on
the
committee
is
helpful
as
we
work
together
to
support
our
service
members
and
ensure
Washington
State&#8217;s
interests
are
protected.
What&#8217;s
more,
the
House
members
from
our
state
&#8211;
Democrats
and
Republicans
&#8211;
get
together
for
a
periodic
breakfast
to
catch
up,
to
discuss
issues
facing
our
state,
and
to
figure
out
how
we
can
work
together
on
some
shared
priorities. For
instance,
we&#8217;ve
now
had
a
majority
of
the
state&#8217;s
representatives
become
a
part
of
the
new
Puget
Sound
Recovery
Caucus
I
am
co-chairing. We&#8217;re
working
together
to
ensure
that
the
sales
tax
deduction
that
benefits
Washington
State
citizens
becomes
a
part
of
any
tax
reform
proposal.
And
if
that&#8217;s
not
enough,
for
the
nights
when
I&#8217;m
in
D.C.,
I
actually
share
an
apartment
with
our
neighboring
congressman
(and
my
co-chair
of
the
Puget
Sound
Recovery
Caucus),
Rep.
Denny
Heck. People
are
convinced
that
we
should
write
a
sitcom. For
the
record,
I&#8217;m
the
&#8220;neat
one.&#8221;
7) How&#8217;s
the
travel?
Not
bad. Having
met
my
wife
Jennifer
on
an
airplane
back
in
1996,
I
built
up
more
positive
airline
karma
than
I
ever
deserved.
Listen,
I
knew
when
I
signed
up
for
this
job
that
I
was
also
signing
up
for
a
3,000
mile
commute
to
work.
And,
admittedly,
I&#8217;ve
learned
the
exact
number
of
pretzels
to
expect
in
an
Alaska
Airlines
pretzel
package.
That
said,
I&#8217;m
psyched
to
make
it
home
nearly
every
weekend
because
it&#8217;s
important
I
see
and
interact
with
my
constituents
as
much
as
possible
(not
to
mention
my
own
family).
Sure,
that
means
a
lot
of
time
on
a
plane. But,
on
the
bright
side,
I
get
11
hours
a
week
of
mostly-uninterrupted
work
time. I
get
a
lot
of
time
to
read
policy
briefings
and
to
respond
to
letters
from
constituents. So
if
there&#8217;s
something
you
think
I
should
take
a
look
at,
email
me!
6) So,
did
you
get
Norm
Dicks&#8217;
office
and
committee
assignments?
In
short,
no.
As
you
can
imagine,
I
was
somewhat
bummed
to
find
out
that
I
wasn&#8217;t
going
to
be
the
Ranking
Member
on
the
Appropriations
Committee
like
my
predecessor. (I
did,
however,
get
two
great
committees: Armed
Services
and
Science,
Space,
and
Technology).
Office
designations,
too,
are
based
on
seniority
and
then
on
a
random
drawing. Let&#8217;s
just
say
that
I
had
about
as
much
success
in
the
office
lottery
as
I
had
in
the
recent
Mega
Millions
drawing. Of
the
435
members
of
Congress,
I
drew the
429 th office
choice.
That
said,
I
have
no
complaints
about
my
office. Not
only
did
it
come
with
a
few
tiny,
furry
&#8220;friends&#8221;
(which
has
made
the
book
House
Mouse,
Senate
Mouse
even
more
entertaining
for
my
kids),
we
found
out
from
the
Library
of
Congress
that
it
was
the
freshman
office
of
Washington
State
legend
Henry
M.
Jackson
when
he
served
in
the
House. Come
visit
us!
5) Any
big
surprises?
A
few.
Prior
to
my
tenure,
Congress
passed
the
Budget
Control
Act
which
included
sequestration
as
a
poison
pill. It
was
meant
to
be
so
stupid
that
it
would
force
Democrats
and
Republicans
in
the
House
and
the
Senate
to
work
together
to
deal
with
our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
fiscal
health. Unfortunately,
to
my
surprise,
for
most
of
the
last
year,
Congress
chose
to
swallow
the
poison
pill.
Thankfully,
the
end
of
2013
saw
the
passage
of
a
budget
that,
while
not
perfect,
will
set
aside
the
bulk
of
sequestration
for
the
next
two
years
and
ensure
we
won&#8217;t
have
another
devastating
shutdown. Not
only
is
that
good
news,
it
was
a
welcome
surprise
after
a
year
of
partisanship
to
see
our
parties
work
together
to
make
some
progress
on
the
budget.
I
was
also
surprised
by
the
scrum
for
seats
at
the
State
of
the
Union. Some
of
my
colleagues
REALLY
wanted
to
have
a
seat
on
the
aisle
so
they
could
be
on
TV
shaking
the
president&#8217;s
hand. I
haven&#8217;t
seen
that
much
demand
for
seats
since
the
last
time
Taylor
Swift
visited
the
Tacoma
Dome. I
had
a
feeling
it
was
trouble
when
I
walked
in.
4) So,
what&#8217;s
on
Congress&#8217;s
list
of
New
Year&#8217;s
Resolutions?
For
me,
that&#8217;s
simple: I
need
to
eat
healthier,
exercise
more,
and
teach
my
dog
Truman
not
to
eat
the
furniture.
For
Congress,
the
top
of
the
list
is
fighting
to
extend
unemployment
benefits
early
in
the
New
Year. A
recent
report
by
Washington
State&#8217;s
Employment
Security
Department
found
that
24,400
residents
of
our
state
lost
their
benefits
on
December
28
due
to
the
failure
of
Congress
to
act. Another
37,600
Washingtonians
stand
to
lose
coverage
over
the
course
of
the
next
six
months.
The
impact
of
letting
unemployment
insurance
benefits
lapse
will
also
prove
to
be
yet
another
headwind
to
our
economic
recovery.
In
fact,
the
White
House
Council
on
Economic
Advisers
estimates
that
the
failure
to
extend
unemployment
insurance
benefits
will
cost
the
state
of
Washington
6,183
jobs.
In
addition,
there
are
some
big
challenges
that
deserve
attention: a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill,
improvements
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
comprehensive
tax
reform
to
help
Main
Street
businesses
and
middle
class
families,
actions
to
address
climate
change,
and
campaign
finance
reform.
And
most
importantly,
Congress
should
resolve
in
2014
to
get
focused
on
the
economy. Not
a
single
JOBS
bill
passed
this
year. I
hope
that
changes
in
2014. In
fact,
I&#8217;m
working
with
a
group
of
colleagues
on
the
reauthorization
of
the
America
COMPETES
Act. Stay
tuned
for
details
as
we
work
to
get
it
passed.
3) What
do
I
do
if
I&#8217;m
not
getting
the
help
I
need
from
a
federal
agency?
On
my
district
team,
we&#8217;ve
got
some
wonderfully
talented
caseworkers
who
work
every
day
to
solve
problems
for
the
people
we
represent
and
make
sure
government
works
for
you. This
year
alone,
we&#8217;ve
helped
over
500
people
resolve
issues
with
government
agencies
and
we&#8217;ve
helped
return
over
$600,000
in
savings
for
constituents
from
agencies
like
Medicare,
the
VA,
or
the
IRS.
If
you
have
an
issue
or
know
someone
who
does,
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out
to
us.
2)
So,
are
we
making
progress?
Despite
the
dysfunction
in
our
nation&#8217;s
capital,
there
were
some
policy
successes. We
saw
the
bipartisan
passage
of
the
Violence
Against
Women
Act. Just
prior
to
the
holidays,
we
saw
Congress
pass
a
budget
for
the
first
time
since
2009.
My
focus -
on
the
policy
front
and
in
the
district -
is
on
economic
development. I
spent
the
past
decade
working
in
economic
development,
and
I
feel
strongly
that
a
lot
of
the
challenges
facing
our
nation
will
get
a
lot
better
when
people
get
back
to
work. That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
proposed
or
cosponsored
bills
to
help
small
businesses,
to
improve
workforce
development,
and
to
improve
our
business
climate. It&#8217;s
why
we
fought
(successfully!) to
protect
the
Small
Business
Development
Centers
in
our
region
and
are
actively
working
to
responsibly
increase
harvest
levels
in
the
federal
forests,
to
protect
jobs
at
our
military
installations,
and
to
give
downtown
revitalization
a
shot
in
the
arm. I&#8217;m
very
hopeful
that
2014
will
see
a
greater
focus
by
the
Congress
on
helping
our
small
businesses.
That&#8217;s
also
why
I
do
&#8220;Kilmer
at
Your
Company&#8221;
events.
As
we
end
the
year,
I&#8217;ve
visited
with
nearly
five
dozen
companies
in
our
district. I&#8217;ve
had
the
opportunity
to
help
construct
a
door
at
the
Simpson
facility
in
McCleary. I&#8217;ve
visited
hospitals,
toured
emergency
rooms,
or
stopped
by
dialysis
centers
in
every
county
in
the
district
(and
used
a
lot
of
hand
sanitizer).
I&#8217;ve
slipped
on
some
hip-waders
and
gotten
into
a
cranberry
bog. I&#8217;ve
visited
IT
companies,
manufacturers,
and
local
small
businesses. In
each
meeting,
I
try
to
get
a
sense
of
the
good,
the
bad,
and
the
ugly
of
how
our
employers
are
interacting
with
the
federal
government. I
want
to
make
sure
that
we&#8217;re
doing
all
we
can
to
see
employers
grow,
succeed,
and
stay
here
in
our
region.
While
there&#8217;s
obviously
much
more
to
do,
I&#8217;m
proud
that
my
team
has
accomplished
a
lot
for
folks
in
our
region
for
the
past
year.
Take
a
look
at
this
&#8220;Year
End
Report&#8221;
we
put
out
that
shows
some
of
our
efforts
and
accomplishments.
1.) So,
overall,
how&#8217;s
it
been?
When
I
first
decided
to
run
for
federal
office,
the
most
common
question
I
received
was:
&#8220;Why
on
earth
would
you
want
to
serve
in
Congress
when
it&#8217;s
such
a
mess
and
you
have
two
little
kids?&#8221; My
answer
remains
the
same
now
as
it
was
then. &#8220;It&#8217;s
because
it&#8217;s
a
mess
and
I
have
two
little
kids.&#8221;
Their
ability
to
grow
up
in
an
America
where
there
is
growing
educational
and
economic
opportunity,
where
our
nation
is
secure,
and
where
there
is
clean
air
and
water
is
important
to
me. But
getting
there
requires
Congress
to
get
to
work.
Being
your
Representative
is
an
honor
and
a
privilege
and
not
a
day
goes
by
that
I&#8217;m
not
grateful
for
the
opportunity. I&#8217;m
heading
into
2014
highly
motivated
to
get
things
back
on
track.
Let
me
just
end
by
saying
I&#8217;m
grateful
to
each
of
you
for
continuing
to
read
these
updates,
and
for
continuing
to
provide
me
with
your
thoughts
and
advice. I
wish
you
a
happy
new
year,
and
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
in
the
coming
year.
Sincerely,
Derek Stay
