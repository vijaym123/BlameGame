November 17 Disaster - Surveying the Damage
On Sunday, many parts of the Midwest were hit with violent storms and
tornadoes.
Hoosiers were not spared from the damage the storms caused.
While the extent of the damage has yet to be fully measured, I am
thankful that Indiana did not report a single loss of life in this
tragedy.

Immediate Assistance
If you or someone you know is still displaced, or still in need of
assistance, one helpful resource available to you would be your county
emergency management agency (EMA).
For a county by county listing of
EMA contacts, click here
.
In addition, there are also local non-profits like the American Red
Cross, United Way, the Salvation Army, faith based groups and community
service organizations who are providing help to Hoosiers impacted by
the storm.
Gov. Pence, Mayor Franklin and Rep. Rokita Survey Damage in Logansport
Assessing Damage
On Tuesday, I joined with Governor Pence, Senator Donnelly, other state
and local officials, and emergency responders to survey the damage.

Frankly, pictures do not do the damage justice, but I was able to take
some photos from the damage on the ground in Boone
, Cass
, Howard
, and
Tippecanoe
Counties
that I wanted to share with you.
While the safety of Hoosiers was the
top priority, you can see by the pictures that the damage to
infrastructure and property is significant.
Our hearts go out to
anyone who has suffered loss of property or disaster through this
disaster.
Mayor Lewis and Rep. Rokita Talk with Volunteers Cleaning Up
Abner-Longley Southside Park in Lebanon
What impressed me most on Tuesday, and has always impressed me, is that
through the visits I made on Tuesday to survey the damage was the
caring and generosity all Hoosiers show each other.
Whether it was the
children that were volunteering to clean up the park in Lebanon Tuesday
afternoon, or the neighbors who were digging in to help begin the long
cleanup and rebuilding process in Lafayette or Kokomo, Hoosiers didn't
wait for someone to come help them.
It has always humbled me and will
continue to inspire me that the people of this great state are so
compassionate towards one another.
My staff and I remain in continual contact with emergency responders
from every impacted county in the Fourth District.
I stand ready to
work with them, as well as state and local officials to secure federal
disaster assistance should it be necessary.
Report Damage
While emergency response and clean up are underway, it is still vitally
important to have a full accounting of the property damage sustained
during these storms, and I encourage everyone affected to report damage
through the Indiana Department of Homeland Security as soon as
reasonably possible. This will help local and state officials as they
determine how to proceed with disaster recovery efforts.
You can
report damage via the IDHS website here
.
I also made remarks on the House floor to recognize the resiliency of
Hoosiers during this trying week.

Creating Jobs Through Domestic Energy Production
This week, the House considered a series of bills designed to create
job growth through increased domestic energy production and streamlines
a burdensome regulatory process that has led to increased energy costs.
Job creation remains a top priority of mine.
These commonsense jobs
bills will lead to thousands of American jobs and reduce the
skyrocketing gas and energy prices that are preventing small businesses
across Indiana and the nation from hiring new employees.
Increasing American energy production is the most critical step
Congress can take to reduce energy prices now and in the future while
creating thousands of new jobs. We must put a stop to the Obama
administration's attack on domestic energy production.
Domestic energy
leads to American jobs.
For more information on the pro-jobs energy bills passed this week,

Act
*	Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act
*	Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act

Helping Our Neighbors - Our Annual Food Drive Continues
Our two district office locations are now accepting nonperishable food
donation items for our annual holiday food drive through Friday,
December 20.
As you'll recall, this is the second year in a row we are collecting
food for local food pantries.
Earlier this year, during the August
town hall events, we also collected food items.
Year-to-date, you have
helped our offices collect 500 pounds of food.
Office hours are open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday.
Addresses for my Danville and Lafayette offices are below.

ObamaCare Insurance Cancellations Continue to Hit Mailboxes
It has been widely reported that millions of Americans are being sent
cancellation notices of their insurance policies
due to forced changes
under ObamaCare.
These cancellations come despite the promise made by
the President, time and again, that, "if you like your health insurance
plan, you can keep your plan."
If you or someone you know has had a
similar experience, please send me your insurance cancellation notices
at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.

What

on

and
has
always

me,
is
that
through

I
made
on

from
every
impacted
county
in
the
Fourth

I
stand

as
well
as

disaster
assistance
should
it
be

While

it
is
still
vitally
important
to
have
a
full

damage

and
I
encourage
everyone
affected
to
report
damage
through
the
Indiana
Department
of
Homeland
Security
as
soon
as
reasonably
possible.
This
will
help
local

Creating
Jobs
Through
Domestic

This

the
House
considered
a
series
of
bills
designed
to
create
job
growth
through
increased
domestic
energy
production
and
streamlines
a
burdensome
regulatory
process
that
has
led
to
increased
energy
costs.
Job
creation
remains
a
top
priority
of
mine.
These
commonsense
jobs
bills
will
lead
to
thousands
of
American
jobs
and
reduce
the
skyrocketing
gas
and
energy
prices
that
are
preventing
small
businesses
across
Indiana
and
the
nation
from
hiring
new
employees.
Increasing
American
energy
production
is
the
most
critical
step
Congress
can
take
to
reduce
energy
prices
now
and
in
the
future
while
creating
thousands
of
new
jobs.
We
must
put
a
stop
to
the
Obama
administration&#8217;s
attack
on
domestic
energy
production.
Domestic
energy
leads
to
American
jobs.
