You Tell Me
Friends,
Have you read about my work to keep
flood insurance
affordable and available to those who need it? Were you aware that a recent budget agreement significantly cut spending for the fourth year in a row?
Did you know that the Congressional Budget Office released a report this week showing that
ObamaCare
will shrink the workforce by 2.5 million? How do you feel about streamlining and simplifying the
tax code ?
Each week, I have the opportunity to work on multiple issues on behalf of Mississippi families, and I use this newsletter to keep you informed. But I also want to hear which issues you care most about, so I can better serve you.
I hope you'll share your thoughts with me by taking the survey below. And as always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my
website ,
twitter , and
facebook .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
