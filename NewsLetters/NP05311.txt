URGENT: All Gifts Triple-Matched for the next 3 hours
This is our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
President Obama and Nancy Pelosi wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you if we didn&rsquo;t need your help.
-- Boehner&rsquo;s allies just launched their biggest attack yet -- a whopping $17,OOO,OOO.
-- We were within range of hitting our goal, and fighting Republicans&rsquo; smears.
-- But then the Koch Brothers ambushed us with $1.8 MILLION MORE in attacks.
That was a LOT of bad news for just one day.
But here&rsquo;s the good news: We were able to extend the Triple-Match through today to make up for yesterday&rsquo;s shortfall!
David, the triple-match is only valid for another 3 hours. Control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
