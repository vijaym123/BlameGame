A MESSAGE FROM
CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. dedicated his
life to equality, social justice, economic advancement, and opportunity
for all Americans. In recognition of Dr. Kings incredible legacy of
service to all, Congress designated the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
as a national day of service in 1994. Taking place each year on the
third Monday in January, the MLK Day of Service is the only federal
holiday observed as a national day of service
a day on, not a day off.
There are several
volunteer opportunities in the Fifth District to honor his legacy by serving
our communities. Please click
