Delegates want fair treatment for insular areas under Affordable Care Act
No one in the insular areas gets federal help to pay for health insurance from the Affordable Care Act. Yet insurance providers here still have to pay a fee to the U.S. Treasury to cover the cost of ACA subsidies nationwide. That is unfair. More importantly, it could make health insurance more expensive for all of us, if insurers raise rates to cover the fee. So I joined other insular area Delegates, led by Puerto Ricos Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, asking the Secretaries of the Treasury and of Health and Human Services for relief from the fee.
Of course, my ultimate goal is to get federal subsidies in the Northern Marianas for individuals and families who buy insurance on their own and for employers who buy insurance for their workers. Until then, insurers should not have to pay the fee. Or the U.S. Treasury should return the money to insular governments to offset the cost of insurance, support local hospitals, or otherwise improve health care.

Panel expands diabetes testing guidelines
Following the House Diabetes Caucus letter
I reported on last week, urging broader guidelines for diabetes testing, the United States Preventive Services Task Force has agreed that adults age 45 and older should be routinely screened for type 2 diabetes. In its draft recommendations
the Task Force also suggests routine screening for people who are overweight or who have a family history of diabetes. Broader screening is important because finding the disease early can stop its progress or slow it down. These recommendations are a change from 2008, when the Task Force only recommended screening for adults with high blood pressure. Since the previous recommendation, the Task Force now says, six new lifestyle intervention studies have shown consistent benefit of lifestyle modifications to prevent or delay progression to diabetes. In other words, catching the disease early can save people from this terrible disease. The Task Force is accepting comments to the draft recommendations online
through Nov. 3.

Congressional office to host New Zealand intern
At the invitation of Ambassador Mike Moore, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Director-General of the World Trade Organization, your congressional office will host a New Zealand university student-intern for two months beginning in November. The Congressional Intern Programme was established by the New Zealand Embassy in Washington and by the US
NZ Council in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Christchurch, New Zealand in 2011. Originally, students from Canterbury University, which was badly impacted by the disaster, were brought to Washington to participate in the internships, but the program now includes students from Victoria University in Wellington, too. I narrowly escaped the earthquake myself. I was a member of a congressional delegation, working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade agreement, which departed Christchurch just two hours before the quake. Helping the still ongoing recovery by hosting a student-intern is one way of being a good Pacific neighbor.
