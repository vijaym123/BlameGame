OUR DISTRICT
May 16, 2014
Dear friend,
It's been a busy week in Rhode Island and I wanted to share a few
updates about the work I'm doing throughout the First District and also
discuss the unfinished business I will continue to work on when I
return to Washington next week.
Celebrating Small Business
Small businesses are the backbone of Rhode Island's economy and I was
glad to celebrate their contributions to our local economy during
National Small Business Week. Over half of all Americans either own or
work for a small business, and they create about two out of every three
new jobs in the U.S. each year. According to a 2013 Small Business
Administration (SBA) study, there are over 95,400 small businesses in
Rhode Island, which employ more than 221,000 workers.
I was especially pleased to meet with entrepreneurs in Providence's
Knowledge District, Pawtucket and Newport and to tour their businesses
for a firsthand look at their operations.
I was very impressed by the
creativity and innovation these companies displayed, like G-Form in
Providence, which develops high impact protective gear for athletes and
their personal electronics.
In addition to visiting G-Form, I also
toured Splitwise, a Providence based web and mobile application
software service that organizes shared expenses to make it easy to
split bills with friends and family; Cooley Group, a Pawtucket based
manufacturer of coated fabrics used across an array of industrial,
commercial and military applications; and Famaesthetics, a Newport
based cosmetic manufacturer of skincare products. I had the opportunity
to hear about the challenges these businesses face.
That's why I'll
continue working in Washington to ensure Rhode Island's small
businesses have the resources they need from the federal government,
working capital, and trained workers in order to grow their businesses
and create more jobs.
Supporting Rhode Island Manufacturers
This week I kicked off the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association's
2014 Annual Meeting and discussed the importance of our state's
manufacturing sector. According to Manufacturers' News, Inc., in 2013
Rhode Island added over 1,000 manufacturing jobs and manufacturers'
support over 59,000 jobs across the state. We need to build upon this
success in order to ensure that our state remains a leader in
industrial production. Since coming to Congress, one of my top
priorities has been advocating for federal programs that support
manufacturers, both big and small, including the Make It In America
Agenda
to provide American businesses the
best conditions to manufacture their products, innovate, and create
jobs right here in the U.S.
Honoring Middle School Students
A strong education is critical to the well-being of our state and its
economic competitiveness. On Tuesday, I was delighted to support Rhode
Island educators and congratulate outstanding middle school students at
the Rhode Island Middle Level Educators' Annual Scholar Leader Awards
Banquet. I was especially pleased to provide over 60 students
congressional citations for their academic achievements. With the help
of dedicated teachers, these students will be well prepared to enter
high school, college, and compete in the global workforce. I'm proud of
the work our teachers are doing and will continue to support their work
in the classroom.
Unfinished Business
Last week Congress left town with unfinished business.
When I return
to Washington next week I will work with my colleagues to responsibly
invest in our nation's transportation infrastructure.
This includes
reauthorizing surface transportation programs so critical
infrastructure projects that support jobs are not disrupted. I have
signed discharge petitions to force a vote on legislation that would
extend unemployment insurance for over 2.5 million Americans, enact
comprehensive immigration reform, and raise the minimum wage because
House Republicans have refused to allow a vote on each of these
important matters.
I will continue fighting for these important pieces
of legislation because our country's economic security is dependent on
protecting and strengthening the middle class and we must build more
ladders to increase the quality of life for millions of Americans,
promote economic growth and spur job creation.
As always, if you or someone you know has a question or needs
assistance on a matter relating to the federal government, please
contact my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
david.cicilline@mail.house.gov
My best always,
David Cicilline

Dear

It&#8217;s
been
a

in
Rhode
Island
and
I

to

a

the

I

Celebrating
Small

Small
businesses
are
the
backbone
of
Rhode
Island&#8217;s
economy
and
I
was
glad
to
celebrate
their
contributions
to
our
local
economy
during
National
Small
Business
Week. Over half
of
all
Americans
either
own
or
work
for
a
small
business,
and
they
create
about
two
out
of
every
three
new
jobs
in
the
U.S.
each
year.
According
to
a
2013
Small
Business
Administration
(SBA)
study,
there
are
over
95,400
small
businesses
in
Rhode
Island,
which
employ
more
than
221,000
workers.
I
was
especially

Providence&#8217;s

like

That&#8217;s

I&#8217;ll

Manufacturers

and
discussed
the
importance
of
our
state&#8217;s

According

Manufacturers&#8217;

in

Rhode
Island
added
over
1,000
manufacturing

and
manufacturers&#8217;
support
over
59,000

across
the
state.
We
need
to
build

this
success
in
order

Honoring
Middle

A

is

the

of

and
its

On

I

and
congratulate
outstanding
middle

students
at
the
Rhode

Middle

Annual
Scholar

Banquet.
I
was

With

of
dedicated

these

I&#8217;m
proud
of
the
work
our
teachers
are
doing
and
will
continue
to
support
their
work
in
the
classroom.
Unfinished

Last
week
Congress
left
town
with
unfinished
business.
When
I
return

Washington
next

I
will
work

to
responsibly

and
raise
the
minimum

because
House
Republicans
have
refused
to
allow
a
vote
on
each
of
these
important
matters.
I
will
continue
fighting
for
these
important

because
our
country&#8217;s
economic
security
is
dependent
on
protecting
