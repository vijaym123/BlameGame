Again and again, you told us you wanted to stop big money from buying our elections. And trust us, we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. 99% of our contributions are from supporters like you giving an average of $22. If we could remove secret corporate cash from our elections, we could remove a gargantuan barrier to electing Democrats who put the middle class first.
But since you -- our grassroots supporters -- are the main source of our funding, we can&rsquo;t move forward without your support. We hope you&rsquo;ll make your voice heard immediately. Results will be posted soon -- stay tuned! http://action.dccc.org/2014-instant-poll
