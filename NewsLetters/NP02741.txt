Statement on Browns
Canyon
2/18/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released a statement following President
Obama's decision to designate Browns Canyon as a National
Monument.
I am outraged; this is the
type of executive order that upsets Americans. This is a top-down, big
government land grab by the President that disenfranchises the
concerned citizens in the Browns Canyon region. Ive heard from multitudes of
local citizens whose concerns about grazing rights, water rights,
outdoor recreation, and the inability of first responders to manage and
fight wildfires in the area have never been addressed. It is also
important for people to note that national monuments created by
Presidential executive order under the Antiquities Act almost always become
underfunded, neglected properties. This is because they are created without
normal Congressional and local consensus, robbing the people of a
fair and open process that stifles the input of the community. And they
become orphans once the Administration changes. Does Browns Canyon
really deserve this kind of second-class
status?
