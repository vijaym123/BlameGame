Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today, I join the
millions of Hispanic Americans in Nevada and across the country, that
celebrate and remember their loved ones on this Dia de los Muertos.
This cultural celebration is an example of how the rich traditions of the
Hispanic community run deep in the social fabric of our great
state.
Throughout our nations history, Latinos have enriched the
fabric and culture of the United States. The influence of Hispanic
Americans in Nevada, who represent a quarter of our states population,
is reflected everywhere: from our state's name, which refers to the
snow-capped peaks of our beautiful Sierra mountains, to its businesses,
classrooms and work places.
The Hispanic community has
contributed to the progress of our countrys greatness and I am proud to be
their representative in the Senate. To all of those who celebrate
this important holiday, Feliz Dia de los Muertos!
