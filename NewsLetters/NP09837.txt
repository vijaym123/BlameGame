It was great seeing Scott from Short's Brewing Company this week. They
are one of Michigan's largest brewing companies and continue to create
quality beer in Northern Michigan.
Met with representatives from the Michigan chapter of the Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association this week to discuss funding for
ALS research and the many obstacles that those suffering from this
devastating disease have to overcome.
Dear Friends,
This week in Washington, it was once again a busy time meeting with
constituents from Michigan and groups on a variety of issues. We
considered a number of issues on the floor of the House with the
primary focus being on legislation that would continue to reduce
burdensome regulations and help get families back to work.
Veterans' Affairs Committee Subpoenas VA Secretary Shinseki for Real
Answers
Having worked at the Iron Mountain, Michigan VA hospital for nearly 20
years, I experienced firsthand the challenges veterans face trying to
receive the care they deserved.
As we continue to investigate the
failures at Phoenix VAMC,
all veterans deserve to know that we will
not stop until there are answers and people are held accountable.

The Creation of a Select Committee on Benghazi
One of the most important functions of Congress is oversight over the
Executive Branch.
This week there were a number of efforts to continue
our oversight authority.
This has included passing legislation that
will establish a Select Committee to investigate the deaths of the four
Americans murdered in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.
In addition, we
also passed legislation that will hold Lois Lerner, a federal employee,
in contempt of Congress.
Ms. Lerner refused to comply with a subpoena
regarding an ongoing investigation into policies adopted by the IRS
that unfairly targeted politically conservative groups.
The deserve
and demand accountability from our federal agencies.

Supporting Growth of Charter Schools
This week, we celebrate teachers, mothers, and nurses.
Monday was
National Teachers Day, which gave us all an opportunity to thank a
teacher, and think about those teachers who may have inspired you along
the way.
In that spirit, the House passed H.R. 10, the "Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act" today.

With that, I'd just like to remind everyone that Sunday is Mother's
Day.
I wish every mother out there a Happy Mother's Day, and thank you
for all that you do!
I want to hear your thoughts on how best to represent Northern
Michigan, so please call me at 202-225-4735 or send me an email through
