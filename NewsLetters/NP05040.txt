Boys and Girls Club breaks ground in Commerce City
On Tuesday, I joined the Commerce City Mayor, City Councilors, representatives of the Boys and Girls Club and SunCor Energy to celebrate the groundbreaking for the new 20,000-square foot Suncor Boys &amp; Girls Club. Boys &amp; Girls Clubs are important to our community because they provide a safe place for children to learn and play. Providing this resource instills a sense of usefulness and belonging to the community, which will reap benefits for years to come.
This project is a prime example of how private, public and nonprofit entities can work together at the local, state and federal levels to make critical investments in our communities. A big thank you to SunCor Energy, Commerce City, Dick and Ze Deane, Adams 14 School District, and the Boys &amp; Girls Club for your hard work to get this project off the ground. I&rsquo;m proud to have the opportunity to have played a role in this project by working with HUD to secure $166,000 for this project. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the completed club in 2015.
Medicare enrollment now open
No increase to premiums or deductibles
Medicare Open Enrollment started last week. If you need to enroll in Medicare for the first time or make changes to your plan, you have until December 7.
Click here to get information about enrollment, check your current plan, and compare coverage.
There is no increase in this year&rsquo;s premiums or deductibles.
In fact, despite premiums more than doubling from 2000 to 2008, rates have stayed the same for the last three years, and Medicare now offers more free preventive services for seniors.

Colorado economy continues
to lead nation
In September, employers added 14,600 jobs and Colorado&rsquo;s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% last month, the lowest since June 2008.
In addition, jobless aid applications fell to the lowest level in 14 years. These are both great indicators for future growth and a healing labor market.
We also heard this week the U.S. Department of Labor is granting the Denver area $6.2 million to help retrain long-term unemployed workers. The grant will fund programs to retrain workers in advanced manufacturing, IT and other jobs requiring technical training. This is good news for people who have struggled to find the right resources, and it shows we are committed to not leaving any Coloradans behind as the economy continues to grow.
Helping Kudjo
Kudjo applied early this year to receive his green card.
Weeks after receiving approval on his application, he still had not received his green card. Kudjo called my office to help resolve the issue and my staff went to work.
"When I first had this problem, nothing was getting done.
When I contacted Congressman Perlmutter&rsquo;s office, I knew I had found the right place- Suzette completely understood my situation, and worked hard to solve it.
Now I tell my friends and neighbors about Ed&mdash;who he is, and how he can help you."
My office is here to help the hard-working people of the 7th Congressional District. We want to help you cut through red tape when dealing with a government agency or with any other issues you are facing. If you are having an issue with a federal agency, please call my office at 303-274-7944. My staff and I will always do our best to help.
