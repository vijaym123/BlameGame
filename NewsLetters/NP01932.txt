2015 Congressional Art Competition
I am inviting high school students from Ohio's 15th Congressional District to participate in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
The Art Competition is held every year to recognize the extraordinary artistic talents of our high school students. The winner will have his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year, as well as be awarded a trip to Washington, D.C. to attend a reception and see his or her artwork hung inside the Capitol.
Artwork must be an original in concept design, and execution, and may be up to 28 inches by 28 inches (including the frame) and up to 4 inches in depth. The artwork may be paintings, drawings, collage, prints, mixed media, computer generated art, or photography.
The Art Show and Awards Ceremony for the Art Competition will take place at the Columbus Museum of Art on April 8, 2015 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.
The public is invited to attend.
For additional information on this year's Congressional Art Competition, please contact Kevin Watters in my Hilliard District Office at (614) 771-4968.
