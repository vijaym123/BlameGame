Week in Review
Dear Friends,
Thanks for subscribing to receive regular email updates!
I'm happy to share with you highlights from the legislative week in D.C. and stops around the district.
Honoring Harriet Tubman
I introduced bipartisan legislation to feature an iconic American woman, Harriet Tubman, on U.S. Currency.
This legislation recognizes the incredible contributions that Harriet Tubman has made to our great country -- and to Central New York -- by preserving her legacy, courage, and commitment to others.

Action in Washington
The House Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing on the threat of terrorism going viral.
We focused on the slick online and social media messaging used by ISIS and other terrorist groups to recruit &amp; inspire westerners to join violent jihad.

I'm proud to partner with my Upstate New York colleagues to co-sponsor the TREAT Act,
legislation to fight the opioid and heroin epidemic plaguing Central New York and our entire country.
This legislation will provide more comprehensive treatment options by allowing competent and qualified health care professionals to treat a greater number of patients suffering from addiction.

Around Central New York
This morning, I spoke with seniors at Liverpool High School via Google Hangout.
Great questions, and a wonderful way to interact with NY-24 students!
After 16 years of service to the U.S. House of Representatives, Shelly retired earlier this week.
Thank you, Shelly, for your service to the people of NY-24!
Our entire team wishes you the best of luck in the next chapter of your life.
I visited the Child Advocacy Center of Cayuga County
to learn about the important, multidisciplinary work that they do to help children who suffer from abuse.
As always, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
