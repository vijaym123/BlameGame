Putting Politics Before Good
Policy
Dear Friend:
To everyones great dismay, this week
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said that it
cannot produce emails originating from Lois
Lerner, and possibly other top IRS officials,
about the way the IRS handled certain
applications for tax-exempt status (primarily for
conservative organizations).
This is an outrageous impediment to the
investigation we have launched. What is even more
egregious is the fact that we are learning about
this a full year after our initial request to
provide the Committee with any and all documents
related to the bipartisan Senate Finance
Committee investigation. Its deeply
troubling that the Obama Administration failed to
notify the Committee that these emails were lost
when they first became aware of it.
So thats why I sent a letter yesterday
to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding
answers on the timeline of when the IRS first
discovered this information; who was aware of
this information on Monday when information was
provided to the House Ways and Means Committee;
and why was it not brought to my attention when I
met with Commissioner Koskinen.
You can read my full letter
here.
This is an important issue and Im going
to get to the bottom of it. You have my
commitment to continue to press for answers, and
I will keep you updated on what were able
to uncover.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
