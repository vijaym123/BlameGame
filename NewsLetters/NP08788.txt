Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Fathers Day offers us a great opportunity to
acknowledge and honor the influential role that fathers play in our lives. Dads
often serve as our first example of a friend, teacher, provider, and
role model. I feel very fortunate to have been raised by a great father
who was a hard working rock-miner with an eighth grade education in
Searchlight, Nevada. My father instilled in me the importance of
education, hard work, courage, compassion, and values.
Today, we
should take the time to appreciate the countless sacrifices that
fathers have made to ensure the well-being of their children and families.
They continue to work hard to provide the positive support and
encouragement that will help to guide their children from adolescence to
adulthood.
To fathers and families everywhere, I wish you
a Happy Fathers Day!
