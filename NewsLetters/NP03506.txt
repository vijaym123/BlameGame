Dear Friend,
Welcome to the 114 th
Congress.
I am deeply honored that my fellow Hoosiers elected me to another term representing the home that I love&mdash;Indiana&rsquo;s Seventh Congressional District. Whether we are pushing for higher wages, more affordable health care, or better education for our children, I look forward to the things we can accomplish together over the next two years.
It is important that we stay in touch and talk regularly about your priorities, interests and comments on the issues our country is facing, both in Washington D.C. and here in Indiana.
Together with my dedicated staff, I stand ready to help you in any way that I can.
In addition to receiving my weekly e-newsletter, you can also stay up to date on a wide range of issues and activities through
Facebook ,
Twitter
and by visiting my
website .
If you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss your priorities or receive help navigating the federal government, I have two offices to serve you.
I welcome you to visit with us at either location.
Our
Indianapolis Office , is located at 300 E Fall Creek Pkwy N Dr. Suite 300. Additionally, our
Washington, DC Office
is located at 2432 Rayburn House Office Building.
You can also reach us by phone at 317-283-6516 or 202-225-4011.
I take the title of "Representative" literally and consider helping constituents and representing their views to be my top priorities.
I value your ideas and I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Andr&eacute;
