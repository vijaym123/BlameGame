Dear
Friends,
Did you know that its Medicare Open
Enrollment season? That means now through December 7, all Medicare
beneficiaries have the opportunity to review and change their Medicare
health and Part D prescription drug
plans!
If a beneficiary is satisfied with his or her
current coverage, its important to know that no action is required.
However, I encourage all Medicare enrollees to get as much information as
possible and review their options to ensure their current plan is the
best available to best meet their needs.
You can do
this by visiting
www.medicare.gov . On the site, you will be able to find out more
information, review and compare coverage options, check current
enrollment, and apply for a plan online. These services are also available via
telephone; just call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to speak directly
to a Medicare expert.
I understand that it is often difficult for
some seniors to decide which plan is the best for them and their
individual health needs
those Arkansans can receive free personalized health
insurance counseling through the
Senior Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP) . SHIIP
advisors will be able to provide one-on-one counseling, education,
and information to Medicare beneficiaries of all ages. They can also
assist with applications for Medicare subsidy programs, such as the
Medicare Savings Programs
or
Extra Help . Find out
more by visiting
www.insurance.arkansas.gov/shiip .htm or by calling
1-800-224-6330.
As with many government programs and
agencies, working through red tape can be a difficult and frustrating process;
thats where my office comes in! One of the most important things I
do as a U.S. Representative is help people with federal problems.
Although I cannot override decisions made by a federal agency, I can often
intervene on a person's behalf to answer questions, find solutions, or
just make the process a little smoother. In the event that you or a
loved one needs my help with a Medicare issue, please fill out
my privacy authorization form , print it
off, and send it to
my office via fax or by
mail . If you have any questions, feel free to call my
office at 479-464-0446.
Over
550,000 Arkansans rely on the Medicare program to pay for their doctor and
hospital visits and prescription drugs. However, each beneficiary has
unique needs. Therefore, I hope our seniors will use these resources
during open enrollment to make sure the program is working for them
and meeting their needs the best it can.
From the Front...
