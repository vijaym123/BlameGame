Rep. Lipinski Receives Leadership Award
for
Standing Up for America's Seniors
Congressman Dan Lipinski has
been chosen by the over 400,000 members of the RetireSafe organization
to receive their Standing Up for Americas Seniors Leadership
Award.
The award is presented to a small group of elected officials
each year who have distinguished themselves through various actions
that benefit seniors throughout the nation, now and in the future.
RetireSafe is a nonpartisan organization.
I take great pride in looking out for
the interests of the Third District's senior citizens while on
Capitol Hill, and stand ready to help them cut through bureaucratic red tape
at home to get the services they need when they need them, said Rep.
Lipinski.
My office has helped countless seniors get answers
and solve problems involving Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,
Veterans' benefits, the Postal Service, and many other federal
issues.
I also host Senior Fairs throughout the year to give seniors a
chance to get assistance with a variety of issues from my staff, as well as
local organizations, agencies, and
businesses.

Rep. Lipinski Helps Spur Launch of New
Department of Energy Program that Will Drive Innovation and Create
Jobs
Argonne
National Laboratory Will Play an Important Role
Congressman Lipinski is announcing that the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) is starting a new program designed to accelerate
the movement of innovative clean energy technologies from the DOEs
National Laboratories into the commercial marketplace.
This is part
of Lipinskis efforts to grow American jobs by taking advantage of
the innovations created with the help of federally-funded
research.
In doing so, not only are more jobs created, but Americans get a
better return on the investment of their tax
dollars.
Built on the National Science Foundations Innovation Corps (I-Corps)
program long-championed by Rep. Lipinski, Lab-Corps aims to better train
and empower national lab researchers to successfully transition their
discoveries into high-impact, real world technologies in the private
sector.
The I-Corps program was initially developed from a
course conceived by Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur Steve Blank, and has
led to the creation of many new companies in its short
existence.
As the top Democrat on the Research and Technology Subcommittee of
the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Lipinski used his
leadership position to advocate for the development of this program,
which will involve Argonne National Laboratory in
Lemont.
The total cost of this
program is relatively modest compared to its potential value, said
Congressman Lipinski.
Just like I-Corps, Lab-Corps represents a
low-cost way to take laboratory discoveries and turn them into
profit-making companies and high quality jobs that boost economic growth and
American
competitiveness.
Argonne is one of just five national labs that will recruit and
support the Lab-Corps teams, helping new innovations reach their
commercial potential.
Rep. Lipinski wrote to then-Energy Secretary
Steven Chu in April of last year urging him to allow scientists at Argonne
to participate, and raised the issue again with current Secretary
Ernest Moniz in hearings before the Science
Committee.
Next generation supercomputing technologies are also coming to
Argonne.
