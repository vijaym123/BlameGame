Dear
Friends,
I want to make
sure you know that the White House has extended the deadline to sign up
for health insurance for consumers who are already in line on
www.healthcare.gov
to enroll but have not been able to
complete their application due to high volume or a technical
issue.
If you begin your application, whether online, by
phone, or in person before March 31 st , you will be able to
receive health coverage.
Dont wait until the last minute if you do
not have coverage and take advantage of this opportunity to get
insurance, regardless of your previous health history.
For the first
time ever, no one can be turned away when they apply for health
insurance.
In our communities, where many people do not have insurance
and getting sick can risk a familys financial stability , this is
truly important.
Key
Points:
1. What happens to
people in line
HHS made clear that consumers in line
when the deadline passes get
helped.
2.
Complex Cases
Case work
HHS
made clear that complex cases that could take more time will be worked
through without a disadvantage to the consumer.
Please do not hesitate to begin
your health insurance application before the March 31st
deadline.
For more information, visit
www.healthcare.gov
or

Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
