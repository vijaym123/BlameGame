Staying in Touch
With the Second Session of the 113th Congress in full swing, I wanted to let you know how you can stay
up-to-date on legislative action in Washington as well as other issues impacting the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia.
If you would like
to receive regular e-mail updates on legislative issues and upcoming events, I encourage you to subscribe to my
e-newsletter .
You can also &quot;Like&quot; my
Facebook
page, follow me on
Twitter , or subscribe to my
YouTube
channel for updates.
Click
here
or on the image above to subscribe to my
e-newsletter. Another way to stay in touch is
through Tele-town Hall Meetings.
Tele-town Hall Meetings are a great way to directly connect with you even when Congress is in session and
voting.
They allow me to listen to your ideas on the critical challenges facing our nation, share my work on legislation, and answer questions
that you may have about what is happening in Congress. If you have not yet had the opportunity to participate in a Tele-town Hall Meeting and would
like to do so in the future, you can
sign up
now. Click
here
or on
the image above to sign up for Tele-Town Hall Meetings. As part of my efforts to assist constituents, my office also hosts monthly Open Door Meetings in communities throughout the Sixth
District.
My staff is available to assist you with problems with federal agencies or listen to your opinion on legislation before
Congress.
For a complete schedule, please click
here .
If you have questions about legislation or need help dealing with a federal agency, you can contact one of my offices (information below) or
send an e-mail
through my website.
Click
here
or on the image above to view the Open Door Meeting schedule. It is an honor to represent the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia in the House of Representatives and
serve as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
I know this will be a busy few months in the House of
Representatives as we debate numerous issues impacting our nation.
I look forward to continuing to communicate with you whether it is
through a Tele-town Hall Meeting, a constituent response, a meeting in my office, by Facebook or Twitter, or seeing you at a stop around the Sixth
District.
In the meantime,
I hope that you will be in touch if I may be of assistance.
Sincerely,
This message was generated from an unattended
mailbox. Should you have further questions, please visit the &ldquo; Contact Bob &rdquo; section of my website or call my office at
