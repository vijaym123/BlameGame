Republican special interests are spending more money against Ami than any candidate in the entire country.
Friend , it&#39;s no surprise why: poll after poll show that our race is DEADLOCKED.
John Boehner and his friends think that with enough cash they can buy this election for their handpicked candidate.
That&#39;s why we&#39;ve got to talk to each and every voter in Sacramento County and make sure they know fact from fiction.
