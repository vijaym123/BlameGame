RAND'S NEWSLETTER UPDATE
NOVEMBER 28, 2013
Happy Thanksgiving! With the season upon us, please pause for a moment to reflect, remember and appreciate how special our country is and how important it is that we secure its greatness for future generations of Americans.
We are blessed to live in a country where individual and religious freedoms, guaranteed through our Constitution, allow us to enjoy Thanksgiving as a celebration of our blessings.
We must also not forget those who have sacrificed to protect those freedoms, and keep our thoughts and prayers with those who are away from their families, serving our nation, over the holidays.
From my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving.
God Bless,
