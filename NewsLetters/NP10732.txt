Friend -
Throwing more taxpayer dollars into transportation projects that are being choked by bureaucratic red tape doesnt make sense and doesnt fix the problem.
The 414 Plan is simple.
Heres what it does:
Suspends for five years all federal regulations that do not pertain to the safety or durability of highway facilities, or of public and workplace safety;
Dispenses with costly, federal requirements while continuing to afford states and localities flexibility in utilizing federal funding for road and bridge projects; and
Expresses the sense of Congress on the need for greater interagency cooperation among project stakeholders to further expedite the deployment of surface transportation projects.
The 414 Plan, which I introduced, has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The text for this legislation can be found
here
and you can learn more about it,
here .
Yours in Service,
Randy
