August 24, 2014
Friends,
Can you believe August is already almost over? Many of you are
putting your kids on the school bus in the mornings or taking your
older ones back to college. Our two girls are back on their campuses now
and excited to start a new school year. Our oldest graduated from
college this past spring, and I think he's a little jealous watching his
sisters go back!
This week in OH-14, I had the opportunity
to focus on
jobs . Encouraging job creation and
economic growth in Northeast Ohio remains my top priority, and one of the
best ways to learn how to do that effectively is to hear directly from
local employers.
Here is a look at a few of my
visits:
Bird Technologies in
Solon
It was a
pleasure to speak with the hardworking employees at Bird Technologies
and learn more about the significant contributions they make to our
local economy and national defense. Facilities like this one play a
crucial role not only here in Northeast Ohio but also around the world by
ensuring that members of our military have the equipment they need to
fully accomplish their missions.
Coca-Cola Bottling
in Twinsburg Township
Already a big employer with lots of
initiatives to give back to the community, the Coca-Cola Bottling facility
in Twinsburg Township gave me a fascinating tour of their operation. I
was happy to hear they are growing and continuing to provide more
employment opportunities. And, of course, we had to sample their
product!
Ashtabula County Community Action Agency in
Ashtabula
The Ashtabula County Community Action Agency has
established an innovative trucking school called Action in Motion
Academy, where students can earn their CDL within five weeks. To close the
unemployment gap, we have to be more deliberate in training people for
the good jobs that are available. Employees with CDLs are in high
demand with local businesses, so the Action in Motion model is a win-win
for OH-14's economy.
3Chamber Luncheon with
Twinsburg, Solon and Aurora
Thank you to the
Twinsburg ,
Solon
and
Aurora
Chambers of Commerce for having me speak at their 3Chamber
Luncheon. I had the opportunity to update the group on what's happening
in Washington and take a number of great questions. It's always an
honor to talk about pressing issues with our district's business owners
and employers.
Quick plug:
Visiting
businesses and industries in our area is one of the most valuable and
enjoyable things I get to do. If you would be interested in having me come to
your business,
please shoot me a note on my
website . I've done hundreds of tours since I took office and have learned
something new at each one.
Medal
Presentation
On Friday, I had the honor of presenting medals to the
family of Robert Luckner, who lost his life in World War II. His
sister-in-law Donna and nephew Kim wanted to honor Robert's service and
sacrifice by passing his medals on through their family's
generations.
If you are related to a veteran who misplaced or never received
the medals he or she earned, we would love to help you obtain these
awards.
Please contact our office
to let us know
how we can assist you.
