&ldquo;With days left in the race, [Mitch] McConnell is in the toughest re-election fight of his career.&rdquo; --
USA Today
Friend &ndash; Democrats are SURGING in the polls -- even in
RED STATES
like McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky.
USA Today
reports, &ldquo;The pressure on Republicans to win the Senate cannot be overstated&hellip; Losing in this climate would shake the party, its base and its donors to the core.&rdquo;
We CAN win this election, but EVERYTHING depends on this weekend&rsquo;s Get Out The Vote Push.
If you help us fully fund it , we&rsquo;ll OVERWHELM Republicans on Election Day.
But if we can&rsquo;t raise another $1,100,984 by tomorrow night&rsquo;s LAST end-of-month deadline, we risk having to cut some states loose.
Will you pitch in to our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push so we can fight for voters in EVERY state? All gifts will be triple-matched!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
It would be downright criminal not to seize this opportunity to set the GOP back for decades and beat McConnell and the Tea Party! But we must, MUST, MUST be able to fund our Final Weekend Push!
Friend, we need you now. If you pitch in, we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift and it will go right to deadlocked battlegrounds to GOTV and WIN!
We can do this!
Democratic Victory
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
