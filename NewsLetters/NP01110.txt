This morning, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in challenges to four democratically-passed state marriage laws from Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, and Tennessee.
I believe states and their citizens should remain free to debate and decide the issue of marriage for themselves. That is why I joined my colleagues in the House and Senate in an
amicus brief
urging the Court to uphold the marriage laws before the Court today.
However, regardless of what the Court decides, the government should not coerce individuals who believe marriage is an inherently religious act into participating in affirming a ceremony that violates their religious beliefs. I believe every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
But there is a fundamental difference between a blanket refusal to provide services to someone because of who they are (which is wrong) and respectfully declining to proactively participate in the celebration of something that contradicts your religious beliefs (which is a constitutional right).
In fact, the worlds three largest religionsChristianity, Judaism, and Islamall view marriage as a sacred and fundamentally religious act; so for many individuals, their inability to actively participate in a same-sex marriage ceremony is not a choice.
We are a free society rooted in these fundamental freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom to peaceably assemble and associate with likeminded individuals. These freedoms ring hollow if Americans are not free to live by their beliefs, and instead are told they must check their convictions at the doors of their homes or places of worship. A nation that allows differing opinions and beliefs to flourish is a nation that is truly tolerant and diverse.
Yours in service,
Randy

On April 28 th , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in challenges to four democratically-passed state marriage laws from Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, and Tennessee.
This is an important case because it will decide whether states, as sovereign entities, will see their laws defining marriage respected. In
United States vs. Windsor
in 2013, the Court emphasized that the statesnot the federal governmenthave the authority to define and oversee marriages. Now, however, the Court is being asked to ignore its own precedent and judicially interfere.
I joined my fellow Members of Congress in submitting an
amicus curiae
brief to the Supreme Court, urging the Court to defer to the authority of the States, so as to allow the people to debate and determine what marriage policies are best for their state. You can read the text of the brief,

Yours in service,
Randy
