Dear David,
Growing up in rural Missouri, I learned at a young age how seriously Missourians take their hunting and fishing seasons. In fact, my dad was no stranger to hunting in the fall and fishing in the summer, and it's those memories I cherish as I fight to protect our state's outdoor heritage.
That's why I recently announced
my support
for the
Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act 0f 2014
to ensure we're doing our part to protect your hunting and fishing rights, and promote increased access to more public lands for outdoor recreation.
This bill not only represents Missouri values and traditions we hold dear, but protects outdoor opportunities for our kids and grandkids.
The
Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act
combines 12 different measures, all aimed at preserving hunting and fishing rights, renewing conservation programs, and promoting access to public lands for outdoor recreation. The legislation would require the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service to promote hunting and angling opportunities on federal lands, allow duck hunting permits to be sold online, and renew certain conservation measures such as the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
The bill also permanently prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating hunting ammo and fishing tackle under the
Toxic Substances Control Act , and will aid the development of new shooting ranges on public land.
This bill has already garnered widespread support among major hunting and fishing groups, including the Congressional Sportsmen's Federation, Ducks Unlimited, the National Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, Safari Club, and the National Wild Turkey Federation.
It's no secret Missouri is full of beautiful outdoor recreation areas and it's my hope that my grandchildren will get the opportunity to hunt and fish like so many of us did as kids. I know it's something my dad would be proud of.
All the best,
P.S. I'm prepared to see this bill across the finish line and I'll keep you up-to-date as I do. Stay in touch by
