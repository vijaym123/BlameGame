David -- Before I was a Senator, I was a farmer.
Actually, I&rsquo;m still a farmer. Every April my wife Sharla and I plant our crops on our farm in Big Sandy, Montana. And this year, I could use your help.
That&rsquo;s why the DSCC is flying one Democratic supporter and a friend to Montana to help me with my spring planting.
There&#39;s no cost to enter -- just add your name.
They&rsquo;ll put you up in a hotel, drive you out to our farm, and Sharla and I will turn you into farmers. I might even give you a ride on the tractor.
Click here to enter the DSCC&rsquo;s contest to join me for a day of farming in Montana. They&rsquo;ll pick up the tab for your farming adventure.
So what do you say? Ready to come out to the Treasure State? Then add your name to enter the DSCC&rsquo;s contest.
I&rsquo;ll see you on the farm!
