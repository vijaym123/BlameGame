House Passage and Senate Inaction
Dear Friends,
During this session of congress, my colleagues and I in the Republican controlled House have passed over 356 bills, including more than 40 jobs bills, that are still awaiting consideration by the Democrat controlled Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has chosen to ignore these important bills that range from management of natural resources to national defense.
Republican and Democratic Senators alike are frustrated with this stalling and refusal to legislate.
Even non-partisan and non-controversial acts have been denied consideration.
Sen. Harry Reid has set Congress back by hundreds of bills and months of work.
And he shows no signs of changing his tune.
Please
share your thoughts
with me on these and other issues you are concerned with.
Sincerely,
Cynthia M. Lummis
