Dear Friend:
This week we learned the shocking news that nearly 34 million air bags made by the Takata Corporation are being recalled nationwide because of a dangerous defect that has caused at least six deaths and more than 100 injuries.
Dozens of models of vehicles from automakers including Honda, BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru and Toyota dating back to the 2001 model year have been affected.
While automakers are required to send you a recall notice if your vehicle is under recall, I encourage anyone concerned that their vehicle might be affected to go to the Transportation Department's safety recall
website . By entering your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), you can find out if your vehicle is subject to the Takata air bag recall or any other safety recalls.
You can also visit the automakers' recall websites to determine if your vehicle is affected. For more information on how automakers are responding and to visit their recall websites, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
