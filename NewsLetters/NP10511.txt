Dear Friend:
Starting this week, Congress is taking a two week break from Washington.
What that means for me is that I get to spend the next two weeks visiting with folks from all across the 12th District.
During this District Work Period, Im going to be traveling across the entire region talking about the work Im doing on your behalf in Washington.
Since I cant see everyone, I wanted to make sure I shared some updates with you.
Over the next two weeks, Im conducting my
3rd annual Made in Georgia tour across the 12th District .
Every year, I have the opportunity to visit with manufacturers across the area to talk about their business, and learn what the federal government can do to help them grow or hire employees.
Im amazed every year at how many great products are manufactured here in the 12th District, and many of those products are being shipped across the world.
We started on Friday in Bulloch County with a roundtable with businesses from the area, community leaders, and stakeholders to talk about how we can promote manufacturing in Georgia.
Im looking forward to continuing on this tour over the next two weeks, and Ill be sure to share some thoughts with you when were finished.
You can keep up with my tour by following
#MadeinGA
on Twitter.
Im also going to be visiting with students and teachers across the district who participated in our very first Barrows Bookworms reading program.
I couldnt have asked for better participation this year:
More than 1,300 students across the district participated in the challenge, and they read more than 27,000 books!
We all know how important reading is to a childs education, and I was very impressed with this years students.
Every student who read the required amount of books will get a certificate and a bookmark that was created by Bekah McCord, a third grade students from Southwest Laurens Elementary School.
I recognized these students on the floor of the House of Representatives earlier this month (you can see the speech by clicking the image).
Im looking forward to seeing as many folks as I can from around the district over the next two weeks.
And soon well be announcing more opportunities where you and I can visit.
Until then, if I can be of help, please dont hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
