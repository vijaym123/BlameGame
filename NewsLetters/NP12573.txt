Legislation Gives Homeowners an Edge in Preparing for Hurricanes,
Natural Disasters
You can't fool Mother Nature, but a Disaster Savings Account (DSA)
would provide added incentive to prepare for her. That's the
common-sense thinking behind new legislation that I have co-sponsored
to allow homeowners to set aside up to $5,000 in tax-free accounts to
strengthen their homes against natural disasters.
By installing cement-fortified walls, storm shutters, generators or
other features, safety increases and the need for taxpayer-funded
government intervention decreases.
For every dollar spent on disaster
mitigation the federal government saves between three to four dollars
in future rebuilding costs, according to recent statistics: that's a
win-win all around.
Homeowner's insurance holders are eligible to set up a DSA, and unused
funds can be rolled over from year to year. Any expense that would help
to fortify a home in preparation for, or in recovery from, a natural
disaster event is qualified; for example, storm-proof shutter or window
panes, whole home generators, or reinforced walls. Account funds are
also qualified for use toward personal property losses in and around
the home, resulting from a natural disaster, not otherwise covered by
insurance, including natural disaster from floods.
The Disaster Savings Account Act (HR 3989) was introduced on February
2nd and has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. I'll
be sure to keep you in the loop on its progress.
Military Academy Day Set for April 26 at Mandarin High School
Northeast Florida students have been some of the best and the
brightest. I strongly encourage those who are interested in attending
one of the nation's service academies to attend Military Service
Academy Day on Saturday, April 26th at Mandarin High School from 10
a.m. to noon.
Representatives from the United States Military Academy (West Point),
United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force Academy, United
States Coast Guard Academy, and United States Merchant Marine Academy
will be on hand to answer questions. And, my staff will be available to
outline the application process for nomination to the academies. In the
meantime, if you are interested in learning more, click on the
