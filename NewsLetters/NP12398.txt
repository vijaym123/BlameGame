Fellow Marylander,
Each year, the Internal Revenue Service's Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Programs
offer free help for qualifying tax payers. As we head into the 2014 tax
season, be aware of the options available for filing your federal tax
returns.
VITA
Don't Forget to File your FAFSA
Each year on January 1st, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA
) is released. This free form, created by the
Department of Education, is the only form required to apply for federal
aid. The Office of Federal Student Aid offers an estimated $150 billion
in grants, loans, and work study funds for college students. It is
critical to fill out the FAFSA form in order to receive the maximum
amount of help in paying for a college education. Visit the FAFSA
Page at the Department of
Education's website for more information.
Will you, a friend, or a family member be filling out a FAFSA form this
year?

The VITA Program generally offers free tax help to people who make
$52,000 or less and need assistance in preparing their own tax returns.
IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return
preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals in local
communities. They can inform taxpayers about special tax credits for
which they may qualify such as Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax
Credit, and Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled. VITA sites are
generally located at community and neighborhood centers, libraries,
schools, shopping malls, and other convenient locations.
TCE
The TCE Program offers free tax help for all with priority assistance
to people who are 60 years of age and older, specializing in questions
about pensions and retirement issues unique to seniors. IRS-certified
volunteers who provide tax counseling are often retired individuals
associated with non-profit organizations that receive grants from the
IRS.
To have your return prepared through the VITA or TCE program, find a
participating site here
, and be sure to bring the following items:
*	Proof of identification - Picture ID
*	Social Security Cards for you, your spouse and dependents; or a
Social Security Number verification letter issued by the Social
Security Administration; or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number
(ITIN) assignment letter for you, your spouse and dependents
*	Proof of foreign status, if applying for an ITIN
*	Birth dates for you, your spouse and dependents on the tax
return
*	Wage and earning statement(s) Form W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, 1099-Misc

Avoid
