Friends,
This has
been a heartbreaking week for South Carolina, but through the
heartache and pain we have seen amazing and inspiring things happen across our
state and nation.
Hate did not divide us and we must remain
vigilant to ensure it has no place in our society today.
The
Palmetto State has proven to be a beacon of light in a world too
often clouded with violence and divisive rhetoric.
As we have seen,
violence will not conqueror violence and hate will not conqueror hate.
Our state has shown the nation that evil can only be conquered
with love and to win this battle, it takes an entire
community.
At dusk tonight, 3,000 people of every race, age, and
religion are expected to join hands to form a human chain bridge over the
Cooper River connecting the Charleston and Mt. Pleasant communities.
Building this bridge has not come without years of trials and
tribulations and tonight it will symbolize what makes the United States
great today: freedom and equality.
Today is
Father's Day and I believe our nation's Founding Fathers would be incredibly
proud to see this human chain bridge span over the Cooper River. They
would be proud to see a country that does not tolerate hate and
violence towards others, one that respects freedom and stands united to
preserve it.
As a father, it is unfathomable for me to
think about losing one of my sons.
I imagine the victims'
families are especially feeling the weight of their loss today.
Please
continue to keep them in your thoughts and prayers.
It
is an honor and privilege to serve you, your family, and the great
state of South Carolina.
Happy Father's
Day,
