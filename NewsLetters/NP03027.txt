A New Congress &ndash; Ready to Work!
Dear David,
In early January, I took the oath of office once more
and was sworn in for the third time as a member of the House of Representatives.
At my swearing in ceremony, I promised to uphold and protect the
Constitution of the United States of America and that is exactly what I intend to do.
Serving
the citizens of Indiana&rsquo;s 3rd Congressional District is not only an honor, but a responsibility that I take very seriously. Washington has a lot
of work to do to strengthen America both at home and abroad. As your Representative, I am proud to serve as your voice in the halls of Congress.
Although there is much to accomplish,
I want you to know that I have returned to Washington ready to work!
Below is a brief update on several issues and pieces of legislation I have been working on since the beginning of
January.
Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act (TRIA)
Upon returning to Washington, one of the first things I supported was the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIA). In the wake of 9/11, TRIA provided much needed stability to help ease the
economic harm of another attack. Re-authorizing this important legislation was a very crucial step to keeping our national security strong. I am happy
both parties worked together to get this done.
Medical Device Tax
As we all know, Obamacare is not what was promised by President Obama
and senior officials in his administration. Millions were kicked off their health care plans and others have seen their premiums rise.
We must
continue the fight to replace this terrible law and the House can pursue this goal in several ways.
One step we can take is to repeal the Medical Device Tax that&rsquo;s hidden in Obamacare. This is a tax on sales of medical devices that damages
our economy by hurting small businesses and slowing advancements in medical technology. Back home in Indiana, the medical device industry is a big
part of our local economy and I will not sit by silently while it harms working families. As a result, I am working on legislation that has
bi-partisan support to repeal this tax and protect Hoosier jobs.
I joined members from both parties to speak to reporters about the need to repeal the Medical
Device Tax.
Keystone Pipeline
Earlier this month,
I voted for a bill to approve the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. This project will add thousands of jobs to the American workforce and as
much as $2 billion in revenue. The Nebraska Supreme Court approved the proposed route for the pipeline and the American people overwhelmingly support
building it. When this bill hits the president's desk, he should sign it into law.
Life
January 22nd was the 42nd
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. Over the last four decades, millions of innocent unborn children were denied a chance to live the American Dream. Just
last week, in honor of the lives lost, thousands of activists from around the country gathered on the National Mall to promote the sanctity of
life.
I was very proud to join the rally and greet pro-life advocates who traveled from Allen
County. Later that day, I supported legislation that would prohibit federal tax dollars from funding abortions. While serving in the House, I will
continue to support legislation that protects innocent unborn children and I look forward to the day when America is a place where everyone is
protected by law and welcomed to life.

County.
529 College Savings
Plans
The very beginning to climbing the
economic ladder of success is a good education. The federal government should be finding ways to make it easier, not harder, for working parents to
save for their kids&rsquo; college education. In his State of the Union speech, President Obama unveiled a plan to tax 529 College Savings Plans. This
disastrous idea was nothing more than a brazen attack on the middle class. As a result, I am now co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Congresswoman Lynn
Jenkins that would strengthen these savings plans.
Fortunately, the president abandoned his initial proposal. However, I will continue to work on and promote
legislation with members of both parties to protect working families and make it easier for them to save for college.
Going Forward
Over the next few months, Washington will have many important issues to deal with. As your Congressman, I
will continue to fight for a strong economy to produce more jobs, more education opportunities through school choice, a return to fiscal
responsibility, a secure border, and a strong national defense. That is my pledge to the 3rd Congressional District and it&rsquo;s a pledge I will
keep.
