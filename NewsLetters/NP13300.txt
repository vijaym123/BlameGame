Dear Friends,
As the 113th Congress comes back this week for the start of its second session, our first order of business should be extending unemployment benefits to those who need it most.
The failure to extend benefits is putting a tremendous hardship on families who are struggling to survive and are very vulnerable.
The expiration of extended benefits took $400 million out of the national economy last week alone, including $12.2 million from Ohio.
Families who are receiving unemployment benefits generally spend the money quickly on essentials such as food and shelter, and taking this money out of the economy has a deep impact on our region.
Since Ohio is one of only five states where unemployment is rising, failing to extend benefits hits Ohio particularly hard.
This is a major piece of unfinished business.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the failure to extend benefits will cost the U.S. economy 200,000 jobs this year.
I am eager to begin working to undo this damage as soon as possible.
If my office can be of assistance to you or a loved one, please do not hesitate to contact me by calling 800-964-4699 or emailing me through
my website .
Sincerely,
U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
Representing Ohio&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District
