Dear David Johnson,
I am writing to remind you to stop by my end-of-the-year open house.
As your representative in Congress, one of my priorities is supporting
our troops and their families. Additionally, as the co-chair of the
Safe Kids Caucus, I believe it is important that children have safe,
educational activities.
My office is hosting an end-of-the-year open house on Monday, December
23 at my Flushing District Office and at my Forest Hills District
Office from 9:30am to 5:30pm.
I will be in Flushing between 10:00am and 12:00pm and in Forest Hills
from 1:00pm to 3:00pm.
When you stop by my office on Monday to share your views, there will
also be an opportunity to send warm words of thanks and well wishes to
our troops and their families, through Operation Honor Card.
Additionally, NYC Public Library has designated our offices as book
collection drop off pointsfor their children's book drive.
Please feel free to drop by to share your thoughts and enjoy some
refreshments.
If you intend to drop by, please RSVP to Anthony Lemma at 718-445-7860
or email Anthony.Lemma@mail.house.gov
and tell us which office you
intend to visit.
I look forward to seeing you on Monday!
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress
