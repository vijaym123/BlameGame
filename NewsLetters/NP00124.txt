Dear David,
Last week the President announced that he's sending over 400 more American troops to Iraq.
I am very proud of the men and women who will be sent into harm's way.
But while America possesses the greatest fighting force the world has ever known, we can't put the Middle East back together by ourselves.
Our allies have to step up to the plate to help defeat a threat that affects them as much as it affects us.
And we can't be sacrificing America's future by spending billions of dollars on the other side of the world while we make drastic cuts to education, health care and infrastructure here at home.
Unfortunately, that's what some in the Congress are trying to do.
Right now Senate is debating a $600 billion defense funding bill. That's billion with a "B."
Not only is this a $30 billion increase over last fiscal year, but this bill also funnels nearly $40 billion into an off-the-books spending account to make it look like the Majority is saving taxpayers' money.
And while they are increasing defense spending through a budget gimmick, they're making harmful cuts to health care, education, and infrastructure.
And yes, even our veterans.
Taking care of our veterans is a cost of war.
But just two weeks ago, the Appropriations Committee passed a bill that underfunds the VA by $857 million.
I introduced an amendment to close that gap, but it failed on a party line vote.
The VA is under a lot of pressure right now, and it should be.
But we can't expect the VA to improve care for veterans by giving the department nearly a billion dollars less than it needs.
This is the height of hypocrisy and it threatens the America that our kids and grandkids will inherit.
Montanans deserve better.
So please tell Congress to refocus its priorities and make responsible investments that will help move our state forward.
