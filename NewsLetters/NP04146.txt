FROM THE DESK OF
CONGRESSMAN PATRICK McHENRY
10th DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA
Hello Friends,
As you gather with friends and families here in Western North Carolina or around the country, Giulia and I wanted to take a brief moment and wish you a happy Thanksgiving.
While this is a day of celebration, we must remember it is also a day to give thanks for those whose actions allow us the opportunity to enjoy the day with family.
Thank you to all our troops serving in the Armed Forces.
Thanks to these brave men and women who have volunteered to defend our nation around the world, sacrificing their holiday so we can celebrate here at home.
While there is much wrong in our world, today is a day to celebrate and give thanks for all that is good.
Thank you to the people of the 10th District for giving me the opportunity to serve and, as always, feel free to contact me if I can ever be of assistance.
God Bless,
Patrick McHenry
Member of Congress
