RECENTLY IN WASHINGTON
A 5-FOR-1 TRADE WITH THE TALIBAN
Criticizing President Bush in 2008, candidate Obama promised
unequivocally
that he would not use signing statements to do an end run around
Congress. This week he broke that promise. His unilateral decision this
week to trade a Taliban dream team of 5 Guantanamo Bay detainees for an
American prisoner of war without notifying Congress as required by law
raises deep concerns for me.
Would the American people have elected him had they known he would
negotiate with terrorists to release senior Taliban members back to the
battlefield? I discussed those concerns with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell
and Chris Hayes
as well as Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity
and Gretchen Carlson
earlier this week.
APOLOGIZING ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
Add VA health care to the list of President Obama's broken promises.
In 2009, President Obama promised veterans the agency would move to
electronic health records and integrate them between the VA and the
DOD.
Not only has that project been abandoned, but both agencies now
seek millions to update their separate systems.
I expect better and
our veterans deserve better. The resignation of Secretary Shinseki last
week was a necessary step in holding the VA accountable for its failure
to perform.
Previously, I called for
Secretary Shinseki to resign.
I
argued
that the President issued orders that were not carried out.
Any effort by Shinseki now would have been too little too late.
I told
KUTV
I'm tired of
talk.
I want immediate help for our nation's wounded warriors.
We
need to allow our veterans to tap into existing health resources in
their own communities.
CHIEF OF STAFF CHANGE
This week, Utah Governor Gary Herbert announced
his selection of Justin Harding, my current Chief
of Staff, to become the new Chief of Staff in the Governor's office.
Justin has been an exemplary leader and will be a great asset to Utah.
I am pleased to announce
the return of Fred Ferguson, who currently serves as Rep. Bishop's
Legislative Director, as the new Chief of Staff in the Chaffetz office.
Ferguson previously worked in my office as a staff and legislative
assistant from 2009-2012.
I am ecstatic to be able to bring him back.
Fred will continue to play a key role in Utah's Public Lands
Initiative, which he led during his tenure in the Bishop office.
US EMBASSY CONSTRUCTION COSTS SOAR
CBS News reports
the cost of
building new embassies under the Obama Administration has soared.
In Port Moresby, the Papua New Guinea embassy project estimate
ballooned from $50 million to $211 million. The new London embassy is
already $100 million over budget just six months into construction. An
internal security review by the State Department warned that delays are
compromising security of US citizens.
QUESTIONING DHS SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON ABOUT BORDER SECURITY
Last week I had the opportunity to question
Secretary Johnson about the use of a biometric exit system to help
secure the border.
Although he acknowledged such a system was
possible, he said it would take funding he doesn't have.
I pointed out
this is funding he has never asked Congress to provide.
TWEET OF THE WEEK
Thankful for the Marines I met protecting our embassy in Libya. God
bless them for their service. #MemorialDay
