Dear
Friend,
It has been a busy Spring on Capitol Hill and
back in the Third District.
For
example, this week marks National Small Business Week, and
I have been visiting local companies
to highlight the
entrepreneurs and small business owners that impact our communities and to
chat with them about how best the federal government can provide
support. Read about some of these recent visits in this weeks edition of
Congress in Your Inbox.
Last week, my colleagues and
I on the Armed Services Committee spent a marathon session
finalizing the annual National Defense Authorization Act ,
which sets policy for the military. More than a dozen provisions I
authored were part of the bill, impacting issues such as gender-specific
gear to our local Massachusetts military
installations.
Included in the NDAA was a bill that I recently introduced with Congressman
Mike Turner (R-OH). The Support Uniformed Patriots; Prevent Offenses
and Restore Trust Act (SUPPORT Act) will improve support for survivors
of military sexual assault. Specifically, to prevent assaults,
encourage reporting, provide quality services, and reform the military
justice system that too often fails survivors of these crimes. The NDAA is
expected to be voted on by the full House of Representatives in the
coming weeks.
Also in this weeks newsletter, you can watch
my speech on the House Floor on the Armenian
Genocide
anniversary and
you can read my OpEd about
National Parks . Also included is audio of
my interview
on WBUR , and
my chat with the Travel section
of the Boston Globe.
As always, I
look forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for staying
engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
