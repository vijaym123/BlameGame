Dear
Friends,
Recently,
I was chosen by my colleagues
to assume the chairmanship of
the Transportation and
Infrastructure Subcommittee
on the Environment and Public
Works Committee (EPW).
This change in my leadership
role is bittersweet because
it meant stepping down from
my chairmanship of the Clean
Air and Nuclear Safety
Subcommittee, which has
jurisdiction over issues that
are of great importance to me
and Delaware. My new
position, though, will give
me the opportunity to engage
in one of the most critical
issues facing our nation
today: our crumbling
infrastructure.
Im excited to share
with you some of the key
policies I will be working on
in my new leadership
role:
My most urgent
priority is a
long-term
solutionto the
insolvency confronting
the Highway Trust
Fund
so we have the
resources we need to make
smart investments in
highways, transit, and
other transportation
projects that help to
grow commerce and boost
our economy.
I will engage with my
colleagues to
improve our
national transportation
policies
so that
were getting the
most bang for our
taxpayer dollars and
investing in the best
projects to help move
people and goods where
they need to go
efficiently and
affordably.
I will work to make
critical
investments in key water
infrastructure
initiatives
that are
important to the First
State, such as the Delaware
River Main Channel
Deepening and flood control
and resilience projects to
protect against extreme
weather.
During
this challenging time for our
federal transportation system
and infrastructure, it is
important that Congress
continue to promote
cost-effective policies while
simultaneously pursuing
promising new
initiatives. I look
forward to working with my
colleagues, as well as policy
experts and stakeholders, on
these issues in my new
position as chairman of the
Transportation and
Infrastructure
Subcommittee.
What
transportation and
infrastructure issues are
most important to you? Let me
