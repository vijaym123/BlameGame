Dear Neighbor,
I would like to invite you to my next Twitter Town Hall on Thursday, February 12th, 2015 from 12:00 - 12:30 PM.
During the Twitter Town Hall, you will be able to ask me questions on any range of topics and I will quickly respond.
So please plan on tweeting your question about the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, immigration, ObamaCare or any other question you may have and I will be happy to answer it.
In order to participate you must first follow me on Twitter @RepDennisRoss. Then, during the Twitter Town Hall, please ask your question using the hashtag #AskRepRoss and I will look for it and offer my response.
I look forward to hearing from you this Thursday, February 12th.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
