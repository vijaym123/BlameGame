Dear Friend, Our primary is one week from today.
And last I checked, the
Washington Post
was giving Republicans an 82% chance of taking the Senate this year.
The pundits are underestimating the power of grassroots organizing. And they&rsquo;re underestimating you. We have a week to go until our primary, and we need our grassroots energized and active. We&rsquo;re aiming for a $50,000 primary goal, and we need your help to get there -- can you pitch in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
People are looking at Massachusetts and assuming it&rsquo;s going to be an easy win for Democrats. But it&rsquo;s not as simple as that. We know that Massachusetts&rsquo; largest political party is &ldquo;unenrolled.&rdquo;
And we know all too well what happens when Democrats sit on the sidelines. We simply can&rsquo;t afford to take anything for granted in this race, especially since the Republicans are building out their ground game. The primary will be here in one short week. Help us raise $50,000 in grassroots donations so we can protect Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat from a Republican takeover.
Thanks for your help.
