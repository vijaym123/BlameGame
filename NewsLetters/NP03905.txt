Greetings,
For the first time in its 19 year history, the 931st Air Refueling GroupMcConnell Air Force Bases reserve unithas received the Raincross Trophy, a hard-earned award given to the best unit in the 4th Air Force.
I recognized them on the House floor this week to honor their dedication to their work, and their service to this nation.

congratulate the 931st Air Refueling Group
During the past year, the 931st partnered with the 22nd Air Refueling Wing at McConnell AFB, and logged over 30,000 hours of flight time.
While overseas, supporting such missions as Operation Enduring Freedom, they transported 1,034 passengers, delivered 80,850 pounds of cargo, and offloaded 2.9 million pounds of fuel.
This award is a wonderful recognition of the hard work and commitment to excellence of Col. Mark S. Larson, Chief Master Sgt. Kathleen E. Lowman, and all the men and women of the 931st.
I know you join me in congratulating the 931st and the entire McConnell family!
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
