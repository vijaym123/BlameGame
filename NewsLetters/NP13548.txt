Dear Friend-
This week, the House voted on a budget deal that increases spending and
breaks the spending limits established by law in the 2011 budget deal.
This budget deal increases spending now and promises to replace the
increases with spending reductions scheduled to occur far into the
future. Because I am doubtful these reductions will materialize and
because I promised my constituents I would work to reduce spending, I
could not support the deal.
Indeed, the more I looked at the details of the deal, the more apparent
it became to me that the deal represents a classic Washington
sleight-of-hand: Congress agrees to spend more today, and then promises
that a future Congress in 8 or 10 years will make up for the new
spending by abiding by future spending limits. Given the history of
modern budget deals, this is, as a general matter, not credible. In
this particular circumstance, there is even more cause for skepticism
because this deal broke the spending limits contained in the bipartisan
budget agreement which was enacted just two years ago.
Those who claim that the deal simply represents a compromise between
the House (which wanted less spending) and the Senate (which wanted
more spending) ignore that Congress already established - via a
bipartisan compromise - the spending limits for 2013 and 2014 as a
matter of law. I have been a critic of how some of the spending
reductions were applied (particularly the singling out of defense for
disproportionate reductions), but the best course of action would have
been to write spending bills that complied with the statutory caps
while appropriating the spending more thoughtfully.
Furthermore, changes were made to military retirement programs that do
not apply to civilian employees or retirees. While veterans will be the
first to support fiscal reforms that will avert a debt crisis, it is
unfair to apply these changes to current military retirees but to no
one else. Please click here for a detailed breakdown of some of the
major components of the deal.
Secretary of State John Kerry appeared before the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs for a hearing about the interim agreement with Iran
regarding the radical Islamist regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons.
Since the Secretary agreed to participate for a predetermined amount of
time, I was not able to ask Kerry any questions (that is, the time for
the hearing elapsed before it was my turn to ask questions).Please
click here to read the questions I would have asked Kerry had there
been time.
On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a joint
subcommittee hearing on the unjust imprisonment of Pastor Saeed Abedini
by the Iranian regime. Adedini was taken hostage by the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard during a visit he made to Iran to help set up a
government-sanctioned orphanage. He was prosecuted by an Iranian
kangaroo court for the "crime" of converting from Islam to
Christianity. As the pastor's wife testified at the hearing, he has
been confined to a brutal prison: "Each day he remains in that dreadful
place could mean a death sentence; any day could be execution day."
Pastor Saeed Abedini must be returned to the United States. The
injustice perpetrated against Abedini represents an affront to our
nation and our people. We cannot simply allow him to languish in one of
Ayatollah Khamenei's gulags. You can watch my questioning at this
hearing by clicking here.
Lastly, of all the ways that government abuses taxpayer money, perhaps
the most crass is the use of tens of millions of dollars to fund
political party conventions and campaigns, which is essentially welfare
for the political class. This week, I voted for a bill in the House
that ends this absurd charade and redirects the funds to pediatric
medical research. The bill passed 295 to 103.
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act uses the roughly $126
million dollars currently earmarked for political welfare to fund
research for pediatric cancer, autism, diabetes and more. The bill's
namesake, Gabriella Miller, lost her battle with brain cancer on
October 26, 2013. She was 10 years old. Her dream was that one day
there will be a cure for this punishing disease. I recommend watching
Gabriella tell her story in the video found here
, which
was filmed before she passed away.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week, the
House
voted
on
a
budget
deal
that
increases
spending
and
breaks
the
spending
limits
established
by
law
in
the
2011
budget
deal.
This
budget
deal
increases
spending
now
and
promises
to
replace
the
increases
with
spending
reductions
scheduled
to
occur
far
into
the
future.
Because
I
am
doubtful
these
reductions
will
materialize
and
because
I
promised
my
constituents
I
would
work
to
reduce
spending,
I
could
not
support
the
deal.
Indeed,
the
more
I
looked
at
the
details
of
the
deal,
the
more
apparent
it
became
to
me
that
the
deal
represents
a
classic
Washington
sleight-of-hand:
Congress
agrees
to
spend
more
today,
and
then
promises
that
a
future
Congress
in
8
or
10
years
will
make
up
for
the
new
spending
by
abiding
by
future
spending
limits. Given
the
history
of
modern
budget
deals,
this
is,
as
a
general
matter,
not
credible. In
this
particular
circumstance,
there
is
even
more
cause
for
skepticism
because
this
deal
broke
the
spending
limits
contained
in
the
bipartisan
budget
agreement
which
was
enacted
just
two
years
ago.
Those
who
claim
that
the
deal
simply
represents
a
compromise
between
the
House
(which
wanted
less
spending)
and
the
Senate
(which
wanted
more
spending)
ignore
that
Congress
already
established
&#8211;
via
a
bipartisan
compromise
&#8211;
the
spending
limits
for
2013
and
2014
as
a
matter
of
law. I
have
been
a
critic
of
how
some
of
the
spending
reductions
were
applied
(particularly
the
singling
out
of
defense
for
disproportionate
reductions),
but
the
best
course
of
action
would
have
been
to
write
spending
bills
that
complied
with
the
statutory
caps
while
appropriating
the
spending
more
thoughtfully.
Furthermore,
changes
were
made
to
military
retirement
programs
that
do
not
apply
to
civilian
employees
or
retirees.
While
veterans
will
be
the
first
to
support
fiscal
reforms
that
will
avert
a
debt
crisis,
it
is
unfair
to
apply
these
changes
to
current
military
retirees
but
to
no
one
else.
Please
click
here
for
a
detailed
breakdown
of
some
of
the
major
components
of
the
deal.
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
appeared
before
the
House
Committee
on
Foreign
Affairs
for
a
hearing
about
the
interim
agreement
with
Iran
regarding
the
radical
Islamist
regime&#8217;s
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons.
Since
the
Secretary
agreed
to
participate
for
a
predetermined
amount
of
time,
I
was
not
able
to
ask
Kerry
any
questions
(that
is,
the
time
for
the
hearing
elapsed
before
it
was
my
turn
to
ask
questions). Please
click
here
to
read
the
questions
I
would
have
asked
Kerry
had
there
been
time.
On
Thursday,
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
held
a
joint
subcommittee
hearing
on
the
unjust
imprisonment
of
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini
by
the
Iranian
regime.
Adedini
was
taken
hostage
by
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guard
during
a
visit
he
made
to
Iran
to
help
set
up
a
government-sanctioned
orphanage.
He
was
prosecuted
by
an
Iranian
kangaroo
court
for
the
&#8220;crime&#8221;
of
converting
from
Islam
to
Christianity.
As
the
pastor&#8217;s
wife
testified
at
the
hearing,
he
has
been
confined
to
a
brutal
prison:
&#8220;Each
day
he
remains
in
that
dreadful
place
could
mean
a
death
sentence;
any
day
could
be
execution
day.&#8221;
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini
must
be
returned
to
the
United
States.
The
injustice
perpetrated
against
Abedini
represents
an
affront
to
our
nation
and
our
people.
We
cannot
simply
allow
him
to
languish
in
one
of
Ayatollah
Khamenei&#8217;s
gulags.
You
can
watch
my
questioning
at
this
hearing
by
clicking
here.
Lastly,
of
all
the
ways
that
government
abuses
taxpayer
money,
perhaps
the
most
crass
is
the
use
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
to
fund
political
party
conventions
and
campaigns,
which
is
essentially
welfare
for
the
political
class.
This
week,
I
voted
for
a
bill
in
the
House
that
ends
this
absurd
charade
and
redirects
the
funds
to
pediatric
medical
research.
The
bill
passed
295
to
103.
The
Gabriella
Miller
Kids
First
Research
Act
uses
the
roughly
$126
million
dollars
currently
earmarked
for
political
welfare
to
fund
research
for
pediatric
cancer,
autism,
diabetes
and
more.
The
bill&#8217;s
namesake,
Gabriella
Miller,
lost
her
battle
with
brain
cancer
on
October
26,
2013.
She
was
10
years
old.
Her
dream
was
that
one
day
there
will
be
a
cure
for
this
punishing
disease.
I recommend
watching
Gabriella
tell
her
story
in
the
video
found
here ,
which
was
filmed
before
she
passed
away.
