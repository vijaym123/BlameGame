URGENT: All Gifts Today Now
Triple-Matched Today's ad buy deadline is the most critical of the election. This is our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
President Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you today if we didn&rsquo;t need your help.
Boehner&rsquo;s allies launched their biggest TV ad blitz of the entire election --
$1O,OOO,OOO
-- TODAY
It's also the BIGGEST ad buy deadline of the election -- and we&rsquo;re falling dangerously behind!
That&rsquo;s a crushing combo of bad news.
But here&rsquo;s the good news: At 6:47PM EST today, a $15 grassroots contribution officially unlocked the TRIPLE-MATCH UNTIL MIDNIGHT!!!
David, control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
