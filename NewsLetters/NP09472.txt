Dear Friend,
With Memorial Day Weekend just around the corner, many of us are
looking forward to having a long weekend with our families. I'll be
attending a few Memorial Day events in Gig Harbor, Bremerton, Tacoma
and Port Orchard. Whether you visit a local ceremony or not, I hope
everyone will remember our fallen and honor the brave Americans who
protect our nation's freedoms. I want to extend my gratitude and
appreciation to the millions of servicemen and women and their families
who are on duty every day for our country.
Many of our friends, family, and neighbors know what it means to serve.
They answered a call with the expectation that we'd be there for them
if needed. That's why the news of long waits for urgently needed care
at our Veterans Affairs hospitals is so outrageous. It's shocking and
unacceptable that the VA was more concerned with hiding patient delays
than helping treat sick veterans.
This situation cannot and must not stand. We need to hold accountable
anyone who did not help our servicemembers, and we need to ensure that
every single person who has served receives the care and benefits that
he or she has earned. It's the least we can do.
National Defense Authorization Act Moves Forward
After a long debate on the floor with members from across the country
sharing their views, the National Defense Authorization Act cleared the
House yesterday. Now, the Senate will debate their own version and once
that's passed we'll iron out the differences between the two.
In my last update I talked about the provisions like investments in our
navy and cyber technology that I fought for. I'm happy to say they were
included in the bill that passed the House. For a larger refresher on
those, check out my release on the bill's passage
.
I'm pleased to report that two amendments that I authored to help our
civilian workforce were also included. These employees are essential to
our armed forces and help keep things running smoothly. I'm always
amazed by the skill and dedication they show at sites like Joint Base
Lewis McChord, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Keyport.
There are more than 170,000 Department of Defense civilian employees,
including more than 1,400 in our state, that are paid using what's
known as "working capital funds." Working capital funds do not receive
direct funding through the annual appropriations process. Rather, these
funds come from fees collected for goods and services these civilian
defense workers provide. This part of our civilian workforce has been
through a lot the past few years, including furloughs.
When these workers were furloughed in the past, I stood up and raised
concerns about the legal justification that was used. Furloughing these
workers does not, repeat does not, save the government money. All it
does is send them home and needlessly delay crucial projects. My
bipartisan amendment ensures that in the future, these workers would
not face unpaid leave days due to furloughs from across-the-board
budget cuts.
I also successfully secured an amendment to the defense bill that
ensures that shipyard workers that get sent overseas to work on the
U.S. aircraft carrier stationed in Japan don't face unfair and
unnecessary financial sacrifices. This September, without an extension
from Congress, shipyard workers at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard who
volunteer to go overseas to do critical national security work will
lose the ability to collect overtime from the Navy.
I don't think it's fair to ask workers at our nation's shipyards to go
overseas and make needed carrier repairs without the overtime they
receive in the United States. That's why we pushed and won a one year
extension on these overtime payments in the House bill.
Ocean Acidification
In recent years, ocean acidification has emerged as a real threat to
coastal communities and industries across the United States. Changes in
ocean chemistry have already begun to impact our shellfish industry.
For example, there are studies that show that oysters are now
struggling to get the minerals they need to form shells. What's more,
we don't yet fully understand how these changes will impact the rest of
the ocean food chain.
That is why I have introduced a bill, the Ocean Acidification
Innovation Act, which takes an innovative approach to encouraging
research in this area. Specifically, the bill would allow federal
agencies to use existing grant money to establish new competitions with
goals of more involved research on the impact of ocean acidification
and how this phenomenon can be impacted.
Prize competitions have been a big subject on the Science, Space, and
Technology Committee on which I serve. We heard testimony that prize
competitions can attract substantially more researchers to study a
scientific challenge and create enormous leverage. In fact, one of the
folks from the XPrize organization reported that they've seen between
four and ten times the amount of research conducted in a prize
competition. So, in a nutshell, rather than simply providing a $5
million grant for research, you could see a $5 million prize drive
between $20 million and $50 million of research.
Last week, I spent some time at Northern Fish in Tacoma to see their
facility and discuss the critically important issue of ocean
acidification and its effects on our fishing industry. You can read
more about the bill in this News Tribune article
, or this article in
the Kitsap Sun
.
I'm pleased to report that this proposal has seen strong bipartisan
support. Several leaders from our state including Representatives Jamie
Herrera Beutler, Denny Heck, and Dave Reichert have already sponsored
the bill. Stay tuned!
Congress takes a vote on water (projects)
Speaking of bipartisanship, this week the House passed a bipartisan
bill known as the Water Resources Development Act (aka WRDA). The bill
strengthens investments in projects that will help enhance ports and
other waterways infrastructure and assist in ecosystem restorations.
This is a big deal for our region. The ability to move goods quickly on
our waters is a big reason why we are an export leader and set a record
for exports last year. Products traveling along Washington waterways
and through our ports create more jobs.
There were a few really important provisions in the bill that impact
the competitiveness of our ports here in Washington.
Let me give a little background on one. Currently, some of our ports
that ship large amounts of freight - including Tacoma -receive back
pennies for every dollar they contribute through something known as the
Harbor Maintenance Tax to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. They are
known as 'donor ports' because they pay in much more to the fund than
they receive. Importantly, the WRDA legislation levels the playing
field by authorizing funding for 'donor ports' like Tacoma that could
be used to improve port infrastructure and extend rebates to importers
and shippers that are the port's customers.
Particularly when we're
seeing more and more competition from Canada, the inclusion of this
provision is a really big deal.
The bill we passed also helps our network of smaller ports and emerging
harbors by setting aside 10 percent of the Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund for them through 2022. That will support needed investments in
channel maintenance and jetty repairs, potentially including a number
of ports along the Olympic Peninsula and across the state.
There are two more boxes I'm particularly excited that we checked with
this bill. One provision, known as Section 214, will permanently give
us more control over port project timelines. Now, local government and
ports can use their own resources to pay for a speedier Army Corps of
Engineers' permit review process to get improvements underway more
quickly. We also took a step forward in the fight against invasive
species crowding into our region by bolstering the Corps' ability to
protect Washington state waterways from invasive species like quagga
mussels.
I should note, at a time when most people believe the House and Senate
can't agree on what day it is, this bill received strong bipartisan
support in the House and is expected to sail through the Senate and
land on the President's desk for his signature.
Armed Forces Day
I had a great time last weekend taking part in Bremerton's Armed Forces
Day Festival. We had an awesome showing for the event and the Bremerton
Chamber (and the "Great" Chris Larson) did a wonderful job organizing
the parade. Thanks to everyone who took part and showed our friends,
neighbors, and family members in the military that we will always
support them!
I also want to say a few words about John 'Bud' Hawk of Bainbridge
Island, who had a car in the parade in his memory. Bud was an army
sergeant who received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in WWII. He
passed away last November at age 89. This Memorial Day, I hope we keep
Bud and his family in our thoughts and prayers.
Finally, in honor of Bud and all others who serve our country, I was
pleased to volunteer my time this week with the USO. I helped assemble
some care packages to support our troops at the USO Service Project.
Since Sesame Street is a long-time partner of the USO, I also ran into
a special red furry guest!
Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I or my
office can be helpful to you. Have a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day.
As always, I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek Kilmer

2014 Dear
Friend,
With
Memorial
Day
Weekend
just
around
the
corner,
many
of
us
are
looking
forward
to
having
a
long
weekend
with
our
families. I&#8217;ll
be
attending
a
few
Memorial
Day
events
in
Gig
Harbor,
Bremerton,
Tacoma
and
Port
Orchard. Whether
you
visit
a
local
ceremony
or
not,
I
hope
everyone
will
remember
our
fallen
and
honor
the
brave
Americans
who
protect
our
nation&#8217;s
freedoms.
I
want
to
extend
my
gratitude
and
appreciation to
the
millions
of
servicemen
and
women
and
their
families
who
are
on
duty
every
day
for
our
country.
Many
of
our
friends,
family,
and
neighbors
know
what
it
means
to
serve.
They
answered
a
call
with
the
expectation
that
we&#8217;d
be
there
for
them
if
needed.
That&#8217;s
why
the
news
of
long
waits
for
urgently
needed
care
at
our
Veterans
Affairs
hospitals
is
so
outrageous.
It&#8217;s
shocking
and
unacceptable
that
the
VA
was
more
concerned
with
hiding
patient
delays
than
helping
treat
sick
veterans.
This
situation
cannot

must
not

need
to
hold
accountable
anyone
who
did
not
help
our
servicemembers,
and
we
need
to
ensure
that
every
single
person
who
has

receives
the

that
he

It&#8217;s
the

we
can
do.
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
Moves
Forward
After
a
long
debate
on
the
floor
with
members
from
across
the
country
sharing
their
views,
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
cleared
the
House
yesterday.
Now,
the
Senate
will
debate
their
own
version
and
once
that&#8217;s

we&#8217;ll
iron

the
differences
between
the
two.
In
my
last
update
I
talked
about
the
provisions
like
investments
in
our
navy
and
cyber
technology
that
I
fought
for.
I&#8217;m
happy
to
say
they
were
included
in
the
bill
that
passed
the
House.
For
a
larger
refresher
on
those,
check
out
my
release
on
the
bill&#8217;s
passage .
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
report
that
two
amendments
that
I
authored
to
help
our
civilian
workforce
were
also
included.
These
employees
are
essential
to
our
armed
forces
and
help
keep
things
running
smoothly.
I&#8217;m
always
amazed
by
the
skill
and
dedication
they
show
at
sites
like
Joint
Base
Lewis
McChord,
the
Puget
Sound
Naval
Shipyard
and
Keyport.
There
are
more
than
170,000
Department
of
Defense
civilian
employees,
including
more
than
1,400
in
our
state,
that
are
paid
using
what&#8217;s
known
as
&#8220;working
capital
funds.&#8221;
Working
capital
funds
do
not
receive
direct
funding
through
the
annual
appropriations
process. Rather,
these
funds
come
from
fees
collected
for
goods
and
services
these
civilian
defense
workers
provide.
This
part
of
our
civilian
workforce
has
been
through
a
lot
the
past
few
years,
including
furloughs.
When
these
workers
were
furloughed
in
the
past,
I
stood
up
and
raised
concerns
about
the
legal
justification
that
was
used.
Furloughing
these
workers
does
not,
repeat
does
not,
save
the
government
money.
All
it
does
is
send
them
home
and
needlessly
delay
crucial
projects.
My
bipartisan
amendment
ensures
that
in
the
future,
these
workers
would
not
face
unpaid
leave
days
due
to
furloughs
from
across-the-board
budget
cuts.
I
also
successfully
secured
an
amendment
to
the
defense
bill
that
ensures
that
shipyard
workers
that
get
sent
overseas
to
work on
the
U.S.
aircraft
carrier
stationed
in
Japan
don&#8217;t
face
unfair
and
unnecessary
financial
sacrifices.
This
September,
without
an
extension
from
Congress,
shipyard
workers
at
the
Puget
Sound
Naval
Shipyard
who
volunteer
to
go
overseas
to
do
critical
national
security
work
will
lose
the
ability
to
collect
overtime
from
the
Navy.
I
don&#8217;t
think
it&#8217;s
fair
to
ask
workers
at
our
nation&#8217;s
shipyards
to
go
overseas
and
make
needed
carrier
repairs
without
the
overtime
they
receive
in
the
United
States.
That&#8217;s
why
we
pushed
and
won
a
one
year
extension
on
these
overtime
payments
in
the
House
bill.
Ocean
Acidification
In
recent
years,
ocean
acidification
has
emerged
as
a
real
threat
to
coastal
communities
and
industries
across
the
United
States.
Changes
in
ocean
chemistry
have
already
begun
to
impact
our
shellfish
industry. For
example,
there
are
studies
that
show
that
oysters
are
now
struggling
to
get
the
minerals
they
need
to
form
shells. What&#8217;s
more,
we
don&#8217;t
yet
fully
understand
how
these
changes
will
impact
the
rest
of
the
ocean
food
chain.
That
is
why
I
have
introduced
a
bill,
the
Ocean
Acidification
Innovation
Act,
which
takes
an
innovative
approach
to
encouraging
research
in
this
area.
Specifically,
the
bill
would
allow
federal
agencies
to
use
existing
grant
money
to
establish
new
competitions
with
goals
of
more
involved
research
on
the
impact
of
ocean
acidification
and
how
this
phenomenon
can
be
impacted.
Prize
competitions
have
been
a
big
subject
on
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee
on
which
I
serve. We
heard
testimony
that
prize
competitions
can
attract
substantially
more
researchers
to
study
a
scientific
challenge
and
create
enormous
leverage. In
fact,
one
of
the
folks
from
the
XPrize
organization
reported
that
they&#8217;ve
seen
between
four
and
ten
times
the
amount
of
research
conducted
in
a
prize
competition. So,
in
a
nutshell,
rather
than
simply
providing
a
$5
million
grant
for
research,
you
could
see
a
$5
million
prize
drive
between
$20
million
and
$50
million
of
research.
Last
week,
I
spent
some
time
at
Northern
Fish
in
Tacoma
to
see
their
facility
and
discuss
the
critically
important
issue
of
ocean
acidification
and
its
effects
on
our
fishing
industry.
You
can
read
more
about
the
bill
in
this
News
Tribune
article ,
or
this
article
in
the
Kitsap
Sun .
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
report
that
this
proposal
has
seen
strong
bipartisan
support. Several
leaders
from
our
state
including
Representatives
Jamie
Herrera
Beutler,
Denny
Heck,
and
Dave
Reichert
have
already
sponsored
the
bill. Stay
tuned!
Congress
takes
a
vote
on
water
(projects)
Speaking
of
bipartisanship,
this
week
the
House
passed
a
bipartisan
bill
known
as
the
Water
Resources
Development
Act
(aka
WRDA). The
bill
strengthens
investments
in
projects
that
will
help
enhance
ports
and
other
waterways
infrastructure
and
assist
in
ecosystem
restorations.
This
is
a
big
deal
for
our
region.
The
ability
to
move
goods
quickly
on
our
waters
is
a
big
reason
why
we
are
an
export
leader
and
set
a
record
for
exports
last
year.
Products
traveling
along
Washington
waterways
and
through
our
ports
create
more
jobs.
There
were
a
few
really
important
provisions
in
the
bill
that
impact
the
competitiveness
of
our
ports
here
in
Washington.
Let
me
give
a
little
background
on
one. Currently,
some
of
our
ports
that
ship
large
amounts
of
freight
&#8211;
including
Tacoma
&#8211;receive
back
pennies
for
every
dollar
they
contribute
through
something
known
as
the
Harbor
Maintenance
Tax
to
the
Harbor
Maintenance
Trust
Fund.
They
are
known
as
&#8216;donor
ports&#8217;
because
they
pay
in
much
more
to
the
fund
than
they
receive.
Importantly,
the WRDA
legislation
levels
the
playing
field
by
authorizing
funding
for
&#8216;donor
ports&#8217;
like
Tacoma
that
could
be
used
to
improve
port
infrastructure
and
extend
rebates
to
importers
and
shippers
that
are
the
port&#8217;s
customers.
Particularly
when
we&#8217;re
seeing
more
and
more
competition
from
Canada,
the
inclusion
of
this
provision
is
a
really
big
deal.
The
bill
we
passed
also
helps
our
network
of
smaller
ports
and
emerging
harbors
by
setting
aside
10
percent
of
the
Harbor
Maintenance
Trust
Fund
for
them
through
2022.
That
will
support
needed
investments
in
channel
maintenance
and
jetty
repairs,
potentially
including
a
number
of
ports
along
the
Olympic
Peninsula
and
across
the
state.
There
are
two
more
boxes
I&#8217;m
particularly
excited
that
we
checked
with
this
bill.
One
provision,
known
as
Section
214,
will
permanently
give
us
more
control
over
port
project
timelines.
Now,
local
government
and
ports
can
use
their
own
resources
to
pay
for
a
speedier
Army
Corps
of
Engineers&#8217;
permit
review
process
to
get
improvements
underway
more
quickly.
We
also
took
a
step
forward
in
the
fight
against
invasive
species
crowding
into
our
region
by
bolstering
the
Corps&#8217;
ability
to
protect
Washington
state
waterways
from
invasive
species
like
quagga
mussels.
I
should
note,
at
a
time
when
most
people
believe
the
House
and
Senate
can&#8217;t
agree
on
what
day
it
is,
this
bill
received
strong
bipartisan
support
in
the
House
and
is
expected
to
sail
through
the
Senate
and
land
on
the
President&#8217;s
desk
for
his
signature.
Armed
Forces
Day
I
had
a
great
time
last
weekend
taking
part
in
Bremerton&#8217;s
Armed
Forces
Day
Festival.
We
had
an
awesome
showing
for
the
event
and
the
Bremerton
Chamber
(and
the
&#8220;Great&#8221;
Chris
Larson)
did
a
wonderful
job
organizing
the
parade.
Thanks
to
everyone
who
took
part
and
showed
our
friends,
neighbors,
and
family
members
in
the
military
that
we
will
always
support
them!
I
also
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
John
&#8216;Bud&#8217;
Hawk
of
Bainbridge
Island,
who
had
a
car
in
the
parade
in
his
memory.
Bud
was
an
army
sergeant
who
received
the
Medal
of
Honor
for
his
heroism
in
WWII.
He
passed
away
last
November
at
age
89.
This
Memorial
Day,
I
hope
we
keep
Bud
and
his
family
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers.
Finally,
in
honor
of
Bud
and
all
others
who
serve
our
country,
I
was
pleased
to
volunteer
my
time
this
week
with
the
USO. I
helped
assemble
some
care
packages
to
support
our
troops
at
the
USO
Service
Project. Since
Sesame
Street
is
a
long-time
partner
of
the
USO,
I
also
ran
into
a
special
red
furry
guest!
Thanks
as
always
for
reading
and
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out
if
I
or
my
office
can
be
helpful
to
you.
Have
a
safe
and
enjoyable
Memorial
Day.
As
always,
I&#8217;m
honored
to
work
for
you.
