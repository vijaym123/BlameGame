Friend --
We are only 10 days out.
We hate to ask again, but a dozen races are within 5 points -- and we need a final grassroots push to stop Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s Republican Senate takeover.
Can we count on your help today?
You&rsquo;ve already helped fund a phenomenal Democratic turnaround in the past month:
CO: Democrats erased a 6 point deficit to gain a one point lead: 45-44
GA: Democrats erased a 4 point deficit to gain a three point lead: 47-44
KY: Democrats erased a 3 point deficit to pull into a tie with Mitch McConnell.
But we haven&rsquo;t won anything yet.
The Republicans are doing everything they can to stop our progress. It&rsquo;s happening at lightning speed. But if we can get every voter to the polls, we&rsquo;ll wipe out their spending advantage.
Our final-week Get Out The Vote deadline hits TOMORROW at midnight, and we have a $228,214 hole to fill in the budget -- can you help? Gifts will be triple-matched today to get there.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We can absolutely take victory -- Nate Silver just declared that we&rsquo;re leading in ruby red Georgia, the state he&rsquo;s calling the &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; to determine the Senate majority.
Meeting our fundraising goals will determine how hard we can work to stop a Republican Senate takeover by Mitch McConnell.
Will you pitch in right away? Remember: It&rsquo;ll be triple-matched.
Thank you so much for your support.
