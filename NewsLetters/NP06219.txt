I am Honored to Serve as Next
Chairman of the Senate Steering Committee
This week I was
honored to be selected by my colleagues as the next Chairman of the
Senate Steering Committee.
The Committee is essential in ensuring
Republicans remain dedicated to growing the economy, protecting
individual liberty, maintaining a robust national defense, and protecting
the space for institutions of civil society to grow and flourish.
As Chairman, I will work to develop, promote, and build consensus
around policy solutions based on fundamental conservative
principles.
Over the past year, I have introduced a series of reforms
aimed at alleviating the economic concerns of working families.
These proposals
collectively called the
Conservative Reform Agenda
are focused on improving economic mobility,
strengthening middle-class security, and eliminating cronyist protection
at the top of our economy.
For each issue I follow what I like
to call the Utah Model
a way of approaching problem solving that
maximizes freedom, fosters community, and delivers results. As your
representative, I see this as a unique opportunity for Utah to play a
major role in the future prosperity and security of our nation and I look
forward to hearing from Utahns about their ideas to fix the problems
we face. I am excited to take on this challenge and am incredibly
grateful for the support of my colleagues in the
Senate.
