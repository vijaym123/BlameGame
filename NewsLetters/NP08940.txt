Transparency.
Accountability.
Responsibility.
These are characteristics that government agencies and departments are obligated to possess in order to effectively serve the American people. Despite their size and power, the Federal Reserve and the Department of Defense (DOD) are not exempt from this responsibility.
To ensure taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient, effective means possible, action needs to be taken. We need to audit the Fed, and audit the DOD.
Its just common sense. With our nations staggering deficit looming over the heads of our children, auditing the Federal Reserve is imperative, not optional. Likewise, a full audit of the Department of Defense would create an even stronger national defense, allowing us to better ensure that the agency is meeting its core goal of protecting our national security.
Its long past due. The time is now.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
Ensuring that government and federal agencies remain transparent in their use of tax dollars is a job I take very seriously. Recently, Ive worked on the Freedom of Information Act, ( H.R. 1211 ) which increases the ability of citizens to access records and documents from government agencies. Additionally, Ive supported the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act, ( H.R. 1423 ), which requires federal agencies to annually provide the public with information on the programs they administer.
