March 26 was Purple Day, when people around the world are invited to wear purple and host events in support of epilepsy awareness. In commemoration of this years Purple Day, I introduced the bipartisan Charlottes Web Medical Access Act of 2015, legislation to ensure that children and individuals with epilepsy and other debilitating seizure disorders have access to life-changing Cannabidiol (CBD) oil.

Currently, more than 300,000 children in American suffer from some form of epilepsy. Many of these children experience more than 100 violent seizures a day any one of which could be fatal without proper care.
Strong anecdotal evidence shows that CBD oil has reduced the amount and duration of seizures in individuals suffering from epilepsy and other seizure disorders; however, CBD currently is banned for medical use at the federal level.
Ive been approached by many local families whose children suffer from severe epilepsy. Through these accounts, I've learned that many people are considering geographically breaking up their families to move to states that allow CBD treatment. The federal government shouldnt break up families who are just trying to help their children. CBD oil offers great hope for relief; were I in a similar situation, Id want the same for my children. Their situations compelled me to act at the federal level
these kids and people like them deserve a chance at a healthy and productive life and our government shouldnt stand in the way.
This legislation seeks to exclude CBD oil from the Banned Substances Act. CBD is extracted from a plant containing no more than .3% THC, which means it has no hallucinogenic effects.
Philip M. Gattone, M.Ed., President &amp; CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation said, We applaud Congressman Perry and his leadership in creating access to this treatment for Americans with epilepsy who have run out of options. As a parent of a child with epilepsy, I know how difficult it can be to stand by as your child has a seizure that you are helpless to stop. The Epilepsy Foundation has supported access to CBD oil
which is showing positive results for some patients. Access to a potential lifesaving treatment should not be determined or limited by zip code. It is time for Congress to enact this sensible bill."
The legislation now moves to the House Energy and Commerce and Judiciary Committees. If voted out of committee, it then moves to the full House for consideration. To learn more about Purple Day and efforts to raise awareness about epilepsy, please visit

FY2016 Budget
This week the House also passed the fiscal year 2016 budget. Washington must stop spending money we dont have. By ignoring our $18 trillion debt crisis, Social Security, Medicare and other vital programs continue to drift towards bankruptcy. Thats why I supported the FY2016 Budget passed by the U.S. House, which confronts the debt crisis that threatens the economic security of every American.
By balancing in less than 10 years without raising taxes, reducing spending by $5.5 trillion, calling for a fairer, simpler tax code and strengthening Medicare, this Budget puts us on a path to paying off our debt through economic growth and making government more efficient, effective and accountable.
A balanced budget fosters a healthy economy and helps create jobs. Thats why I offered my own balanced budget amendment to the Constitution earlier this year.
Leadership calls for making tough decisions. President Obama has yet to offer a balanced budget during his terms in office. Before he and his allies criticize our plan to balance the budget, they need to stop playing politics and offer their own. We need to take bold action on new solutions to strengthen our economy and provide greater opportunity for all Americans.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
