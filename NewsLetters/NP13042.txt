The Huizenga Huddle: Jan. 14, 2014
2014 Congressional Snowmobile Ride :
The air is crisp, the powder is fresh and the sleds are gassed up - it's time to hit the trails!
Grab your snow machine and join Dr. Dan Benishek and I this Friday and Saturday for the 2014 Congressional Snowmobile Ride.
In addition to enjoying some time in Michigan's great outdoors, we will be holding meet and greets and town hall meetings along the way.
I hope you will join me for one of the events listed below!
White Cloud
We will start the ride from the Newaygo County Sports Park at 9 AM.
The Sports Park is located at 4684 Evergreen Dr. From there, we are going to travel north on trail #3 into White Cloud and drop by Sally's to meet with folks from the area.
If you don't have a snowmobile or don't ride, I hope those of you in the White Cloud Area will
join us at Sally's
located at 103 South Charles/M-37. This is a meet and greet style event.
If you have a question about a government agency, come over to Sally's around 9 AM and I will help you get answers!
Chase
At around 10:15 AM we are going to make tracks from Sally's and travel north on trail #3 to Baldwin, then East on trail #30 until we reach the
Chase Creek Smoke House , where we will stop for lunch at about 1 PM.
Stop in and join us for ribs or
another smoke house special !
Irons
At 4 PM, give or take a few minutes, we will arrive at the Oak Grove Tavern in Irons, where Dr. Dan and I will hold a town hall meeting.
I am hopeful this will be a more open forum for folks to discuss anything from issues at the federal level to issues impacting Irons and all of Lake County.
Oak Grove Tavern
is located at 5482 W. 10-1/2 Mile Rd.
Cadillac and Wellston
On Saturday morning, we are going to meet and pick up folks who want to ride with us at 9 AM at
the staging area near the ski hill at Caberfae and then hit the trails heading towards Wellston.
At approximately 10 AM will will stop in the
Kozy Kitchen Restaurant
located 16938 Caberfae Hwy. in Wellston for a meet and greet with area residents.
At 10:30 AM or so we will head back to the sleds and take trail # 3 to the Benzie Manistee Snowbirds Clubhouse.
Kaleva
At noon, Dr. Dan and I will hold a town hall meeting at the Benzie Manistee Snowbirds Clubhouse located at 14121 Industrial Drive.
This will be another open forum with a question and answer session led by Congressman Benishek.
We expect the town hall and lunch to be finished by about 1:30 PM, after which we will hop back on trail #3 and head towards Thompsonville.
Thompsonville
At 2:30 PM we will be stopping by
Geno's Sports Bar
for a meet and greet.
There is plenty of time before either Michigan or Michigan State tip off, so I am hoping if you are in the area you will stop by and say hi. Geno's is located at 14848 Thompson Ave. At about 3:30 PM we will head to the sleds one last time and ride to Beulah, where the ride will end at approximately 4:30 PM.
Remember, if you want to join us with your snowmobile, you absolutely can.
If you don't have a snow machine, do not hesitate to come to one of the event locations.
I am very interested in hearing from you.
I want to know your thoughts on recent events in Congress, and how Washington is impacting you!
