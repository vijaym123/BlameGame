Dear Friends,
This week was again filled with many hours of debate and votes on
amendments to the Keystone XL pipeline legislation. On Thursday, the
legislation to allow this pipeline that would support thousands of jobs
and invest billions of dollars in the economy, at no expense to
taxpayers, finally passed the Senate by a vote of 62 to 36.
The American people are still struggling in today's economy, and they
expect and deserve Washington to cut red tape to unleash America's
energy resources. By doing so, we will create American jobs, ensure
America's energy security and reinforce relations with our largest
trading partner. Building the Keystone XL pipeline is an important step
toward meeting these goals.
It is time now for President Obama to reconsider his threat to veto the
Keystone XL pipeline and to take the opportunity to work with Congress
to find the commonsense solutions wanted by the American people.
Audit the Fed
This week, I also joined Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., in co-sponsoring
legislation by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would that would require the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive and
independent audit of the Federal Reserve.
I have long been an advocate of sunshine laws, and better oversight by
Congress of all agencies of the federal government. The Federal Reserve
Transparency Act
will help us
determine areas that need improvement and shed additional light on a
system that has a significant impact on the U.S. economy via the
national, monetary policy decisions it makes. There is more need for
accountability across the board. Click here to read more

Georgia Agriculture
I also had the opportunity this week to question U.S. Trade
Representative Michael Froman on issues dealing with two of Georgia's
largest agricultural goods: cotton and poultry.
On Tuesday, I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to
underscore my opposition to illegal anti-dumping duties imposed by
South Africa on American chicken. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., joined me
on this letter and we repeated our warning that if South Africa's
duties are not dropped before the Senate considers the reauthorization
of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) this spring, we would
work to prevent South Africa from continuing to enjoy the significant
trade benefits afforded by the law. Read the letter here
.
During a Finance Committee hearing this week at which Froman testified,
I also raised my concerns with him over the significant decline in the
trading price of cotton, from 80 cents to 85 cents a pound and now down
to 55 cents to 57 cents a pound.
Georgia is the U.S. cotton's largest export market, and I emphasized to
Ambassador
Froman the harmful impact of
China's stockpiling reserve program through the government purchases of
domestic cotton, allowing China to subsidize its producers at twice the
world market price of cotton. I also inquired as to how we could
successfully keep China from manipulating the cotton prices and
suppressing the cotton market. I received assurance from Froman that
the United States is currently engaging with China on the issue. Read
more from the exchange here
.
Iran Sanctions
On Thursday, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee
passed legislation I co-sponsored aimed at increasing pressure on Iran
to dismantle its nuclear program amid ongoing negotiations with the
United States and five other world powers. The Nuclear Weapon Free Iran
Act of 2015 would impose more sanctions on Iran if a final nuclear
agreement has not been reached by July, and would continue to increase
sanctions for each additional month that an agreement has not been
reached.
It is critical that we clearly demonstrate to Iran that we will not be
lied to, we will not be misled and that we expect them to honor their
commitments. Read more about the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015

What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will begin with votes on the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act
, which passed unanimously out of the Senate VA Committee last
week as my first priority as chair this Congress. This legislation
seeks to improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources
for American service members, and I look forward to managing the floor
debate on Monday evening.
Additionally, as chair of the Senate Committee
on Veterans' Affairs
, I look forward to holding an on-site meeting
with VA leadership and employees at the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015. It
is vitally important to me to go into the VA headquarters to hear
firsthand from the leadership and from rank-and-file employees what
actions they're taking on behalf of our veterans.
Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson

Dear

This

Building

It

I
also
had
the
opportunity
this
week
to
question
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Michael
Froman
on
issues
dealing
with
two
of
Georgia's
largest
agricultural
goods:
cotton
and
poultry.
On
Tuesday,
I
wrote
to
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Michael
Froman
to
underscore
my
opposition
to
illegal
anti-dumping
duties
imposed
by
South
Africa
on
American
chicken.
Sen.
Chris
Coons,
D-Del.,
joined
me
on
this
letter
and
we
repeated
our
warning
that
if
South
Africa's
duties
are
not
dropped
before
the

During
a
Finance
Committee
hearing
this
week
at
which
Froman
testified,
I
also
raised
my
concerns
with
him
over
the
significant
decline
in
the
trading
price
of
cotton,
from
80
cents
to
85
cents
a
pound
and
now
down
to
55
cents
to
57
cents
a
pound.
Georgia
is
the
U.S.
cotton's
largest
export
market,
and
I
emphasized
to
Ambassador
Froman
the
harmful
impact
of
China's
stockpiling
reserve
program
through
the
government
purchases
of
domestic
cotton,
allowing
China
to
subsidize
its
producers
at
twice
the
world
market
price
of
cotton.
I
also
inquired
as
to
how
we
could
successfully
keep
China
from
manipulating
the
cotton
prices
and
suppressing
the
cotton
market.
I
received
assurance
from
Froman
that
the
United
States
is
currently
engaging
with
China
on
the
issue.

Iran
Sanctions
On
Thursday,
the
Senate
Banking,
Housing,
and
Urban
Affairs
Committee
passed
legislation
I
co-sponsored
aimed
at
increasing
pressure
on
Iran
to
dismantle
its
nuclear
program
amid
ongoing
negotiations
with
the
United
States
and
five
other
world
powers. The
Nuclear
Weapon
Free
Iran
Act
of
2015
would
impose
more
sanctions
on
Iran
if
a
final
nuclear
agreement
has
not
been
reached
by
July,
and
would
continue
to
increase
sanctions
for
each
additional
month
that
an
agreement
has
not
been
reached.
It
is
critical
that
we
clearly
demonstrate
to
Iran
that
we
will
not
be
lied
to,
we
will
not
be
misled
and
that
we
expect
them
to
honor
their
commitments.
